		<p>I&#39;m not much into giving or receiving gifts, but my sense is that one should probably figure out what&#39;s _missing_ (and is likely to remain missing forever) in the target home. Of course, the missing item should also be something that the person might actually like if exposed to by someone else.</p>

		<p>Ha! &nbsp;We always got my uncle penguin-themed gifts because he supposedly liked penguins. &nbsp;At least, you&#39;d assume that given all the penguin stuff he owned (by the end, at least)&#8230;</p>

		<p>I have 1 thing from my football (soccer) team Liverpool on my desk.</p>
<p>No one knows what to get me for Christmases or Birthdays.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been at the company for 4 years.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m a casual collector of The Lord of the Rings stuff, too. I do love Tolkien&#39;s work, and people keep gifting me all sorts of related things, like One Rings (there was only one of them, right?), figures from the movies, or various objects with Tolkien&#39;s anagram in them. Once, someone gifted me a book titled &quot;Tolkien for Dummies&quot; &#8211; I think that was at the time I had just finished reading the Silmarillion for the second time. I don&#39;t think I have even opened it.</p>
<p>Going off topic, the good thing about writing a tech blog is that your readers can follow your links even when you make a mistake with them :-) .</p>

		<p>Historically I&#39;ve been a TRS80&gt;Tandy&gt;Windows guy, but fifteen years ago someone gave me an old compact mac and I put it on my desk. Pretty soon, they were coming out of closets cause &quot;Jim likes those old macs.&quot; Pretty soon, my wife had to tolerate &quot;the evolution of the compact mac&quot; on our fireplace mantel instead of normal wife stuff. I found that more than 3 don&#39;t stack well for storage. Seriously, I had over 100 of them when I had to move&#8230; What do you do with these things? &nbsp;I contemplated burying them in the crawlspace! I kept a few &quot;interesting ones&quot; and put an ad on Craigslist: &nbsp;1 mac for 1 premium beer, all you can haul. (Quite the discount from the original sales price) &nbsp;I ended up with a lot of easily disposable beer and also scientifically determined that an Isuzu Trooper can (uncomfortably) hold 43 compact macs.</p>

		<p>For me it is Beatles junk by proxy. I do have most of their music and I enjoy it, but I have other artists that I enjoy far more. My children, on the other hand, latched onto a few of their songs and became huge Beatles fans. Everyone made the inference that they could only become Beatles fans because I am and started giving me Beatles junk. And trust me, there is a lot of Beatles junk for sale out there and I very deliberately use the word junk.</p>

		<p>Even though I may not be into Coke that much, if someone started giving me vintage stuff, I wouldn&#39;t complain to much. &nbsp;Some of the old Star Wars and Coca-Cola merchandise from years ago is worth a lot of money now.</p>

		<p>Sometimes this idea can work out in your favor. &nbsp;A few years ago my sig other and I let it be know to the extended family that we both like craft beer. &nbsp;For every Christmas that followed, we usually received one or two bottles, growlers, or beer mugs from the fam. &nbsp;Believe me, we have not complained : )</p>
<p>I&#39;ve also seen the down side of this effect. &nbsp;Years earlier my mom asked me what I like for Christmas. &nbsp;I replied that I like history books and baseball. &nbsp;Now, for every birthday and Christmas, I get a deluge history- and baseball-related books every year (sadly, no game tickets). &nbsp;Occasionally some of the titles turn out to be interesting, but most of them sit on my shelf until I get a chance to put them into the book donation bin.</p>

		<p>When I was travelling for work, one of my co-workers asked me to pick them up a shot glass from the airport. The co-worker ended up leaving before I could give it to them, so I kept it. Kind of a neat keepsake for the places I travelled to. After that, I started buying them from every airport I went through. My parents knew of my collection and when they came back from a roadtrip, I had 20 new shotglasses for my collection. I didn&#39;t have the heart to tell them I wasn&#39;t collecting shot glasses, I was collecting memories of my travels.</p>

		<p>Too bad I am not in the kind of environment where people do this, otherwise I would be telling everyone that &quot;I love LEGO&quot; and have everyone gift me LEGO :)</p>
<p>Of course they would probably get me useless crap (things that look like LEGO but aren&#39;t LEGO, things that are LEGO but that I already have, things that are LEGO but that I have no use for, old used LEGO that isn&#39;t good enough for the collection etc)</p>

		<p>I bought a cheap, deactivated training hand grenade off Ebay and put it on my desk several years ago (It&#39;s the &quot;blame grenade&quot; for when someone breaks the build). My coworkers saw it and now, years later, I have an impressive arsenal of replica training Mills bombs, Stielhandgranates, pineapple grenades, lemon grenades, &quot;baseball&quot; grenades, rifle grenades, flash bangs, and smoke grenades.</p>

		<p>Old guy, loved the Giants. Went to over 500 games ( over 45 years ), at one of his first games, saw this offer for Mr Peanut Promotional items. Over the years, collected so much stuff, that he gave away boxes of it at the New Years Day Party. Wish I still had the Mr Peanut Pencil he gave me.</p>
<p>He, oh my, looked like he was wearing those fuzzy eyebrow glasses. He put on a pair, and no one knew he was wearing them.</p>
