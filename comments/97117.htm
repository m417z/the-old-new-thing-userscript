		<p>Across the street from our building is a bar named &#8220;The Dr.&#8217;s Inn&#8221;. We call it &#8220;going to the doctor&#8217;s office&#8221;.</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a bar located roughly a five minute walk from my old apartment that I nicknamed The Home Office because whenever I received a page at night I&#8217;d walk over, order a drink, and log in to figure out what was going on. The bartenders didn&#8217;t mind because I helped them with their IT stuff.</p>

		<p>I imagine that there are quite a few instances like that. I know that we have a bar named &#8220;The Library&#8221; here. In another city that I used to live in, there was a bar named &#8220;The Bank,&#8221; named because it used to be one a long time ago (and still had the vault to prove it).</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a bar in Santa Monica called &#8220;Father&#8217;s Office&#8221;.  Pretty sure there are some sad tales of childhood trauma behind that one.  (It was opened as a straight-up bar in 1953; since 2000, it&#8217;s been a gastropub.)</p>

		<p>A few weeks ago, I received a Google calendar invitation to a meeting in the [xyz] Room. I was interested to see that the name of the room was a hyperlink, and clicked on it to see whether our Facilities staff had done something slick, perhaps providing photographs or a floor plan. They had not. Google had noticed that there is a bar called The [xyz] Room in a midwestern city, and had provided this link.</p>

		<p>That room is where all the variable names go after they&#8217;re finished being used. It also contains the bit buckets for all your computers, but make sure that qualified maintenance personnel empty those periodically.</p>

		<p>In Spain, several years ago there was a television series called &#8220;Los ladrones van a La Oficina&#8221; (&#8220;Thiefs Go to The Office&#8221;). Note the capitalization: &#8220;La Oficina&#8221; (&#8220;The Office&#8221;) was the name of a café where, among the regular crowd, there was a group of pickpockets and con artists. The pun was that, in Spanish, &#8220;ir a la oficina&#8221; (&#8220;to go to the office&#8221;) means to go to work, specially at a white-collar position &#8211; quite the opposite to what pickpockets do.</p>
