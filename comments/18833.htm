		<p>I found that clip barely watchable&#8230; maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m not from the UK and am not accustomed.</p>
<p>The dancing was great, but the camera kept showing everything else but the dance: the audience, the jury, the guys backstage etc. Irritating!</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m from the UK, and it&#8217;s not just you. I think it&#8217;s largely because that clip is from the audition stage and presumably they haven&#8217;t choreographed the camera movements in advance &#8211; the same act from the show&#8217;s final ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4sGmnKuIjU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4sGmnKuIjU</a> ) does a much better job. But looking at the semi-final ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d31_aQEQwU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d31_aQEQwU</a> ) the show seems to like doing swooshy camera moves rather than showing the action, and it&#8217;s slightly worse than in other similar programmes I&#8217;ve seen.</p>
<p>The bhangra dance group ended up in second place, behind a 14-year old street dancer ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKKdvyTd4rg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKKdvyTd4rg</a> ). Sadly the dancing dog ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEVYvN4Qces" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEVYvN4Qces</a> ) only reached 5th place in the final.</p>

		<p>They are currently touring with the X-Factor finalists appearing with JLS (X-Factor is the UK version of American Idol for the uninitiated). My wife and daughter went to see them the other day. I remember them well from Britain&#8217;s Got Talent &#8211; they were very good.</p>
<p>The act was called Signature.</p>

		<p>@Neil:</p>
<p>Not quite. It started off in New Zealand with Popstars, then after that spread to the UK it was mutated into Pop Idol which was then exported to the USA as American Idol, then they did it all over again in the UK but as &quot;X-Factor&quot; due to a dispute with Simon Cowell.</p>
