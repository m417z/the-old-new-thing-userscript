		<p>Oh man, 16-bit. This awakes some memories. Like that time I was woken by the phone in an ungodly hour by the FoxPro Norwegian team, responding to my (quite serious) complain that their import .lib exported the WEP!</p>
<p>For the ones lucky enough to never having explored these deep and dark corners of Windows 16-bit, WEP was the &#8220;Windows Exit Procedure&#8221; (IIRC &#8211; Raymond will correct me if I&#8217;m wrong). It was a very special <em>named</em> function exported by DLLs to be called when all references to the module had been released, i.e. no programs used the DLL anymore. This was required as all applications and the system itself shared a single address space resource, and the DLL had to have a way to clean up what resources it allocated before it was unloaded.</p>
<p>The thing was, while you usually did write a WEP for moderately and more complex DLLs, you never <em>EVER</em> exported it like these morons did. You put it in the exported names table in the DLL, but you NEVER put it in the import library for that DLL. Doing so would make it effectively impossible for anyone else writing a DLL to use your DLL.</p>
<p>Well, guess what. That was a scenario the FoxPro developers never considered (one could rightfully, and in the most polite way, say &#8220;they didn&#8217;t really and fully know what they were doing&#8221;), and so I was left with a DLL I couldn&#8217;t link, and a phone call at an hour I didn&#8217;t appreciate.</p>
<p>What really made me see the quality of this was when I presented, again, the error for this person over the phone, and the response was &#8220;OK, we export the WEP from the import lib? So what?&#8221;.</p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>Ah, the WEP&#8230; The modern analog to this mistake would be putting your DllMain into your import library. Now everybody who tries to link to your DLL gets a &#8220;duplicate definition conflict&#8221; between their DllMain and yours. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Just out of curiosity, what sort of function /would/ GetProcAddress() be called for with high frequency?</p>
<p>And do you have any idea what made it impractical/impossible for callers to remember the returned pointer(s) themselves? If there aren&#8217;t that many of those functions, and it&#8217;s only 4 bytes per pointer (GetProcAddress returns a FAR pointer?), then that wouldn&#8217;t have eaten too much mem at the time, would it?</p>

		<p>For 16-bit, I also can&#8217;t think of one. For 32-bit though (even that it works differently), I&#8217;d say GetDisk(Free?)SpaceEx is at the top of the list. Oh the shortsightedness of what is/was known as Win32c (the &quot;Chicago&quot;, aka Win95, version of the Win32 API).</p>
<p>Adam:<br />
<br />There is no reason a single process wouldn&#8217;t hold on to the pointer, once it got it. But remember, 16-bit. All the applications in the system shared a single address space. The DLL was loaded once, at an address that then became unavailable for all other use in all other processes. So the issue wasn&#8217;t at all a single process not being able to keep track of what it got &#8211; it was the whole system using that single and very small adddress space and needing to share it between all applications (we&#8217;re talking pre-386 here).</p>

		<p>A base-1 integer? What&#8217;s that? 0 for 0, 00 for 1, 000 for 2, etc?</p>
<p>Wait, you said &quot;1-based integer&quot;? Never mind. :)</p>
<p>BTW Mike, was that back when FoxPro was an MS app, or was that before MS bought them?</p>

		<p>As far as a function that gets GetProcAddress()ed frequently in 16-bit, I&#8217;d say that DefWindowProc might be a good candidate. &nbsp;Programs won&#8217;t call GetProcAddress() on it directly, but they will import it, so the system needs to resolve the link every time any program starts.</p>
<p>However, it may be that the programs linked to DefWindowProc by ordinal number, in which case it&#8217;s not one of the frequent functions. &nbsp;Hmm&#8230;</p>

		<p>Mike:<br />
<br />I don&#8217;t believe that any version of Windows was written in Pascal. &nbsp;The reason that Pascal calling conventions were used was, IIRC, the Pascal calling convention (callee cleans up after the call) was a few bytes smaller (per call site), and a few clock ticks faster than C calling conventions (caller cleans up after the call).</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re trying to shoehorn a system into 640K, every few bytes help.</p>
<p>Of course, C calling conventions allow for varargs.</p>

		<p>On the subject of 1-based, so I don&#8217;t die wondering: Raymond, was Windows at one time written in/for PASCAL (specifically the API or API-handling code)? I&#8217;m thinking of the many clues in the form of calling convention for system functions, the one-based indices and other implementation details that seems to have leaked through. If not, do you know (or can you find out) why many of these design decisions were made at the time? I&#8217;d hate to die not knowing this piece of history.</p>
<p>Gabe:<br />
<br />IIRC it was around 1991, so I&#8217;m quite confident MS was the owner of FoxPro then. Another clue could be; top score on getting back to me on the issue quickly, but a rock bottom for giving me a &quot;Huh, what you say goes *whoosh* over our head&quot;. I see it as just another proof of what Raymond recently wrote in another entry &#8211; many are the groups that ship Windows software that break (the) rules of Windows programming, and not all within MS writing software are Windows API gurus.</p>
<p>Still, not exporting the WEP into the import library might perhaps not have been considered a &quot;guru&quot; issue. ;-)</p>
<p>(I btw think MS never fixed this. IIRC I had to fix it manually by introducing, for no other reason than to fix this FoxPro bug, yet another intermediate DLL that had no data whatsoever and only forwarded my calls from my real DLL to the FoxPro DLL).</p>

		<p>The WEP problem is easily fixed. You simply load the import library<br />
into a binary editor, find the WEP text and replace it with (say) XXX.</p>
<p>One should never treat third party tools with more respect than<br />
your own code. (There was a time when our company had MSVC6 checked<br />
into SourceSafe to make it easy to deploy all the necessary patches.)</p>

		<p>Hello Raymond,</p>
<p>sorry to be off-topic to this post, but could you look into this<br />
and correct this on your tooltip post? I had the same problem (missing<br />
black border most of the time, but with XP) and the suggestion by<br />
Martin Filteau made it go away.</p>
<p>Original posting tooltip: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/06/26/647365.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/06/26/647365.aspx</a><br />
<br />Martin Filteau&#8217;s suggestion: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/06/27/648493.aspx#649674" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/06/27/648493.aspx#649674</a></p>
<p>Thanks,<br />
<br />Tony</p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>I&#8217;m not sure that removing WS_EX_TRANSPARENT is the correct answer (since it messes up hit-testing) but I haven&#8217;t had the interest in finding out. People can find Martin&#8217;s comment and decide whether or not they want to follow it. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Sorry Mike, but MS didn&#8217;t buy FoxPro until the middle 1992, and the Windows version that was released a few months later was already mostly complete by the time MS moved in. It would almost certainly have been a Fox Software engineer you were talking to.</p>

		<p>Gabe, right, my bad. I&#8217;m fairly sure I was using MSVC1.x for that project, and it seems it was released early 1993 (?), why I&#8217;d guesstimate sometime after Q1-Q2 1993.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  For most DLLs, no function falls into this category, and the resident names table is empty. </p>
<p>WEP was in fact one of those names that had to be in the resident names table (and the code segment had to be preload nondiscardable for the same reason). </p>
<p>&gt;I can&#8217;t think of a function designed to be GetProcAddress&#8217;d with high frequency <br />Although I never used PenWindows, I&#8217;d say RegisterPenApp would have been a candidate for the resident names table &#8211; even taskman.exe calls GetProcAddress(GetSystemMetrics(SM_PENWINDOWS), &#8220;RegisterPenApp&#8221;) and it&#8217;s only 3K.</p>
