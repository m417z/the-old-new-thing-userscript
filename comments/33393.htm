		<p>You don&#8217;t need your voting registration card to vote.  Other forms of ID, for example, your driver license, should do.  Even if you don&#8217;t have an ID on you, you can &quot;vote a provisional ballot&quot;.</p>

		<p>FWIW, I was a poll judge, and our instruction manual had the same problem. The instructor salvaged the situation by using it as an example of what not to do.</p>
<p>Also, a canvassing board could still have counted your vote.</p>

		<p>(sorry for the double post &#8211; I wanted to reply to Mark)<br />
<br />Mark &#8211; that&#8217;s a great example of the security faux-paus, &quot;security by harassment&quot;. The ID requirement offers no additional security protection. To the end-user, it just changes which table you vote at.</p>
<p>I find this theme often comes up in security reviews. Somebody will propose some security measure, which upon closer inspection, only harrasses the user and doesn&#8217;t actually provide any security wins.  Stuff like &quot;let&#8217;s protect all our data by xoring it with some constant.&quot; Like that&#8217;s going to stop a hacker&#8230;</p>
<p>I think it would be very educational to take the security review procedure we use for software and then apply it to every day things (like shopping at a grocery store, or our election process).</p>

		<p>This is voting we&#8217;re talking about right?  Well in Chicago (where I live) jmstall&#8217;s message would have no applicabilty to our ID requirements because from what I can tell, other than being used to maintain the mailing list it seems like computers have almost no role on the actual day of voting.</p>
<p>You walk into the polling place, you show them your card, they look at their printout and cross your name off.. you go to ballot &quot;machine&quot;, punch your holes (we still use punchcards) and then put the thing in the box.</p>
<p>Then you go down to the next polling station and do it all again.<br /></p>

		<p>Or be like me, skip all the security procedures and not vote at all, because there&#8217;s nobody you want to vote for.</p>
<p>On the original topic, I remember the SuSE Linux boxes that had some sort of abstract mathematical figure on them, and people were going &quot;what the hell is this?&quot; &#8211; very poor design.</p>

		<p>Why not use Internet for voting? All have SN, right? Set up the SQL Server backed site and that is all!</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s a good catch, Raymond.</p>
<p>Now, what&#8217;s up with those &#8216;arrow&#8217; style ballots (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://makemyvotecount.info/ballotarrow.htm" rel="nofollow">http://makemyvotecount.info/ballotarrow.htm</a>)?</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t imagine that anyone designing a ballot would think that that&#8217;s an intuitive way to mark a ballot.</p>
<p>At least with the oval or box style ballots, someone has a good chance of actually filling the thing out correctly without having to resort to instructions.  But I don&#8217;t think anyone would have a clue how to correctly mark the &#8216;arrow&#8217; ballot without first studying the instructions.<br /></p>

		<p>Hey!  We use arrow-style ballots, and they work just fine!  :-P</p>
<p>They give us a fairly thick marker to use (not pencil or pen), and the people working there usually ask us if we&#8217;ve voted before (if not, they give a quick overview of what to do &#8212; &quot;just fill in the arrow next to the candidate you wish to vote for, and if you change your mind, X out your first choice&quot;).  So it&#8217;s extremely obvious after you&#8217;ve done it once, and before that, it&#8217;s still fairly obvious due to the oral instructions.</p>

		<p>Bryan &#8211; it may be obvious, but it&#8217;s not secure.<br />
<br />Someone handling your ballot (eg, a corrupt state worker doing a recount) could go cross out your original vote and mark a new vote.</p>
<p>From a security review perspective, it&#8217;s lacking defense-in-depth against corrupt handling. A more secure oriented goal would be: &quot;assuming somebody can hack your program (eg, tamper with your ballot), how can we design it such that they can&#8217;t do any damage.&quot;</p>
<p>In computer-speek, we do things like run as low-privilege user. In ballot-speek, you could do things like require a new ballot instead of allowing X&#8217;s, or even having some sort of ballot checksum.<br /></p>

		<p>Yes, that&#8217;s true, it&#8217;s not secure.  Then again, neither is any ballot type at all that allows the voter to change their minds.</p>
<p>Even with a checksum, if the checksum isn&#8217;t write-once (i.e. non-correctable), then it&#8217;s not secure.  A corrupt state worker doing a recount could just change the checksum to match their vote changes.  Adding a private key owned by the voter into the checksum would be one way to fix this &#8212; but as much as I like PKIs, PGP, etc., I doubt that&#8217;d be practical.</p>
<p>(I was responding to mikeb, where he said &quot;I can&#8217;t imagine that anyone designing a ballot would think that that&#8217;s an intuitive way to mark a ballot.&quot;  It is actually fairly intuitive: you have a big thick black line, broken in the middle, and a big thick black marker in your hand &#8212; &quot;Gee, I wonder what to do?  Maybe fill in the rest of the big thick black line, using my big thick black marker?  Naah, that&#8217;d be too obvious.&quot;  ;-)  Plus, there are the instructions the workers give you.)</p>

		<p>&quot;neither is any ballot type at all that allows the voter to change their minds.&quot;</p>
<p>If you change your mind or make a mistake, return the marked paper to the official, it is placed in a separatey identified box and you receive another paper. The separate box is retained for a time after the election in case any party disputes the result.</p>
<p>If you change your mind after you&#8217;re finished, that&#8217;s tough luck.</p>
<p>On the one hand I&#8217;m amused that the supposed &quot;champion of democracy&quot; spends a huge amount of money to run elections so poorly, disenfranchises its citizens, can&#8217;t run a fair election, and so on. On the other hand it&#8217;s hardly important, in my country everyone knows the fix is in, if your representative is from the ruling party they must toe the government line, if they&#8217;re from an opposing party they have no effective power. So decisions are really made by an elite, but a lot of money is wasted on the set dressing of a democracy.</p>
<p>Most decisions are made by consensus. Good or bad, they&#8217;d be the same in almost any system of government. It&#8217;s only in the rare cases where there is no consensus that any opportunity arises for your system of government to have an effect. Mostly, the effect will be a negative one, regardless. So by all means make your opinion known, but learn to enjoy the ride.</p>

		<p>Why do you cerr-razzzy Americans have such a strange set of voting procedures?</p>
<p>Here in the good old UK, we have a simple piece of paper, printed with some names. You put a mark in the box. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s so simple it&#8217;s very difficult to get wrong. If you do, you just tell the officials, and they give you a new voting form.</p>
<p>How we&#8217;ve laughed in recent years at all the coverage of how the &quot;world&#8217;s greastest democracy&quot; can&#8217;t even come up with a reliable, simple, trustworthy system to elect their leaders!</p>
<p>(BTW, this isn&#8217;t general bashing of the US &#8211; just bashing your political problems&#8230;)</p>

		<p>I needed to correct an error on the California touchscreen ballot. I touched &quot;review&quot; and sure enough, there was the &quot;yes&quot; circle with my erroneous checkmark through it. But no &quot;no&quot; circle. What to do? I was about to ask for help, but fir some reason I touched my &quot;yes&quot; and wonder of wonders, the space was replaced by unchecked yes and no circles. Radio buttons gone mad!</p>
