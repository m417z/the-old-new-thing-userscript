		<p>Aw, I was hoping these were going to be interesting questions/answers, not really basic ones. I had to add this functionality to a cron daemon type program in the last six months, and spend 60-70% of my time on the project trying to figure out the correct way to manage Desktops and Window Stations and stuff like that. Figuring out how to manage the token was the easy part :)</p>

		<p>&#8220;Programming Windows Security&#8221; by Keith Brown was one of the best assistants to that I&#8217;ve ever had.  The book is admittedly a bit dated(it mentions NT4 and Windows 2000, ffs), however, it gives extremely useful details and background of the logon process, managing tokens, managing ACLs, desktops, window stations, jobs, etc. that are still quite applicable and very useful today.</p>
<p>Kind of like how many people still find Programming Windows, 5th Edition by Charles Petzold is still one of the best introductions to the concepts and basics of Win32 programming, despite the fact that it focused on Windows 98 and NT 4.</p>
