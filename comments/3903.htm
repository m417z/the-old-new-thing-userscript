		<p>I find your articles on security issues intriguing. This is another example of an issue I wouldn&#39;t have considered on the face of it, but makes perfect sense once explained. It&#39;s a wonder that anyone can make secure software given the wide range of exploits that come to light. I wonder if, in hindsight, there was a better initial design that could have prevented this type of exploit in the first place.</p>

		<p>I wonder how many security vulnerabilities on Unix systems have resulted from the fact the setuid binaries do inherit their environment and current working directory from their parent processes.</p>
<p>Unix&#39;s sudo(1) does clear the environment by default (except for a few whitelisted environment variables), but you can override it and ask it to preserve the environment with the -E option.</p>

		<p>&quot;To improve security, it&#39;s a good idea revert all implicit path-resolving settings to safe and boring defaults for elevated child processes.&quot; I guess that&#39;s the point of education â€” that you get told simple yet not immediately apparent things. When you are told it, it makes perfect sense, but before being told, very few would think about it off the top of their heads.</p>

		<p>@Marutis [MSFT]:</p>
<p>It should be obvious because of the affect the integrity level has on inter-process communication.</p>
<p>As far as I am aware, Windows doesn&#39;t do any fiddling with the handles, so the high integrity process will have its end open with the default high integrity level, and the lower integrity process will have its end open with a lower integrity level.</p>
<p>This means that the lower integrity process will be WRITING to stdout, and the higher integrity process will be reading from stdin. The writing is capitalised there because the default integrity level associated with a process has the MANDATORY_LEVEL_NO_WRITE_UP mask set in the access mask of the ACE. The pipe is doing exactly that, writing to a higher level process, therefore writes get blocked.</p>
<p>I am also pretty sure that this is done via named pipes in Windows.</p>
<p>For the lower integrity process to be able to write to stdout in this case, the pipe would have to have a lower integrity level assigned to it.</p>

		<p>Can the elevated process voluntarily lower the integrity level on its input pipe? I assume so.</p>

		<p>@Crescens2k: You know even the MAC checks are only done at open time, do you not?</p>
<p>It&#39;s also nontrivial to get the exit code of the elevated process to the point where I don&#39;t currently know how to do it (I only know how to wait for it by searching the process table for it, with the obvious race condition).</p>

		<p>I wish that elevated processes could more easily start non-elevated children. &nbsp;There are so many programs out there whose installer asks at the end whether you want to run the program you just installed. &nbsp;When you click yes, the program runs, but because the installer was running elevated, the child is elevated, too. &nbsp;This can result in data files created during this first execution being inaccessible to subsequent executions. &nbsp;It has caused us tech support issues, sadly.</p>
<p>A hack I came up with is to use Explorer&#39;s token. &nbsp;I feel bad about using it, and thankfully have not in a real application. &nbsp;GetShellWindow to find Explorer, GetWindowThreadProcessId to get its PID, OpenProcess, OpenProcessToken, DuplicateTokenEx, CreateProcessAsUser. &nbsp;You don&#39;t need SeAssignPrimaryTokenPrivilege because a non-elevated version of your token is considered a restricted version of your token for CreateProcessAsUser. &nbsp;If you want Explorer to be the parent rather than yourself, use STARTUPINFOEX with PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_PARENT_PROCESS. &nbsp;One downside to this is that the child still gets the elevated process&#39;s environment, rather than your user environment, the point of this article. =)</p>
<div class="post">[<em>There&#39;s no need to hack it this way. There&#39;s a completely documented and supported solution. I have an article in the queue on this topic, but you can also find it if you just look through the SDK samples. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Adam Rosenfeld: The sudo(1) manpage on my Linux system states:</p>
<p>&quot;The -E (preserve environment) option indicates to the security policy that the user wishes to preserve their existing environment variables. &nbsp;The security policy may return an error if the -E option is specified and the user does not have permission to preserve the environment.&quot;</p>
<p>And there are indeed settings in the sudoers file to control this.</p>

		<p>@Maurits [MSFT]: Yes, but it&#39;s a bit painful in the way I know. &nbsp;Make a new SACL with a single entry containing a SYSTEM_MANDATORY_LABEL_ACE, specifying the well-known SID WinLowLabelSid or whatever, and mask = SYSTEM_MANDATORY_LABEL_NO_WRITE_UP. &nbsp;Initialize a security descriptor with nothing in it but a SetSecurityDescriptorSacl. &nbsp;Then call SetKernelObjectSecurity with LABEL_SECURITY_INFORMATION.</p>
<p>This can also be done at the time of pipe creation by specifying a security descriptor with this SACL. &nbsp;(In both cases, ACCESS_SYSTEM_SECURITY is apparently not required for lowering the label despite being in the SACL.)</p>

		<p>&quot;(In both cases, ACCESS_SYSTEM_SECURITY is apparently not required for lowering the label despite being in the SACL.)&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, you only need the rights that standard users have. This is why you use the LABEL_SECURITY_INFORMATION constant instead of the SACL one. This allows even standard users to lower the integrity level of objects and processes they spawn.</p>

		<p>[ I wish that elevated processes could more easily start non-elevated children. &#8211; Myria ]</p>
<p>The hack i used in my most recent installer-project is to shell out to schtasks.exe, to register a scheduled task for the target executable that runs as the current interactive user, don&#39;t add a schedule, invoke it immediately and then unregister it.</p>
<p>It seems like an absurd solution but i have seen it mentioned on MSDN somewhere, although i can&#39;t find the citation right now (so feel free to throw things at me for being part of the eventual Win32 compatibility problem instead of using the Right Solution)</p>

		<p>@Myria, @mappu: &quot;There are so many programs out there whose installer asks at the end whether you want to run the program you just installed.&quot;</p>
<p>Personally, I think the easiest solution is to NOT have the installer ask if you want to run the program. &nbsp;</p>
<p> &nbsp;&#8211; It&#39;s not a huge feature (I personally don&#39;t care if the program gives me a way to run the program when it&#39;s done)</p>
<p> &nbsp;&#8211; I have to know how to run the program using the &quot;normal&quot; method anyway, or the program will not be useful</p>
<p> &nbsp;&#8211; It only happens once (at the end of the install)</p>
<p> &nbsp;&#8211; Some programmers are apparently having trouble with it</p>
<p>Why go to a lot of trouble for a tiny feature?</p>

		<p>DWalker: It&#39;s not an entirely useless feature. There have been plenty of times I&#39;ve want to run some trivial utility program that requires installation before I can use it. If I have to go through the annoying install process, it&#39;s nice to not have to then go and try to find what I just installed.</p>
<p>When you&#39;re installing an app to make it permanently available on your computer (like Office), it&#39;s have it run the app when the installer&#39;s done. When you&#39;re trying to run a program, and installation is just an impediment to using it, offering to run the program at the end of the install is the least they can do.</p>

		<p>Some other times when running the application post-install is useful:</p>
<p>&#8211; The software has an always-on component running as the user (e.g. a tray icon)</p>
<p>&#8211; The installation was an upgrade, and the software was open prior to the installation &#8211; restarting it would simply be the polite thing to do (especially if the installation was run silently in the background, or initiated from within the application itself)</p>
<p>&#8211; If configuration needs to be performed on first application launch, then it makes sense to continue straight into it once installation is complete</p>
