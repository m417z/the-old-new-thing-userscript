		<p>I&#39;m suprised you mention the motherboard as the biggest source of hardware uncertainty and not the circuitry on the battery itself that reports it&#39;s original max capacity, current max capacity, and current capacity.</p>

		<p>Microsoft (or other system developers) might do well to follow the lead of automobile manufacturers, and fib a little on the safe side. &nbsp;I can run my car quite a while even after the gas gauge has dropped below &quot;E&quot;. &nbsp;But, I can&#39;t recall the last time I was able to run my laptop when the battery gauge said it was empty. </p>
<p>On the other hand, it seems common enough for for a computer (or whatever device &#8211; this is certainly not unique to Windows-based laptops) to die when the battery gauge says there 30% or so left (or maybe it actually does drop to 0% first, but only seconds after reaching 30%).</p>

		<p>Unlike lefty, I think that fibbing the battery meter is a bad idea. First, it&#39;s not precise enough that the software would be able to lie even convincingly. Second, people will just adjust to the new display and only plug in when the meter has been at zero for a while (like some do for gas). Then we&#39;d have a display that starts from inaccurate information and adds extra inaccuracy. No thanks!</p>

		<p>Running your car past E certainly works, but isn&#39;t very good for your engine, as bumps in the road and sloshing due to acceleration and turning can cause air to enter the fuel lines.</p>

		<p>I wish there was a way to set the maximum battery life, or turn power management off altogether. My laptop hasn&#39;t been above 70% for a couple of years now, and as of the last three weeks it&#39;s constantly on 5%. Which means whenever I pull the power cord out it hibernates. Changing the critical battery level in power settings doesn&#39;t work &#8211; it gets reset to 5% immediately. And changing the critical action to sleep doesn&#39;t really work either. Since I actually have a very short battery life I wouldn&#39;t remove the power plug unless I&#39;m just moving to the other room, which is pretty common &#8211; and every time I do that I now have to wait for a hibernate and then a resume.</p>

		<p>@configurator: I think you can disable the battery in device manager to accomplish that.</p>
<p>If not, deleting My Computer from device manager and adding &quot;Standard PC&quot; will disable power management, at the cost of any second core and DEP.</p>

		<p>Any reported cases of GetBatteryLifePercent() just being implemented as &#39;return 100&#39; for marketing purposes? :P</p>

		<p>I&#39;m curious how this battery indicator actually works, considering the whole point of thirty years of battery evolution was to create a battery that delivers stable power all the way from full to empty, then suddenly stops working?</p>

		<p>The battery indicator works by [interrogating some hardware which] measures the battery output voltage before it reaches the &#39;voltage stabilizer&#39; part of the power supply circuitry.</p>
<p>LI batteries discharge quite consistently: fully charged you get a known high voltage per cell (3.7 to 4.2V depending on the type of battery), fully discharged you get a known low voltage per cell (3V ish). The &#39;discharge curve&#39; is relatively flat &#8211; i.e if the measured output voltage is 50% of the way between 4.2V and 3V then the battery is 50% discharged, the same for 45%, 40%, etc.</p>
<p>It is possible to discharge &#39;dumb&#39; LI batteries beyond the point where they can be recharged; this is why consumer batteries will simply stop giving power beyond a certain point; internal protection circuitry prevents discharge beyond the point of no return.</p>
<p>From the consumer&#39;s point of view, batteries do give stable power all the way from full to empty; then they suddenly stop working.</p>

		<p>I can think of many meetings when I sat down with an estimate of 2 hours of battery life remaining only to have the machine hibernate after an hour. &nbsp;</p>
<p>configurator: Put your machine into standby before you unplug it to move it to a new room. &nbsp;It&#39;ll be much quicker to resume than hibernate.</p>

		<p>You start your machine, it idles. You check the battery life remaining gauge &#8211; it says 2 hours. You close the gauge and then open your apps and start working&#8230;</p>
<p>If you kept it open you&#39;d see that the moment you start actually doing things, the battery life remaining estimate drops significantly &#8211; it updates about every 20 seconds depending on instantaneous power drain.</p>
<p>If you really want a &#39;portable&#39; you have to make sure the manufacturer&#39;s battery figures are 4+ hours or it&#39;ll just get irritating.</p>

		<p>I&#39;d expect battery run time to be even more difficult to predict than file copy time.</p>

		<p>I have got file copying times of &quot;2 million minutes&quot; in several different windozes when copying a few files. Have never seen anything remotely close to that on the battery meter.</p>
<p>Battery meter I don&#39;t trust. Wifi reception I don&#39;t trust. For manufacturers, there&#39;s too much to win by lying about these things, it can&#39;t be trusted at all, it&#39;s only funny pixels on the screen, not actual conditions of anything.</p>
<p>Software could of course do a better job. Software could record previous battery drains and compare to the current drain and predict the future from there. If user always use office 08-17 weedays, and always play games 20-22 every saturday, windows could use that information to predict the future much better. But it does not. It is only stupid.</p>
<p>WMI can&#39;t be trusted either. Most of the information are of very low quality, corresponding APIs usually return much more accurate information about anything. The wmi repositories are also very fragile, break very easily.</p>
