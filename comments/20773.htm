		<p>Well, maybe they didn&#8217;t get to the part in the program yet where they tell you not to put yourself in a position where it appears that you&#8217;re doing drugs and sleeping with hookers. :)</p>
<p>Sending them home from the program, meaning they don&#8217;t get to complete it the first time round, does seem like a bit of a dumb thing to do. It would be like being in rehab, getting caught with booze (or whatever it is you&#8217;re in for) and then, instead of just staying there until you are actually dry, being thrown out and told you&#8217;ll have to come back later in order to start again.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t see how their privacy was invaded. &nbsp;The fire alarm went off and (probably by law) the room had to be inspected. &nbsp;And as far as getting &quot;ripped off&quot;, they knew the rules when they joined the league; I have no sympathy for them. &nbsp;It doesn&#8217;t even matter in the long run; they are still going to make their millions of dollars. &nbsp;They just have to suffer some temporary public embarrassment. &nbsp;Sounds like a pretty good deal to me; Stern probably would have liked the punishment to be much harsher.</p>

<p>I wasn&#8217;t aware this was a blog dedicated to Windows software development. Raymond is free to post about whatever he feels like posting, which happens to be, well, about 50% non-Windows software development.</p>

		<p>So they made an oopsie and set off the fire alarm. In the end they were just having a bit of fun with some hookers and marijuana. Why would that interest us?</p>

<p>Then imagine, as I said, that they set an actual fire in the room, and prevented anyone from entering their room long enough for the fire to spread to other rooms, causing untold amounts of damage as well as putting the lives of other people (who are probably asleep, considering it was 2 AM) in jeopardy. Is it unethical now?</p>
<p>Yes, a real fire didn&#8217;t occur (besides the lighter and the joint), but the fire alarm went off, and hotel management had a duty to ensure that there was no actual fire, and the players hindered them in their duty.</p>

		<p>&gt; So they made an oopsie and set off the fire alarm.</p>
<p>And then refused to let anyone in the room to inspect it, which, if there were an actual fire, would be interpreted as being extraordinarily callous towards the personal safety of the other patrons of the hotel.</p>
<p>&gt; In the end they were just having a bit of fun with some hookers and marijuana.</p>
<p>*Just* prostitution and drug use? My bad, I thought they were breaking the law.</p>
<p>The NBA has had an image problem for a while now, culminating with the Palace brawl and now the Donaghy scandal. It&#8217;s going to be a while before it&#8217;s going to be seen as a &quot;clean&quot; league; Stern is livid because if the rookies don&#8217;t start living clean now, the league will be tainted by their actions during their entire careers.</p>

		<p>&gt;Erik: When you&#8217;ve paid them.</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t see where it says the women were hookers. &nbsp;So how is spending the night with two women &#8220;messing up your life?&#8221;</p>
<p>If marijuana was involved- well that&#8217;s a crime and I side with the NBA authorities. &nbsp;But the issue with the women is different. &nbsp;Raymond appears to be siding with the NBA authorities here, by saying &#8220;Maybe this time, they&#8217;ll learn something.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a matter of learning. It&#8217;s quite possible the players resent being told how to spend their personal time. They may not care what the NBA thinks of their actions, and if that&#8217;s the case, I agree with them.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>&#8220;&#8230; messing up your life&#8221; was just an attempt at a catchy headline. I had a nitpicker&#8217;s corner ready but decided not to run it. Maybe I should have. One of the things they were supposed to learn is &#8220;Activities you should avoid because they will result in embarrassment to you and the league when they appear in the newspaper.&#8221; That&#8217;s the lesson they failed to learn. Whether this is a valid lesson I don&#8217;t really care. I just enjoyed the irony. -Raymond</i>]</div>
