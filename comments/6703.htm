		<p>Executions can take a while &#8211; did anyone check with Legal if he was only alive pending appeals?</p>
<p>The military have a status of &#39;terminal leave&#39; when your service is up &#8211; referring to using up any remaining leave entitlement after you go home but before you leave the payroll, but it does seem to imply some sort of incurable medical problem.</p>

		<p>We&#39;re given that the intern was the subject of the termination, rather than the object, so it does not surprise me that he is OK.</p>

		<p>In my student days, around 1980, new languages fluorished, and my University contributed significantly to what became ITU&#39;s standard programmingh language for phone switches, CHILL. The contribution was a very well designed &#8211; but just tooo academic style! &#8211; language called Mary, named after the girlfriend of the chief language designer.</p>
<p>This was before &quot;Hello World!&quot; had been established as The Simplest Program. Rather, the standard presentation of the language usually opened with a small program printing out &quot;Mary has been executed&quot;.</p>

		<p>Several years ago, the product I was working on had a creatively Byzantine start-up process, with several different modules written in various languages successively loading each other. One of these modules was called the &quot;native&quot; (because it was written in C++ and compiled to an .exe containing native code, in contrast to the Java program that it would, in turn, load).</p>
<p>One step earlier in the chain was another module which tried to start the &quot;native&quot; module after doing various sanity checks. One of these sanity checks was that the &quot;native&quot; in fact existed on disk. If it didn&#39;t (which could happen after abotched or interrupted update/uninstall), the end user would be shown a message box reading:</p>
<p>&quot;Error: Could not find a native to execute!&quot;</p>
<p>at each login (!) because our product was obviously The World&#39;s Most Wonderful Program and therefore would default to adding itself to the Startup group at install.</p>
<p>Some time later, as I was working on code that would obsolete the native and native-starter as part of a new improved slightly less Byzantine start-up process, I made a special effort to identify a failure mode that could plausibly take over the traditional error message wording. Unfortunately, the higher-ups vetoed that.</p>

		<p>Why aren&#39;t business people learn to avoid ambiguity in business? They can sometimes introduce fatal issues (While this one is definately a &quot;fatal&quot; one).</p>

		<p>In the English language, many words have (too) many meanings. This applies to &quot;termination&quot; and &quot;execute&quot;. And it seems to me that such words (and other words too, of course) can be combined to a legal sentence by simply putting them together with some whitespace between them. (Maybe the word legal should be sentenced.) Moreover, it&#39;s often impossible to distinguish verbs and nouns.</p>
<p>I got used becoming confused by such sentences of such words.</p>

		<p>I suppose the manager would be doubly worried if the intern were named &quot;Termination Report&quot;.</p>
<p>My company also has a Termination Report. &nbsp;The people that run it are affectionately known as Terminators.</p>

		<p>In our application there are hierarchical commands, so we often speak about executing children, &quot;the child won&#39;t be executed if its younger brother is still running&quot; etc.</p>
