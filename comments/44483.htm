		<p>Where/how/what is the debugging version of MSHTML.DLL obtained? I don&#39;t think I have ever heard of that before. A quick google search didn&#39;t show any info in the first few results.</p>
<p>This could be very helpful in a product I am working on.</p>

		<p>You need an MSDN subscription to get at checked builds, iirc?</p>

		<p>Ok. I have the subscription but have never worked with the checked builds of Windows. Way back when (before virtualization) I didn&#39;t have a separate machine to run them on, now I don&#39;t have that excuse.</p>
<p>General question about the debug builds, are they an all or nothing? Do I need to use the full debug build of windows, or are there DLLS (like MSHTML) that can be installed individually? Really need to explore this stuff.</p>

		<p>What exactly that it means that it can only be used for test purposes? Can it be used to test what is the new reference count? Apparently not.</p>
<p>I am wondering, since technically the value can be meaningless (as in the discussed implementation of IUnknown::Add&shy;Ref) or I guess even random, is there an actual use where this value would be helpful?</p>

		<p>I am reminded of this mathematical joke:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.math.psu.edu/tseng/profession.html">http://www.math.psu.edu/&#8230;/profession.html</a></p>
<p>A Mathematician, a Biologist and a Physicist are sitting in a street cafe watching people going in and coming out of the house on the other side of the street.</p>
<p>First they see two people going into the house. Time passes. After a while they notice three persons coming out of the house.</p>
<p> The Physicist: &quot;The measurement wasn&#39;t accurate.&quot;.</p>
<p> The Biologist: &quot;They have reproduced&quot;.</p>
<p> The Mathematician: &quot;If now exactly one person enters the house then it will be empty again.&quot;</p>

		<p>So you&#39;re saying that if my program relies on MSHTML&#39;s component&#39;s AddRef to return an accurate value, I will need to get the debug version of Windows and ship its MSHTML.DLL alongside my application?</p>

		<p>@Me, no, what he&#39;s saying is that you shouldn&#39;t rely on the AddRef count. You should be tracking your own references. When you call AddRef, you need to call Release when you&#39;re done with the component &#8211; for each instance of the component you created. You shouldn&#39;t blindly call Release, especially for a system level component. </p>

		<p>@Terry Denham: This is not a &quot;system level&quot; component &#8212; it&#39;s just the IE browser or part of, running in my process. I can probe and find the private m_dwRefCount if want to, so no need to play it rude.</p>
<p>IE team has such a high bugs-to-features ratio. Custom heap, custom COM, custom GC, custom compiler (?) &#8212; do they think they or as import as OS or Office or something.</p>
<p>They should start wiping from behind first, IMHO.</p>

		<p>@wqw</p>
<p>Terry had it right there.</p>
<p>IE, on Windows, is &#39;OS-level&#39;. You are almost never going to encounter a version of Windows without it.</p>
<p>Additionally, I&#39;ve encountered geometrically more bugs caused by third-party developers misusing IE than native to IE, so this is a case of &quot;don&#39;t throw stones.&quot;</p>

<p>I&#39;d hope so. If there&#39;s one thing some of the stories on this blog have taught me, it&#39;s that you can never be as sure as you might hope that people won&#39;t really try things like this ;)</p>

		<p>prshaw: but please, for the sake of the MS devs, don&#39;t raise a support issue against &quot;debug mshtml.dll running on free Windows&quot;. Load the debug file on a debug version of Windows first and see if it reproduces.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m pretty sure that debug DLLs are not redistributable. &nbsp;Although (I hope) @Me was joking, we can be virtually certain that someone somewhere is seriously thinking the same thing.</p>

<p>You mean, provided that you know what the implementation of AddRef that you&#39;re using is? because I don&#39;t get how looking at the value returned by &quot;return 0;&quot; can give you any clue about anything, other than that the function actually returns.</p>
