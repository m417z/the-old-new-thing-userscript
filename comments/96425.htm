		<p>Ok, but why was Recycle Bin the default directory? Was this some kind of advanced file restoration dialog?</p>

		<p>Hopefully. Might not even need to be that <i>advanced</i>; I could easily imagine a program that stored its data as a series of files and let one delete them within the program easily (something with an interface like an email program, perhaps tracking incoming Widget Orders or To-do List items or whatever). And, to delete it just sends to the built-in Recycle Bin, which seems like perfectly reasonable behavior. Then, rather than having the user dig around in their system&#8217;s Recycle Bin themselves, it offers a handy undelete dialog that opens up the Recycle Bin but filtered to the file type the application uses for its documents.</p>
<p>But since everything&#8217;s handled directly with files, it integrates nicely with backups and people transferring items via email or some other means if needed, too.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know anything about this particular program, but just &#8220;I want a file open dialog defaulting to the Recycle Bin&#8221; doesn&#8217;t bring up huge red flags for me, since I can see a use for it. And it&#8217;s not likely something that has a built-in MSDN sample program.</p>

		<p>I think I&#8217;m missing a piece of information explaining why the original way worked (and why it working is classed as a bug).</p>

		<p>It worked because the old open dialog has very limited PIDL support (CDM_GETFOLDERIDLIST etc.). The initial directory looked like a absolute path (?:* drive root) and got passed directly to shell stuff that parses a path and gives you a PIDL. The shell supports ::{CLSID} paths in certain places and the :: path was parsed successfully into a PIDL and the PIDL got used as the initial directory.</p>
<p>The fact that it worked was an accident and long path fixes in Vista Path* functions probably broke it and so it was less work to say that it is a bug than to add the support back (and document it).</p>

		<p>Ah, ok, so the translation code was there in the back but it just wasn&#8217;t intended to be used through that route. Thanks.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m sure the author chose Recycle Bin as a just an example of a virtual directory to open. It is not a recommendation and nothing was offered pro or con as to whether that is a reasonable thing to do in your own app. Give the guy a break!</p>

		<p>I doubt that.  Raymond explicitly says:</p>
<p>&#8220;A customer reported that they had been setting the lpstrInitialDir member of the OPENFILENAME structure to &#8220;::{645FF040-5081-101B-9F08-00AA002F954E}&#8221; in order to have the dialog&#8217;s default directory be the Recycle Bin.&#8221;</p>
<p>This seems clear that the customer (the one calling for support) has some code that wants a dialog&#8217;s default directory to be the Recycle Bin.   I&#8217;m not sure who you mean by &#8220;author&#8221;; Raymond is the author, and Raymond is not the customer that he mentions.</p>

		<p>Either that, or the customer was doing something substantially dumber (&#8220;Let&#8217;s show an open file dialog for the Control Panel!&#8221;) and changed it to the Recycle Bin when consulting Microsoft because they did not want to get told &#8220;Don&#8217;t do that.&#8221;</p>

		<p>One more example on people who (unintentionally ?) rely on bug behavior.</p>
