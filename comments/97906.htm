		<p>In the 1970&#8217;s for a brief time there was no tariff on imported sugar. The result was first a drop in the price of sugar and then a large increase.

Who loses? Heartland, the people of Canada, and the people of the United States.</p>

		<p>And that poor molasses loses too, by being added to sugar, then refined out again, shipped back to Canada, then added again to a new batch, and so on.  That molasses must get tired and feel unappreciated for its own merits; it&#8217;s just there for tax purposes.</p>

		<p>Or they got to feel they&#8217;re good companion for the containers that used to ship them. (It makes little sense to just ship empty containers back to Canada when there are molasses to ship back too)</p>

		<p>Regarding the 2005 case &#8212; disclaimer I&#8217;m not a lawyer &#8212;  It appears Customs started trying to collecting actually money (i.e. pay us what we say you owe).</p>
<p>Heartland said &#8220;The court ruled you can&#8217;t collect on imports made before the last reversal 2000&#8221;.  The court said &#8220;Try to work out which shipments are under which tariff rate&#8221;.  Heartland said &#8220;We tried, but couldn&#8217;t reach agreement, so please make them obey your original order&#8221;.  Customs said, requesting summary judgment, &#8220;The court&#8217;s original order doesn&#8217;t apply because of all the legal wangling this is now a new case.&#8221;  The court said, &#8220;This is not a new case and the previous decision applies.  Customs will not be allowed to evade this court&#8217;s decision on a technicality without a full hearing, and Heartland can ask to have the decision enforced.&#8221; </p>
<p>My observation: when the government takes the low road and tries to abuse the process of justice, it&#8217;s a sure bet the action is being motivated by personal interests.  A prosecutor lets things get personal with a defendant, or wants the glory of bringing a big name down.  Big money applies pressure via political connections for government agencies to act against the best interests of the people.  People of power or ideology within agencies use the courts to impose their desires.  The common good is ignored.</p>

		<p>AFAICT, I think that the 2007 judgement was regarding U.S. Customs liquidating (selling off) sugar that was seized (for non-payment?), where the judge put a stop to that, at least until this epic saga had concluded. This is indeed a strange story. Next in the series: softwood lumber!</p>

		<p>Ford used the Heartland dodge complete with magic recycled ingredients. The Transit Connect, a small delivery van, was built in Turkey and shipped to the USA with four seats and side windows to be tariffed as a car. In the USA, Ford then takes out the two rear seats and replaces the side windows with metal panels. Presto, it is then sold as a panel van. The replaced parts are shipped back to the factory for re-use. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Transit_Connect#Tariff_circumvention" rel="nofollow">Wikipedia says that in 2013 US Customs told Ford</a> the imported vans disguised as cars would be tariffed as light trucks and subject to the 25% tax. Oddly, despite no longer benefiting from a lower tariff Ford continues to import the vehicles as cars then re-work them into vans in the USA.</p>
<p>Americans might remember the Subaru pickup trucks with the two plastic seats in the truck bed. With those two plastic seats, the Subaru was classified as a car and avoided the USA&#8217;s 25% tariff on light duty trucks. Later, revised US passenger safety regulations forbade the outboard seats and the Subaru was a car no more.</p>
<p>Then there was the USA&#8217;s attempts to limit imports of computer memory chips made in Japan. One of the US semiconductor makers that had pleaded for relief from competition from Japanese imported memory chips also had a division that built and sold IBM-compatible mainframe computers. Then for its computer business, this US memory chip maker started importing computer mainframe storage units built by Hitachi in Japan. IIRC, Hitachi&#8217;s loose chips were subject to the import quota but not when Hitachi&#8217;s memory chips were soldered onto printed circuit boards and packaged in metal boxes as computer mainframe storage units.</p>

		<p>As Raymond said in his post on the 25th:<br />
 Ford&#8217;s solution is to produce a passenger car, and then on arrival in the United States, remove the seats and windows. (This may explain why you see paneled vans with window cutouts in the cargo area.)</p>

		<p>&gt; Americans might remember the Subaru pickup trucks with the two plastic seats in the truck bed.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, I had forgotten about those.  At the time I wondered who would ever want or use them? Tax dodge never occurred to me.</p>
