		<p>So much is configurable on a PC. How does a user determine what to send? A user could send everything, but isn&#39;t that a bunch of unuseful junk most of the time? And if the user did send everything, how do you figure out what of that is relevant?</p>

		<p>Guess: since, at the time the policy was named, the only information displayed was the user name.</p>

		<p>Haha. This stuff gets nasty.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve a rare set of configurations that lead to me finding strange bugs. Since these configurations are set due to a rare eye problem, these also end up being tagged accessibility.</p>
<p>I&#39;m using the so-called free accessibility you get if you write your code correctly in the first place but lots of people don&#39;t and have no clue what to test for (hint: do not assume window colors or web browser colors. Do not assume background images display).</p>
<p>I try to include the relevant information but sometimes I miss something and even Microsoft has a hard time reproducing the bug I encountered.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been on the receiving side of incomplete bug reports so I feel your pain too.</p>

		<p>It might be helpful to make &quot;the original item&quot; a link to the post that the comment was referring to, although since there it was a week-long series, maybe just the most relevant one would do.</p>

		<p>I know this isn&#39;t really the point, but FWIW I can reproduce the behaviour in question. With &#39;Show window contents while dragging&#39; disabled, the icons in the notification area reflow before the mouse button is released, even though the taskbar itself isn&#39;t redrawn. I&#39;m using Windows XP x64, with a custom theme which I guess might have an effect.</p>
<p>(Sadly after that experiment the taskbar is now attempting to show my applications in a vertical list even though it&#39;s now back at the bottom of the screen, leading to the first entry falling half off the bottom of the screen, and the rest being lost entirely :(.)</p>

		<p>Usually people which reports bugs thinks developers have all code they ever written memorized down to every single loc, and that developers don&#39;t want anything else than to jump straight into their code and fix bugs. The reality couldn&#39;t be further away. Usually developers have rather limited possibilities to edit code they written, in the common case they doesn&#39;t even own the code they written, they are usually not the legal author!</p>

		<p>I&#39;m curious as to if you had been able to reproduce the issue, whether you would have actually done something about getting it fixed?</p>
<p>We&#39;ve given up reporting cosmetic bugs to Microsoft, because after repeatedly putting the effort in to document the problem, write an app that demonstrates it, find the right person to submit it to, wait 3 months for a response that misunderstands the original problem, write back, wait another 3 months for a response that finally confirms the problem, what we most often find is that, next time a new version of Windows comes out, nothing has changed.</p>

		<p>Yes, I would be sooooo happy if anybody reporting a bug would read <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/&#8230;/bugs.html</a> first. Only a few hours ago I had somebody file a bug writing whole three paragraphs of text &#8211; and not a single piece of useful information, probably hoping that I would somehow read his mind.</p>
<p>As to your exercise &#8211; I would guess that this policy name comes from Windows 2000 or earlier where there wasn&#39;t any other information to display, only the user name. And after that there wasn&#39;t an incentive significant enough to change it. You know, not much gain but lots of documentation and books and PowerPoint presentations that need to be rewritten. Not to mention the applications that somehow managed to hardcode the policy by its name&#8230;</p>

		<p>Because if people turned on a policy called &quot;Do not display information about last logged on user&quot;, they would call in wondering why they couldn&#39;t see the *name* of the last logged on user :-P</p>

		<p>@JonPotter:</p>
<p>True words. Every bug goes through like at least 3 levels; every level won&#39;t often bother to read the case history, and will just request all the same information again. 99.9% of the time they don&#39;t have access neither to the source code, nor to the code owner.</p>

		<p>Twice in the last week I had requests to &quot;fix&quot; an email account, because mail which was intended for that recipient but with the address wrong was failing to arrive. In one of the two cases, the sender had somehow entered a very obviously wrong address into his address book; the other involved a cut and paste picking up stray punctuation. I am starting to wonder if I can find a vendor doing &quot;user replacement parts&quot; which do what the name implies&#8230;</p>

		<p>Although one shouldn&#39;t be too trigger happy in closing things with WORKSFORME.</p>
<p>On a tracker I used to work with, there always was a steady stream of ‘button X doesn&#39;t work’ or ‘if you do X, Y happens’ type reports. A cow-orker used to routinely close these without a second look, citing tracker policy. But it turned out that in every single case, the issue was easily reproduced and usually indicative of a serious bug.</p>
<p>Users do not always give you all the information you want. But I&#39;ve never assumed that therefore their problem is non-existent or unimportant. Sometimes they don&#39;t know any better, sometimes they lack the time (I saw someone submit fifty issues on a day &#8211; that would have been a full-time job, had he followed policy), sometimes they think the issue is not dependent on configuration and they saw it happening on all versions to date.</p>

		<p>But why show an ugly empty frame? A frame is supposed to be around something. When that policy is enabled, the frame should be hidden too. Better still, bring back the real Classic logon style as an option that shows the domains in a dropdown (which also broke btw in Vista).</p>
