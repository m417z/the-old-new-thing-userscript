		<p>I was a crackpot physicist. The straw man was a high school level textbook that was very good until the last two chapters.</p>

		<p>Doesn&#39;t the Microsoft security team have to respond to/investigate to all security issue reports, even the ones from crackpots?</p>

		<p>I suspect that many of the papers in &quot;the box&quot; tell the reader that they need to think &quot;outside the box.&quot;</p>

<p>I want to see Raymond on the Microsoft Security Team, just for the ruckus. ;-)</p>

<p>Everyone should keep an open mind, but not so open that your brains fall out.</p>

		<p>Apparently engineers are somewhat over-represented not just in &quot;the box&quot;, but also among conspiracy theorists, religious nutjobs, and even terrorists.</p>
<p>Has anybody put forth a theory as to why engineers are so likely to be cranks?</p>

		<p>Gabe, my theory is that engineers tend to see themselves as smarter than most other folks. I think this then leads to (a) giving way to much credit to one&#39;s own musings and (b) the suspicion that if the hoi polloi thinks a thing, it&#39;s very likely wrong.</p>

		<p>@Daniel: Not to mention they always work with systems that were designed. So naturally, some of them start to assume everything was rationally designed&#8230; and they are not told much of the physics anyway, but since they get the job done with it, some of them, again, start to assume that that&#39;s the actual contents of the physics, and all the extra stuff is just to be pretentious.</p>
<p>Something like this, I suppose.</p>

		<p>As long as we&#39;re using Fox News style anecdotal hearsay, I&#39;ve heard talk that more cranks falsely claim to be Engineers/Doctors/Lone Geniuses/etc than the average number of non-cranks. I hypothesize that it is because they think doing so will bolster their first impressions and claims. I&#39;ve also heard a lot of people generically slag others with university degrees. I hypothesise that in many cases it&#39;s simply because&#8230; uhh&#8230; they entered a competitive job market without one and had some hunter-gatherer competitive thing going on in their head over it. I intend to invent a machine that will prove these hypotheses AND THEN I WILL SHOW YOU ALL!!!!</p>

		<p>@Daniel @Gabe</p>
<p>I think it is related to the old adage that there is a fine line between genius and madness. Many engineers (and scientists for that matter) are highly creative, and a little bit mad. If we take the example of Tesla, he seemed to be truly brilliant and also a crank. Michael Shermer has a very good talk on this topic (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_shermer_the_pattern_behind_self_deception.html">http://www.ted.com/&#8230;/michael_shermer_the_pattern_behind_self_deception.html</a>), and relates it to the wonder brain drug dopamine. Dopamine is what makes as creative, but too much and your crazy. There is no hard line here though, so a lot of creative intelligent people are also a little bit crazy. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Yeah, um, have fun in your closed little worlds. &nbsp;The crackpots are more fun to hang out with. &nbsp;Long live the stupid! &nbsp;Down with disease!</p>
