		<p>I&#8217;ve also noticed some programs doing things like this, and then showing up off the screen if I change my resolution or change the positioning of my multiple monitors. So, it&#8217;s probably a good idea to make sure that the coordinates you want to restore at are still within the visible area that the user can see.</p>

		<p>If the previous instance is maxed, you can start the next copy in restored mode using the previous coords.  Also, you can restore the previous instance and then continue on with the normal positioning system.</p>

		<p>On a vaguely related note, Windows Explorer has/had a bizarre bug which causes it to open windows with a width of zero! I never figured out how this happened or how to fix it &#8211; for some reason the default size didn&#8217;t get updated even though I kept resizing these zero-width windows using Alt-Space. I can&#8217;t imagine how an ordinary user would cope with invisible windows like that.</p>

		<p>Another issue that has bitten me many times:</p>
<p>The desktop dimensions might have changed.</p>
<p>I have a dual-monitor workstation at work, but I frequently VPN in from home and use Remote Desktop. (single monitor at home)</p>
<p>Consider what happens you start an app in remote desktop, and its former location was on the second monitor.  The form opens so far to the right that it is completely non-visible.  That&#8217;s really irritating!! You have to use the move option on the taskbar, and then use the keyboard arrows to drag the form back over.</p>
<p>Even worse, if the app doesn&#8217;t take this into account with its dialog boxes, you can get modal dialogs on the non-existent monitor.  (Happens with Visio all the time, because Visio tries to remember which monitor to display its dialogs on).<br /></p>

		<p>Several apps I&#8217;ve used will behave strangely if you close them while they are minimized, then reopen them. I assume they&#8217;re using something other than GetWindowPlacement to determine where they were.</p>

		<p>I have the same problem switching between my laptop LCD and my desktop.  Very different resolutions.</p>
<p>Is there any way for an open application to realize the screen has been resized, and that it is now off-screen?</p>

		<p>Some programs use GetWindowPlacement to save the position and then they use SetWindowPos to set it.</p>
<p>Try it with the bar on the top, it&#8217;s funny&#8230;</p>

		<blockquote><p>

<p>WM_DISPLAYCHANGE will tell you this. Although I believe Windows will resize open windows when the user changes resolution.</p>
<p>As far as remembering your window position goes: my code handle this by intersecting the saved rectangle with each of the monitor&#8217;s rectangles. If the saved position doesn&#8217;t overlap any of the monitors, then the program reverts to using CW_USEDEFAULT.

		<p>A pet peeve of mine is the VS.NET + Deskmenu Powertoy combo. I keep a shortcut of Visual Studio .NET on my desktop and use the deskmenu to launch it. Visual Studio always starts in &quot;restored&quot; mode, even if it was maximized when I closed it! Probably Deskmenu uses SW_SHOWNORMAL command and Visual Studio decides to ignore its saved settings. (BTW, Visual Studio 6 did work correctly, this problem started with .NET)</p>
<p>Whose fault is this? Should Deskmenu use SW_SHOW instead, or Visual Studio should ignore the show command?</p>

		<p>Yeah, I see this all the time. It&#8217;s a flaw in the windows user interface in my opinion. (Not the position, but the opening of applications twice)</p>
<p>Naive users, and even me occasionally, click the application icon twice because it just takes too long for the application to show up. And there is hardly any noticable feedback from the windows GUI if a program is lauching.</p>
<p>And an application should only be allowed to open twice if it load&#8217;s two distinct documents, or if the users requests to do so from with the application. And then, yes, you are right, a naive placing policy is not enough.</p>

		<p>I would absolutely LOVE to see two functions added to Win32 or put in some sort of utility library.</p>
<p>CascadeWindowPos( WINDOWPOS *out, WINDOWPOS const *in ) &#8211; Offsets the window down and to the right, or moves it up to the top leftif it&#8217;s out of room.  That would help to solve this problem.</p>
<p>EnsureWindowPosVisible( WINDOWPOS *out, WINDOWPOS const *in, flags ) &#8211; Will ensure that the window is partially visible, full visible, not spanning monitors, et cetera depending on the flags parameter.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>That is, if these functions don&#8217;t already exist.  These would be so wonderfully useful for multimon situations.</p>

		<p>Most of my time goes in maximized windows or fullscreen apps. Atleast when you have the todays standard 1280&#215;1024 display.</p>
<p>Most of the time if the window is not maximized goes in moving it around. So the default should be to open apps in maximized state. Now that we have everything running maxed, it is good time to think how to make the experience better if you need to do work between the apps. The answer obviously is not to restore them to a smaller size to do some drag drop crap.</p>
<p>I would not be surprised if Apple has solved this already.</p>

		<p>Note that if a window has wandered off-screen, you don&#8217;t have to move it all the way back with the keyboard.  Press any arrow key once and then move the mouse.  The window will follow the mouse cursor until you click.  If it happens a lot, remember alt-space, M, arrow, move mouse, click.</p>
<p>Windows will move/resize windows that are on the monitor that changed, but not those out in never land.</p>
<p>Just don&#8217;t window movement and prevent your window from going off-screen at all, ever.  Starting off-screen is bad.  Allowing the user to move the window off-screen is good.  (Virtual desktops!)</p>
<p>And not all corrections are criticism.</p>

		<p>A bit offtopic: </p>
<p>One of the things I really miss in windows is session management, every *nix desktop out there has it, but at work I&#8217;m stuck with win2k and every morning I have to start all the applications I need and move them to the correct monitor, this is quite annoying.</p>
<p>Will there ever be session management in win32 ?</p>

		<p>Aaargh!: Microsoft hasn&#8217;t changed the functionality of its window manager since 1995. That&#8217;s ten years &#8212; more than an eternity in the short-lived world of software. What makes you believe that they will change it in the foreseeable future? How long are you willing to wait?</p>

		<p>&quot;How long are you willing to wait?&quot;</p>
<p>I stopped waiting for a decent windows version shortly after win98 was released, that was the last version of win32 I had installed on my home machine, in a dual-boot config with Linux. I thrashed it when I realized I didn&#8217;t actually use it anymore and I needed the disk-space.</p>
<p>Sadly, I have to use win32 at work, so I would still appreciate it if they would fix their OS, but I&#8217;ve given op the hope it might actually happen.</p>

		<p>I once wrote a desktop utility (a free tool shipped with the drivers for a certain graphics card) that hooked into all desktop apps to provide a few useful things like starting new apps up in their last position. I&#8217;m pleased to say it had that exact feature&#8230; it would iterate through all top-level windows, and if it found one with the same classname and already in the position, it would move window-caption-height pixels to the right and down.</p>
<p>Re the zero-window width thing, I had IE6 doing this to me at home. No matter how many times I resized the window (by dragging window borders) new IE windows kept opening with zero width. Finally my non-technical partner found and used the &quot;Size&quot; command on the window menu and of course only then did IE get the idea&#8230;. wow was she smug! I don&#8217;t know why the WM_SYSCOMMAND made a difference.</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s an app whose annoying behaviour in this regard I often run into.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called &quot;notepad.exe&quot;.</p>
<p>Sigh&#8230;</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s hard to restore the coords correctly. Several &#8216;gotchas&#8217; is mentioned already (minimized window, resolution change, multimonitor, &#8230;). Usually I want to &quot;bounce&quot; the window against any border (and resize it if it&#8217;s larger than the desktop), but it becomes complicated with multimonitor. Function for this should have been included in multimon-api.</p>
<p>And, applications which doesn&#8217;t allow several instances usually do this because it&#8217;s hard to manage shared resources. Not because it is userfriendly in any way. I hate those programs.<br />
<br />The work-around (which works 99% of the time) is to use 2 computers.<br /></p>

		<p>what kills me is, I have my laptop connected to my 21&quot; monitor and use both monitors for designing<br />
<br />but if I turn on the laptop with the other monitor disconnected and open Photoshop, it will sometimes open in the ghost monitor!&#8230; and what&#8217;s worst, I can manage to move that window manually, but when I do &quot;File, Open&quot;, or &quot;File Save&quot;, etc, those open in the ghost monitor!!&#8230; and you can&#8217;t move those windows!&#8230; arrrrgghh&#8230; I have to connect the monitor open every single window in the laptop monitor before I can work in the laptop by itself</p>

		<p>I must be the lone odd egg.  I find I *don&#8217;t* want my window positions anything but what I last set them at.  This includes mutlitple instances of the app displaying over each other.  I also want an app to remember its last state (min/max/normal) and display in that state every time (or as many times) I open it.</p>

<p>Have never heard any complain about &quot;usability problems&quot; with this approach.</p>

		<p>Agree with the comments about apps that don&#8217;t notice when you move from a multi-monitor set-up to a single screen.</p>
<p>I now am used to moving all apps back to the primary display before I shut them down as I can&#8217;t keep track of which ones do not handle this scenario well.</p>

		<p>&quot;So the default should be to open apps in maximized state. Now that we have everything running maxed, it is good time to think how to make the experience better if you need to do work between the apps. The answer obviously is not to restore them to a smaller size to do some drag drop crap. </p>
<p>I would not be surprised if Apple has solved this already.&quot;</p>
<p>&#8216;the answer to do some drag drop crap&#8217; is obviously drag-and-drop the crap onto application button on the taskbar, which causes this application to be put in the front and then you can drop the crap in it wherever you like. On Windows, anyway&#8230; no idea how Apple has solved this, if at all.</p>
