		<p>Freeport is an interesting place &#8212; changed a lot in the past 20 years. Still, if you are ever Down East, take the trip on Route 1 to visit there. Still, some 80% of my clothes are from there (polos, chinos, etc).</p>
<p>Anyway, there&#8217;s always folks who want to call and place orders at 3 AM Christmas morning, &quot;Just to see&quot; if LL Bean is still open. My brother in law is one of them. I wonder if they do it now for cachet rather than need.</p>

		<p>Does anyone know why NPR don&#8217;t provide transcripts? Raymond frequently links to NPR, but it generally takes 30 minutes to listen to something you could read a transcript of in 2 minutes.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Wouldn&#8217;t it be awesome if there were a Web site where you could type &lt;NPR transcripts&gt; and it gave you a link to a page that answered the question <a href="http://www.npr.org/transcripts/" rel="nofollow">Why does NPR charge for transcripts?</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/02/27/1769281.aspx" rel="nofollow">I bet you could make a lot of money with such a service</a>. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Don&#8217;t try to shop in Germany at 3am. You wont find &nbsp;a shop that is opened. There are some supermarkets hard to find &#8211; I think the count is 5 to 8 over the whole country &#8211; that are opened 24h/6d. On Sunday they are also closed.</p>
<p>If you need food go find a fueling station but take enough money with you. However also dont be too suprised if you can only find closed fs.</p>

		<p>Nathan, your brother-in-law needs to understand that the mail-order department is not necessarily the same as the retail store; L. L. Bean does have a significant worldwide market, including in Japan, and so their mail order department needs to be open all hours, not just for cachet.</p>
<p>The store is also open 24 hours, for real, though it&#8217;s pretty sparse most of the time, except near Christmas. I&#8217;ve been there in the wee hours, not often, but they&#8217;re open. In fact, and this may be apocryphyal, I think that the last time they closed was when JFK was shot, for an hour. Possibly also for a power outage, but nowadays they have their own generators &#8212; when the lights are out in town, say at the Starbuck&#8217;s next door, Bean&#8217;s is still up and running. That *may* be for cachet, but a lot of people do like to stop in at late nights in tourist season, on the way to their camp or whatever.</p>
<p>Me, I live about 2.5 miles away. I generally like Bean&#8217;s, but not in daytime in the summer, when Main St. is clogged with tourists on foot and in vehicles. I am wondering why they don&#8217;t just get it over and bulldoze the surrounding neighborhood for parking, and put a in direct exit off the highway. And their recent free concert series (John Hiatt &amp; Shawn Colvin this Saturday) &#8212; nice idea, but now folks have taken to putting their chairs up in front of the stage 3 days before the actual event (as in Thursday morning).</p>
<p>I like living in Freeport, mostly, but summer time can be a trial. Fortunately I can avoid the main drag when I&#8217;m in the car, or bicycle through if need be. </p>
<p>Jeff</p>

		<p>I wonder what if NPR have done any research into the pricing of the transcripts. $3.95 is clearly too much for something in which you have just a casual interest, but would they sell twice as many copies at $2, or 4* more at $1.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t imagine they sell that many at $4/time.</p>

		<p>I go away for a week and the nitpickers corner disappears?</p>
<p>I assume you&#8217;re talking about the LL Bean in Maine in the US.</p>

		<p>For Germany stores are allowed to be opened 8 am to 9pm (until recently was 8pm) and close on Sunday; states can set rules on how often stores can be opened on Sundays as part of special events. &nbsp;Restaurant, bars and bakeries have a different set of rules.</p>
<p>When I moved here 5 years ago they were just switching from hours of 10am to 5pm weekdays and 10am to 2pm on Saturdays.</p>
<p>Gas stations, with mini stores, that are located on the autobahn(highways) are allowed to be open 24/7 and are authorized to only sell essential items. &nbsp;The big question is why are beer and wine considered essential items?</p>

		<p>Will, that&#8217;s not true anymore. While Sundays are still reglemented in Germany most states have adopted the 6&#215;24 model so shops can be open whenever they like, except Sunday. But in practice next to no shops are open after 10pm.</p>
<p>BTW beer IS essential and gas stations are often the only hope for parties running out of &quot;fuel&quot; :-)</p>

		<p>I live in Nashua, NH, and I have friends who&#8217;ve driven to Freeport (about 2 hours from here) at O-Dark-30 in the morning to go to LL Bean, just because it&#8217;s there, it&#8217;s open, and they can. &nbsp;It&#8217;s part of the brand and it&#8217;s cachet.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s certainly easier to go to EMS or REI at the mall, but then you can&#8217;t brag that you bought your item at 3AM.</p>

		<p>Entirely related, is the origin of the word port in computing derived from shipping?</p>
