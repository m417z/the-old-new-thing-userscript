		<p>Ah the luxury of being able to set stretch goals. I get tired of scheduled release dates being utterly unrealistic.</p>

		<p>If stretch goals were given with a set bonus swag/$ associated to them more would get reached. :)</p>

		<p>Is this really just Microspeak anymore? Kickstarter has been using it in what appears to be the same sense, as sort of &quot;extra&quot; goals that they want to accomplish in addition to the basic goals if they receive sufficient extra funding to make it possible. Perhaps the two uses of the term originated independently, maybe Kickstarter borrowed it from Microsoft (former employees?), or perhaps it was a pre-existing term in English that just happened to be rare outside Microsoft. It seems like a sensible enough compound to not just be the second of these three possibilities, but who knows.</p>

		<p>@Brad: that only works if stretch goals = overtime goals.</p>

		<p>I distrust the stretch goals concept since, in my experience, they all too often become the goal.</p>

		<p>Do you think they also use this term in the world of competitive eating?</p>

		<p>@Brad: Or the reverse will happen, because then anyone what to set a stretch goal has to have right on (re)allocating project budget.</p>

		<p>@Robert M. &#8211; but Raymond asked you in the very first sentence to &quot;Recall that Microspeak is not merely for jargon exclusive to Microsoft, but also for jargon that you need to know.&quot;</p>

		<p>Ah, yes, we had these at my last job at department level, usually for a metric that had a number, like 99.9% uptime or 25% increase in signups). We usually met them in the IT department too. Of course, that was the expectation as far as our VP was concerned (the CEO didn&#39;t know that, though. In fact, there was a third, lower goal, which we didn&#39;t even know about, that was reported to the CEO as the &quot;meet&quot; goal)</p>
