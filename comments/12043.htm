		<p>&quot;If I were some European-looking person, I wouldn&#39;t have had as much of a problem because, I&#39;m told, Chinese people naturally assume that if they see a Chinese person on the street, that person speaks Mandarin.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m familiar with that phenomenon, as well. I had a friend here in Tokyo who is actually Canadian, but her parents are Vietnamese, so she looks Asian. Whenever we went anywhere, if I asked a question in Japanese, they&#39;d reply to her, under the assumption that she spoke Japanese (even though I asked the question). Our Japanese skills were actually quite similar, since we were in the same language course (that&#39;s where I knew her from).</p>

		<p>I wish this would happen to me. I look so United-States-ian that people insist on speaking English to me everywhere I go, even when I was in college on a language immersion trip. (I think one of my friends got around the problem by claiming she was Norwegian, which her parents really were&#8211;not that English, IIRC, isn&#39;t a required part of school curriculum there.)</p>

		<p>Back in high school I knew a girl whose mother was of Japanese descent. Apparently that made her look Chinese-enough. When she went to China with her father everybody assumed she was the local tour guide for the American, so they spoke Chinese to her instead of attempting to speak English to her father. Obviously this was a problem because even if she spoke her mother&#39;s language, it&#39;s nowhere near Chinese.</p>

		<p>Quote: &gt;&gt;The air pollution in Beijing is legendary. The week before I arrived, the United States Embassy declared that the Air Pollution Index in Beijing topped 500, earning the rating &quot;Hazardous for all people.&quot;&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>This sentence makes me laugh. You know why?</p>
<p>It&#39;s because in Salzburg, a (relatively) big city in Austria, Chinese tourists often wear a mouthguard (don&#39;t know if the word is right), to protect themselves from pullution or disease-causing agents in the air, I assume. Like on this picture: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.ard.ndr.de/peking2008/land_und_leute/mundschutz100_v-ardgross.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.ard.ndr.de/&#8230;/mundschutz100_v-ardgross.jpg</a></p>

		<p>I love Traditional Chinese much much better although I am a pure PRC. And yes we assume every Chinese looking guy a Chinese. You know, you see thousands of Chinese looking guys passing in front of you everyday, it is an impression strong enough that you cannot easily shake off.</p>

		<p>On being given directions: What&#39;s even worse is that if you ask someone for directions and they don&#39;t know how to get there, they won&#39;t say, &quot;Sorry, I don&#39;t know.&quot; Instead, they&#39;ll make it up and point you in a COMPLETELY wrong direction. Happened to me about a dozen times there.</p>

		<p>Apropos of looking like or not looking like a foreigner, James Fallows of The Atlantic magazine has had an interesting series on his blog for the last couple of months about just this topic.

		<p>Now i&#39;m reminiscing about Beijing &#8211; it&#39;s awesome despite all of the cavaets (confusion and pollution mostly).</p>
<p>I&#39;d have to agree with the above commenter that it seemed like everyone wanted to speak English to me if they could do so at all and refused to let me try to speak Mandarin. Of course it seemed like I met a lot of people who spoke English quite well, and I am a white person &#8211; some of the Asian Americans in our group had a pretty rough go of it I think.</p>

		<p>I am surprised you did not have a colleague as a guide. There are not many city as big as Beijing in terms of population, residents alone, in this world. And consider the history of this city too. If you you are going to explore a large code base with a long history in which people have put in so much changes, and you usually want to get some guidance before you start. Or you&#39;ll at least be missing some interesting stories. In a sense,your blog has been our guide to Windows and telling many interesting stories we would be ignorant of otherwise.</p>
<p>The fact you look Chinese may also gave yourself unfounded confidence that you could get it through alone. My experience, it&#39;ll be much easier to get through a jungle than a crowd where I do not speak their language. As you experience showed, having been grown up in American, you are probably not at an advantageous status of understanding China and Chinese than your non-Asian-looking American folks. By China I mean both the people and place where they make a living on everyday nowadays, and by Chinese I mean the language and history. If you started your trip with that kind of consciousness you would probably have enjoyed your journey more.</p>
<p>Finally, allow me to join your Beijing bash. I always remember it as being gray and cold and avoid going there as much as I can. I did not register in the Tech Ed just because it was in Beijing, even Raymond would be there. Declaimer, I am in Shanghai, so you know how much my comments about Beijing count;-)</p>

		<p>I spent a few months in Taipei once. &nbsp;My Mandarin was pretty meager, but my pronunciation was excellent; so naturally once I opened my mouth people assumed I was fluent. &nbsp;Fortunately, one of the very first things I learned to say was &quot;I can&#39;t speak (much) Mandarin.&quot;</p>

		<p>&gt; The one exception? The character for &quot;car&quot;: 車. The simplified version is 车 which to me is unrecognizable because it destroys the ideographic representation of the top view of a car.</p>
<p>I agree. However, 車 is a graphic representation of a &quot;wagon, carriage&quot;, the original meaning. It hardly resembles a car. In the 20th century, the meaning expanded to include another means of transportation: cars.</p>

		<p>I like to think crowd-sourced mapping projects would mitigate problems like out-of-date maps (read: &lt;a href=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/&quot;&gt;OpenStreetMap&lt;/a&gt;" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/.../a&#038;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.openstreetmap.org/&#8230;/a&#038;gt</a>;), but then you realize that &lt;a href=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2007-03/07/content_821274.htm&quot;&gt;crowd-sourced" rel="nofollow">http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/&#8230;/content_821274.htm&quot;&gt;crowd-sourced</a> mapping is illegal in China&lt;/a&gt;.</p>

		<p>My number one travel tip is to grab a local prepaid SIM card with a data plan and then just use Google Maps religiously the whole trip. I made it around Beijing without knowing a word of Mandarin by using prepaid 80 yuan mobile broadband card and an iPhone. All the locals I spent time with were absolutely amazed that I used the subway &#8211; some girls I met who were from outside of Beijing just used taxis instead of figuring it out, and a guide at the Summer Palace pointed me in the direction of the taxi stand near the exit, and when I said &quot;well the subway is the other direction&quot; she acted as if I was the most impressive person in the world. Also, Google&#39;s maps were very detailed and up-to-date, showing all the subway exists etc.</p>

		<p>Regarding pronounciation of &quot;車&quot;, I think the word sounds close enough in both Mandarin and Cantonese, so people speaking Mandarin shouldn&#39;t misunderstand it. Instead, he probably thinking you&#39;re going to railway station which could be far away.</p>
<p>Just like if you ask and mention &quot;火車&quot; in Hong Kong, most people will just think you&#39;re asking for instruction to get to a KCR station instead of MTR.</p>
<p>Regarding pinyin name of stations, you should probably just go ahead of pronouncing it as if it were English, and let them figure out. If you mentioned &quot;火車&quot; and then the pinyin station name, there could be chance that they can at least tell you how to get to a nearest station. (Since some Metro station&#39;s name does sound similar to railway station, I think this trick wouldn&#39;t always work.)</p>
<p>And if your traval plan works closely with Metro, you should get a metro map from CS counter on the first metro station you visit. Not only they have latest map on Metro expansions, in your case you could just pointing on Metro logo and they should recognise you&#39;re going to take a ride on Metro.</p>

		<p>I had exactly the same problem in Beijing, being unable to ask someone where I was on the map (in fairly well practiced communication-through-mime-and-hand-waving). </p>
<p>In the Forbidden City, if you can (and if they still have it) you *must* listen to the English language commentary by Roger Moore. It&#39;s hilarious; the man was taking the mickey.</p>
<p>Outside Beijing I found hustlers etc weren&#39;t as much of a problem; China has a massive internal tourism industry. Once you&#39;re slightly off the international tourist path it becomes less of an issue.</p>
<p>The only other issue I had in China was ordering meals from my Lonely Planet guide book &#8212; I always got the first thing on the list until I crossed it out.</p>

		<p>The people in sushi restaurants, in America, get mad at me because I look Japanese, but I don&#39;t know how to speak the language. I had one waitress yell at me in Japanese and then refuse to serve me (another waitress was ok with it).</p>
<p>I am not Japanese at all :O.</p>

		<p>@Drizzt: You&#39;ll find Parisians are mostly very happy to try to help you in English &#8211; provided you at least make an effort to try French with them first.</p>
<p>As for the Metro, all you need to know is that directions are given by the station at the end of the line, not &#39;eastbound&#39;, &#39;southbound&#39;, etc as they are in London (and probably elsewhere).</p>

		<p>@Drizzt:</p>
<p>I was in France this summer (first day from northern Germany to Milan, Italy, then ten days from Nice to Lourdes/Gavarnie, then one week through the country to Alps, Switzerland, Alsace, and from there back to Germany), and my general experience was that most people spoke at least some English. Granted, I speak enough French for such a voyage, but the guys I was travelling with don&#39;t, so the French switched to English when they saw their non-understanding looks.</p>
<p>There was exactly one guy deep in the country who spoke only French (&quot;Parlez-vous anglais?&quot; &#8211; &quot;Non. Parlez-vous francais?&quot;), and a girl at our hotel in Lausanne (French part of Switzerland) who preferred German with a sweet French accent over English, but other than that, they all spoke English and were very helpful. The signs were also quite good, most of the time.</p>
<p>We found this kind of funny since we rather expected that they mostly refuse to speak English outside of Paris, but since you got problems exactly there, it seems to be the opposite &#8211; but then, Ian may be right, outside of international tourist places, they&#39;re more helpful if you try some French at first, even if it&#39;s just that your French is not very good.</p>

		<p>@Ian: I noticed this phenomenon when we went to Paris in the summer. At breakfast in the hotel, I would ask a waiter for something in French, and he would reply in English. At a nearby table was a family of Americans, ordering stuff in English &#8230; and none of the waiters would speak anything but French to them.</p>

		<p>@jim: The trick is to speak some /other/ language in France, preferably one that you know reasonably fluently. I personally would go for Hakka, Hokkien (Chinese dialects), or Bahasa Malaysia (Malaysia&#39;s national language) for preference. Chances are either (a) they&#39;d speak English back hoping this horrible foreigner might understand it or (b) they&#39;d reply in the same language, and in both cases you&#39;d be able to communicate just fine.</p>

		<p>Actually, the logo is a monogram of the letters B, G, D</p>
<p>The meaning is left to the reader as an exercise :)</p>

		<p>@Xiaoyin, Raymond: my first thought was indeed that it looked like one of those people-drawn carriages you (used to) see in Hong Kong quite a lot.</p>

		<p>Great post. &nbsp;Reminds me of my trip to Amsterdam, where another American friend and I were standing on a street looking at a map. &nbsp;A very helpful local was walking by, and he stopped, and helped us tremendously, in perfect English. &nbsp;We were impressed.</p>

		<p>Well&#8230; Was it forbidden to bring a GPS into a country?</p>
<p>Even when travelling in Europe, where chance of meeting someone not speaking English is quite low, I always carry a GPS, just to be sure.</p>

		<p>I can&#39;t really say anything about the helpfulness of Parisians. They are generally regarded as being assholes but it may be just an old reputation.</p>
<p>See for instance these ads:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.dailymotion.com/video/xvthi_pub-le-parisien-montage_ads" rel="nofollow">http://www.dailymotion.com/&#8230;/xvthi_pub-le-parisien-montage_ads</a></p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.culturepub.fr/videos/le-parisien-paillasson" rel="nofollow">http://www.culturepub.fr/&#8230;/le-parisien-paillasson</a></p>
<p>(&quot;The Parisian. Better to have it as a newspaper&quot;)</p>
<p>Regarding the directions signs, you have to remember that a lot in France has been made for the cars, so the directions may indeed be unadapted for tourists (If it is really the case in such a touristic city, I agree it is strange!)</p>
<p>Traveling by car, I have always found the directions signs to be helpful and put at the right time. When you cross the border to Spain, you will inevitably doubt at a moment or another because the city name you were following on the directions disappears or isn&#39;t present at a crucial intersection, etc.</p>
