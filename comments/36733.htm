		<p>We call it dirt and smut when celebrities break up and have huge fights (though the zinger from tom Arnold had about having sex with Rosanne being like landing a Boeing 747 in the grand canyon is still a classic) and we complain about how self-centered they are.  And then they whine about the media and we call them hypocrites.  Frankly, I far prefer the Pitt/Aniston kinda breakup to the other one.</p>
<p>Secondly, a lot of &quot;normal&quot; people break up with the same fears about image, and how they&#8217;ll be perceived (especially in cultures where separations still aren&#8217;t the norm).  And a lot of them break up and act like children&#8230;so really we aren&#8217;t any different.</p>
<p>I guess you&#8217;re damned if you do and your damned if you don&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>In a way, it was a joint branding agreement.  As I understand it, the two own a production company together.  This might be the brand they are referring to.</p>
<p>From imdb: &quot;Along with wife Jennifer Aniston and friend Brad Grey, he owns Plan B Entertainment.&quot;</p>

		<p>So how are they going to maintain the brand? Will we be able to select a &#8216;Jennifer Aniston Classic&#8217; skin during movies which will simulate the old version?</p>

		<p>Do you even know that &quot;until death do us part&quot; was a part of their vows?  What kind of ceremony it was?  There are many different forms of marriage besides the Catholic/christian one.  From what I recall, it was a pretty successfully private ceremony with perhaps the only public information being the attendees gleaned from scummy media in helicopters with telephoto lenses.</p>
<p>This off-target railing against divorce seems pretty out of place in an otherwise great technical blog, but I suppose that&#8217;s one of the downsides of following blogs.</p>

		<p>My wife and I never promised &quot;until death do us part&quot; because although we&#8217;d like that we don&#8217;t see any sense in staying married if we come to a point where we could no longer be happy together. Plus we are not religious so we got married in a register office, where any religious text is not allowed.</p>
<p>Divorcing over a major difference is better than trying to paper over it, having children, and making their lives miserable too.</p>

		<p>So, do we need a fantasy Raymond Chen branding opportunity?</p>

		<p>That BBC article is great.</p>
<p>&quot;He added that doctors described the 72-year-old&#8217;s condition as &quot;very serious&quot;. </p>
<p>Followers of the Atkins diet are allowed to eat unlimited meat, eggs, fish and shellfish.&quot;</p>
<p>But just goes to show, no matter how much meat, eggs, and shellfish a person eats&#8230; it doesn&#8217;t do anything for their balance on ice&#8230;</p>
