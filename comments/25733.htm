		<p>@Nathan: That&#8217;s surprisingly one of the most dignified pictures of Bush I&#8217;ve seen in a long time. It seems like he&#8217;s always shown making some sort of odd expression.</p>

		<p>We have a similar paper in the UK, and this reminds me of a story they ran some years ago, shortly after they started&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;World War 2 Bomber Found on Moon!!&quot;</p>
<p>followed the next week by:</p>
<p>&quot;Someone&#8217;s Stolen Our World War 2 Bomber From The Moon!!&quot;</p>
<p>(following numerous astronomers saying &quot;erm, no, there isn&#8217;t a WW2 bomber on the moon at all&#8230;&quot;)</p>

		<p>Now if the &quot;real&quot; tabloids would just follow suit the world might be a better place. &nbsp;On the other hand, the idiots who buy that garbage would still be with us and someone else would step up to fill the void. &nbsp;Sigh. &nbsp;The heat death cannot come soon enough.</p>

		<p>&quot;the idiots who buy that garbage&quot;</p>
<p>WWN is actually really entertaining. &nbsp;It&#8217;s chock full of super-short-story fiction.</p>

		<p>My favorite was the headline reporting that Heaven was full, no more room for souls. A couple of weeks later it was reported that they were wrong &#8211; there was in fact room for 28,317 (or some such absurd number) additional souls in Heaven. Either way, I figure I&#8217;m now out of luck on the Pearly Gates deal.</p>
<p>RIP WWN!</p>

		<p>I remember both the WW2 bomber on the moon and the heaven is full stories from WWN. &nbsp;The former ran an article months later asserting that aliens hid it because &quot;we knew too much.&quot; &nbsp;What about? &nbsp;Who knows.</p>
<p>My personal favorite was an article at least 18 years ago claiming that vampires were going trick-or-treating on Halloween because they were afraid of catching AIDS. &nbsp;There&#8217;s just so much wrong with the idea.</p>

		<p>Although I&#8217;ve not read WWN before, from the headlines posted here I think it is very entertaining&#8230; suitable to good laugh before work.</p>

		<p>I think my all time favorite WWN headline was (I&#8217;m not making this up): &quot;Gay Vampires Spread AIDS, Scientists Say&quot;</p>

		<p>Why wouldn&#8217;t a geologist look at the moon through a telescope? &nbsp;Or Mars? &nbsp;Would it be okay for a geologist to look at a rock through a microscope? &nbsp;The only difference is the matter of scale. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Plenty of geologists look at the pictures of rocks sent back by Mars rovers. &nbsp;It kind of begs the question of whether a microscope attached to a planetary probe is actually a telescope, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Frankly, the whole search for life on other planets seems like entertainment to me, very very expensive entertainment, so I can&#8217;t fault WWN for wanting to get in on the act.</p>

		<p>I would pay a significant amount of money for a CD- or DVD-ROM collection of every WWN issue ever printed.</p>
<p>About fifteen years ago, they reported that a family on North Shore Drive in Vienna, Virginia, was the subject of a lawsuit by neighbors for using a goat to cut their lawn. Can you imagine?! A goat!</p>
<p>Since I happened to live on North Shore Drive, I examined the photo closely and determined the address of the house. I went to the address, which was not the same house, and asked if they owned a goat. They didn&#8217;t. I gave them the paper, and went off to call and annoy the WWN offices.</p>
<p>You have weird ideas of fun when you&#8217;re in your early twenties.</p>
<p>After spending some time on hold, I finally got through to someone who listened to my tale of going to the address and disproving their story. I was placed back on hold. After about &nbsp;half hour, the phone was picked up by someone who listened to my account once more. And that&#8217;s when they earned my eternal respect and admiration.</p>
<p>&quot;We make this stuff up,&quot; he said. &quot;Can&#8217;t you tell?&quot;</p>
<p>We proceeded to laugh for an hour or so about other stories they&#8217;d published, and things he&#8217;d read in reader mail. It was a big phone bill, but I&#8217;ve loved the WWN ever since.</p>
