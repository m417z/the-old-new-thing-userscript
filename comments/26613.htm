		<p>I can&#8217;t help but wonder what would women complain about if all men suddenly started to ignore their sexuality completely?</p>

		<p>the more icky part is that someone can be a vice president of a company and happily state (allegedly) that he &quot;did not like women&quot; and call women who&#8217;s jobs he&#8217;d (allegedly) threatened &quot;[expletive] terrorists&quot;. &nbsp;</p>
<p>dealing with customers who comment on your underwear? &nbsp;That&#8217;s a standard female skill in the patriarchy &#8211; most girls have mastered that one by the age of 10 yrs.</p>

		<p>My company had mandatory compliance training because of some lawsuit and while most of the sessions were on business transactions, one of them was on employee conduct. &nbsp;So in the training there was a question that was something like &quot;Ann wears tight and low-cut clothing to work with a thong and one day Mark says &#8216;Hey, that&#8217;s a sexy thong you have on&#8217;. &nbsp;Ann felt uncomfortable at Mark&#8217;s comment.&quot; &nbsp;The question to us employees was obviously to decide whether Mark&#8217;s comment was inappropriate for the workplace.</p>
<p>Turns out it was not inappropriate. &nbsp;It was apparently her fault for dressing sexy. &nbsp;Who knew?</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m assuming that the compliance training approached the question from a legal standpoint, and there&#8217;s probably legal precedent saying that his comment wasn&#8217;t inappropriate, but I don&#8217;t know for sure)</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Mark says &quot;Hey, that&#8217;s a sexy thong you have on&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course it was not inappropriate &#8212; he was addressing thong rather then her. On the other hand, if he said &quot;Hey, you look sexy in that thong&quot;&#8230;</p>

		<p>I liked this quote from the article:</p>
<p>&quot;Even the fries are listed on the menu as &quot;skinny.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>I never heard of anybody getting offended by thin-cut fries before&#8230; We call them &quot;shoe-string chips&quot; in Australia, parhaps in an attempt to be politically correct?</p>

		<p>&gt; &quot;Ann wears tight and low-cut clothing to work with a thong and one day Mark says &#8216;Hey, that&#8217;s a sexy thong you have on&#8217;. &nbsp;Ann felt uncomfortable at Mark&#8217;s comment.&quot;</p>
<p>Ann knows very well that exposing her underwear to the world is an act of &quot;trolling&quot;. &nbsp;Anyone who fishes understands that you will make a lot of casts before you catch something that you want in your boat. &nbsp;There&#8217;s really no sense being mad *at the fish* if your lure caught its attention and reacts. &nbsp;Either don&#8217;t troll, or don&#8217;t whine about what you catch while trolling; you can&#8217;t have it both ways.</p>

		<p>Last year there was a discussion in the MFC newsgroup about an odd observation that suddenly better results were coming from using MSDN to search MSDN than from using Google to search MSDN. &nbsp;One of the subthreads tangented off into other search subjects, someone observed that the most common search was for panties, and someone else said that panties are on-topic.</p>
<p>How boring.</p>
<p>Well, now this adult-rated blog[*] solves the issue. &nbsp;Panties are off-limits.</p>
<p>Off is better than on, indeed.</p>
<p>Nitpicker&#8217;s corner:</p>
<p>* Yes this is a footnote marker. &nbsp;No I&#8217;m too lazy to search for the article in this blog that observed that some judgement site had assigned this blog an adult rating.</p>

		<p>Igor, I wonder what the world would be like if all women started to really push comments about men&#8217;s sexuality and appearance. :)</p>

		<p>Being too sexy in the workplace is distracting. But I don&#8217;t think anyone has ever actually said anything to me about it.</p>
