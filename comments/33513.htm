		<p>Being ***TOTALLY*** unfamiliar with the Seatle area, It&#8217;s with some trepidation that I comment.</p>
<p>My commute, by bicycle, would be 96 km (50 miles, give or take), each day.  </p>
<p>Even, as a bike fanatic, that would be to much.</p>
<p>So, here&#8217;s the &quot;routine&quot;.</p>
<p>Drive to work Monday morning, with bike in van.</p>
<p>Ride bike home.</p>
<p>Ride back to work Tuesday Morning.  Use Van as bike garage.</p>
<p>Tuesday evening?  It&#8217;s a tailwind home.  Go for it.</p>
<p>Wednesday morning?  Crappy weather. Drive other car.  (you can see where this is going?)</p>
<p>At some point, I&#8217;ve got to get the gas-powered vehicles home, regardless of weather.</p>
<p>Which means riding the bike in &quot;less than bike-friendly&quot; weather.  Although, in the context of Seattle weather, that&#8217;s kind of open-ended.</p>
<p>The nice thing about riding a bike, is that, computer-related problems kind of solve themselves in the background &#8212; (along with a lot of non-computer-related problems).</p>
<p>So, it&#8217;s been a pretty good year.  12000 km on the bicycle. . . (+- 7000 miles (I haven&#8217;t done the exact math)).</p>
<p>Oh, yeah, Thursday. . .  rinse, repeat.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a busy day.   But Old New Thing is on my &quot;must do&quot; list.</p>
<p>It has been, and hopefully, will continue to be an educational experience.</p>
<p>Thanks to Raymond, and the host of intelligent commenters!</p>

		<p>Just to add a fourth possibility:</p>
<p>1) Left off the trail after the bridge onto 118th, continue until it intersects with 112th (there&#8217;s a turn in there), on 112th to NE 12th, right on 12th, left on 116th, right on Northup, left on 24th, take the 520 trail about halfway up the hill.</p>
<p>Of all of them, blue is the best, though I recommend going over to 164th on Main rather than Lake hills. I don&#8217;t know where the &quot;Extremely hazardous intersection&quot; part at Bel-red came from. Traffic is fast, but the sightlines are absolutely great, and I&#8217;ve never even had anything remotely close happen here. When going onto campus, aim for cutout slightly to the west of the crossing. </p>
<p>Anybody who think that 24th to 156th and then 156th north is better, is, to put it charitably, brain-dead. </p>

		<p>The hazard assessment is mine. That crossing freaks me out.</p>

		<p>I guess I don&#8217;t understand &#8211; are you crossing a road, using a road or *shudder* using a crosswalk? I&#8217;ve seen all 3 around downtown.</p>

		<p>Zoom in on marker D5 to see the crossing. No crosswalk, no traffic light, high speed cross-traffic&#8230;</p>

		<p>If I were you, I&#8217;d turn left on 24th st, then go up 156th ave. That crossing is a disaster waiting to happen.</p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t there a rumour about always booking you and a couple of the other SDEs on separate airplanes to avoid the hit-by-a-bus scenario? This seems to be begging for it.</p>

		<p>When the Cascade Bicycle club runs routes along 164th (the blue route) they go right on 30th, left on 176th, and left on 40th to get up to the Microsoft campus. Lots of extra downhill on 30th and uphill on 40th that way, but it avoids the dreaded intersection.</p>
