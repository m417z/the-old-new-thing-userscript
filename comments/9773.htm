		<p>It is not that we refuse to upgrade from Windows XP; it is that, while people still use Windows XP, and it is still supported by Microsoft, we have to make the software we develop work on it too. After 2014, this will not be an issue anymore.</p>

		<p>Before reading the post, I was thinking that the Recycle Bin folder is specially managed as the logging file system, so that it can have items with the same name and path. But it seems that I was wrong.</p>

		<p>Yep, that&#39;s a lot of trouble. &nbsp;I just ignore the recycle bin most of the time. &nbsp;I delete things to the recycle bin, but I clear it out several times a day. &nbsp;Seeing trash in the recycle bin is mildly annoying.</p>
<p>As for Windows XP, I know a lot of companies that plan to wait until 2013 or 2014 and then upgrade to Windows 7. &nbsp;Some of my relatives will likely do the same thing (but most of them are on Windows 7 already). &nbsp;I have mostly moved to Windows 7 on my 5 main computers, but I keep XP around in a virtual machine for testing things that my customers use.</p>

		<p>Actually, it is a refusal to upgrade by our IT administrator, rather than by me. &nbsp;Not that our IT guy has any sort of coherent reason to ban Windows 7 and Vista (this is the same guy that blocked IMAP access to our corporate email from our PCs inside the building because he thinks the web client is &quot;very nice&quot;).</p>
<p>In the end, Cesar nailed things on the head though &#8212; as long as OUR customers use XP, we have to write software than runs under XP. &nbsp;As nice and cool as the new APIs are, they are irrelevant until our customer base migrates.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>That&#39;s fair. In the past, though, I get flamed for not providing Windows XP ways of doing things as if it no right-thinking person would run anything else. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Alternative solution, which is less efficient but I doubt it matters much for this kind of thing, is to use the Shell32 library object model which does the same thing under the hood, but it makes your code shorter because you don&#39;t have to do all the management yourself:</p>
<hr />
<p>Private Sub Form_Load()</p>
<p>Dim S As New Shell32.Shell, I As FolderItem2</p>
<p>With S.NameSpace(ssfBITBUCKET)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Caption = .Title</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;For Each I In .Items</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;List1.AddItem I.Path &amp; &quot; = &quot; &amp; _</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I.ExtendedProperty(&quot;{9B174B33-40FF-11D2-A27E-00C04FC30871}2&quot;) &amp; _</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;&quot; &amp; I.Name</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Next</p>
<p>End With</p>
<p>End Sub</p>
<hr />
<p>Visual Basic code because I can&#39;t be arsed to write C++ GUI code for a reply to a blog post. To test, draw a widish listbox on the form.</p>
<p>P.S. Thanks for providing XP compatible code, Raymond, it is appreciated.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  so it&#39;s possible that they are looking at their problem the wrong way.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;d say &quot;probable&quot; !</p>
<p>I look upon the recycle bin as being something that&#39;s there for the user, and is not an application programmer&#39;s concern.</p>
<p>If the file that&#39;s being deleted &quot;belongs to the user&quot;, then use the API that might put the file in the recycle bin, depending on the user&#39;s preferences, and forget about it. &nbsp; If the file that&#39;s being deleted is some internal application thing that shouldn&#39;t end up in the recycle bin, then don&#39;t use the API that might put the file in the recycle bin. &nbsp;How hard is that?</p>
<p>Even if an app can reliably purge its own file from the recycle bin after putting it there, that&#39;s not always an operation without side-effects. &nbsp;The recycle bin is limited in total capacity.</p>

		<p>AC&#39;s simple method easily demo&#39;d from (gasp) vbscript (thus requiring only notepad):</p>
<p>option explicit</p>
<p>const ssfBITBUCKET = 10</p>
<p>dim sh, item, s</p>
<p>set sh = createobject (&quot;shell.application&quot;)</p>
<p>s = &quot;&quot;</p>
<p>with sh.nameSpace (ssfBITBUCKET)</p>
<p>&nbsp; for each item in .items</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;s = s &amp; item.Path &amp; &quot; = &quot; &amp; _</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; item.ExtendedProperty(&quot;{9B174B33-40FF-11D2-A27E-00C04FC30871}2&quot;) &amp; _</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;&quot; &amp; item.Name &amp; vblf</p>
<p>&nbsp; next</p>
<p>&nbsp; msgbox s,, .title</p>
<p>end with</p>
<p>wscript.quit</p>

		<p>@TC: That happened because this blog doesn&#39;t have a concept of line breaks (as opposed to paragraph breaks). The reason for this is probably that most of the replies are prose, and people press enter a variable number of times when all they really want is a paragraph break. Just be happy our spaces are preserved.</p>

		<p>And another bug in Windows 7: Custom Recycle Bin icons for full and empty do not refresh automatically, only the default icons do. You have to either refresh manually or tweak the registry to fix it.</p>
