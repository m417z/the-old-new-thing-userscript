		<p>And, of course, there is the behaviour of the Unix &quot;ls&quot;, which when redirected (or piped) automagically switches from using several columns to a &quot;one file per line&quot; mode.</p>

		<p>On UNIX, well Linux at least, console output is also buffered, the buffer is flushed when a newline is output.</p>
<p>Makes things interesting when you&#8217;re using good old printf debugging if you don&#8217;t put &quot;n&quot;&#8217;s on all your debugging output.</p>

		<p>Well, good to know all that, but what would a user do in the following situation:</p>
<p>&#8211; He wants to have the output (both stdout and stderr) redirected to a file, but in the same order the statements would appear on the console</p>
<p>&#8211; The software is not open source, he doesn&#8217;t have the source code, and he is not skilled enough to patch a binary</p>
<p>What would he do? (When using Unix/Linux vs. when using Windows)</p>

		<p>Anonymous &#8212; that&#8217;s because /bin/ls does an &quot;if(isatty(1))&quot; while deciding how to format its output.</p>
<p>If its stdout (file-handle 1) is a TTY, then it uses several columns. &nbsp;If not, it uses one. &nbsp;(This is so you don&#8217;t have to remember to &quot;ls -1&quot; every time you need to redirect the output. &nbsp;You can if you want to, but if stdout is a pipe or a normal file, then it won&#8217;t make any difference.)</p>

		<p>[sorry if this is repeated. I&#8217;m pretty sure the last submit failed, but &#8230; who knows.]</p>
<p>bramster: The same way you do it on an old bourne-compatible shell on UNIX:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;command &gt; output_file 2&gt;&amp;1</p>
<p>I tested this on cmd.exe on XP SP2 and it works fine. Here&#8217;s the test program I used, which produced identical output in the target file and on the console (and worked correctly with redirections of just stdout or just stderr).</p>
<p>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</p>
<p>int main() {<br />
<br />    using namespace std;<br />
<br />    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;This is on stdout&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;<br />
<br />    cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;This is on stderr&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;<br />
<br />    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;This is also on stdout&quot;;<br />
<br />    cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;this is also on stderr&quot;;<br />
<br />    cout &lt;&lt; endl;<br />
<br />    cerr &lt;&lt; endl;<br />
<br />    return 0;<br />
<br />}</p>
<p>I guess the NT POSIX system has some nice legacy lying around. I wonder what I can do with passing file descriptors around etc&#8230;</p>

		<p>Reading this made me realise why trace output to an output file wasn&#8217;t writing&#8230; bloody Flush()!</p>

		<p>Craig, I think it worked that way because of your use of &#8216;endl&#8217; which I believe causes the buffer to be flushed. &nbsp;If you had used &quot;n&quot; instead, your output might have been subjected to the buffering rules.</p>

		<p>When you output your debug statements (stderr and stdout, in Java which is System.err and System.out respectively) to a file, do take I/O buffering into consideration. You may not see your output lines in the sequence you expect if your program is perfor</p>

<p>Well, thank you both, but I thought there were an easy way to do so (since the task at hand sounds real simple), but sometimes the easy sounding tasks end up causing the headache &#8230;<br />
  <br />I don&#8217;t have (at the moment) a program at hand where the order of redirected output would matter to me, but from time to time it would be so very useful to have an easy way. Maybe Monad could tackle this problem, please?<br />

		<p>You&#8217;re bringing back fun memories of my VLSI class. &nbsp;We used a wonderfully-outdated design tool called Magic, and ran simulations using P-Spice. &nbsp;Great for learning how things really work, but a bit removed from how VLSI design is really done these days.</p>

		<p>BSD3-derived Unix variantes provide pseudo ttys that are a cross between a pair of pipes and a tty. It&#8217;s how xterm etc. work for instance. There is also a utility called &quot;script&quot; which does just what rolfhub wants. Note that it is not a good idea to use &quot;script&quot; to work out which control codes &quot;vi&quot; uses. Fortunately my Comp. Sci. professor shall remain nameless as I have forgotton.</p>

<p>Well, I&#8217;ve read the manpage, and it looks quite useful, especially:<br />
  <br />&#8212;[from man script]&#8212;<br />
  <br />-c COMMAND<br />
  <br />Run the COMMAND rather than an interactive shell. This makes it easy for a script to capture the output of a program that behaves differently when its stdout is not a tty.<br />

  <br />&gt; &quot;vi&quot; uses. Fortunately my Comp. Sci. professor shall remain nameless as I have<br />
  <br />&gt; forgotton.</p>
<p>The manpage seems to have improved since then ;-)<br />
  <br />&#8212;[from man script]&#8212;<br />
  <br />Certain interactive commands, such as vi(1), create garbage in the typescript file.<br />
  <br />&#8212;[/from man script]&#8212;</p>
<p>Thank you for the info. Now, if anyone knows an equivalent for windows, that would be cool, too.<br />
