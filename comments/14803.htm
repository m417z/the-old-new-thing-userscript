		<p>I&#8217;ll agree that the existence of a Twinkie-bagel is a crime against cuisine, but I can see the line of thought that went into it &#8211; the prior product wasn&#8217;t convenient enough.</p>
<p>It still required someone to unwrap the product, use a microwave to thaw the bagel, open a container, and use an awkward tool to combine the bagel with cheese. It also meant that you were paying things you might not use (like the cream cheese/knife, if you wanted jam instead), and produced additional garbage.</p>
<p>This cuts the number of required steps to just two (unwrap and microwave) and benefits the environment; admittedly it removes customer choice, but if it proves successful I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;ll be plenty of new flavours, like Butter, Butter + Cheese, Strawberry Cream Cheese, and Lox.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve always thought the most offensive food product was Combos. Mostly because they look like dog food. And taste like&#8230; dog food.</p>
<p>These bagel-loafs, though&#8230; wow.</p>

		<p>@ alt-92: &quot;Then why buy the damn thing in the first place?&quot;</p>
<p>Convenience? Portion control? Only bagel-related product visible on the shelf? I haven&#8217;t the foggiest notion &#8211; I&#8217;m trying to think like the brains behind the product, and I&#8217;m not sure they&#8217;ve considered who the potential market for this product is in the first place.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s students. Certainly the new product has more in common with typical (high school / college) student fare than an actual bagel.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know about you, but I bought my bagels from delis and bakeries (depending on whether they were prepared for me or toasted at home) in college and high school. This thing is a crime against humanity.</p>

		<p>How is this any different from frozen pancakes or waffles? Those products are not nearly as good as the real thing, but they are still popular.</p>
<p>Admittedly, these will probably be terrible, but it&#8217;s not a particularly new concept.</p>

		<p>I agree with benjamin. &nbsp;Granted Combos DO look like dog food, but they are delicious.</p>
<p>Anyway, I think this whole thing is a slippery slope. &nbsp;Anything not 100% natural could be construed as an &#8220;offense against nature&#8221;. &nbsp;If you want to get crazy, one could argue that shipping foodstuffs or ingredients thereof via mechanized freight is an offense against nature as it produces large quantities of CO2.</p>
<p>Ultimately I think the point you are trying to make is that there is no accounting for taste (in both senses of the word). &nbsp;I used to feel like you, but a long time ago I realized that people like what they like no matter what you think; why waste your time being bothered by it?</p>

		<p>&quot;one could argue that shipping foodstuffs or ingredients thereof via mechanized freight is an offense against nature as it produces large quantities of CO2.&quot;</p>
<p>And one would be quite wrong in a lot of surprising ways. Take tomatoes. It costs 4 times more energy to grow them here in Denmark than letting the Spanish grow them and then truck the results north.</p>
<p>Some purists will argue that we should only eat what can be naturally grown in the immediate area, to which I say: come to Denmark and we will happily feed you our &quot;natural&quot; products. After a week on beets, barley-porridge and pig-products (no, not just pork, everything but the squeal) I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll see why tomatoes are necessary&#8230;</p>

		<p>I suppose it&#8217;s wrong to comment that we buy these, and they are not half bad. &nbsp;I can toss one from the freezer in the bag when I leave for work, and it&#8217;s thawed out enough to pop in the toaster oven when I arrive.</p>
<p>The significant advantage is that they are &quot;self contained&quot;. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t always want bagels and cc, so if I take the ingredients to work, they might go bad before I finish them (the bagels, anyway). &nbsp;With these, they can live in the freezer until I decide I want one that morning, and I have no waste.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m branded a &quot;dumb&quot; consumer for such a purchase, oh well. &nbsp;I.d rather say these are marketed to &quot;undecided, non-committal,lazy bagel eaters&quot;. &nbsp;I&#8217;m in that camp.</p>

		<p>@John: Don&#8217;t take it so seriously. We aren&#8217;t saying this is literally damaging to nature, but rather that we are thumbing our noses at the natural when we produce and consume products like this.</p>
<p>I call people who put butter on bagels heretics, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I believe they are literally violating the laws of god or their religious hierarchy.</p>

		<p>If you want to go absurd with the &quot;natural&quot; angle, I&#8217;ll say that apples are not natural because they were bred by humans to look and taste the way they do. Along with, I suppose, just about every other fruit and vegetable and animal we eat.</p>

		<p>The bigger problem with bagels isn&#8217;t these Kraft monstrosities &#8211; they&#8217;re probably based on the something very similar to those things you might find in a grocery store which for some reason are called bagels, but in fact are just dinner rolls shaped like donuts.</p>
<p>The only place I&#8217;ve found in the Seattle Eastside that sells something that can truly be called a bagel is Mikie&#8217;s Brooklyn Bagel in Redmond. If anyone knows of another place in the Seattle area that has real bagels, I&#8217;d appreciate hijacking this thread so you can let me know (I hope Raymond won&#8217;t mind, but if he does, he has the awesome moderating power to fix my transgression &#8211; and good, true bagels are worth the risk of angering &#8216;He Who Should Not Be Nitpicked&#8217;).</p>
<p>Oh man &#8211; a Mikie&#8217;s bagel with cream cheese and some paper-thin hot coppa from the Thriftway that used to be Larry&#8217;s&#8230; Heaven.</p>

		<p>I went to Blazing Bagels (in Redmond, near Marymoor) once and it was incredibly disappointing. &nbsp;The bagels were so stale, it was almost literally stunning. &nbsp;It seems they bake the bagels, let them sit for 1-2 days, and then sell them.</p>

<p>Stale bagels are a sign of GOOD bagels.</p>
<p>The crap round-squishy-roll bagels never get stale. Same as most bread, they stay soft and pliant for weeks.</p>
<p>A real bagel (vanishingly rare in New York now; you may never have seen one) turns into cement in about a day. Bakers now shorten or even eliminate the boiling part of bagel preparation, and the results are more breadlike and remain edible for a few days.</p>
<p>If you find a place with stale bagels, just ask if they have any fresh ones, or which are freshest.</p>

		<p>I may be just a stupid non-American, but what exactly is wrong with these Bagel-fuls? Do they taste bad? Are they sold frozen and must be heated/toasted before eating? Anything else?</p>

		<p>Being the sort of person who thinks that putting fruit in bagels (or in cream cheese, for that matter) is a crime against humanity, I am ashamed to admit that I have actually discovered Bagel-fuls in my very own freezer. When I confronted my wife about this, all she had to say in her defense was that the blueberry flavor isn&#8217;t as good as the cinnamon flavor.</p>
<p>The bagel shop I grew up going to had products with the same dough prepared in the same way, only different shapes &#8212; sticks, round without holes, pretzels &#8212; but the only ones labeled bagels were the ones with a hole in the middle. As for the toroidal rolls, I can imagine that they call them bagels because they are round and have a hole in the middle. However Bagel-fuls are not round, have no hole in the middle, and are not really even rolls. I&#8217;m certainly willing to bet they&#8217;re not boiled. So what makes them a bagel? The fact that they have cream cheese in them?</p>

		<p>No, the worst offense against nature is the cheeseburger in a can.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://gizmodo.com/351304/cheeseburger-in-a-can-reviewed" rel="nofollow">http://gizmodo.com/351304/cheeseburger-in-a-can-reviewed</a></p>
<p>First, they&#8217;re awful (McD&#8217;s is better). Second, they&#8217;re pricier than your local fast food joint. Third, you can get a freshly made one that tastes better practically anywhere. Even if it&#8217;s McD&#8217;s.</p>
<p>These really have no reason to exist. Not even a convenience reason.</p>

		<p>Raymond, you make me smile with these posts. I second the Uncrustables comment as being the worst. You can&#8217;t even take the time to take the crust off of your own sandwich?!?!?! Besides, I used to save the crust for last, and enjoy the best for last.</p>

<p>If you going to refer to the holy goodness that is chocolate chip pancaked wrapped &nbsp; around a sausage you need to include that coup de gr&#226;ce of dipping it in baconnaise (mayo mixed with bacon) as Jon Stewart suggests.</p>

		<p>Jim Gaffigan does an entire bit about &quot;hot pockets&quot; that seems applicable here.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#8217;ve never eaten a Hot Pocket and then afterwards, been, &#8216;I&#8217;m glad I ate that.&#8217;&quot;</p>

		<p>Gabe: &quot;I put butter AND cream cheese on my bagels. Am I a heretic?&quot;</p>
<p>Yuck.</p>
