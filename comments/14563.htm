		<p>Random832 is correct: the creation/modification timestamps on the file can be changed by copying, or they can be inaccurate due to the filesystem on which the module is stored.</p>
<p>With respect to rebasing, I would say it does modify the timestamp. &nbsp;I believe the export records are stored in RVA format (relative to the load address), but the cached export address would need to be resolved (base+offset) in order for binding to work. &nbsp;If rebasing didn&#8217;t update the timestamp, binding to the rebased DLL would result in undefined behavior.</p>
<p>And even if I&#8217;m wrong about why, my answer still stands: I just rebased a DLL and it changed the timestamp.</p>
<p>P.S. &nbsp;I find it awesome how you threaten your readers &nbsp;with the nitpicker&#8217;s corner. &nbsp;:)</p>

		<p>The baseaddress is stored in the DLL itself, so if you re-base (static, not run-time), it would modify the file last modified time.</p>
<p>Should it modify the internal timetamp ? Well, are the function pointers all relative to the base address, ya ? Thus the offsets shouldn&#8217;t change &#8212; they are the same, since only the base changed.. So maybe not..</p>

		<p>You dont want to be dependant on the file last accessed date time for more reasons(compression that might optimize this away for instance)</p>
<p>The header is updated when you rebase, actually we found that out accidentally this week as that header timestamp is also used to resolve modules stored in our symbol server, and it found nothing. Moving rebase upstream in our build process solved that&#8230;</p>
<p>But this then means that rebasing a dll will cause the loop to check the entire export table.</p>

		<p>timestamp is stored in the header because the filesystem timestamp can change when a file is copied. &nbsp; Also FAT had (has?) a 2 second granularity.</p>
<p>Rebaseing makes the binding invalid so it should update the timestamp.</p>
<p>How does binding work on Vista and Win7 (with ASLR)? &nbsp;Is it disabled?</p>

		<p>Tiemstamp is stored in the header for the reasons mentioned by several people (that the file timestamp can change independently of the file contents), but a more important principal (I think) is that the timestamp stored int he header need not be a timestamp &#8211; as Raymond said, it&#8217;s just a key to indicate that the DLL being linked to at runtime is the same (at least as far as the imports are &nbsp;concerned) as when the importing module was linked. </p>
<p>Even though the field is called &#8216;TimeDateStamp&#8217; it could just as easily be any reasonable hash or key that might uniquely identify a particular build of the DLL &#8211; at least for the purposes of the optimization discussed in the article &#8211; there may be other uses for the field that require it to be a timestamp.</p>

		<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/12/04/9932270.aspx" rel="nofollow"></a> The memcmp() trick was worth mentioning because people actually do this, or rather, they do something equivalent but a bit smarter.</p>
<p>Suppose you have a big system running a dozen VMs. And although the VMs aren&#8217;t strictly identical, for the usual support reasons they&#8217;re as similar as they can be. All six run the same version of the OS, and if several run the same application, that&#8217;s probably the same version too. So &#8220;hardware&#8221; page 0x45e0000 in VM #1 may be identical to page 0x4390000 in VM #6</p>
<p>In this scenario (which is common and becoming more so) you get a huge saving in physical RAM from having a mechanism in the hypervisor (or in the OS supporting the hypervisor, in this case typically a Linux distribution) which can coalesce these pages. The strategy is to track pages which change infrequently and to keep hashes of their contents. If two pages have the same hash, there&#8217;s an excellent chance they&#8217;re identical, and you should memcmp() them and coalesce any that match.</p>
<p>Of course once someone had this working for an extreme scenario where it&#8217;s the only option (VMs) people began experimenting to see how effective it is on an ordinary desktop OS. Raymond describes one way that two applications can end up with identical pages that can&#8217;t be caught by traditional COW, but there are countless others. The RAM saving is modest but significant.</p>
<p>One day everybody&#8217;s ordinary PC may do this. Or, with RAM getting ever cheaper, perhaps only big VM farms will care.</p>

		<p>I thought this is relevant:</p>
<p>‘BIND.EXE is the most well-known way to bind an executable. However, it optimizes your executables based upon your system DLLs. If you distribute your program to users, they probably will have different system DLLs, so you&#8217;ll want to bind your executables on their system. The Windows Installer has the BindImage action, which looks pain-free to use (although I must confess I&#8217;ve never written an installation script). Alternatively, you can use the API BindImageEx that&#8217;s part of IMAGEHLP.DLL.’</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know if it changes the timestamp but rebasing does not break PDBs.</p>
<p>At least, we have a rebase step in our release build process that happens after the PDBs are generated and the PDBs still seem to work.</p>
<p>I expect that either:</p>
<p>1) Each PDB stores offsets relative to the module&#8217;s base address</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>2) The PDB stores absolute addresses as well as the original base address (so you can calculate the offset).</p>
<p>It must do something like that or PDB symbols would be useless with processes which had to move a DLL at load time.</p>
<p>(There&#8217;s no guarantee that a DLL&#8217;s prefered address range will be free. Rebasing can effectively happen at runtime as well as at build time.)</p>
