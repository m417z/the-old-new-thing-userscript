		<p>Wow, that Communicator Team one really had me confused. &nbsp;&quot;IM an Expert for Lync Server 2010 can help connect experts in an organization&#8230;&quot; &nbsp;You are an expert? &nbsp;Why the missing apostrophe? &nbsp;And why the bad syntax and capitalization? &nbsp;Oh, I get it, it&#39;s talking about something called &quot;IM an Expert&quot; where &quot;IM&quot; is a verb and the whole thing is a program title, hence it&#39;s a noun phrase. &nbsp;Wow. &nbsp;My verbal parser just exploded.</p>
<p>Would have been much better to write something like &quot;The &quot;IM an Expert for Lync Server 2010 program&quot; can help &#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>David &nbsp;</p>

		<p>A couple of links down I ran into another instance of reported Schrödenbug (the guy encountering them logged it as Heisenbug because he doesn&#39;t know what it is). The biggest &quot;what if&quot; I can imagine for us is &quot;what if Schrödenbug is real?&quot;</p>

		<p>David: It doesn&#39;t help that it&#39;s pronounced the same as &quot;I am an Expert for Lync Server &#8230;&quot;</p>

		<p>@Mike: It&#39;s not, you pronounce it /aɪ ɛm/ (am is /əm/, or maybe /æm/). Although this might be one of those clever written puns that just flies over my head because US speakers use only two vowel sounds.</p>

		<p>Wow, those comments on the &quot;how to file a Visual C++ bug&quot; are &#8230; amazing.</p>
<p>I filed a bug against the free version of Visual C++ once, which was, &quot;This 20 lines of C++ code throws this error and here is why I think the C++ standard says it should work, and if I put in this illegal-by-the-C++-standard workaround, it seems to work but then of course it doesn&#39;t work in my other compilers.&quot;</p>
<p>And I got a response along the lines of, &quot;Yup, we agree: That&#39;s a bug. &nbsp;The code that implements that stuff is intricate and horrid to try to fix bugs in without creating worse bugs, and this is clearly a deep corner case, so this is a wontfix &#8212; sorry.&quot; &nbsp;Which, considering the context, seemed entirely reasonable to me &#8212; I mean, I work for a compiler company, and I *know* how grotty C++-template-parsing code gets, and what kind of support we&#39;re able to give our non-paying users. &nbsp;I really appreciated that the support engineer took the time to confirm that it was a bug, and gave me a clear answer about whether I could expect a fix or would have to depend on my workaround as a permanent thing.</p>
<p>Anyhow, thanks for the links!</p>

		<p>I like how the User Guidelines document contains links to the author&#39;s desktop. They should include that in the next edition: &quot;Make sure hyperlinks point to something accessible by the user.&quot;</p>

		<p>Who is pmcrae and why do the links in the UX guide all point to his (non-existant) user space on my C drive? &nbsp;(such as &quot;effective resolution&quot; on page 9)</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, the one VC++ bug that would bite us occasionally, we could never report. &nbsp;Under some rare circumstances, it seems like the preprocessor or lexical analyzer would back up one character, so a line like:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;foo = bar;</p>
<p>might end up being treated like:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;foo = baar;</p>
<p>It only happened mid-way down some large file or other. &nbsp;Our solution was that if the build broke because of it, we would add a long comment to the line before, to move the bug into the comment. It still worries me that it might have hit a spot in the code (like a minus sign!) where it would have compiled bad code silently. Looking back, I should have checked the preprocessed file to see if the problem was there.</p>
<p>Is there place I can go to look at fixed bugs to see if it got fixed in VS 2008 or 2010? From the searching I&#39;ve done, I think I&#39;m only seeing the highlights, and this is a minor obscure one.</p>

		<p>The difference between QFE and GDR is meaningless post-XP because you can&#39;t choose which branch gets installed.</p>
