		<p>Wow, that&#8217;s quite a sophisticated bit of programming for a demo!   But I fully understand the motivation.</p>

<p>Did you press Ctrl+C to prevent the output of &#8216;p&#8217;? :-)</p>

		<p>&#8220;Raymond Chen is wrong&#8221; is a series of words I never use, but I think this is one of those cases.</p>
<p>To be frank, I&#8217;ve never learned a single thing of lasting value from any demo that went &#8220;as intended,&#8221; because *NOTHING* in the real world ever works as intended; that&#8217;s why most people want live demos, so they can see what goes wrong and how to recover.</p>
<p>If you want something that works perfectly every single time, you can just play back a recorded video.</p>
<p>(This is also why I enjoy watching Defrag Tools demos &#8212; something is always going wrong, but they always find a way to recover and get back on track!)</p>

		<p>It depends on the demo and the problem.  For sales demos, you definitely do want to see what can go wrong (and ask for more details about those things).  For training demos, if something occurs that can&#8217;t be resolved, or too much time is wasted on it, then the time was just wasted.</p>

		<p>Yes, but&#8230;<br />
TechReady presentations last an hour and a quarter, and have a very sophisticated audience (Microsoft technical field employees, with most of those attending this session likely expecting a top notch &#8220;Raymond Chen&#8221; -quality presentation).  It&#8217;s hard to recover from a hard glitch during a short presentation, and, when you do, you end up having to slice off the last 10-15 minutes of your presentation &#8211; which will often result in key points being missed.<br />
I&#8217;ve done lots of technical presentations.  But, I was never as prepared as I was before my TechReady talk.  There were two of us.  We had two laptops that we could have used, our own little network so we didn&#8217;t rely on anything out of our control, and we had backup strategies for our backup strategies.<br />
Because everyone works for the same company, there&#8217;s an understanding in the room that glitches happen.  But, your eval scores can go down pretty quickly if you can&#8217;t make the points you set out to make.</p>

		<p>For the presentation I wrote this app for, I had only 15 minutes. There was very little time available to recover from any hiccups.</p>

		<p>It may be both fun and educational to watch someone else struggle to recover from a broken demo.</p>
<p>But would you want to be the guy behind the podium investigating some weird problem you&#8217;ve never seen before in front of a live audience?</p>
<p>Actually, this does sound like it could be an interesting game-show-like-thing.  How fast can you figure out what&#8217;s wrong after someone else intentionally sabotages you?  But it seems like it would work a lot better if the whole audience was in on it, or at least had some basic familiarity with the software stack so they can follow along.</p>

		<p>You probably meant Framework 2.0 or CLR 2.0, rather than C# 2.0, because IIRC extension methods were introduced with C# 3.0.</p>
