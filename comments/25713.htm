		<blockquote><p>
  &gt; For some reason, traffic is significantly worse on sunny days.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Funny, here is the opposite! (and the reason is understandable.. if you take a bus you&#8217;d probably have to walk a bit and under the rain&#8230;.)</p>

		<p>In Atlanta, the traffic is notorious for being worse in rain. &nbsp;The two philosophies seem to be, &quot;There isn&#8217;t any problems with wet roads which can&#8217;t be solved by driving faster and closer together,&quot; and, &quot;instant idiots, just add water.&quot;</p>

		<p>I live north of Seattle (north of Bothell), and the traffic is way worse running north/south when it rains. &nbsp;Maybe it is just my luck :)</p>

		<p>clip-on sungalsses = &nbsp;bad design</p>
<p>The Rayomnd suffers problem created by bad desing = looses clip-ons from normal carryingplace. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Raymond replaces bad design with identical bad design rather than solving the problem but upgrading the sun-protection design. &nbsp;Or have you simply not informed this nit-picker of the preventative steps you&#8217;ve taken to overcome this design inadeaucy?</p>
<p>Admittedly reactalite glasses often react rather slowly, &nbsp;too slowly for diring into a tunel, &nbsp;but they may reduce your replacement costs&#8230;. &nbsp;&#8230;and maybe they&#8217;ve been made more responsive since I last purchased a pair&#8230;</p>

		<p>Wendy, for a nit-picker, you sure make a lot of mistakes. I counted at least 11.</p>
<p>Btw Raymond &#8211; &quot;Traffic across the 520 bridge during the evening rush is always a disaster&quot; &#8211; could have phrased that better, really &#8211; we must remain politically correct! :-)</p>

		<p>I had the expensive clip-ons for my glasses disappear as well. They were the &quot;rare-earth magnets on the hinges&quot; type. I had my visor up and turned my head to make a lane change and the airstream just sucked them right off.</p>
<p>I replaced them with clip-ons where there&#8217;s a claw at each corner and the temple is spring-loaded so you pull them apart to release them.</p>

		<p>So did you see Harry in IMAX 3D? That&#8217;s WELL worth hunting down an IMAX theatre, and I&#8217;m probably going again since that&#8217;s something you&#8217;re not going to ever get at home on DVD.</p>
<p>I had the expensive clip-ons for my glasses disappear as well. They were the &quot;rare-earth magnets on the hinges&quot; type. I had my visor up and turned my head to make a lane change and the air stream just sucked them right off. Price: $116 bucks</p>
<p>I replaced them with clip-ons where there&#8217;s a claw at each corner and the temple is spring-loaded so you pull them apart to release them. They&#8217;re also a little darker. Price: $25 clams</p>
<p>So more expensive does not always equal better.</p>
<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>My problem is that I can&#8217;t find a case for them. If they&#8217;re not in a case, they&#8217;re GOING to get crunched, and the enormous cases out there are big enough to hide an elephant in, and totally ridiculous. You expect me to fit THAT in a pocket??!!</p>

		<p>::Wendy:: &#8212;</p>
<p>Photochromic lenses are great, but they&#8217;ve got a few quirks that prevent them from being used in every situation.</p>
<p>Most photochromics work nice and quick (&lt;60 sec for full range), but they usually *don&#8217;t* work inside a car (glass, such as the windshield, blocks most UV, and photochromics react to UV). There are special designs (&#8220;Drivewear&#8221;) that do work in cars, but they lighten only to amber, not clear, so they&#8217;re not very useful at night. One way or another, &#8220;The Raymond&#8221; (I like that!) would still have to change glasses, or use clip-ons, at some time.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>I prefer to control when I&#8217;m wearing sunglasses and when not, because tinted lenses carry social connotations that may not be appropriate for all situations. And clip-ons are easier to carry than a second pair of glasses. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Hey, it just occurred to me: the problem here was that the clip-ons fell out of your pocket while you were running. So the issue is that the clip-ons weren&#8217;t properly fastened in place when you weren&#8217;t wearing them over your glasses.</p>
<p>Easy solution: flip-up sunglasses! Stylish *and* practical. Well, practical. Well&#8230;</p>

		<p>Gene: Agreed, it cost me 1/3 more to see it in 3D, which was well worth it just to ooh and aah &#8211; that&#8217;s come a long way since the old red/green lenses of twenty years ago.</p>
<p>I thought that was pretty good value &#8211; of course my sunglasses remained in my pocket the entire time, I imagine my verdict might have been similar to Raymond&#8217;s had they not.</p>

		<p>But did you see it in 3D?!?!&#8230; they could have provided you some high quality sexy glasses!</p>
<p>The 3d trailers were far better than the 3d in the film! One upside, I&#8217;ve got a new photo with the posse in some full retro geddup!</p>

		<p>Sometimes I wonder what value blogging provides, and every now and then, I happen across a delightfully insightful specimen that reminds me of the enormous power of open, free, mass communication of thoughts and ideas.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just unfortunate that I have to sort through this sort of rubbish to find it.</p>
