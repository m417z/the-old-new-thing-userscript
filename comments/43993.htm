<p>This is what WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT means too, right?</p>

		<p>I&#39;d like to see an email exchange consisting of Raymond telling the Embedded folks that they need to remove something from their documentation which doesn&#39;t exist, and them responding that they don&#39;t need to remove it because it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

		<p>@Anon: I assume you&#39;re joking about their response, but that&#39;s probably what you would get when filing a bug report with your average (OSS) project.</p>

		<p>@Raymond</p>
<p>I feel your pain. I need the answer to a question right now, except in order to find the answer, I will need to cc 50 people in order to find the correct one.</p>

		<p>&quot; Unfortunately, I don&#39;t have any contacts in the Windows Embedded documentation team, so I don&#39;t know whom to contact to get them to remove the references to flags that don&#39;t exist.&quot; &mdash;Raymond Chen</p>
<p>Is it *that* difficult to find someone in the same company? No directory?</p>

		<p>^ Actually, 9 people might be enough. A couple of years back, I read about a study by Microsoft on MSN about an experiment concerning sending a message to a total stranger. The experiment only asked the sender to send it to the most appropriate person he knows. (Say, X, living in Redmond, WA is asked to send the message to Y, living somewhere unknown in Pasadena, CA; X would send it to Z, who lived in LA.) That person would, in turn, send it to the most appropriate person he knew of. Study showed that in most cases, after 9 instances of forwarding, the message reached the intended destination.</p>
<p>Where I work, it has never been more that two hops. And it takes a bit of negotiation.</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command: That experiment was done several times and the underlying idea is that of the &quot;small world&quot;, also known as &quot;six degrees of separation&quot;. In both the email experiment by Columbia University in 2003 and the snail mail experiments by Milgram most mails were never received, for the others the average chain length was both times near six, with outliers up to ten or so. Interestingly Milgram tested only in the US, while the email experiment was worldwide (or what counted for &quot;worldwide&quot; in electronics in 2003 ;-))</p>

		<p>^ I see. Thanks a bunch.</p>
<p>My memory seems to have recorded 6 as 9. Also, &quot;by Microsoft on MSN&quot; is in fact &quot;on Microsoft MSN&quot;, which is the MSN Messenger network.</p>

		<p>@mito, you reminded me my question last year (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15024372/what-is-the-value-of-a-dialog-constant-ds-recurse">stackoverflow.com/&#8230;/what-is-the-value-of-a-dialog-constant-ds-recurse</a>). There Raymond rejected my question on the grounds that this constant is &quot;not exist now&quot;, and I offered to talk about it in this blog :)</p>
