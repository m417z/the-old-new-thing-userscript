		<p>If you have a listview with 500,000 items in it, that&#39;s quite a usability nightmare! &nbsp;Of course, your point still stands for a much more reasonable size like 5,000 items.</p>

		<p>@Adam Rosenfield: Not if you provide some &quot;instant filter&quot;, e.g. typing a filter term will reduce the list.</p>

		<p>It would be very useful if this message is sent even for regular controls (not owner-data). Imagine if you have to update the selection count like Explorer does in the status bar. If you do that on LVN_ITEMCHANGED, you will have to update it many times after a &quot;select all&quot;. With a single message like LVN_ODSTATECHANGED (or a new one LVN_SELCHANGED) life would be much easier.</p>
<p>What I&#39;ve done in the past was to post a private message on the first LVN_ITEMCHANGED and set a flag that stops further messages from being posted until the first message is received and processed. It works OK, but if it was done by the list control it would be more efficient.</p>

		<p>I had to deal with these two messages the other day, if you look at the structs the OD struct maps pretty good to the other struct so I did:</p>
<p>//deal with other changes?&#8230;</p>
<p>if (LVIF_STATE&amp;pNMLV-&gt;uChanged) {</p>
<p>NMLVODSTATECHANGE*pLVSC=(NMLVODSTATECHANGE*)pNMLV; //NMLVODSTATECHANGE is much smaller</p>
<p>pLVSC-&gt;iTo=pNMLV-&gt;iItem; //ok as long as LVN_ODSTATECHANGED is able to deal with iTo==-1</p>
<p>pLVSC-&gt;iFrom=(-1==pLVSC-&gt;iTo)?0:pLVSC-&gt;iTo;</p>
<p>goto &quot;handle_LVN_ODSTATECHANGED&quot;;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>A very weird bug I ran into while doing this was that sometimes NMLISTVIEW.iItem would be 16 in a list with 3 items. So I had to deal with both -1 and &gt;myItemCount</p>
