		<p>&quot;This is all ridiculous, of course, because imaginary people don&#8217;t write code or fix bugs or buy you a pint of beer after work.&quot;</p>
<p>Are you kidding? &nbsp;Where I work, imaginary people are the only ones who fix bugs or buy me beer.</p>

		<p>For once an intelligent management term. How many times has someone said we&#8217;ll give these tasks to the new developer. only to find 4 months have gone by with no one hired and the tasks are either left undone, assigned to someone who is already overloaded, etc.</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how many times over the years that I referred to my imaginary friends in project planning/review meetings w/ my management. It helped them &quot;get&quot; that the plan had two parts, one was the fantasy-based-on-wishful-thinking about what real people already present in the org could do, and the other was the &quot;upside&quot; possible if our imaginary friends were reified somehow. It allowed us to discuss moving features from one bucket to the other, and sometimes made them laugh a little during usually painful discussions.</p>

		<p>@Hardware Junie and David Walker:</p>
<p>I agree that &#8216;reified&#8217; is a great word. I&#8217;ve always liked it. For me it conjures up a combination of magic and science; creating something from nothing (or an idea).</p>
<p>Sorry for the continued thread drift; back to butts in seats&#8230;</p>

		<p>Mark: That episode aired in February 2004, so it predates this post enough to qualify as the possible inspiration for the BIS nomenclature.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Butts in seats&#8221; is an awful term for that metric. Personally, I would use &#8220;actual bodies&#8221; or &#8220;real people.&#8221; </p>
<p>To me, (and surfing around a bit online, I see I&#8217;m not alone), &#8220;butts in seats&#8221; has always meant exactly that and nothing more &#8211; someone sitting in the chair. Not writing code, not debugging or running QA, not buying beers &#8211; just a butt in the seat. </p>
<p>This article: <a href="http://www.certmag.com/read.php?in=2868" rel=nofollow target=_new rel="nofollow">http://www.certmag.com/read.php?in=2868</a></p>
<p>talks about &#8220;butts in seats&#8221; referring to those large services companies whose only goal is to maximize the manpower on a contract &#8211; the number of &#8220;butts in seats&#8221; no matter what they&#8217;re doing. </p>
<p>I also worked with a guy who was positive that our management ran metrics on &#8220;Butt-hours per week&#8221; because all they seemed to care about was how long we were in the office; not what we produced or who did what. The key to advancement was about spending twelve hours a day in the office, not actually writing code. </p>
<p>The inverse of &#8220;butts in seats&#8221; would be &#8220;productivity&#8221; &#8211; actual work done. </p>

		<p>Butts in seats is a pretty common term in workforce management, particularly in the callcenter industry. &nbsp;It refers to those in their seats taking calls &#8211; not on break, lunch, in the bathroom, in training, meetings, etc.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m reminded of another Microspeak I&#8217;ve heard: BOL. It stand for &quot;Butt On Line&quot;, and refers tpo the person who is in charge on a certain project, and would have to provide answers in case it fails &#8211; the person who put his butt on the line for this project.</p>
<p>Project Managers: Remember that even when a theoretical headcount turns into an actual BIS, its contribution isn&#8217;t immediately equal to existing team member. Actually, initially the contribution is negative, as he draws time from team members for ramp-up.</p>
