		<p>Absolutely amazing! and extremely useful for students like me!<br />
<br />Btw..in these days of OOPS, SOAP and buzzword-compliance, I can&#8217;t believe that it&#8217;s necessary to know these nitty-gritties! Or do u work in this particularly low level stuff?</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t work in the nitty gritties, but I&#8217;m constantly being brought into other peoples offices to look at mysterious problems (I called this routine and it corrupted a local variable) simply because I DO know how all this stuff works.</p>
<p>Of course the fact that I figuratively cut my development teeth on MS-DOS 4.0 back in 1984 helps :)<br /></p>

		<p>If you work in C or C++, you pretty much have no choice but to learn these nitty-gritties because there is no framework around to do this for you. (And even if you are using a framework like VB or the CLR you still need to know this if you intend to interop with C/C++.) When your program crashes mysteriously, you&#8217;re stuck staring at nitty-gritties.</p>

		<p>This is one of my pet peeves. That someone writing business apps in C++ has to worry about these details. I am hoping that C# takes off.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s not really true, you can program in C++ and not even have to worry about something like *memory management* if you use smart pointers and classes that take care of themselves. Though I agree, C# is a better language than C++ for mediocre programmers to use. Not knowing basic assembly or how the architecture is implemented is like not knowing calculus or linear algebra. You can get away with not knowing it in life but if you ever come across a problem that can be solved using it, you&#8217;ve just saved yourself a lot of time and trouble.</p>

		<p>True, you can get the compiler to do a lot of the work for you, but you have to do it right. A mistake as simple as declaring the same (extern &quot;C&quot;) function two different ways will go unnoticed by the compiler and lead to all sorts of strange crashes.</p>
<p>(Plus of course there are fun things like returning a pointer to a stack-allocated object and using it after the function returns&#8230;)</p>

		<p>It is very seldom that a C++ programmer needs to keep low-level internals in mind when coding, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you shouldn&#8217;t know of them.  Just knowing how the underlying code generation model works gives you a lot of insight as to why code (mis)behaves as it does, and that is true whether you are using C++ or C#.</p>
<p>You can get very nasty bugs by mismatching calling conventions.  One time I accidentally declared a VFW callback as __cdecl instead of __stdcall, and the result was stack hemorrhaging in the video capture loop.  Normally the capture went OK because the garbage was removed by the frame pointer, but if I went above a certain time limit the thread ran out of stack and crashed.</p>
<p>Sometimes declaration errors can be caught in a program by compiling it as managed C++ (/clr), even if you never intend to actually run or ship it that way.  In particular, One Definition Rule (ODR) violations are caught, such as declaring a structure differently in two modules with the same name.<br /></p>

		<p>MilesArcher: &quot;This is one of my pet peeves. That someone writing business apps in C++ has to worry about these details. I am hoping that C# takes off.&quot;</p>
<p>I have a different perspective on the issue: If a programming language makes it too easy on the developer chances are that you&#8217;ll wind up with hordes of poor programmers flooding the business. Of course that is not to say that a Java programmer, for example, is a bad programmer per se, just because (s)he doesn&#8217;t have to care about as many details as a C++ programmer ideally would. From personal experience though, I have seen few good programmers that never got in touch with their machines on a low level. Many just never even cared, and it is lack of interest that seperates the boys from the men ;)</p>
<p>So my opinion is that knowledge never hurts. With low-level languages you&#8217;re forced to get to know those details under the hood. This, however, doesn&#8217;t disqualify a language as the tool of choice for a given project.</p>
<p>The problem with C++ is not so much that you have to know about certain details. It&#8217;s more that it was old already at the time it was brand new. There is too much C legacy and those who read D&amp;E know how great C++ would have turned out if it didn&#8217;t have to care to attract C coders.</p>
