		<p>Why do tooltips disappear so quickly (especially in IE)? &nbsp;I often can&#39;t read the entire thing before it disappears, and so I have to drift off and back on so it will re-appear. &nbsp;</p>
<div class="post">[<em>This doesn&#39;t really have anything to do with coding tracking tooltips, but at the risk of encouraging off-topic discussion: They are probably using <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/23/8417521.aspx">the default timeouts</a>. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>It lead to us completely reimplementing tooltips since there is no obvious way to change the timeout from .NET (there probably is a way but it was faster to reimplement tooltips than find it.) Turns out tracking tooltips are really easy to implement by hand.</p>

		<p>Is having the common controls entry in your manifest enough to get the version 6 common controls DLL to load, or do you have to load the DLL somehow as well? I&#39;ve only worked with manifests for msvc*.dll, which is its own different bundle of joy.</p>
<p>Raymond, what is your feeling on TCHAR at this point? Windows 9x is long gone, so is there a reason to use TCHAR instead of WCHAR?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>It depends on how your component is loaded. Search MSDN for &quot;common controls manifst&quot; for your options. I use TCHAR as a concession to people who have to maintain old code that is still ANSI-based. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@ Joshua &#8212; changing the timeout on tooltips from managed code is very easy. &nbsp;The tooltips provide props to do that. &nbsp;You are correct in that it is darn near impossible to control where the tooltips apear outside of some win32 interfacing.</p>

		<p>@12BitSlab: And I did indeed have to control where they ended up.</p>
