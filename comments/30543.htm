		<p>Plus the fact that using monikers instead of PIDLs would&#8217;ve been a nightmare given Windows 95&#8217;s requirement to fit in 4 MB of RAM.</p>

		<p>You appear to misunderstand the idea of monikers. You seem to believe that, as soon as you have a moniker to Excel file, Excel itself is started. This is <em>not</em> the case. A separate step &#8211; a call to IMoniker::BindToObject &#8211; is necessary to actually run the underlying server. This is equivalent to ShellExecuteEx call on a PIDL. Until then, the moniker is just like PIDL &#8211; a generalized notion of a file path if you will.<br /></p>

		<p>Excel isn&#8217;t started, but the code for the IMoniker implementation must be loaded.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how much code that is (less than a page?), and it&#8217;s nowhere near Excel&#8217;s footprint. &nbsp;But I think it is more than the space required for the code behind a PIDL, because AFAIK there is no code behind a PIDL (it&#8217;s just plain-old-data). &nbsp;Could be wrong on that, though.</p>

		<p>Igor,</p>
<p>Q. What do you think is implementing IMoniker?</p>
<p>A. A COM object. </p>
<p>Hence, you would have 1000 COM objects as pointed out.</p>

		<p>Igor&#8217;s point is that you don&#8217;t get &#8220;a dozen live, running spreadsheet objects&#8221;. You do get a dozen file monikers, the code for which is shared. The data within each instance of the file moniker is probably is just plain-old-data.</p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>Even if it&#8217;s not live running spreadsheet objects, it&#8217;s still code that has to be loaded off the disk. And all that just to show a list of files? The principle of &#8220;pay for play&#8221; applies here. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<blockquote><p>
  You have to load an external DLL to load the moniker class implementation </p>
<p>Not if the moniker is implemented by shell32.dll, or shlwapi.dll &#8211; whoever now implements PIDL manipulation API. It does not have to be a file moniker implemented in ole32.dll &#8211; anybody can implement a COM interface. It can very well be an IMoniker implementation wrapping a PIDL internally. </p>
<p>&gt; And what if there&#8217;s an Excel file but you don&#8217;t have Excel installed? Does that mean no moniker? </p>
<p>A moniker does not know nor care which server a particular file belongs to &#8211; until you call BindToObject. Until then, it just carries around a file path or whatever information is necessary to locate a file &#8211; just like PIDL does. When you call BindToObject and no server can be found to handle the file, it fails &#8211; just like ShellExecuteEx does. </p>
<p>Face it &#8211; monikers and PIDLs are two manifestations of the same fundamental concept. One is exposed via COM-based API while the other via C style API, and that&#8217;s pretty much the only difference.</p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>True, but the COM object is &#8220;live&#8221; &#8211; it&#8217;s hard to marshal, it&#8217;s hard to copy into a block of memory, good luck sending it to another computer. A pidl is &#8220;dead&#8221;; it&#8217;s just a bunch of bytes. You can copy it around with impunity. It&#8217;s the difference between FindFirstFile returning a bunch of HANDLEs and returning a bunch of file names. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>&gt;Hence, you would have 1000 COM objects as pointed out.</p>
<p>So? Why do you think it matters if you have 1000 PIDLs or 1000 COM<br />
pointers each wrapping a PIDL? Do you also believe that a 1000<br />
instances of C++ class are more expensive than a 1000 instances of<br />
plain old C struct with the same fields? COM is not black magic, a COM<br />
object is little more than a C++ class instance.</p>
<p>I admit a moniker would be slightly more expensive (by one vtable<br />
pointer) than raw PIDL, but not vastly, outlandishly expensive as<br />
Raymond makes it sound.</p>
<p>&gt; AFAIK there is no code behind a PIDL</p>
<p>What do you mean, no code? How do you manipulate a PIDL in your<br />
application then? What&#8217;s really the difference between calling<br />
SHGetPathFromIDList and calling IMoniker::GetDisplayName?</p>
<p>Consider:</p>
<p>struct X {<br />
<br /> &nbsp;int n;<br />
<br />};<br />
<br />void DoSomething(X* p);</p>
<p>class CX {<br />
<br /> &nbsp;int n;<br />
<br />public:<br />
<br /> &nbsp;void DoSomething();<br />
<br />};</p>
<p>You seem to imply that there is &#8220;no code&#8221; behind X, but there is<br />
&#8220;some code&#8221; behind CX. I fail to see the fundamental difference between</p>
<p>X x;<br />
<br />DoSomething(&amp;x);</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>CX cx;<br />
<br />cx.DoSomething();</p>
<p>In fact, the latter is internally implemented very similarly to the former: the compiler generates something like</p>
<p>void CX_DoSomething(CX* this);<br />
<br />// cx.DoSomething();<br />
<br />CX_DoSomething(&amp;cx);</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where &#8216;this&#8217; pointer inside a C++ method comes from.</p>

		<p>Marshalling could have been implemented with Marshal-By-Value, transferring PIDL to the target process or machine and wrapping it in another moniker instance once there (all transparently behind the scenes). </p>
<p>IMoniker is derived from IPersistStream &#8211; that&#8217;s how you store the underlying data in a block of memory. </p>
<p>Note, I&#8217;m not arguing that using PIDLs was a bad decision and that the shell should have used monikers instead. In fact, the issue didn&#8217;t occur to me until you raised it. I&#8217;m just arguing against your claim that monikers are somehow fundamentally different and completely unsuitable for the task.</p>

		<p>Your article makes a number of false claims about monikers, quite unrelated to whether or not Shell could or should use them. Somebody reading it might get wrong ideas. I&#8217;m just trying to set the record straight, is all.</p>
<p>Shell can happily continue to use PIDLs as far as I&#8217;m concerned. I&#8217;m not advocating adding moniker support. I&#8217;m arguing in principle that your claim about monikers being fundamentally unsuitable, and a few other claims, are wrong. That doesn&#8217;t mean somebody has to rush and implement monikers in the shell just because it&#8217;s possible.</p>

		<p>The whole discussion misses the real difference between a PIDL and a Moniker, which is, that a PIDL not only contains an identification of an object (i. e. a file name, object pointer etc.) but may contain as much additional data as you please. In practice, this is used to store attributes of the objects the PIDLs refer to in the PIDL structure. In the Windows Shell, you can display files&#8217; attributes or virtual folders&#8217; attributes given the PIDL without &quot;binding&quot; to the target object. In case you have a large list of objects which you want to display in the Windows Explorer Details View, it&#8217;s much faster to find the attributes (columns in details view) in the PIDL than to open the objects one by one.</p>
<p>And of course, every Shell Extension needs a PIDL-Manager Module, which might be a pain to program.</p>
