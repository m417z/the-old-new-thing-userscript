		<p>The true number of irreplaceable DLLs is four.</p>
<p>So, since KnownDLLs is not a security feature, is it safe to remove a troublesome entry? I&#39;ve seen a few threads of &quot;but X is known DLL&quot; where X was the name of some local DLL in some very old program but has the same name as some Windows DLL.</p>

		<p>&quot;Granting open write access to your application directory is equivalent to leaving open the door to your airtight hatchway.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s one of the reasons why I don&#39;t like Steam. They turn off the security of their folder in Program Files</p>

<p>One thing I dream of is for Microsoft to place hard-locks on permissions for system folders when in the OS (i.e. not in WinPE or WinRE) for accounts which aren&#39;t builtins. </p>
<p>It would break lots of poorly-written programs which should have been broken a decade or more ago.</p>

<p>Sadly, while they could probably be a tad more selective and open up the security on a few of the sub-folders instead, they have to cope with the fact that game developers are particularly notorious for ignoring &quot;the right way&quot; of doing things, in favor of &quot;it works&quot;, &quot;it meets my performance goals&quot;, and &quot;it just means the user has to be an &#39;admin&#39;. Who isn&#39;t these days?&quot;. Before Steam added the change themselves, they were being screamed at in their forums because &quot;game X won&#39;t run&quot; or &quot;every time I start game Y, it runs the &#39;first time&#39; setup&quot;, etc.</p>
<p>On the up-side, this is actually slightly better from a system standpoint, because before the change everyone&#39;s solution was to run Steam &quot;as Administrator&quot;. Now they can stay normal users with the normal limitations. On the down-side, <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://xkcd.com/1200/">http://xkcd.com/1200/</a></p>
<p>There&#39;s no fixing the old games; their devs are gone or don&#39;t care. There&#39;s a slim chance that new games could start doing things &quot;the right way&quot;&#8230;</p>
<p>Well I did say &quot;slim&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Kevin</p>
<p>And that&#39;s exactly where they should be installed. NOTHING in %ProgramFiles% should be modified by a non-Admin user.</p>
<p>@Random User</p>
<p>That&#39;s not true. You can fix plenty of things using redirection and file-level permissions.</p>
<p>But until MS makes breaking changes to security or starts outing bad developers, nothing will change.</p>

		<p>This worries me. What if, instead of some \serversoftwareinstall, it was the &quot;downloaded files&quot; directory of the user&#39;s browser? The place where random downloaded files go to?</p>
<p>I can imagine an attacker tricking the user into downloading HAHA.DLL and then downloading the installer from its legitimate website. The user feels safe, since the installer was downloaded from a legitimate place and has a legitimate signature&#8230; But it runs untrusted code which just happened to be in the same directory.</p>
<p>I hope at least .msi installers are immune to this. Do they run in separate (or trusted) directories?</p>

		<p>I actually got hit by a virus last year which used the application directory attack &#8211; it dumped an installer for a popular browser plugin, along with a rogue DLL, into the TEMP directory. It executed the installer, which ran elevated (after confirmation, if required), so the code in the DLL could do its thing.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: Presuming those DLLs are &quot;irreplaceable&quot; because they call into kernel-mode, couldn&#39;t you statically link the same code and have zero DLLs?</p>

		<p>I&#39;m pretty sure ntdll.dll, user32.dll and wow64.dll are the only dlls with syscall numbers hardcoded inside them. kernel32, kernelbase and advapi just calls into ntdll or user32 and wow64 needs the syscall numbers to marshal structures to their 64-bit versions for 64-bit system calls from WoW64 code. None of them are essentially irreplaceable, however you would need to have a replacement for every kernel revision. You would have a problem removing ntdll from the system though, as the kernel loads that into every process and starts the user space side of the execution of every process at a function inside ntdll.</p>

		<p>@poizan42:</p>
<p>For an executable marked as Win32 application, the loader also loads kernel32.dll (and because of dependencies, kernelbase on newer versions of Windows). This is because kernel32 is an integral part of the Win32 API.</p>

		<p>@Anon</p>
<p>I think we agree. My point was not that there was no other fix. Only that the common &quot;wisdom&quot; out on the Net was &quot;Run as Administrator&quot; to fix the Steam issues.</p>
<p>Me, personally: There are defiantly games out there that completely fail without significant tweaking or &quot;admin&quot;. On my machines, I figured out what dumb thing each games was doing that the automatic redirection wasn&#39;t fixing, and either granted that specific access, or found a way to force the redirect.</p>
<p>I expect most of the game-playing public lacks either the knowledge or patience for such an exercise. If the developers cared, they would have designed the dumb thing not to need such overreaching access. Historically, they don&#39;t care; I do not have high hopes for them to start caring.</p>

		<p>I hate installers that insist admin privileges. Those that not only get elevated automatically because UAC thinks they are setup programs, but also want to be elevated by use of manifest, and even explicitly check for admin rights in the code and halt with message box if invoker isn&#39;t one.</p>
<p>The application compatibility toolkit can only fix so much with RunAsInvoker, VirtualRegistry, and ForceAdminAccess, and eventually run into what&#39;s apparently redirection issues on x64 systems.</p>
<p>Nowadays I give up on those installers and just install them in a VM, then copy the program files and registry entries out.</p>

		<p>@RE: installer</p>
<p>I hate the consequence of trying to clean up after somebody got past the manifest checks (who knows how) and managed to get half-way through the install w/o admin rights and now it&#39;s wedged because fix permissions routine in the installer revoked permissions on the directory they installed to. At some of these shops, it&#39;s really hard for them to hunt down somebody who is admin to fix the thing.</p>
