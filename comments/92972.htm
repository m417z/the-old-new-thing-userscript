		<p>What I&#8217;ve never understood is, why is that there by default anyway?  If I have a bug in my code, and I publish it, and someone uses it and it crashes on their system, what can *Microsoft* do with the debug information from my crashed program?</p>
<p>If they could forward it on to me, that would be useful, but then again, pretty much any developer with the skills to know what to do with a crash report is going to build an automated crash reporting feature into their own program anyway, one that&#8217;s going to gather more domain-specific information than a generic Windows crash dump, so what good does it do me to register with Microsoft for something like that?  And if I don&#8217;t register with Microsoft, why is this feature that does me no good pestering my users?</p>

		<p>Just because the crash is in your app doesn&#8217;t mean the bug is in your app. Often, apps expose bugs in Windows.</p>

		<p>I think they *do* forward crash reports to developers. Isn&#8217;t there some sort of program you can opt in to for this?</p>

		<p>Was. No more. Microsoft said &#8220;shoo, developers!&#8221; after Windows 8.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about Metro-style apps though. There could be a program for them.</p>

		<p>They do. If you sign your binary, you can get all WER crash reports related to it right to you. That&#8217;s how we catch and fix many issues, which would normally go unreported.</p>

		<p>There are drawbacks to embedding your own crash reporting into your program.  The main one is that it&#8217;s the crash reporting is best done from an external process.  Having a process try to report its own crashes can be problematic because the state of the process is uncertain; it may fail to send a report for some kinds of crashes.</p>
<p>So, to do your own crash reporting, you should install a service or otherwise spin up a watchdog process.</p>
<p>But, as a user, I&#8217;d much prefer it if all of the apps I run could share such a single crash-reporting service rather than having one per application (or, if you&#8217;re lucky, one per vendor).  WER makes that possible.  Software vendors can get access to dumps of their collected by WER if they register with Microsoft and meet certain quality bars.</p>

		<p>Firefox and Chrome report their own crashes without installing a service or having a watchdog process. crashreporter.exe runs every time after the crash. AVG products do the same thing.</p>
<p>My people have been pressuring me to avoid sending any crash data to Microsoft after this whole privacy sensation surrounding Microsoft, although I did nothing about it.</p>

		<p>Google Chrome relies on GoogleCrashHandler.exe, of which there are 32-bit and 64-bit versions.  On my machine, they are set to run all the time unless you turn off the telemetry option in Chrome.  The processes are small and lightweight, so it&#8217;s not a big deal.</p>
<p>But if every application or vendor required and extra process or two, it could add up.</p>

		<p>Because it sends usage statistics too, not because crash handling needs it running all the times.</p>

		<p>Last time I tried to get useful data from WER (through the winqual site) the processing queue was at least a week long.  A week is too long to wait.  Then you have to actively get on the winqual site to browse the results.  Rolling your own allows for immediate feedback, notification, and customized bucketing.</p>

		<p>Interesting.  The only case when I would have wanted crash reports within a week is if I&#8217;m sharing an alpha release in-house or to a particularly close partner or customer.  In those cases, if the users see any crashes, I can get the DMP files directly from them.  </p>
<p>The WER program is useful to get data from the full corpus of your user-base.  For instance, how many users are still using an old version known to be unstable?  Or, say the program becomes unstable only after weeks of continuous usage on a system used for other many things.  In those cases, a week is not really a useful timeframe.</p>

		<p>This was for a small MMOG: a highly complex codebase with relatively frequent updates and a test team insufficient to cover all possible user scenarios and edge cases.</p>

		<p>Microsoft does indeed make crash reports available to developers, and it&#8217;s an outstanding program.  It&#8217;s really easy to set it up, and it gives me visibility into what crashes users are seeing.  It tells me how often my program crashes &#8216;in the wild,&#8217; what the biggest source of crashes are, and where exactly in the code those crashes occur.  (It&#8217;s also a great feeling when I see that pretty much all the crashes are in third-party code&#8230;)</p>

		<p>What I want to know is when would a crash be an expected outcome in a unit test? Unit tests are modeling real life situations. Is crashing in a real life scenario ever the right thing to do (yes, I know you shouldn&#8217;t attempt to stop a crash in progress, but that&#8217;s when it&#8217;s already in progress)? And if you don&#8217;t control the child process and it crashes under certain circumstances, why would you want to test for this? Would something be wrong if the child process unexpectedly *didn&#8217;t* crash?</p>

		<p>I think you are confusing expectation with something that happens every time.</p>
<p>9 times out of 10 the test units expose bugs, but hopefully most of the time it will actually function correctly. But in cases it doesn&#8217;t you do not want to clutter the screen with lots of useless dialogs</p>

		<p>You might want to verify that the component correctly detects an invalid condition (e.g., buffer overrun), and the component is designed so that invalid conditions crash the process.</p>

		<p>This is still a global solution to a local problem, only it&#8217;s global to the parent process rather than the entire system. A different thread in the parent process may suffer the side effects, just as it would if you were modifying your own environment variables so that a child process you&#8217;re going to create might inherit them. In the case of the environment variables there&#8217;s a correct solution in the form of the relevant parameter to CreateProcess. In the case of the error mode, there isn&#8217;t (as far as I know).</p>

		<p>True, but it&#8217;s less global than the machine-global solution. The purely local solution would be for the unit test itself to make the SetErrorMode call.</p>

		<p>That assumes you have control over the code of the executable you&#8217;re running (or at least some part of it), otherwise the only robust solution would be having a sacrificial process do your bidding.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m wondering if there is any way to turn off error dialogs _but_ also cause the information that would have appeared in the error dialog to get logged somewhere a monitoring program can pick it up.  For example, again in the context of a test suite: you don&#8217;t want the program being tested to pop up a dialog box if it can&#8217;t find all of its required DLLs, but you probably _do_ want to log the name of the missing DLL.  SEM_FAILCRITICALERRORS turns off the dialog box in this case, but as far as I can tell, the dialog box is the only place the missing DLL&#8217;s name is reported&#8230;</p>

		<p>For anyone actually doing this in their own program that is more complex than this example, it is important to call SetErrorMode twice like Raymond does in a previous post about this topic: <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040727-00/?p=38323/" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040727-00/?p=38323/</a></p>

		<p>Is there a way to prevent WER being triggered by exceptions raised in TLS callbacks? In Windows 7 these are silently swallowed by the operating system but in Windows 8.1 and Windows 10 they trigger WER (even though the process is allowed to continue running). Setting the error mode can prevent WER from saving crash dumps and writing event log entries, but it doesn’t avoid a service host process and WerFault.exe being started each time. When this happens for each of the 30+ threads the app creates, it leads to a noticeable slow-down in the running of the program.</p>
