		<p>Zone identifier is a useless &quot;feature&quot; that only wears down the mouse and exacerbates the user.</p>
<p>Forgot to remove it once from a driver install file. Installed the driver. On every boot when the background program started that vexing &quot;security warning&quot; dialog showed up. The zone information had infected the files it unpacked and installed. Had to remove the driver, remove the zone information and install it again. Took 2 reboots extra.</p>
<p>Microsoft is helping to kill mother nature.</p>
<p>The feature wants to be helpful but any sane person would install a firewall and anti-virus program which makes that feature redundant and creates a bad user experience. Redundant security. UAC and windows vista anyone?</p>
<p>That feature treats the user as an internet virgin. &quot;You do know this stranger is potentially infected and bad for you?&quot;</p>
<p>Microsoft loves to treat their users as a children. Lie, cheat and even abuse us. Microsoft say: &quot;It is for your own good. We know best. Now shut up and buy this new overpriced and crappy product!&quot;</p>
<p>Surprising that windows doesn&#39;t popup a message each time you use the web camera &quot;This image/video can be stolen and uploaded online for everyone to see&quot;</p>
<p>Hmm. With image recognition tech: &quot;Warning: This image contains nudity. Are you sure you want to save it?&quot; or more realistic view on image recognition (it is always faulty, buggy): &quot;Error: This image contains child-porn. Police have been notified!&quot;</p>
<p>Talking about wearing down the mouse. When will microsoft make click-fest metro optional for desktop users?</p>
<p>I&#39;m feeling violated and raped here, again. Isn&#39;t one apple enough?</p>

		<p>These prompts to before running downloaded files are so annoying that I decided to do something about it. &nbsp;I discovered the underlying mechanism uses NTFS alternate streams to store the zone information. &nbsp;So I wrote a program that traverses every file on the hard drive and deletes this alternate stream info thus unblocking all files in one action. &nbsp;I was unaware of this IZoneIdentifier interface. &nbsp;I&#39;ll have to modify my program to use this interface instead of going for the raw alternate stream.</p>

		<p>I think this &quot;feature&quot; only works on NTFS. &nbsp;I know if you copy the file to FAT or burn to a CD, then copy back to NTFS the zone info is lost. &nbsp;I haven&#39;t tried FAT32, but I suspect the zone info is lost there as well.</p>

		<p>@Tess That is not a Windows feature and I have never had that happen to me on any version of Windows. &nbsp;I suspect a third-party installer or some other third-party shenanigans.</p>
<p>In Windows 8/8.1, ScreenSmart or whatever it&#39;s called (SmartScreen?) will bypass the prompt for known good software, so it will not appear. &nbsp;I&#39;ve only had it pop up a few times myself since I installed the 8.1 preview back when it was released. &nbsp;So it appears to work well in my experience.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve got a file that doesn&#39;t respond to clicking to Unblock button. &nbsp;The button does get grayed out, and I can then click OK to save the changes, but when I re-open the file properties, it&#39;s back, and running the program still causes the warning dialog to appear. &nbsp;Does anyone have experience with this?</p>

		<p>Here we go again. Microsoft documented the API for a file format tag but not the format of the alternate data stream.</p>
<p>This is bad behavior that MS will not stop.</p>

		<p>Wow @Tess (&quot;Microsoft is helping to kill mother nature&quot;, &quot;Metro sucks, boo hoo&quot;) &#8211; troll alert! BTW, here&#39;s a handy tip for future rants: people/users get exasperated, situations get exacerbated.</p>
<p>There is indeed a group policy for this and if you don&#39;t like the feature it takes all of a minute to Bing the steps and implement. Oh, and Chrome has now copied IE9+/Win8+&#39;s zone id based SmartScreen App Reputation system.</p>
<p>@Brian: So you effectively rewrote SysInternals&#39; Streams utility?</p>

		<p>@Jack: my thoughts exactly. &nbsp;If they&#39;re really annoyed by this feature, then why don&#39;t you search for the switch to turn it off rather than build an app to mess with the alternate data streams? &nbsp;I&#39;m reminded of Raymond&#39;s recent post about enumerating all GUIDs. &nbsp;There&#39;s probably a simpler way to solve the &quot;problem&quot;. &nbsp;First, the Zone.Identifier is usually set only on files that you download from the web, not generally on system files, so searching through the whole filesystem seems like a waste of time.</p>
<p>I view this dialog as a reminder to run the program through an anti-virus scanner before actually running the program. &nbsp;I&#39;m usually quite diligent in scanning for viruses and checking file hashes before running programs, but sometimes I forget. &nbsp;This dialog is like a helpful last-minute reminder to run my security scans before letting a program loose on my system.</p>

		<p>@Tess: This has been identified as a serious problem for regular users. It&#39;s not just IE that does this BTW; Safari in OSX does this too, and for exactly the same reason: to prevent users from picking up drive-by viruses/malware!</p>
<p>Congratulations if you are perfect and never get unintended downloads. I&#39;m not, and the people who this feature was designed to protect aren&#39;t either.</p>

		<p>The problem with features like this is that 99.9% of the time the behavior is unwanted. &nbsp;Imagine if you had a bodyguard that asked you &quot;Are you sure?&quot; every time you did something. &nbsp;Got out of bed, stepped into the shower, put on some clothes, went into the garage, got into the car, etc. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think you would employ him very long.</p>

		<p>While I agree that the Explorer prompt is less than helpful for most &quot;power&quot; users, the zone identifier is useful in some circumstances:</p>
<p>1) A &quot;normal&quot; user who very rarely downloads executables, and the unexpected warning may prevent them from running CuteKitties.jpg.exe. &nbsp;It might not help everyone, but if even 5% of Windows users are ever helped by the dialog then that&#39;s a still a very large number of people.</p>
<p>2) As Raymond mentions, a program might treat files it opens differently if they&#39;re marked as coming from an untrusted zone. &nbsp;Word, for example, disables editing (and probably some other things). &nbsp;I think this is probably the primary motivation for the feature &#8212; a scaffold for other applications to make use of &#8212; and Explorer&#39;s dialog is really just an example of an implementation.</p>

		<p>@Jack: &nbsp;I did and I didn&#39;t rewrite SysInternals&#39; Streams utility. &nbsp;SysInternals Streams is a command line tool and removes all alternate file streams. &nbsp;My utility is GUI, allows you to control which folder(s) to search in, and only remove zone identifier stream info &#8211; all other streams are left intact. &nbsp;I wish I still had my personal website up, I would post the code for all to see and download.</p>

		<p>&gt; 2) As Raymond mentions, a program might treat files it opens differently if they&#39;re marked as coming from an untrusted zone. &nbsp;Word, for example, disables editing (and probably some other things).</p>
<p>A certain well-known PDF reader disables printing on untrusted files. I have no idea why.</p>

		<p>@ender: Never heard of printer viruses? Could be that the PDF contains sequences of malicious code that don&#39;t make sense to the viewer application, but use security vulnerabilities in the printer firmware to infect your network. When the content would simply be sent to the printer and the printer has a security flaw you&#39;d be pwned (I&#39;d say currently every single printer is vulnerable, because security hasn&#39;t been much of a concern with those devices till a few years ago).</p>

		<p>Since a lot of computer programs write zone identifier data without regards to one unified policy, I believe security-conscious people need a garbage collector to remove them en masse. Even if there is a policy in Windows to ignore them, the policy must enabled in all computers that use the file. What&#39;s the need? What&#39;s safe is safe anywhere until changed.</p>
<p>As side note, I&#39;d love Tess to take Brian EE&#39;s advice and grab a Linux distro&#8230; only to discover that Linux comes with sudo, a more heavy-handed version of UAC that can&#39;t exactly be disabled. (Mind you, I love both UAC and sudo.)</p>

<p>The kind of people who hate UAC would probably just log in as root all the time. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command: Printer manufacturers like to do firmware updates by having users &#39;print&#39; special document files with a firmware payload. They&#39;re most likely no crypto, just security by obscurity. Search &#39;printer malware&#39; or &#39;print me if you dare&#39; for examples of this being subverted by researchers.</p>

		<p>@The MAZZTer: I&#39;ve had something similar happen to me, though I don&#39;t remember if it was a driver. &nbsp;I downloaded the file, then unzipped it and the unzip utility copied the zone identifier to all the files. &nbsp;When I was done, I was getting those popups from unexpected places while just trying to use the system.</p>
<p>@morlamweb: What need is there to manually scan the file? &nbsp;By the time it is executed, the typical user has inadvertently scanned it three times. &nbsp;Once when it was written to disk during the download. &nbsp;A second time when Explorer looked at it to list the directory. &nbsp;Then a third time when it was actually executed.</p>
<p>@Nick: No silly dialog will keep the normal user from trying to open up what he thinks is a cute kitties picture. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>@ender &quot;A certain well-known PDF reader disables printing on untrusted files. I have no idea why.&quot;</p>
<p>Because it by default runs the viewer as a (low-integrity?) sandboxed process which doesn&#39;t have permission to do anything much, including access the printer. If you choose &quot;enable all features&quot; it reopens the document as an unsandboxed process, and is then able to print.</p>

		<p>@SD: True; but that&#39;s not the point. It does not happen before an &quot;OMG! This OS too!?&quot; attack. Whether they run as root, or return to Windows and disable UAC is irrelevant.</p>

		<p>@Marc K: anti-virus or anti-malware programs (assuming that they&#39;re installed, are up-to-date, and the on-access scanner is enabled) will scan files as you describe. &nbsp;But they don&#39;t, as a rule, verify checksums. &nbsp;I make it a habit to verify the checksums on downloaded files (if I have a checksum to verify against), especially for larger files. &nbsp;As for running it through a malware scanner: I guess it&#39;s a security blanket thing. &nbsp;Seeing the &quot;no problems found&quot; message after a file scan brings a measure of comfort that silence doesn&#39;t.</p>

		<p>The big problem with zones and web pages is that users (even programmers like me) have trouble wrapping their heads at the concept that a web page containing scripts is given more rights when it&#39;s on the computer than when it&#39;s on the web.</p>
<p>What compounds the problem is that for long (I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s sill the case), the only choice when opening a web page with scripts was to either don&#39;t execute scripts at all, or execute the scripts in URLZONE_LOCAL_MACHINE. Why not provide an option to execute the script in URLZONE_INTERNET? And make this &quot;just do as if it were still on the interwebs&quot; option the default one, because it follows the principle of least astonishment for the average user that assumes &quot;a web page is a web page&quot;.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>You can tag your HTML with &quot;The Mark of the Web&quot; to get it to execute in the Internet zone even when local. Unfortunately it&#39;s too late to change the default behavior for compatibility reasons. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Oh, thanks for the info, I didn&#39;t know of that. I wonder how many browsers add it when saving pages (I just tested with Firefox, which doesn&#39;t). If it were systematically inserted by all browsers for page downloads, it would certainly close a big security hole.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve been using a program called ZoneStripper (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://jameskovacs.com/2005/04/11/zonestripper-updated/">jameskovacs.com/&#8230;/zonestripper-updated</a>) for years. I assume it works on the same information, but it may be implementation-dependent where I think yours is not. Even though I frequently remove the zone (most often for sample code), I prefer having it put on by default when I have a way of taking it off.</p>
