		<p>@ac: GetDiskFreeSpaceEx is basically telling you the size of the largest file you could create, which for most programs is indeed the real amount of free space.</p>
<p>The documentation for GetDiskFreeSpaceEx tells you exactly how to get the total number of bytes on a volume: call DeviceIoControl with the IOCTL_DISK_GET_LENGTH_INFO parameter.</p>

		<p>[so, how would one get the &quot;real&quot; amout of free space?]</p>
<p>Raymond already answered that in his article:</p>
<p>&quot;One customer discovered that viewing the properties of a drive from Explorer shows the amount of disk free space significantly lower than the actual amount of free disk space as resported by the disk management snap-in.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, you meant programmatically? Well, I&#8217;m guessing you use GetDiskFreeSpaceEx all the time because the amount of disk space available to a process is going to be the amount of disk space quota allotted to the user the process is running as.</p>
<p>In other words, even if you could determine the amount of &quot;real&quot; free disk space, what&#8217;s the point in knowing it is 100GB if the user has a quota of 10GB?</p>
<p>It would sort of like going to your bank and asking how much money they have then trying to buy something for that much when you only have $100 in your own bank account.</p>

		<p>&quot;If you go to the documentation for the GetDiskFreeSpaceEx function, you&#8217;ll see that the amount of free disk space reported is not the actual amount of physical free disk space&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>Well, going to MSDN[0], it looks like both are reported, the bytes left in the user&#8217;s quota in *lpFreeBytesAvailable and the amount of physical free disk space in *lpTotalNumberOfFreeBytes.</p>
<p>So GetDiskFreeSpaceEx returns the right amount of free space, according to two different metrics. Explorer and the command prompt just happen to display the quota-based one, instead of the one that the user expected to be shown.</p>
<p>Or do I have the wrong bit of documentation for GetDiskFreeSpaceEx()?</p>

		<p>Total unused storage capacity, is GetDiskFreeSpaceEx() + GetDiskExpensiveSpaceEx(). &nbsp;&quot;If you have to ask, you can&#8217;t afford it.&quot;</p>

		<p>ac &gt; You&#8217;d also get the amount of physical free space with GetDiskFreeSpaceEx() &#8211; it returns the available space to the user, *and* the amount of physical free space on the disk.</p>
<p>Each application picks one of those values to display. Looks like explorer and the command prompt (should that be the &quot;dir&quot; command &#8211; or does the command prompt show free space by itself as well?) are picking one, and &quot;the disk management snap-in&quot; (?) is picking another.</p>

		<p>Sorry, didn&#8217;t mean to post the almost exactly the same thing twice. I thought the aether had swallowed my first one.</p>
<p>*shakes head in order to clear it*</p>
<p>Maybe I should have had more than 7 hours combined sleep in the last couple of nights. Things might make more sense then&#8230;</p>

		<p>BTW, that reminded me of one of my last comments on the article <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/07/17/3903614.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/07/17/3903614.aspx</a>. You may have missed this one:</p>
<p>&quot;BTW, I remember reading that Windows NT 3.51 and older automatically filled out the uniquifier part of a window handle (the high 16-bit) if it was zeroed. e.g. casting a window handle to a short, like in the Excel XLL function xlGetHwnd before Excel 2007. NT 4.0 stopped doing that.&quot;</p>
<p>I now have a reference for this:</p>

		<p>This is one of the few occasions where I would have thought an enumeration would be enough as a return value: &quot;Loads, don&#8217;t worry about it&quot;, &quot;Enough&quot;, &quot;Stop downloading porn/mp3s&quot;, &quot;Very little&quot;, and &quot;Not enough&quot;.</p>

		<p>BTW, how about a &#8220;Why does GetDiskFreeSpace return the wrong amount of free space?&#8221; that describes how programs truncate the result of NumClusters * BytePerSector * SectorsPerCluster to 32-bit.</p>

<p>No one said the process was going to check actural hard disc space and then allocate more than the quota allowed. &nbsp;So, the analogy, in my opionion, is not helpful. &nbsp;It would be more like &#8211; &#8220;oh, that much? &nbsp;I don&#8217;t have enough to buy that thing I wanted. &nbsp;I will need to negotiate with the bank manager for some more of your money?&#8221;</p>
<p>I.e. if you have an application that needs lots of hard-disc space, say a pro video editing application, it might look at the quota of hard drive space and also see that the real hard drive has lots of space available. &nbsp;So, it might pop up a message to the user explaining that things would be better if the user could ask the network admin to increase their disc quota.</p>

		<p>The thing I&#8217;m wondering, is:</p>
<p>IF GetDiskFreeSpace() is obsolete, what is the correct manner of getting the number of clusters in a partition, and the size of each cluster ?</p>
<p>A defragmentation program would need such information&#8230;</p>

		<p>Raymond: &quot;I think your program is trying too hard.&quot;</p>
<p>Possibly. &nbsp;It was just an example. &nbsp;I do think that your counter-example is not quite the same, though. &nbsp;I think most people understand, or at least accept, that Internet connections are slow or fast or are just used to whatever they are given.</p>
<p>I think if I had authored a disc-consumming application of the sort in my example, I think I would try to probe the user&#8217;s system to ensure they were aware of the best configuration &#8211; this may give my app an advantage over the competition (I don&#8217;t know that though &#8211; but I don&#8217;t imagine it would hurt it). &nbsp;Maybe not in version 1.0, but it would be something worth doing, I think. &nbsp;Isn&#8217;t this the same as saying, &quot;your video card is set to 256 colours [and my app is going to look rubbish] &#8211; let me increase that for you [so that it looks good].&quot;</p>

		<p>I could imagine a situation where you need an application to monitor the physical disk space. &nbsp;For example, say you give 100 users a quota of 10GB. &nbsp;You don&#8217;t expect everybody to use the full 10GB, so you don&#8217;t have a terrabyte drive set up. &nbsp;You might have an application monitor the total free disk space and e-mail you when it starts to get low.</p>
