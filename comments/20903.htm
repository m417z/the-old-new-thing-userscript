		<p>I can&#8217;t believe no one&#8217;s pointed out the missing word in the story. That&#8217;s a first&#8230;</p>
<p>Usually people will jump all over it in order to feel superior over Mr Chen.</p>
<p>ER? Wow it&#8217;s still on? It must be the longest TV series of all time. I remember watching it when I was a kid.</p>

		<p>One word: Nielsen.</p>
<p>I suspect that the success of a show is directly proportional to the amount of boobies (or possibly explosions) in said show.</p>
<p>See also: Idiocracy.</p>

		<p>On most shows, they&#8217;re usually models-posing-as-X, not just ER.</p>
<p>I especially love CSI for this. &nbsp;Do medical examiners about to get covered in blood and guts wear expensive light-tan suits out in the Florida heat? &nbsp;Do the field criminalists wear high heels&#8230; ON THE BEACH?</p>

		<p>I always liked his character, but had no idea ER was still going. I haven&#8217;t watched an episode for years (I&#8217;d catch it occasionally when my brother was watching, but we don&#8217;t live in the same house any more.) I&#8217;ll keep an eye out for the return, though!</p>
<p>John has a point about the proportionality there; I suppose the logical conclusion is for somebody to produce the ultimate TV show, combining the two: exploding boobies! This could, of course, turn out to be one of those cases where the combination is worth less than the individual elements&#8230;</p>

		<p>Kind of like asking a newly minted CS graduate to come up with an architecture for a software product, you&#8217;ll get whatever hotness they have read about most recently as opposed to something that might actually work.</p>

		<p>I would say the Tonight Show would be the longest running show. &nbsp;But you also day time soap operas &nbsp;*gag* and the Simpson&#8217;s.</p>

		<p>The best part of that show when it was still good was when Noah Wylie was *officially* a doctor and some guy comes to the ER in horrible shape, chaos, and he yells &quot;Someone GET A Doctor!&quot;, and the nurse grabs his wrist and says &quot;YOU are the doctor&quot;. Classic. That was back when the show was good.</p>

		<p>Andrew:</p>
<p>As opposed to the highly experienced developer, who will recommend the same thing he always recommends: his own personal specialty.</p>
<p>When the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Then you learn that not everything is a nail. But over time, you begin to realise that everything can be /reduced/ to a /series/ of nails&#8230;</p>

		<p>As one of those two people referred to in Raymond&#8217;s linked post, I can only say &quot;Ouch!&quot;.</p>
<p>Make that a double ouch, actually.</p>

		<p>Wow and there was me thinking that the show was an fictional entertainment piece instead of reality show. I think someone needs to get out a little more.</p>

		<p>The problem with professional doctors is that most of them just say you have the $mostCommonIllness which out making a real diagnosis.</p>
<p>Most time they are right, but only due to statistical reasons, not because choose what matches the symptoms best.</p>

		<p>Yeah, I thought he had been killed off, maybe it&#8217;s the old identical twin, or Dr. Corday will wake up and find him coming out of the shower and say &#8216;I just had a horrible dream where you died and then everything that happened in the E.R. started happening again every few years with different people but an identical dynamic&#8217;.</p>

		<p>Apparently, anti-youth bias is common in the medical community.</p>
<p>My boss had worked as an IT consultant on a health informatics project, and early on he had to go to meet with some doctors. In the middle of the meeting table was a chart with names and a bunch of gold stars. He asked one of the doctors what the chart was for and was told that they represented how many years of experience each of the doctors had, so they would know how valid a doctor&#8217;s opinion was.</p>

<p>There was a great example in &quot;Never say never&quot; Bond movie.</p>

		<p>&quot;But over time, you begin to realise that everything can be /reduced/ to a /series/ of nails&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>This is why I read the comments here. That&#8217;s hilarious.</p>
<p>re ER: I&#8217;m always struck that they never wear their surgical masks during surgery. (I realize it&#8217;s so you can see the actors&#8217; faces.)</p>
