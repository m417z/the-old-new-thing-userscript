		<p>Interesting.  I&#8217;m still a bit confused though.  You say that Windows sends extra WM_MOUSEMOVE messages for things like showing, hiding, etc.  However, if you use Spy++ and monitor pretty much any window, you&#8217;ll see that even if the mouse is just sitting over the window (without moving), that window gets about two WM_MOUSEMOVE message every second.  What sort of things does Windows need to do when the mouse is stationary?</p>
<p>So, is this basically a case where new functions got grafted onto the OS and the programmers found that WM_MOUSEMOVE was a convenient place to hook into without causing compatibility problems?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not getting any WM_MOUSEMOVE messages when the machine is idle and the mouse isn&#8217;t moving. Perhaps there is some &quot;mouse enhancement&quot; program that is causing this.</p>

		<p>I got bit badly by this on a custom project a while back. I needed to detect when the user was not doing anything with the computer, so I installed systemwide hooks to watch for keyboard and mouse messages. It worked fine except in some rare situations. Finally we figured out that my code was getting tripped up when an OpenGL screen saver was running: It was getting WM_MOUSEMOVE messages repeatedly at the same cursor position. So I put in the test to see if the mouse position had actually changed, and all was well after that.</p>

		<p>I went and tried the Spy++ experiment again today.  For some reason, I had very little activity.  I will check this out from time to time to see if I can find any reason why I had 2 WM_MOUSEMOVE messages a second yesterday (with the mouse stationary) and only one every few seconds today.  As for &quot;mouse enhancement&quot;, I&#8217;m not running anything I&#8217;m aware of.  I&#8217;ll double check and see what I can find.</p>

		<p>I had this problem. I was getting at least 2 WM_MOUSEMOVE messages every second to any window in my application when the mouse was over it, even if the mouse was not moving. </p>
<p>Could not track down the problem any where.</p>
<p>After about an hour or two of trying (and reading this page) I noticed PeterM had the problem go away the next day.</p>
<p>I went for a total restart of my machine, and Dev environment, and the problem went away. I suspect that it was either a problem with the Dev Environment (MSVC++), or something deeper in the OS. </p>
<p>If you get this problem, i sugest you try a restart before spending 2 hours on trying to find the cause.</p>
