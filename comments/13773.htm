		<p>Sounds like you need to change the bug tracking system so that anyone can work on any bug that hasn&#39;t got any active checkouts against it. You&#39;ll still get a few people checking code out and sitting on that, but that&#39;s sufficiently obviously antisocial that it&#39;ll reduce the problem.</p>

		<p>What sort of pitiful source control system would allow such anti-social behavior to be anti-social? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Anyways around here, I lump such behavior in with &quot;Cookie Licking&quot;.</p>

		<p>We&#39;ve done well with a &quot;zero bug&quot; policy around here. &nbsp;If you have bugs assigned to you, you&#39;re not allowed to work on any new feature until your bug count goes to zero.</p>

		<p>Brian: so, whenever a new cool feature is coming up for grab, you can simply assign bugs to anyone who might want to implement the feature so that you;re the only free? You can even keep a herd of sumarine low-impact bugs that you know of but haven&#39;t yet entered in the bug tracking system for just such purpose. Any system can be subverted. :)</p>

		<p>@Brian: That system might work where all bugs are accurate and detailed, with reliable repros. If the bug is vague, or the repro conditions are unknown and the occurrence rate is very low, stabbing blindly in the dark is not exactly going to help matters. You may as well work on features rather than banging your head against a wall. And of course, fixing really minor complicated bugs (say, a userland crash on application exit that occurs on less than 0.1% of exits and has no lasting effects) won&#39;t improve perception of your product as much as a good new feature. Zero bug policies sound nice in theory, but they&#39;re impractical in most real world scenarios (exceptions made for certain types of embedded software designed to rigorous standards with minimal user interaction, e.g. air traffic control software).</p>

		<p>Bug hugging in a small team can be essential. Especially when your team mate(s) should be regular contributors to <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://thedailywtf.com" rel="nofollow">http://thedailywtf.com</a>.</p>
<p>@Pierre: TANSTAFL, but sometimes you can get discounts.</p>

		<p>Bug hugging becomes prevalent when management is incompetent. If the boss is a technical coach instead of a traditional slave whipper, and the team is cleansed from jackasses, then the team members gets confident enough to openly discuss any bug with the boss &amp; other team members. When team members are punished for bugs, then there will always be lot of bug hugging.</p>

		<p>No bug hugging here. We routinely list the bugs according to their age and eliminate these. (Reassign, cancel, whatever&#8230;) But it is a nice expression.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m going to have to use this term. Having a term alters people&#39;s thinking of a problem sometimes.</p>
<p>At my current workplace, this effect is caused by management. We have a lot of enhancement requests disguised as bugs, internal bugs that don&#39;t effect the customer and bugs from very old versions. The programmers would like to fix or close them all, but many of them are never closed or assigned to a release from a fear of offending the person who raised it, or offending the project manager running a specific release. It&#39;s quite frustrating having a backlog that you&#39;re officially ignoring.</p>

		<p>Wouldn&#39;t bug-hogging make more sense as a term? It uses two words in their existing meanings, instead of adding a new meaning to &#39;hugging&#39;. Therefore I vote you start spreading &#39;bug-hogging&#39; while the current term hasn&#39;t been ingrained yet. ;-)</p>

		<p>I suppose the viewpoint on the bug hugger&#39;s side is that those bugs now have sentimental value&#8230;</p>

		<p>It&#39;s only worse when the person whose name is assigned to the bug doesn&#39;t work for the company anymore.</p>
<p>This is where it&#39;s up to the managers to be more on top of their bug lists. The malaise that grows when devs see an ever-growing assigned bug count when there is no way to turn the tide probably contributes to employee departure.</p>

		<p>I find &quot;bug-hugging&quot; difficult to pronounce. &nbsp;This seems like a term which might arise in email, but not migrate easily to spoken form.</p>
<p>As a professional technical writer, I strongly suggest that you use &quot;bug-clutching&quot; instead. &nbsp;This means the same thing, but rolls off the tongue more easily. Strongly, strongly suggest. Yep.</p>
