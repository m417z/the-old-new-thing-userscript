		<p>Hey, I learnt something new today!</p>
<p>You can actually allocate TWO DCs for the same window at the same time? I always found ONE DC to be sufficient for me, no matter how complicated the drawing. But then, I am no Picasso!</p>

		<p>I wondered if using two DCs would be quicker so I measured it. &nbsp;Using one DC (and repeatedly switching the font) the painting takes about 36% more time than using two DCs. &nbsp;YMMV.<br /></p>

		<p>Little bit of trivia: the only part of Windows that uses CS_OWNDC exclusively are the console windows (go on, have a look with Spy++), altough I&#8217;m not exactly sure why (I suppose to allow drawing from outside the window&#8217;s thread? or maybe for performance?). It&#8217;s one of the many ways console windows are &quot;special&quot;</p>

		<p>Another standard Windows app which makes use of the class is Windows Media Player 10. Curious, I checked and the old WMP 6.4 (mplayer2.exe) also uses the class.</p>
<p>Would this be related to the video playback they do? I assume WMP 6.4 also uses DirectPlay for video playback; does using DirectX make a difference?</p>

		<p>&#8220;but the underlying principle remains: DCs should not be allocated carelessly&#8221; </p>
<p>(I don&#8217;t claim to know much about Windows API programming). </p>
<p>When I was first learning about how to program the Windows API on Win 3.1 I took this advice to heart and always freed my DCs as soon as possible. This made sense considering all the memory limits in Windows 3.1. </p>
<p>Now, Raymond, who clearly knows what he&#8217;s talking about, says &#8220;but the underlying principle remains: DCs should not be allocated carelessly&#8221;. In today&#8217;s virtual memory based Windows, why is this true? In other words, why are DCs, and the memory they require, more critical than any other kind of Windows API data structure? Why can&#8217;t they be allocated and managed dynamically? On a system with free memory why can&#8217;t you have a gazillion DCs? </p>
<p>(Again, I&#8217;m asking because I&#8217;d like to know. I&#8217;m not questioning anybody&#8217;s knowledge). </p>

		<p>Interesting post Raymond.</p>
<p>I have never created more than one DC for a Window. &nbsp;Instead, I always end up selecting and deselecting the attributes that I need. &nbsp;It&#8217;s just the way I think.</p>
<p>Basically, I would end up selecting and deselecting the two different fonts within the for loop. &nbsp;Maybe there are side-effects to this?</p>
<p>It always seemed wasteful to use two DCs with different attributes. &nbsp;However, that&#8217;s *part* of what a DC is for right? &nbsp;</p>
<p>Perhaps the FunnyDraw function could use SaveDC/RestoreDC to operate properly.</p>

		<p>Semi-off-topic (i.e. not the point you were aiming for) but there&#8217;s<br />
another good reason to *always* release resources in the opposite order<br />
you acquired them. Although it wouldn&#8217;t fix the printing problem, the<br />
DC would at least have been returned in it&#8217;s original state if the<br />
cleanup was written as:</p>
<p>SelectFont(hdc2, hfPrev2);<br />
<br />ReleaseDC(hwnd, hdc2);<br />
<br /> &nbsp;<br />
<br />SetTextAlign(hdc1, taPrev1);<br />
<br />SelectFont(hdc1, hfPrev1);<br />
<br />ReleaseDC(hwnd, hdc1);</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Actually I did that on purpose specifically because it caused<br />
the &#8220;dirty DC&#8221; problem. A naive reading would say that we did clean up<br />
in reverse order &#8211; if you look at it on a per-DC basis. (Well, okay, I<br />
restored text alignment out of order.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Wow, like the others, I&#8217;m surprised by the ability to use multiple DC&#8217;s&#8230; That could have made life easier for sure.</p>
<p>SaveDC and RestoreDC were mentioned already&#8230; I&#8217;m surprised those aren&#8217;t more widely used as well. &nbsp;When I first found those, it was a hallelujah moment. &nbsp;Why bother keeping track of old objects yourself, making your code bulkier, more complex and potentially introduce bugs, when you can just reset it they way it was with one call before leaving a function. &nbsp;It&#8217;s stack-based too.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flounder.com/badprogram.htm#Using%20GetDC" target="_new" rel="nofollow">http://www.flounder.com/badprogram.htm#Using%20GetDC</a> </p>
<p>I<br />
think one point Flounder makes that&#8217;s a good one: using CClientDC<br />
rather than GetDC. &nbsp;Obviously it&#8217;s a dumb mistake to not call<br />
ReleaseDC, but&#8230;.people make mistakes. &nbsp;I&#8217;d rather have scope<br />
handle the dirty work. &nbsp;Your posted &#8220;FunnyDraw&#8221; method would be a<br />
few lines shorter, and more resiliant to changes by People Who Don&#8217;t<br />

		<p>Most sample code that I&#8217;ve seen doesn&#8217;t bother to restore the DC to its original state (bitmaps, pens, fonts, etc) prior to releasing it. &nbsp;They just assume that Windows will &quot;reset&quot; the DC when it&#8217;s no longer being used by anyone, just like everything else.</p>

<p>Typically OpenGL applications require CS_OWNDC. The general process would be to choose and set the pixel format of the DC, then bind the OpenGL Resource Context to the DC (using wglMakeCurrent).</p>

		<p>Ah yes, CS_OWNDC. &nbsp;I used to work at a software company which produced massive VB6-based applications. &nbsp;Virtually *all* of the app&#8217;s windows had CS_OWNDC (at least on NT&#8211;we didn&#8217;t support our app on 9x). &nbsp;And people wondered why our app was reaching the limit of 10000 GDI handle per process&#8230;</p>

		<p>PatriotB &#8212; VB 6 Forms and UserControls have a property called HasDC which sets the CS_OWNDC class bit when set to true. &nbsp;Of course it defaults to true as well instead of false. &nbsp;I can remember going through this issue for one of our apps that would absolutely smash the GDI heap limits on Win 9x. &nbsp;This was in a large system with a large number of VB custom controls used on a large number of forms.</p>
<p>I never figured out why they defaulted it to true. &nbsp;It seems to be wrong. &nbsp;If you are doing something specific that requires the class bit, you should know enough to turn it on&#8230;</p>

		<p>Billy &#8212; according to this:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.vbwm.com/art_1999/whatsnew/hasdc.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.vbwm.com/art_1999/whatsnew/hasdc.asp</a></p>
<p>it defaults to True so that the behavior is the same as in older VB versions (and so that the HDC property returns a value that can be cached; not that anyone should be using the HDC property anyway).</p>
<p>Now as to why it was set that way in older VB versions, I&#8217;m not sure&#8230;</p>

		<p>Suppose you are writing a graphics intensive application, like a photo editing app or a game, wouldn&#8217;t that be a good time to use CS_OWNDC? As long as you don&#8217;t try to get multiple DCs for your window, you should be fine, right? Or am I missing something?</p>
<p>Also, I thought one of the benefits of CS_OWNDC was that you can get the DC once after you created the window and then use it throughout your application, without further calls to GetDC or BeginPaint. That&#8217;s pretty much what the documentation says. Is that correct?</p>

		<p>&#8220;[You should allocate anything carelessly. DCs are a subset of &#8220;anything&#8221;. -Raymond]&#8221; </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll presume that Raymond accidently left out the word &#8220;not&#8221; from this. <br />But, the fact remains that there&#8217;s something unusual about DCs even in a virtual memory environment. It&#8217;s obvious that nothing should be allocated carelessly but I get the impression that it would be worse if I allocated 10,000 DCs than 10,000 buffers containing the string &#8220;The Old New Thing&#8221;. Right? Why?</p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>Those 10,000 string buffers impact only your process. DCs are cross-process objects. It&#8217;s not the memory usage that&#8217;s the limiting factor; it&#8217;s the address space. -Raymond</i>]</div>

<p>I&#8217;m still missing part of this.</p>
<p>If a DC isn&#8217;t cleaned up before being released, then a corrupted DC<br />
  goes into a per-thread cache. &nbsp;Therefore it seems likely that all<br />
  released DCs, corrupted or not, go into a per-thread cache.</p>
<p>When do DCs become cross-process objects? &nbsp;When they&#8217;re<br />
  acquired they become cross-process but when they&#8217;re released they go<br />
  into a per-thread cache? &nbsp;(I sure hope not, I sure hope this<br />
  logical inference is as illogical to you as it is to me.) &nbsp;Do<br />
  CS_OWNDC windows do something to turn their DCs into cross-process<br />
  objects?</p>
<p>And Reinder&#8217;s question still seems relevant, if DCs are cross-process objects.</p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>Well, some experimentation tells me that DCs are not cross-process after all (they were in Windows 3.1), so I apologize for the misinformation. I am not a substitute for formal documentation.</p>
<p>  By &#8220;cross-process&#8221; I meant that a DC handle, once created, is valid in any process. (This was true in Windows 3.1 though apparently not any more.) The handle doesn&#8217;t &#8220;become&#8221; cross-process any more than a window handle &#8220;becomes&#8221; cross-process. The DC cache is per-thread (or at least was in Windows 3.1; things may be different nowadays). If a thread calls &#8220;GetDC&#8221;, it looks in the cache of DCs recently released by that thread. The two concepts (visibility and cache affinity) are unrelated. Passports are per-country but are globally valid &#8211; nobody seems confused by that. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>So the way I understand what you&#8217;re saying, thread 2 always gets a<br />
different DC than thread 1; thread 2&#8217;s DC will never be dirty (have the<br />
wrong object(s) selected into it) unless thread 2 left it that way<br />
itself.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Or unless you&#8217;re using CS_OWNDC or CS_CLASSDC, which was the point of this mini-series. -Raymond</i>]</div>
<p>Not that this excuses any practice of releasing dirty DCs, but at least you won&#8217;t be breaking anyone else&#8217;s window.</p>
<p>Actually, re-reading the comments here, it seems you said that at<br />
least once before, way back up under Reinder&#8217;s comment June 1.<br />
&nbsp;Hmm.</p>

		<p>I *think* Norman meant a scenario like this (if not, I&#8217;m wondering what happens):</p>
<p>Thread 1 calls GetDC, selects some object into the returned DC, and<br />
releases it. &nbsp;The DC gets put back into thread 1&#8217;s cache, in a<br />
&#8220;dirty&#8221; state.</p>
<p>Then, thread 2 gets a DC for the same window (&#8230;is this even<br />
legal, since the window is owned by thread 1?). &nbsp;No DC for that<br />
window exists in thread 2&#8217;s cache. &nbsp;Does it get the dirty DC that<br />
thread 1 released, or does the window manager create a new DC? &nbsp;If<br />
thread 2 gets the dirty DC, does it get a clean one after the dirty one<br />
ages out of thread 1&#8217;s cache?</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Thread 2 can&#8217;t see thread 1&#8217;s cache. There could be a<br />
kangaroo in thread 1&#8217;s cache, it won&#8217;t have any effect on thread 2.<br />
Note that the fact that the cache is per-thread is an implementation<br />
detail and can change at any time. In fact, it may have already changed<br />
and I simply haven&#8217;t noticed. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>&gt; Formal documentation is not going to say &quot;CS_CLASSDC is hard to use<br />
<br />&gt; correctly, so be careful.&quot; </p>
<p>Why not? &nbsp;If it&#8217;s true, it should. &nbsp;Many people are only ever exposed to the formal documentation, and don&#8217;t see the informal docs that say &quot;but wait, you shouldn&#8217;t use it like *this*&quot;.</p>

		<p>I agree with Miral. &nbsp;In fact some pages in MSDN say that certain items are defined only for backwards compatibility with 16-bit Windows and new applications should not use them. &nbsp;I think such notices have even been added to more pages recently, belatedly but better than never.</p>
