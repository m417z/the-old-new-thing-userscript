		<p>I know little about Outlook, but I&#8217;ve seen extensions causing all sorts of folder issues &#8211; have you tried safe mode (outlook /safe)?</p>

		<p>This is one of the reasons I keep a VPC image around with the final version of Exchange 5.0 client from Outlook 97 SR-2. &nbsp;It has no problems deleting anything. &nbsp;Also it lets you move multiple folders around in an explorer like folder list view. &nbsp;For some reason these features were removed within Outlook.</p>

		<p>whenever I&#8217;ve had a folder Outlook won&#8217;t let me delete, I&#8217;ve been able to do so with Outlook Web Access. Could try that.</p>

		<p>I have an unrenameable Outlook folder. Once upon a time, many years ago, Exchange dogfood had a little amnesia, and decided my Drafts folder was a regular mail folder, noticed I didn&#8217;t have a folder for drafts, so created a new folder which of course had to be called Drafts1. This setup has survived server moves and upgrades. I left the regular folder in place hoping, oh, I don&#8217;t know, maybe one day some fairy godmother would come along and restore the canonical state of affairs.</p>
<p>But even if I move the regular folder &quot;Drafts&quot; to trash (which I can), it won&#8217;t let me rename Drafts1 because, you know, you can&#8217;t delete or rename a special folder. Even if it doesn&#8217;t have the right name.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a little oddity that I have no problem living with.</p>

		<p>David: If it even annoys you a little, you can run: &quot;outlook.exe /resetfoldernames&quot; which will (unsurprisingly enough), reset all the special folder names to the originals.</p>

<p>Funny, like if there was ever a way to rename them in the first place?!?</p>

		<p>There is a way to rename Outlook&#8217;s special folders. &nbsp;When installing the English language pack on a client, it even changes the folder names for that user on servers that it can access. &nbsp;(I don&#8217;t know what happens if a server isn&#8217;t accessible at the time the language pack is installed.)</p>

		<p>We just recently had a hell of a time setting up a front-end Exchange server for OWA. We don&#8217;t have an SSL certificate yet (don&#8217;t ask, the beaurocracy here is ridiculous), so we had forms based authentication disabled. It would not let us login even from the front-end server, though we could log in to the backend server fine. After a couple weeks of messing with it, someone had the bright idea of turning on forms based authentication even though it&#8217;s only for use with SSL, and viola, it works like a charm.</p>
<p>Now we can wait a year to get approval for the SSL certificate through the chain of command, and see if that breaks anything new. :P</p>

		<p>Igor, the outlook.exe /resetfoldernames option is specifically to fix localisation issues.</p>
<p>For instance if I use a Dutch version of Outlook and I connect to my Exchange mailbox for the first time, it will create Dutch folder names as it should. But if someone sends me an e-mail before I have ever connected, the folders will be created using the language of Exchange, usually English.</p>
<p>In this case /resetfoldernames would allow me to recreate them in Dutch.</p>

		<p>I have to say, the &quot;eat your own dogfood&quot; ethos in MS is one of the things that really impresses me.</p>

		<p>OWA is much better at deleting errant folders than Outlook.</p>
