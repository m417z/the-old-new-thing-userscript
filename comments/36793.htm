		<p>Rock on Raymond, for the appreciation.<br />
<br /> I&#8217;m actually a circus performer myself, based in Montreal, Canada. I do silks. I kind of stumbled into it about 3 years ago completely at random. Just had never even crossed my mind up till that point.<br />
<br /> It turns out it&#8217;s &#8216;easy&#8217;. In that I&#8217;ve been training for 3 years (3~4 hours a day I must add), and despite being 25 I&#8217;m pretty much a professional now. I had some background in the arts, but really nothing intense like gymnastics or ballet.<br />
<br /> I still make my bread money by programming about a 3rd of my time&#8230;<br />
<br /> If you want to check out the school, go right ahead, you are bound to meet cool people who most likely will be as varied in backgrounds as you can imagine: when I first went to a recreational school, there was a surprising amount of technical oriented people (e.g. doctors, programmers etc)</p>
<p> Anyways, thanks again for being appreciative about it.</p>

		<p>Being high up isn&#8217;t as scary as you might think&#8230; or rather, it&#8217;s not scary in the way you might expect.</p>
<p> My last gig was at around 40 feet, and looking down, it really looks ok. The really freaky part is looking up because you are so close to things that really should not be close to you: for example you can see all the little details of the lighting grid, the lights themselves (which are actually pretty big, and very hot), and even fire sprinklers. They&#8217;re just there about 4 feet from your reach, and when you stop and think about it, you really wonder what the heck you&#8217;re doing up there =)<br />
<br /> But then your music cues in, and perform you go =)</p>

		<p>They had a trapeze school set up by the Hudson river (I think) in NYC over the summer. I wonder if that&#8217;s the new fad, or if it&#8217;s over by now?</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s also the Florida State Circus:<br />
<br /><a target="_new" href="http://www.circus.fsu.edu/" rel="nofollow">http://www.circus.fsu.edu/</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s open to any student who wants to learn to perform an act.<br /></p>

		<p>As an alumni myself, I recommend the Wenatchee Youth Circus for all those people in Washington.  I spent some good summers with them in my youth.  They usually do a show for Renton River Days if you want to check them out and live near enough.</p>
