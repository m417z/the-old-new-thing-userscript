		<p>Living in St. Louis, (and attending college here, even if we didn&#8217;t even make the NIT) Basketball Fever has certainly swept the city.  The Teams are arriving, albiet only the &quot;small&quot; underdogs are here now.  A recent report suggested that 40,000+ people will come here this weekend bringing in over $60 million in Revenue.  Now all I need to do is manage to scrape a few &quot;cheap&quot; tickets off some college kid whose team just lost.  I figure my Dad, youuger brotehr and I are going down to &quot;Hoop City&quot; the day of the game, it can&#8217;t hurt to try. ;)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m suprised there aren&#8217;t more posts. An entertaining read, thanks.</p>

		<p>I would have posted earlier, but I&#8217;ve been too caught up in reading articles about Louisville today.  The whole city is basically at a standstill.  But that&#8217;s a great read.  I&#8217;ve noticed this myself during games.  I&#8217;ve seen a few college games where they&#8217;ve figured this out.</p>
<p>That being said, Go cards!</p>
