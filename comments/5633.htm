		<p>This first linkers I used baack in the early 80&#39;s were even simpler than this classical model: &nbsp;they would only make a single pass through the LIB files and if anything was undefined, they&#39;d indicate an error. &nbsp;It was necessary with these linkers to include a module in a library more than once in order to handle circular dependencies. &nbsp;This was in the CP/M-80 days when the most popular languange compiler around was Digital Research Pascal/MT+.</p>

		<p>Another non-classical behavior: weak symbols vs. strong symbols. &nbsp;Symbols are strong by default and can be marked as weak with the <strong>attribute</strong>((weak)) syntax in GCC and GCC-like compilers (I&#39;m unsure if any of the Microsoft compilers support a similar feature).</p>
<p>If the symbol is already in the module marked as resolved:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>If both the original symbol and the new symbol are marked <strong>attribute</strong>((weak)), then do not raise an error. &nbsp;Pick one arbitrarily and discard the other.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If one of the original symbol and the new symbol is marked <strong>attribute</strong>((weak)), then do not raise an error. &nbsp;Pick the strong symbol and discard the weak symbol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, raise an error complaining that an object has multiple definitions.</p>
</li>
</ul>

		<p>While we&#39;re still at groundwork, let&#39;s make it explicit: &quot;symbols&quot; to a classical linker are just functions and variables. Constants already get tricky.</p>
<p>Personally the most surprising thing was the fact that linkers link OBJ files, not functions and variables. And even with /Gy and /OPT:REF linking still doesn&#39;t work by starting at main() and recursively adding to that.</p>

		<p>What is the use-case for __select_any? I&#39;ve written C/C++ for years, and I can&#39;t for the life of me think of a good reason for it, other than to introduce non-deterministic bugs to your build.</p>

		<p>Ok &#8211; according to the MSDN documentation:</p>
<p>&quot;A global data item can normally be initialized only once in an EXE or DLL project. selectany can be used in initializing global data defined by headers, when the same header appears in more than one source file. selectany is available in both the C and C++ compilers.&quot;</p>
<p>So basically it&#39;s so you can do &quot;int MyExternVar = 0;&quot; in a header and not get the linker to explode with errors telling you that every C file is defining overlapping &quot;MyExternVar&quot;s.</p>

		<p>@Matt: I wouldn&#39;t have dared use it for variables as the compiler is allowed to direct-bind within an .OBJ file, but for functions declared in header files nothing can really go wrong.</p>

<p>From what I recall, that&#39;s not true. &nbsp;A constant is just an absolute symbol, a variable is a relocatable symbol.</p>
<p>(Based on vague memories of the linkers I used in the mid-1970s, which I think are old enough to be called classical)</p>

		<p>@Evan: In MSVC __inline or __forceinline functions don&#39;t get external linkage &#8211; they get immediately inlined during compilation of the function. I use __forceinline functions in headers all the time and never even thought that selectany might exist.</p>

		<p>I was always wondering why the linker first links everything and then eliminates unused instead doing it the other way around &#8211; starting from a known entry point and then adding only referred segments.</p>
<p>As for the &quot;Packed functions&quot; and &quot;selectany&quot;, I believe an OBJ file with multiple segments and/or common linkage were always supported, the only question was why compilers didn&#39;t use it.</p>

		<p>One more comment on &quot;inline&quot; for the moment.</p>
<p>C++03 standard, 7.1.2 [Function specifiers], footnote #79: &quot;The &#39;inline&#39; keyword has no effect on the linkage of a function&quot;. Para 4: &quot;If a function with external linkage is declared inline in one translation unit, it shall be declared inline in all translation units in which it appears; no diagnostic is required. An inline function with external linkage shall have the same address in all translation units. A static local variable in an extern inline function always refers to the same object. A string literal in an extern inline function is the same object in different translation units.&quot;</p>
<p>So I stand by my earlier statement that C++03 &#39;inline&#39; will leave functions with external linkage, and because of the other requirements of that paragraph you need something like &#39;selectany&#39;.</p>
<p>What MSVC does is a somewhat different matter.</p>

		<p>Some linkage models also keep a list of required symbols per symbol rather than per OBJ. This leads to less spurious dependency growth. You can get this behavior in gcc by passing -ffunction-sections.</p>
<p>Other linkage models require the symbol to be found in a container of a specific name (spwcific dynlib) which cuts down on sprouts breakage when unrelated libraries introduce clashing symbol names.</p>
<p>Both of these are, IMO, significant improvements over the classic Unix model.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve used __declspec(selectany) many times when I needed a module-wide global var. Easier than having it once in a .h, and actually declared in a .c[pp] (or doing macro-trickery to achieve that). Just need to be careful not to include the .h in multiple modules, since each one will get its own instance of the global var, which may not be what you want.</p>

		<p>@Matt:</p>
<p>The thing that made selectany necessary I suspect was templates. (I&#39;m familiar with a mechanism of similar description to selectany but am not familiar enough with MSVC specifically to know if that&#39;s what the exact mechanism it uses in the following situation.) Basically the only way that templates work (ignoring &#39;export&#39; which almost no one supports anyway) is by putting the template definitions in headers. Each compilation unit in which the template is instantiated will have the symbols. If I have foo.cpp with a call to &#39;vector&lt;int&gt;::push_back(int)&#39; and bar.cpp with a call to &#39;vector&lt;int&gt;::push_back(int)&#39;, then the compiler will instantiate that function in both compilation units, generating code in both. Under the classical model, at link time: poof, duplicate definition.*</p>
<p>There are other places it gets used &#8212; in particular, functions defined in headers (e.g. because you want them inlined) &#8212; but templates are what basically forced the linker&#39;s hand and left little choice.</p>
<p>* The reason that this is basically how templates *have* to work is the following. Let&#39;s suppose you are defining some &#39;template&lt;typename T&gt; class MyVector&#39; in MyVector.cpp, and instantiating it with &#39;MyVector&lt;string&gt;&#39; and &#39;MyVector&lt;int&gt;&#39; in Stuff.cpp. (There would be a non-defining declaration in MyVector.hpp that&#39;s included from Stuff.cpp.) The compiler never knows what it needs to do! When compiling &#39;MyVector.cpp&#39; it knows what the C++ code for the MyVector template is, but it doesn&#39;t know what types it must instantiate it with. (Each instantiation gets separate generated code.) When compiling &#39;Stuff.cpp&#39; it knows what types &#39;MyVector&#39; has been instantiated with, but it doesn&#39;t know what the C++ code is and so can&#39;t do the instantiation! The only resolutions are (1) to require that the C++ code and instantiations are co-located (which is usually done by putting the definitions of the template into the header file), or (2) to have the compiler produce a list of instantiations which should be done at link time. The latter puts a lot of burden on the linker and will make links take potentially a long time.</p>

		<p>@Matt:</p>
<p>I&#39;m not positive about this (there is conflicting information), but in C++, functions marked &#39;inline&#39; still have external linkage. I didn&#39;t test, but from the MSDN docs it seems that MSVC is non-compliant in this regard (assuming that I&#39;m correct). I also can&#39;t speak to __inline/__forceinline. This can arise if the compiler refuses to inline the function for some reason, or if the address of the function is taken: my understanding is that the address of even an inline function &#39;foo&#39; is guaranteed to be the same across compilation units. For the same reasons that templates force &#39;selectany&#39;, so does this: the compiler must generate code for &#39;foo&#39; in each compilation unit in which its address is taken, but it must merge those definitions at link time.</p>
<p>Even if the above is untrue for C++98/03, it is true in C++11.</p>
<p>In C, this is not true, and &#39;inline&#39; functions have internal linkage.</p>
<p>However, I believe that even in MSVC there is a case where this occurs, which is member functions defined inline in a class (&#39;class C { int random() { return 9; } };&#39;). What the standard says about the linkage of *these* functions is much less conflicted, and they get external linkage &#8212; and thus multiple definitions require collapsing duplicated symbols.</p>
