		<p>The question should have been: &quot;Why these were turned on behind our backs?&quot;</p>

		<p>It&#39;s amazing that programmers (I&#39;m assuming that, since they were colleagues of Raymond&#39;s) didn&#39;t ask a search engine if they could turn off e-mail notifications. &nbsp;Yet I have seen that often. &nbsp;There are smart people who don&#39;t think about searching the Web for solutions to common complaints they have! </p>

		<p>I&#39;ve been using Windows Phone since 7.5, the emails were enabled by default then (and I assume probably always), I didn&#39;t think it was that big of a deal to click the link at the bottom of every email they send out to disable them if you wanted to&#8230; You can also setup an Outlook &quot;Sweeper&quot; in the web client to clean them up after a week which is pretty slick.</p>

		<p>@algr1:</p>
<p>Because the defaults are not designed for power users, they are designed for grandma (not the literal grandma but the typical user who is non-technical).</p>
<p>Grandma doesn&#39;t know that you can turn on reminders for birthdays. &nbsp;Grandma isn&#39;t going to know to ask if it is possible. &nbsp;Grandma just accepts the technology for what it is.</p>
<p>With features on by default Grandma sees what is possible. &nbsp;Being on by default can motivate Grandma to inquire how to turn it off (if desired), where as if features are off by default and the software sits idle then there is nothing motivating Grandma to ask questions. &nbsp;Remember, Grandma just accepts the technology as is.</p>

		<p>@eddie: The email reminder should be a checkbox when you enter the birthday.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Um, you never entered the birthday. Your contact added it to their profile. Or are you suggesting that when you add a new contact, a confirmation dialog appear that says &quot;Do you want a reminder on your new contact&#39;s birthday?

		<p>@Raymond: What profile? If a birthday is set for one of my contacts, it means I set it explicitly. Even if I did use FaceBook, I would never sync it to my contacts list/calendar. But yes, your solution is a good one.</p>

		<p>It isn&#39;t like Outlook.com doesn&#39;t tell you how to turn them off:</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>When: &nbsp;Monday, July 7, 2014 </p>
<p>Send an email</p>
<p>View contact profile</p>
<p>Edit birthday</p>
<p>Stop getting notifications</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>Tap &quot;Stop getting notifications.&quot;</p>
<p>Tap &quot;Get reminders for events and tasks&quot;</p>
<p>Tap &quot;Save.&quot;</p>
<p>I honestly don&#39;t see how that could be any more blatantly obvious.</p>

		<p>@Bruno&amp;Boots: The birthday calendar is automatically generated by your contacts&#39; data, either manually or from social networks. It&#39;s fine you don&#39;t care for Facebook, but Raymond was referring to the general service, where the birthday of a contact may or may not have been set by you. </p>
<p>The calendar service looks at your contact data and generates the birthday calendar, but it doesn&#39;t go the other way. The contacts service does not touch the calendar. There&#39;s no need to, the calendar takes care of itself. The reminders are all or nothing.</p>
<p>And if you don&#39;t want the birthday calendar at all, you can just remove the calendar from your Microsoft account completely. Problem solved. Instead of just filtering it out, go back to Options, click Birthday Calendar, then click Delete. When this is done, there is always a &quot;Birthday Calendar&quot; option in the Calendar&#39;s New menu. Making a new birthday calendar regenerates the calendar automatically from your contact data. Useful for troubleshooting the birthday calendar.</p>

<p>&gt; [I like how my attempt to create the most annoying dialog box imaginable was met with &quot;Yes, that&#39;s a good solution.&quot; -Raymond]</p>
<p>Perhaps that&#39;s the reason why W8 is not so good. Microsoft thinks about how to make the stupidest Windows ever but all the people want to have a bit more control about what&#39;s going on.</p>

		<p>I hope I could get the correct calendar on my WinPhone 8.1. It correctly gets Hong Kong weather information but chosen to get the Taiwan Holiday list instead of Hong Kong one. I can add that back myself on live calendar but no option is given on WinPhone Calendar App. That&#39;s not very helpful.</p>

		<p>Update: Opps. Now I found that my WinPhone Calendar synced with the live calendar and shows Hong Kong holiday. Apparently it takes some time. :)</p>
