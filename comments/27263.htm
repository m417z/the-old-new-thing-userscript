		<p>Is 6 supposed to be backwards-compatible with 5.82? I&#8217;ve had problems with using 5.82 structures with 6. It is understandable if it isn&#8217;t, since I need a manifest to get 6.</p>
<p>Also, what&#8217;s the common controls version in Vista? Is it still 6?</p>

		<p>By the way, I have to applaud the plunge you guys took regarding using SxS dlls for v5 vs. v6. &nbsp;I especially respect the &#8220;isolation aware&#8221; stuff, as it allowed DLL&#8217;s in our tools to use v6 features, while letting us take our time on transitioning everything else to v6.</p>
<p>I have to wonder, management-wise, how hard of a problem was the v5/v6 interop? &nbsp;Was it something that really manifested as an issue late in development, or was the full scope pretty much known at the beginning?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>v5/v6 interop was a huge undertaking. Your last question presents a false dichotomy. We knew up front that it would be a lot of work, but that doesn&#8217;t mean we understood the full scope up front. Do you ever know the full scope of a large undertaking before you begin? There are always unexpected problems that arise. -Raymond</i>]</div>

<p>Oh, I get that, I was just curious the level of planning that goes into an undertaking like this. &nbsp;Like was it &#8220;well, we&#8217;ll need some interop&#8221; or was it down to the nitty gritty of &#8220;property pages will need to be cross compatible&#8221; ? &nbsp;Also, was the dll-isolation-support planned from the get-go, so something that came of incompatibilities after implementation began?</p>
<p>To me, it could just be an interesting case-study into planning-and-consequences of things at Microsoft. &nbsp;And since this is relatively recent, it seems a bit more relevant given the maturity of the platform as compared to design decisions on Win16 or Win32. &nbsp;I&#8217;m not trying to grill you, but it seems to be one of the more impressive and risky gambits given the huge size of windows, and a peephole as to how it was pulled off so well could be a decent learning experience.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, when the price of admission is nothing, anything at all (including nothing itself) is worth the price of admission&#8230; usually considerably more.</p>

		<p>Raymond I&#8217;m sure he wasn&#8217;t asking you to write a white paper, he is,<br />
like myself, just curious about how things like this work.<br />
&nbsp;Unfortunatly there arn&#8217;t many people out there with this kind of<br />
knowledge! &nbsp;Anyway just an idea for a future blog post if you feel<br />
so inclined :)</p>

I&#8217;d have to interview people. It&#8217;s not like I attend every meeting and<br />

		<p>I have enough spare time to write a white paper for free. &nbsp;Of<br />
course the paper has to be white to start with. &nbsp;Guess what colour<br />
it will be when I&#8217;m done.</p>

		<p>Speak of the devil.</p>
<p>&gt; The solution was to use side-by-side assemblies.</p>
<p>&quot;Some people, faced with a problem, say &#8216;I know what, I&#8217;ll use regular expressions. &nbsp;Then they have two problems.&quot;</p>
<p>s/regular expressions/side-by-side/g</p>
<p>&gt; you can quickly find yourself in a case where</p>
<p>&gt; there is a hodgepodge of v5 and v6 components</p>
<p>&gt; all inside a single process, and they all have</p>
<p>&gt; to work with each other</p>
<p>Then maybe that&#8217;s the only case where they really work. &nbsp;I do have to congratulate you on getting it working.</p>

<p>Well I&#8217;m not holding my breath, but I at least wanted the request out there. &nbsp;At the very least, it may be something to expand on in further blog posts if you have the time. &nbsp;I would hope I&#8217;m speaking for a decent amount of people that finds this sort of talk interesting. &nbsp;Most of us don&#8217;t have the opportunity to work on projects with an impact on literally tens of millions of people.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s actually one of the more interesting threads on this blog for me, is seeing the butterfly effect of a lot of seemingly small changes/change requests. &nbsp;Most of the posts, though, are more in the vein of &#8220;we didn&#8217;t do this because,&#8221; so it&#8217;s a nice insight to see &#8220;we knew this would hurt, but we did it anyway.&#8221;</p>

		<p>What are the implications of using run-time linking with LoadLibrary (with and without manifest) to get comctl32? Because there&#8217;s no version number in LoadLibrary(TEXT(&#8220;COMCTL32.DLL&#8221;)).</p>
