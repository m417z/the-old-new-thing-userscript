		<p>For many people, permanent residency is the first (well, okay, next) step towards citizenship. Getting a green card begins the clock on a time period of, I believe, five years (IANAL), after which you can apply for citizenship if you kept your nose clean. So I wouldn&#39;t say the picture is entirely misleading.</p>
<p>I believe the really misleading part is that the real US lottery page is open and free to anybody, but these companies charge you a fee and all they do is go to the US government page and enter you into the lottery. Which you could do yourself. The lottery page even has a &quot;Check My Entry&quot; feature, so you can verify that your entry is in the lottery correctly. The ultimate in unnecessary middle-man services. I&#39;m guessing by the time you enter all the data plus your credit card info, you&#39;ve done more work on the third party site than you&#39;ve done on the US government site, and paid for the privilege.</p>

		<p>Green cards are green again- Although, they may not have been when you wrote this entry. &nbsp;The new ones were released May 11 of 2010.</p>

		<p>The only possible value-adds that somebody can reasonbly perform are translation services (i.e. you fill out a form in your native language and somebody else enters it into the English US Government web site) and asynchronous notification. It seems that the only way to know if you&#39;ve been selected in the lottery is to poll, so it might be nice to have somebody else do the polling for you.</p>

<p>As the warning Raymond links to points out, entering the lottery twice is against the rules.</p>

		<p>IBM produced a card listing the OpCodes and other developer information about their 360 mainframe. &nbsp;It was printed on green cardstock, and was generally known as a &quot;Green Card&quot;. &nbsp;When IBM created the 370, it switched to yellow cardstock. &nbsp;Nevertheless, programmer continued to call them Green cards even though many had never seen a green one. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Hence we have two different non-green documents known as &quot;green cards&quot;.</p>

		<p>@James, old-timers also refer to 3390 disks and object &quot;decks&quot; despite the fact that the underlying disk hardware is vastly changed and that a deck of puched cards hasn&#39;t been spotted in the wild since the 70s :-)</p>

		<p>Am I the only one who finds the term &#39;alien&#39; somewhat offensive when used describe someone who&#39;s living in the country but happens not to be a citizen? Citizens of foreign countries are after all just as much human as are US citizens, but to my ears the word &#39;alien&#39; carries connotations of non/sub-human. &nbsp;If I have to make the citizen/foreigner distinction, I&#39;d simply refer to people as &#39;foreigners&#39;</p>
<p>(It&#39;s possible this may be a dialect difference &#8211; I&#39;m from the UK. I haven&#39;t heard the term &#39;alien&#39; used nearly as often here as I see it used in the USA, so perhaps it doesn&#39;t carry the same connotations there?)</p>

		<p>The US has used the term &quot;aliens&quot; for hundreds of years to mean citizens of another country. The use of the term &quot;aliens&quot; has only be used to mean non-humans (extraterrestrials) since 1953 (according to <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=alien" rel="nofollow">http://www.etymonline.com/index.php</a>).</p>
<p>Incidentally, the term &quot;computer&quot; has also been used to refer to humans for hundreds of years, and has only come into common use to refer to non-humans since the last century.</p>

		<p>In reply to Simon R, we also have Aliens in the UK, a few of my friends back in Uni (&#39;90s) were American, and had to register as legal aliens&#8230; &nbsp;i guess what comes around goes around!</p>
<p>As an aside, not everyone is able to apply for a green card through the Green Card Lottery &#8211; in fact, if you are English, despite the &quot;special relationship&quot; that gets harped on about, you cannot apply through the Green Card Lottery, as in fact it is actually a &quot;Diversity Immigration Visa&quot;, and being English (although not British), there are too many English people in the USA, so allowing more in doesn&#39;t add to any ethnic diversity&#8230;.</p>

		<p>shadowfixer: It&#39;s not that there are too many English people in the USA, it&#39;s that too many English recently immigrated to the USA (over 50k in the last 5 years). If Englishmen would stop getting jobs in the US and bringing their wives and kids over, they would become eligible for the lottery.</p>
