		<p>It is amazing the number of C questions that can be answered: You engaged in undefined behavior. &nbsp;One possible value of undefined is &quot;It works as expected.&quot; Another is &quot;It doesn&#39;t.&quot;</p>
<p>Nitpickers corner: Even if coding in C++, anytime you use the Windows API, you are engaging in C programming because Windows uses a C API and very few people I have seen bother to do full on RAII around Windows API calls.</p>

		<p>&quot;Uninitialized garbage will contain unpredictable values. There&#39;s no point asking why you got a different unpredictable value this time.&quot;</p>
<p>True, but Microsoft has written compatibility shims for worse things in the past. I guess this guy just wasn&#39;t important enough.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Whether a compatibility shim exists for this issue is independent of the question &quot;Why did this change?&quot;, and &quot;Why did this change?&quot; was the topic for today, not &quot;<a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ff625273.aspx" rel="nofollow">Can we cajole the heap into behaving like it used to</a>?&quot; -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I have found that many developers around me translate &quot;undefined&quot; as &quot;random behavior&quot;, as in &quot;will not behave the same in each run&quot;. I think that&#39;s why so many people rely on implementation details: it works every time for them so &quot;obviously&quot; it is not undefined !</p>
<p>I try to correct this misconception every time I encounter it, but it is very common unfortunately.</p>

		<p>Sometimes I think everybody would be a lot better off if at some point Microsoft decided to shrug their shoulders and sell (but not support) every version of every Microsoft product that ever existed for something like its market price near the time of its obsolescence.</p>

		<p>Raymond, I read and love your blog. And this quote is the best : The change to Windows Vista that broke their program is known as &quot;luck running out.&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t about code reuse, but I known there&#39;s going to be a lot of quote reuse !</p>

		<p>The correct resolution for this would have been for the customer to fix their bug in both the XP and Vista versions of their software and then admit the mistake and move on. To place blame on Microsoft is garbage.</p>
<p>Too bad names aren&#39;t named, I would really like to stop supporting development houses that engage in this type of behavior (it was Microsoft&#39;s Fault our software is broken!). I understand your blog ground rules that forbid you from doing this, but one would hope that there is a site out there that would call these people out by name.</p>

		<p>Maybe the customer had that attitude &quot;if it isn&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it&quot; on XP, since it apparently worked. The proper attitude should be &quot;if it isn&#39;t broke, you haven&#39;t looked hard enough&quot;, and that would have prompted them to correct it before they got burnt on Vista.</p>

		<p>PhilW: Specifically, &quot;if it isn&#39;t broke, use AppVerifier to break it&quot;. AppVerifier would&#39;ve detected this problem right away.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m always wondering why the National Lottery never seems to randomly select the same numbers I did. &nbsp;I guess it must be a bug in their ball selection machines?</p>

		<p>So what if Bjarne Stroustrup said it, it&#39;s a stupid argument from authority. Besides, in its original context is was probably meant as a joking poke at something particular, that no one can find again since if you look up the phrase now you only get inane quotation websites.</p>

		<p>@NB, Yeah I know. &nbsp;But the recent MS meme has been that *modern* C++ is safe. Which is true &#8212; if you use modern techniques and ignore the C-with-classes techniques it is quite easy to avoid undefined behavior in C++.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I find that a lot of that flies out the window when you have to interact with a C API. &nbsp;People forget all the lessons they have learned for the past 15 years.</p>

		<p>I&#39;d prefer &quot;(_tcslen(pszData) + 1) * sizeof(TCHAR)&quot; also. &nbsp;Seems like a better expression of the code&#39;s intent.</p>
<p>I&#39;m amused, but not really that surprised, that anyone would after learning their code had these bugs in it, still complain that they were lucky enough in one OS version for the bug to not hurt them, but not in some other version.</p>
<p>It&#39;s the classic &quot;always someone else&#39;s fault&quot; attitude. &nbsp;All too common in so many facets of daily life. &nbsp;:(</p>

		<p>Here&#39;s a fifth bug in the code: Apparently the RegQueryValueEx() function can never fail (unless error checking code was removed from the sample that was posted to keep it simple).</p>
<p>(That&#39;s not bad, that&#39;s more than one serious bug per line of code. &nbsp;A friend of mine once had to security-audit code with those characteristics. &nbsp;His recommendation was &quot;the only way to secure this code is to run it in an isolated sandbox, since they can churn out buggy crap far faster than we can ever fix it&quot;).</p>

		<p>Undefined behavior like this is why building on different systems and architectures is so helpful. Windows, OSX or Linux; x86, x86_64, ARM, PPC and Itanium; GCC, MSVC, ICC combinations for example.</p>
<p>It wouldn&#39;t have helped this guy, because the code in question only runs on Windows, but even then he might have detected the problem if he&#39;d tried it on Windows 2000 during development.</p>
