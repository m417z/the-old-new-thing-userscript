		<p>I suppose that it adds flexibility for the API to allow you to specify non-canonical ACE ordering, but I never understood why the API wasn&#8217;t designed to just re-order ACEs to the canonical order automatically.</p>
<p>(I know that non-canonical ACE ordering is used to reproduce the behaviour of MAPI permissions, so I won&#8217;t deny that the ability to use non-canonical ACE ordering has some utility, but it sure feels like a hack&#8230;)</p>

		<p>What effect does the inheritance of permissions from parent containers have on all this?</p>
<p>Does it apply all of the DENY rules for the entire heirarchy and then all of the ALLOWs, or does it do that algorithm separately for each item in the heirarchy?</p>
<p>I guess this boils down to whether an ALLOW on the parent overrides a DENY on the child or vice-versa&#8230; but does anything special happen in this case?</p>

		<p>I thought I understood and then I actually tried :)</p>
<p>In my C: root folder (with &quot;Full Access&quot; permission for administrators/SYSTEM and &quot;Read/Execute&quot; access for users), I create a new empty file and then edit its ACL to deny the &quot;remove&quot; permission for Administrators (as I was one during the test).</p>
<p>Now if I understand correctly this post and this page (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/distrib/dsce_ctl_hziq.mspx?mfr=true" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/technet/prodtechnol/windows2000serv/reskit/distrib/dsce_ctl_hziq.mspx?mfr=true</a>), the inherited permissions come after the explicit ones so my deny remove should apply.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t&#8230; I can delete the file!</p>
<p>I know it has something to do with the fact that there&#8217;s also a &quot;delete file&quot; permission in the parent folder and that this permission is granted for me but then how do I prevent a file to be deleted???</p>
<p>If I remove the &quot;delete file&quot; permission from the parent folder then I won&#8217;t be able to delete any file from folder!!</p>
<p>PS:</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry that I do not use the correct permission names, but I have a french XP and those fields have been badly translated&#8230; you can see what happens when I translate them back!</p>
<p>For instance there&#8217;s a interesting confusion made by the translators: What was (I suspect) &quot;Read attributes&quot; has been translated as if it was &quot;Attributes of read&quot;! So you end up wondering what happens when you deny/grant that kind of access! Fortunately, the &quot;Read extended attributes&quot; was correctly translated (since there are no confusion possible) and you are able to deduce what was meant for the previous field&#8230;</p>
<p>Was that a digression? :)</p>

		<p>You can&#8217;t have full POSIX mapping of owner/group/world style access using only canonically ordered ACEs.</p>
<p>For example, rw-r-xrw-, which grants read-write access to the owner, read execute to the group and read write to everyone else can only be represented by having a deny entry in the middle:</p>
<p>Owner Deny Execute</p>
<p>Owner Allow Write</p>
<p>Group Deny Write</p>
<p>Group Allow Execute</p>
<p>Everyone Allow Read+Write</p>
<p>See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/ntsec.html#ntsec-mapping" rel="nofollow">http://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/ntsec.html#ntsec-mapping</a></p>
<p>Unix-over-NT layers like SFU (now SUA) and Cygwin correctly represent such access modes in ACEs but the standard ACL editor will mangle them, given the chance.</p>
<p>There are other mappings that can only be represented by non-canonical ACE orderings&#8211; any time more than two different overlapping layerings or groupings of users and groups need different access.</p>
<p>Incidentally, SD Edit is a graphical ACL editor that supports explicit ACE ordering.</p>

		<p>The differences between the way ACLs really work and they way they appear to work in the Explorer/RegEdit UI, coupled with the amount of code you have to write to do anything with file or registry permissions, is something that I&#8217;d love to see improved by a higher-level API or wrapper.</p>
<p>Trying to reproduce functionality of those UIs, even when using the same standard dialogs, is a big task. Either you have to spend a lot of time writing complex, error prone, and yet quite boring, code that is already inside Explorer/RegEdit (but not exposed) or, more often, the feature is left out completely on the basis that so few people mess with permissions that it isn&#8217;t worth the effort. It&#8217;s a shame in both cases.</p>
<p>An API which took care of canonical ordering, merging, inheritance and, especially, the permissions dialogs would mean that more apps would allow proper permissioning of things. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with the existing API &#8212; you have to expose the full granularity &#8212; but it would really help if there was a higher-level API or wrapper in addition to it.</p>
<p>Having read up on how to use the permissions dialogs (while I was looking at writing an alternative registry editor) it looked like a hell of a lot of code to write just to duplicate the &#8220;set permissions&#8221; context menu of RegEdit. I didn&#8217;t plan to do anything special with permissions &#8212; my planned improvements were in other areas &#8212; but I also did not want to provide a tool which did less than RegEdit in any area, else people would have to switch between tools which is nasty.</p>
<p>When mistakes are made in this kind of code the results can be very confusing to both user and programmer since the other tools (Explorer, RegEdit) show you simplified views of permissions and thus don&#8217;t show you what&#8217;s really gone wrong. (cacls.exe to the rescue, but not many people know about that.)</p>
<p>Anyway, this isn&#8217;t a complaint and I&#8217;m sure there are a million other higher priority APIs and wrappers and examples to write but it&#8217;d be great if one day this stuff was made less of a burden on application developers.</p>

		<p>Regarding inherited ACEs:</p>
<p>Aren&#8217;t they pushed down to the children &quot;automatically&quot;? &nbsp;I thought that the ACL-check code only had to look at the ACEs that existed on the object itself, because that&#8217;s how the inheritance stuff worked.</p>
<p>(And I thought it was set up this way to stay more compatible with NT4, which couldn&#8217;t inherit permissions, but which had a UI option to push a parent object&#8217;s permissions down to its children instead. &nbsp;IOW, I thought that the ACL-editing APIs took over the job of forcibly pushing down the parent&#8217;s inheritable ACEs to any children that are marked inheriting.)</p>
<p>If all that&#8217;s true (and I&#8217;m not sure whether it is), then it doesn&#8217;t matter when inherited ACEs are checked, because they&#8217;re present on the children already. &nbsp;(I suppose it does matter where the APIs put them on the children in that case, though. &nbsp;Hmm.)</p>

		<p>Foolhardy: no way, you don&#8217;t need the deny entries. Accesses that are not granted are denied by default. They are perfectly supported by the ACL editor, too. Try chmodding a file from Cygwin, and then look at its ACL. This is what a mode of 700 looks like from the Windows point of view:</p>

		<p>@Ben Cooke and others:</p>
<p>The canonical ACE ordering when inheritance is involved is:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Direct Deny ACEs</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Direct Allow ACEs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Inherited Deny ACEs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Inherited Allow ACEs</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>@Nawak:</p>
<p>Deleting a file is really an operation on the containing folder.</p>
<p>@BryanK:</p>
<p>If you mean what I think you mean, then yes, you&#8217;re right. &nbsp;When an object inherits an ACL, it actually gets its own copy, with inherited ACEs marked as inherited.</p>

		<p>@Nawak: Yes, it is because of the permissions on the folder. &nbsp;An ACE has two delete permissions, &quot;delete child&quot; (the UI calls it &quot;delete subfolders and files&quot;) and &quot;delete&quot; (self). &nbsp;If you are granted &quot;delete child&quot; permisson on a folder, then you are allowed to delete any files within it. &nbsp;If not, you must have &quot;delete&quot; permission on the file itself.</p>
<p>Usually what you would do is have an inheritable ACE on the folder grant the &quot;delete&quot; permission, so any new files created inside it have the &quot;delete&quot; permission already. &nbsp;Then you remove &quot;delete child&quot; permission from the folder, and remove &quot;delete&quot; from specific files. &nbsp;(I said &quot;remove&quot;, but obviously adding deny ACEs works just as well.)</p>

		<p>@KJK::Hyperion: That&#8217;s what I thought originally, but it&#8217;s not sufficient. &nbsp;POSIX has 3 permission buckets: owning User, owning Group, and Other. &nbsp;The key issue is that NT has no concept of &quot;Other&quot;; &quot;Everyone&quot; consists of, well, everyone (except anonymous users in some configurations, but that&#8217;s not relevant here) which includes both the owning user and group. &nbsp;The POSIX &quot;Other&quot; does not.</p>
<p>Foolhardy&#8217;s example denies a permission (Write) to the owning group, while still granting it to everyone else. &nbsp;This type of exclusion requires a deny ACE, but since the owning user is also part of that group, this ACE cannot come first as canonical order demands.</p>
<p>Indeed, tests with SUA demonstrate this. &nbsp;I created a file with an ACL containing one ACE, granting full access to Everyone. &nbsp;The file was owned by user Administrator, group None. &nbsp;SUA&#8217;s CSH shows:</p>
<p>-rwxrwxrwx &nbsp;1 Administrator &nbsp;None &nbsp;0 Jun &nbsp;8 21:00 test.txt*</p>
<p>&#8230;after &quot;chmod u=rw,g=rx,o=rw test.txt&quot;:</p>
<p>-rw-r-xrw- &nbsp;1 Administrator &nbsp;None &nbsp;0 Jun &nbsp;8 21:00 test.txt*</p>
<p>&#8230;and back in NT land, the ACL now contains 5 ACEs:</p>
<p>1 allow Administrator &lt;all but execute&gt;</p>
<p>2 deny Administrator &lt;execute&gt;</p>
<p>3 allow None &lt;read rights, execute&gt;</p>
<p>4 deny None &lt;write rights&gt;</p>
<p>5 allow Everyone &lt;all but execute and write DACL/owner&gt;</p>
<p>ACE #2 is required under the assumption that the User is part of the Group &#8212; and execute permission is granted to the Group. &nbsp;It could be in canonical order in this particular case though.</p>
<p>ACE #4 is required to deny write permissions to the Group, since they are allowed for everyone else. &nbsp;It must be below the allow entry for the User, and not in canonical order, because the User is still allowed these permissions.</p>
<p>I suppose this is a bad example since the owning group was None in my test, but the logic still works.</p>

<p>I know they don&#8217;t contain have the dialog itself, and I know the dialog is exposed, but to use that dialog a lot of APIs and concepts have to be digested, most of which are orthogonal to what an application developer uses. (By which I mean that getting this dialog &nbsp;to display in their app is the only time they will use most of this knowledge and that makes it more difficult to justify the time and energy, given the amount of reading and fact-digestion involved.)</p>
<p>That code is presumably in Explorer and RegEdit and I figured it&#8217;d be nice to move it into a higher level API that other programs can use.</p>
<p>I mean, look at the amount of code and understanding required in the CodeProject article that&#8217;s also linked in these comments (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.codeproject.com/win32/accessctrl4.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/win32/accessctrl4.asp</a>) and keep in mind that is part four and requires an understanding of two of the previous parts. (The third part is about .Net so can be skipped.)</p>
<p>If all you want to do is to allow someone to modify the permissions on a file or registry item, that&#8217;s a lot of work for a feature that is easy to strike off the list. For file&#8217;s it&#8217;s not so bad since there is an API to display a standard Properties page which gives you the security dialog for free, and there&#8217;s also example code on the net for doing it, but for the registry it seemed like you had to do things the hard way.</p>
<p>Or is there an easy way to use the dialog? I might be wrong.</p>
<p>Ignoring the dialog for a second, an API for dealing with ACLs in the way which the UI deals with them, supporting inheritance, merging, copying and so on would come in handy. I guess the code to do that is in aclui.dll but I don&#8217;t know and I don&#8217;t think it is exposed anywhere as a public API.</p>

		<p>@Leo Davidson:</p>
<p>SetKernelObjectSecurity on a file or key only edits the object in question, with no inheritance.</p>
<p>SetNamedSecurityInfo, OTOH does implement auto-inheritance for children below the named object.</p>
<p>TreeResetNamedSecurityInfo also implements auto-inheritance, supports the replace-direct-entries option and gives you the option of status reports and cancel/retry error handling. Presumably, it&#8217;s the same function that regedit and the shell use when you click OK.</p>

<p>The actual order of traversal from beginning to end is sensible. &nbsp;The canonical order is required as a workaround for broken ACL editing tools, not for the ACL structures themselves.</p>

<p>&quot;The&quot; containing folder? &nbsp;Who says there&#8217;s only one? &nbsp;For pedantic reasons we might want to check for write permissions on one or all containing folders, but delete permissions should depend only on the file itself and the credentials of the intending deletor.</p>

		<p>@Norman Diamond: &nbsp;&quot;Who says there&#8217;s only one?&quot; &nbsp;I don&#8217;t know whether you&#8217;re referring to hard links or to parent/grandparent/greatgrandparent containers, so I&#8217;ll answer both.</p>
<p>With hard links, a file can exist in multiple folders at the same time. &nbsp;&quot;Deleting a file&quot; deletes the reference to the file from one folder. &nbsp;You might have permission to delete it from one folder, but not from another.</p>
<p>Grandparent/etc folder permissions do not matter, unless your token doesn&#8217;t have the ChangeNotify (Bypass traverse checking) privilege, which should always be present and enabled.</p>

<p>As described so far, that resembles Unix. &nbsp;In Unix it is pretty much documented that rm&#8217;ing a filename really only removes an inode and the file doesn&#8217;t really go away until the counts of inodes that link to it and processes that have it open are both zero.</p>
<p>In Windows I don&#8217;t recall seeing it documented that way. &nbsp;The MSDN page for DeleteFile doesn&#8217;t describe it that way. &nbsp;Also in the page on File Security and Access Rights, FILE_DELETE_CHILD gives permission to delete the directory and files that it contains, including read-only files. &nbsp;Does this mean deletion of NTFS equivalents of indoes? &nbsp;Including read-only NTFS equivalents of inodes?</p>
<p>Tangent:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Grandparent/etc folder permissions do not</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>If Bypass Traverse Checking should always be present and enabled, why does it even exist? &nbsp;Meanwhile, surprises don&#8217;t hit the owners of processes that have this thing set, surprises hit the owners of directories and files who didn&#8217;t want their files to get traversed to by bypassers. &nbsp;If an administrator created a hard link somewhere else so that persons unknown to the file&#8217;s owner can still read the file, well tough, the owner will have to apply for administrative sanctions. &nbsp;But when persons unknown reach the file when the owner didn&#8217;t expect it because Windows provides that privilege, I don&#8217;t agree with you about &quot;should&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Norman: &nbsp;I believe that the answers to both your comments derive from the fact that NT was built to support Posix and other applications. &nbsp;I&#8217;m sure there are subtle differences wrt inodes, but I&#8217;m not expert in UNIX so I couldn&#8217;t specify.</p>
<p>Marking a file &quot;read-only&quot; is just a hint. &nbsp;NTFS permissions are what really protect them. &nbsp;Just like &quot;rm -f&quot; can delete &quot;read-only&quot; files in UNIX.</p>
<p>The reason for &quot;bypass traverse checking&quot; was also to support Posix functionality. &nbsp;Note that having that privilege doesn&#8217;t mean you can scan any folder. &nbsp;You need to have permissions on the folder and be able to name it before you can perform any operations in it. &nbsp;What &quot;bypass traverse checking&quot; does is skip the recursive check to parent/grandparent/etc up to the root before determining whether access is granted or denied, which is a performance benefit if nothing else. &nbsp;But if you have no permissions in the target node, then bypass traverse won&#8217;t give you anything.</p>
<p>My use of the word &quot;should&quot; is because that&#8217;s in our recommended guidance. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s what the WinXP Threats and Countermeasures Guide says:</p>
<p>&quot;The Windows operating systems, as well as many applications, were designed with the expectation that anyone who can legitimately access the computer will have this user right. Therefore, Microsoft recommends that you thoroughly test any changes to assignments of the Bypass traverse checking user right &nbsp;before you make such changes to production systems. In particular, IIS requires this user right to be assigned to the Network Service, Local Service, IIS_WPG, IUSR_&lt;ComputerName&gt;, and IWAM_&lt;ComputerName&gt; accounts. (It must also be assigned to the ASPNET account through its membership in the Users group.) This guide recommends that you leave this policy setting at its default configuration.&quot;</p>

		<p>Speaking of Posix semantics, two by-the-ways:</p>
<p>(1) &nbsp;In a case that happened a millennium or two ago, the equivalent of &#8220;bypass traverse checking&#8221; did surprise a Unix user. &nbsp;A professor had disabled read access to a directory and thought that meant students would be unable to read file in the directory. &nbsp;Some students turned in assignments containing the professor&#8217;s code. &nbsp;Some even forgot to rename all the variables to prevent us from recognizing it.</p>
<p>(2) &nbsp;Windows hard links are still harder to understand than Unix hard links. &nbsp;This case is on a Windows XP system with Windows Services for Unix and case sensitivity enabled. &nbsp;I took this screenshot before doing any experimenting, and guess that the differently cased directory was created by some XP security patch in 2006:</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geocities.jp/hitotsubishi/xp_sfu_casesensitivity.png" target=_new rel=nofollow rel="nofollow">http://www.geocities.jp/hitotsubishi/xp_sfu_casesensitivity.png</a></p>
<p>As far as I can tell, both directories are hard links to the same place. &nbsp;If I try to display either folder in Windows Explorer, the address bar shows the pathname with uppercase P. &nbsp;If I use the CMD.EXE command prompt to CD into either directory, it CDs into the pathname with uppercase P. &nbsp;Korn Shell could cd into either directory as directed. &nbsp;In both directories, ls -l showed identical contents. &nbsp;Today as an experiment, using Korn Shell, in one directory I created a file (touch diamond.txt) and then cd&#8217;d into the other directory and deleted the file (rm diamond.txt). &nbsp;So I&#8217;m pretty sure both folder names really are hard links to the same place. &nbsp;But now after that experiment, one folder has its last-written timestamp changed to today, and the other folder still has its old timestamp. &nbsp;How can this be? &nbsp;File creation in one directory should have done a write on that directory, and file deletion in the other directory should have done a write on that other directory, even though these were done using SFU commands.</p>

<p>&quot;Read-only&quot; is not a permission, it&#8217;s just an attribute on the file. &nbsp;As Aaron said, if you want to declare someone has only read permission, you need to use the actual permission system: the file&#8217;s DACL.</p>

		<p>@Raymond: &nbsp;Sorry about that. &nbsp;Windows authz has some very complex rules, so any discussion of it risks numerous ratholes.</p>
<p>@Norman Diamond: re &#8211; (1) surprising the UNIX user. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t know how UNIX security works beyond the limited 0777 thing, so I don&#8217;t have an answer. &nbsp;In Windows it&#8217;s straightforward to get permissions to be inherited, particularly when using the GUI ACL editor. &nbsp;Like I said, if the user had no permissions to read the file, then bypass-traverse wouldn&#8217;t have allowed it either.</p>
<p>Re (2) your [URL] link must be broken. &nbsp;I clicked on it and got a picture of a middle-aged Asian woman with bad teeth. &nbsp;Tried a few more times and got other ads, all in Japanese (I think). &nbsp;Babelfish didn&#8217;t help.</p>

<p>Anyway: &nbsp;I&#8217;m not a file system expert, but I *think* that hard links apply only to files, not to folders. &nbsp;I also think that while the Windows kernel can handle a case-sensitive file system (to support Posix), Win32 is case-preserving but case-insensitive. &nbsp;Two folders that differ only by case seems like something that likely was done within Services for Unix.</p>

		<p>This seems like a really complicated way to handle permissions. The way they are described, they seem less like file attributes and more like mailbox rules with unintended effects that result from conditions the &#8216;standard&#8217; tools are unable to detect, indicate, or correct. What does Windows gain from this complexity that a simpler system would not provide?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>I&#8217;m not sure what you&#8217;re looking for. Which simpler system do you want to compare it to? Obviously it provides more expressive power than a simple system like FAT with a single &#8220;read-only&#8221; flag that anybody can change. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Another point is that this security system applies to many different kinds of objects within NT, not just files. &nbsp;(Raymond never even mentioned files, it&#8217;s just what first came to mind for everyone.) &nbsp;I would argue that a unified security model is a very important thing to have.</p>
<p>Perhaps that&#8217;s why it&#8217;s complex, as there are so many different needs to address.</p>

		<p>@rdamiani: &nbsp;Actually, this is just the tip of the iceberg! &nbsp;We haven&#8217;t even touched on restricting SIDs, deny-only SIDs, the CREATOR OWNER ACE, the new OWNER RIGHTS and WRITE RESTRICTED SIDs, the TakeOwnership, Backup and Restore privileges, SD &amp; ACE inheritance flags, integrity levels/labels, and more. &nbsp;It is so complex that many of the best books on Windows security don&#8217;t get it 100% completely accurate, and some miss pretty badly.</p>
<p>But: &nbsp;it is very powerful, and very useful. &nbsp;*Much* more so than -rwxr-xr-x. &nbsp;And the basics are not that hard to grasp.</p>
