		<p>That sort of facility with language is amazing, especially for someone who learns it at an older age.</p>
<p>I wonder if she has a near photographic memory for things audio?</p>
<p>My daughter (7) is fluent in 3 languages (without accent) and has a near photographic memory for conversation and audio (even if it is not in a language she knows &#8211; she happily sings songs in languages she doesn&#8217;t know)</p>

		<p>If I&#8217;m not wrong, the Van Allen radiation belts didn&#8217;t have a name before he discovered them. So it&#8217;s not a coincidence that they&#8217;re named the same. :P</p>

		<p>Well, I&#8217;ve just returned from a fortnights holiday in France.<br />
<br />Over there I witnessed five year olds speaking fluent French, whereas my son only knows a few words in their native language&#8230;</p>

		<p>That is so sad! &nbsp;That a person from one cultureal group would assume that another would put effort into changing skin-tones to look like a different ethnic group&#8230;. &nbsp;</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  That&#8217;s when you know you&#8217;ve made it. When<br />
  <br />&gt; native speakers mistake you for one of their<br />
  <br />&gt; own who merely has had a lot of cosmetic<br />
  <br />&gt; surgery.</p>
<p>Not always. &nbsp;A few months ago there were several newspaper reports about someone who was arrested for not carrying her passport or alien registration. &nbsp;Japanese don&#8217;t have to carry or have passports and can&#8217;t carry or obtain alien registration, but that doesn&#8217;t matter. &nbsp;She spoke impeccable Japanese too, but that didn&#8217;t matter either. &nbsp;I forgot now if she spent the night in jail or finally got out before midnight, after some maverick in the police department finally obtained information that the arrestee was Japanese.</p>
<p>Of course other kinds of events aren&#8217;t newsworthy because they&#8217;re so common. &nbsp;Like a Peruvian whose grandparents were Chinese but who speaks about 5 words of Chinese and 0 words of Japanese, but Japanese people can&#8217;t stop speaking Japanese to her no matter how many times they&#8217;ve been told that she&#8217;s a Peruvian whose grandparents were Chinese and doesn&#8217;t understand a word of Japanese.</p>
<p>There are also a few Caucasians who are Japanese due to being born to Japanese parents (the parents having been naturalized) and it doesn&#8217;t matter that they speak Japanese impeccably and are Japanese, they get treated as foreigners. &nbsp;Of course Japanese people with darker skin for similar reasons would have it worse, but they don&#8217;t seem to be numerous enough to hear about yet.</p>
<p>&gt; became fluent in Japanese after spending a<br />
  <br />&gt; year as an exchange student</p>
<p>The daughter of some friends also became fluent in Japanese in a year, but she&#8217;s about 4 years old.</p>
<p>When she gets old enough no one will ask how she got her skin so dark, she&#8217;ll just get stopped twice a day and forced to show her alien registration and bicycle registration.

		<p>Norman, funny you mentioned that.</p>
<p>I was stopped by the police and asked for my passport. Of course I have a visa and alien registration card, so I told the officer that I don&#8217;t make it a practice to carry my passport everywhere I go. Then I glared at him a little and asked if I could leave. Sure, no problem, thanks for your time.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say that I recommend walking from Toyocho to Gyotoku at 2 in the morning, though.</p>

<br />Pale skin is considered more attrative to the Japanese eye. It&#8217;s got nothing to do with trying to look like any other ethnic group.</p>

<br />&gt; Wouldn&#8217;t a Japanese girl be different from a<br />
<br />&gt; caucasian(SP?) in more way than just skin<br />
<br />&gt; color &#8211; eye shape, etc?</p>
<p>Around 99.9% are. &nbsp;In other words, not 100%.</p>
<p>But I think the one who was arrested for not having a sufficiently Korean-looking face wasn&#8217;t a descendant of Europeans. &nbsp;Her parents and enough ancestors going back far enough looked like Chinese so they didn&#8217;t get arrested for not carrying alien registration cards. &nbsp;What it was about her appearance that made the arresting officer and some number of other officers sure that she wasn&#8217;t Japanese, maybe only the officers involved know, or maybe it&#8217;s a state secret by now.</p>
<p>As for those who do have a Caucasian parent, there has even been a case of a racist proprietor determining that one sibling would be allowed into his establishment and one sibling wouldn&#8217;t be, on account of their appearance. &nbsp;Actually I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s been more than one case like this, but only one that became famous recently.</p>
