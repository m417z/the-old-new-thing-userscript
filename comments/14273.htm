		<p>these are very practical tips&#8230; a small suggestion: could you create a category for them like &quot;askingforhelp&quot;? in total, it will become a complete guide for beginning / annoying devs.</p>

		<p>I seem to have the exactly opposite problem.</p>
<p>I write a question for a discussion group. I re-read it and think, nah, this question will make the reader think I&#8217;m struggling with the widely known issue ABC. So I add: Please note it&#8217;s not the issue ABC because conditions X and Y are not met in my case.</p>
<p>OK, I re-read the whole thing again and add yet another clarification: Also note that XYZ solution does not apply here because of GHI.</p>
<p>The process repeats several times. Finally I&#8217;m happy with the result so I post the question.</p>
<p>Very quickly I get a response &#8212; You&#8217;re a n00b, it&#8217;s a widely known issue ABC! RTFM!</p>
<p>I respond &#8212; please read my question again. I described why ABC does not apply here.</p>
<p>I then get another answer (often from the same person): Try XYZ then.</p>
<p>Again, I reply &#8212; please read my question again. I described why XYZ won&#8217;t help me.</p>
<p>Several posts later we finally achieve a point where everybody has finally read my question in full and actually understood it. But at that point they are so pissed off for being told to read my question again several times that they are not willing to help anymore.</p>

		<p>Another possible flip side to this is that if the person asking the question goes into too much detail about what was tried already &nbsp;there&#8217;s a risk that potential experts might succumb to TL;DR syndrome (possibly responsible for the responses GSerg saw).</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t to say that someone asking a question shouldn&#8217;t do his homework and indicate such in the question, but queries that go on for pages might &#8216;encoursge&#8217; a lack of interest.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s the manufacturer&#8217;s responsibility to solve problems caused by bugs, non-intuitive interfaces and low quality documentation. The user should not be forced to work a round the bugs and crappy software by it&#8217;s own.</p>
<p>As a developer I always think about how I would want the user experience to be. And usually I, as a programmer, could do better. No matter if it&#8217;s less bugs, better UI, better documentation or something else that has to low quality.</p>
<p>I have to say most developers doesn&#8217;t want anything else than to make good software, but don&#8217;t have the resources, time or tools to make a better product. Very seldom is software flawless, perfect. Don&#8217;t try to think software in general is good. It&#8217;s not.</p>
<p>The manufacturer should not try to hide these defects from the user, a bug report are a perfect opportunity to make the product better. The bugs are still there, even if the developer cannot reproduce or fix the flaws, the bad experience are still there even if you make the user switch to another product.</p>

		<p>The &quot;Smart Questions&quot; page Roman pointed out is where I send people, although it sadly has a bit of an attitude and is more geared to the web of 8 or so years ago. &nbsp;What is hilarious is just how many people then email the authors of that for help. &nbsp;(It was the first link in the help/support page of an open source product I did.)</p>
<p>&quot;How to report bugs effectively&quot; by Simon Tatham is also excellent. &nbsp;Choice quote &quot;Give the programmer some credit for basic intelligence: if the program really didn&#8217;t work at all, they would probably have noticed. Since they haven&#8217;t noticed, it must be working for them. Therefore, either you are doing something differently from them, or your environment is different from theirs. They need information; providing this information is the purpose of a bug report. &quot;</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>No, usually the developer is a clueless junior who doesn&#8217;t have the most basic programming skills. Sometimes they lie straight to your face: &quot;haven&#8217;t ever seen this bug before&quot;.</p>

		<p>@GSerg: For your kind of problem, there&#8217;s known to be some community members who just skim through the questions and see if they can answer be searching the web, in order to gain some real world experience on certain kind of technology. When you post questions that you&#8217;ve already searched the web for, don&#8217;t be surprised if they run out of suggestions quickly. In your situation maybe there just isn&#8217;t anyone experienced enough to solve your problem. Perheps it&#8217;s a good time to try paid support options.</p>
<p>IMO, it&#8217;s actually considered to be a nice thing to have someone deal with dumb questions and gain experience, while those experienced can focus on those question which requires greater expertise to solve. Just that for most of the time when I see a thread with long discussion, I&#8217;d consider someone has committed to solve it and skip reading it completely unless the topic attracts me. (e.g.: It&#8217;s a subject that I&#8217;m likely to encounter in the future and I have not much experience at.)</p>

		<p>The only problem I find with this approach is people who use a support script to address problems still have to go through the script. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I find its best to let them ask and then just say that you&#8217;ve tried it. &nbsp;If you are unlucky, they won&#8217;t be happy with that and will insist you do it again.</p>
<p>This tends to occur with broadband providers here in the UK.</p>

		<p>I have trouble along the same lines as GSerg sometimes&#8230; If a problem is complex, and I have tried lots of possible solutions, I document them in my question so that responders will know that I have tried them.</p>
<p>But then the problem description gets long and perhaps boring, so I get responses like GSerg gets. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Just yesterday, I reported a bug on an internal system, and was asked what version something was in. &nbsp;I gave that information again, even though it was in the original bug report. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t want to be rude to people who are trying to help, so you have to be courteous when you say &quot;I already said I tried that solution and it didn&#8217;t work, you idiot&quot;&#8230; so there&#8217;s sometimes a fine line between including every piece of information about the problem, and making it so long that you get TLDR for responses&#8230;</p>
