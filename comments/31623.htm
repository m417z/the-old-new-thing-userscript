		<p>Given that women can usually think fast (even far ahead), and men usually respond positive to the idea of seeing nurses, you answered like a girl too.</p>

		<p>When calling, some people tend to chatter for minutes until they come to the actual purpose of their call. I know of the importance of small-talk etc. But i usually like to know what&#8217;s up right away.</p>
<p>I had a friend once, who was really irritated by my question &quot;Hey, what did you call me for?&quot;. That was after minutes of &#8216;time-theft&#8217;.</p>
<p>Callers should not expect to find their opposite to be in the mood or to have the time for small-talk. I agree with intersense: briefly and direct.</p>

		<p>I can only guess that the person who called you was a woman.</p>
<p>A man would not answer &quot;Oh! Well then! Bye.&quot; if they posed the question in a hurry. &nbsp;They would answer something like &quot;Ok cool, later&quot;, or &quot;WTF man.. you should go&quot;, or &quot;Dude, I need your opinion, come on&quot; &nbsp;(Modified by your local social slang)</p>
<p>And what&#8217;s with the whole quick thing&#8230; if they can&#8217;t pull over long enough to give you time to think about it, they don&#8217;t really care if you go. &nbsp;What, did they have a list of people they wanted to ask, so they couldn&#8217;t spend the extra few seconds?</p>
<p>Also, I rarely ever answer &quot;no&quot;, unless I&#8217;m either in a formal setting where slang isn&#8217;t acceptable, I&#8217;m correcting someone, or I wish to convey a strong negative (slightly less negative than &quot;no way&quot;).</p>
<p>I usually favor &quot;nah&quot; as in &quot;nah, maybe later&quot;, or &quot;naw&quot; as in &quot;Naw man, screw that&quot;. &nbsp;&quot;Naw&quot; is the slang equivellent of the strong negative &quot;no&quot; conveys, but I only really use it at the start of a sentence.</p>
<p>My response to the quick response would have been &quot;ummmmmmmmmm&#8230; nah&quot; :)</p>

		<p>Another case of an engineer not understanding HIIP (Human interpersonal interaction protocol). </p>
<p>Anyway, the correct answer isn&#8217;t &quot;Sorry, no&quot; either. It&#8217;s &quot;No thanks, I&#8217;ll catch you next time&quot;. </p>
<p>This conveys several additional critical bits of information. A) I appreciate you asking (whether or not that&#8217;s true it&#8217;s part of the protocol, kind of like an ACK).

<p>Also, I can&#8217;t resist pointing out that this response is more optimized even for the case you think you&#8217;re in. If they&#8217;re *really* in a screaming hurry, they can violate the protocol themselves and hang up after hearing &quot;no&quot;. </p>

		<p>Can I offer another slant on this? &nbsp;I&#8217;m a native English speaker; I have been reading the old new thing for ages.</p>
<p>I understood the point he was making about going to a nursery to buy plants and offering a quick, terse answer when asked to do so. &nbsp;<br />
<br />But how many people did not understand that and thought about children at a nursery or nurses. &nbsp;Even if some of the responses are joking, doesn&#8217;t this show something more instructive that perhaps Microsoft and others can learn from? I&#8217;m not offering a world shattering insight, just the view that when IT people talk, although there is a common language of VB, C++, Java, SQL etc etc. &nbsp;there is often a lack of comprehension of the underlying message or meaning. &nbsp;So, perhaps one good thing would be for Microsoft to hire non-American English speakers of varying degrees of ability to review documentation and help files for international portability. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t mean the little things such as the Engligh &quot;labour&quot; and the American English &quot;labor&quot;, but sometimes the message is culturally specific in a way that does not translate. &nbsp;Just a simple idea &quot;an idea from out of left field&quot;. &nbsp;I know that&#8217;s about baseball, but do you expect a C++ developer in Beijing to know that? Or a DBA in Kazakhstan? Or whoever, wherever?</p>
<p>I guess this can be summarised as &quot;internationalisation is not just translation, but endeavouring to ensure consistency of understanding of meaning&quot;. &nbsp;Now, if Microsoft could offer something to do that, that&#8217;d be cool&#8230;</p>

		<p>&#8212;-&quot;No time for niceties. They said they needed an answer instantly.&quot;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Raymond, are you really an autistic sociopath, or are you just playing devil&#8217;s advocate?</p>
<p>What they mean by a quick answer is &quot;don&#8217;t spend half-an-hour thinking about it&quot;.</p>
<p>You are supposed to express interest in their landscaping and what plants they are buying and then reluctantly decline. If they know you are a programmer, and thus hopelessly lacking in the social graces, then you might just get away with &quot;Oh dear. I&#8217;m terribly sorry but I don&#8217;t think I can manage it at the moment. Thanks awfully though.&quot; It will still be considered unacceptably terse, but you may be forgiven.</p>
<p>Never come to the Arab world. You&#8217;d offend the whole country before you got through immigration.</p>

		<p>Maybe &quot;No&quot; is too rude, but how can something like &quot;Oh dear. I&#8217;m terribly sorry but I don&#8217;t think I can manage it at the moment. Thanks awfully though.&quot; can possibly be &quot;unacceptably terse&quot;?<br />
<br />I&#8217;m afraid I lack the social skills to chat about plants for two full minutes just to answer a simple question.</p>

		<p>What Stephen Jones, but with tact :)</p>
<p>When they said &quot;Quick!&quot; did they sound like they were going to hang up in eight seconds because they were catching a train, or like they were just saying &quot;I&#8217;d love to chat, but I can&#8217;t write now, we should leave in 10 minutes&quot;?</p>
<p>If they&#8217;re friends, you can hopefully ask them :)</p>

<p>Russian version of MS Mail 3.0 had menus translated, but American icons left. So people were staring at this thing sitting on a pole trying to understand what was it: an empty soda can on a pole? A red-haired parrot? Or something else? If you still cannot get what I am talking about it is a mailbox. In most European countries mailbox is a box with a slot labelled &quot;Post&quot; or similar. In Sweden it is usually yellow (Raymond should know), in Russia they are blue. Changing a can on a stick to blue box would be real localization. But MS decided not to go this far, and next version of Mail (or was it first version of OE?) did not have icons on toolbar at all ;-)

		<p>I would have been tempted to answer:</p>
<p>&quot;Sunspots!&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s 2 syllables to Raymond&#8217;s 1, but it&#8217;s a complete non-sequitur that would have bought me slightly more time before giving the real answer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if (as he says) they really needed an answer, I would have in effect caused them to make the decision for me&#8230; which probably would have resulted in &#8216;no&#8217;&#8230; but without the offense (just some irritation).</p>
<p>Of course, after years of taking a little while to think carefully through most questions posed to me, most people have learned not to demand a quick answer out of me.<br /></p>

		<p>They needed a quick answer because they were *already in the car on the way to the nursery*. In fact, as I later learned, they were just a few blocks from my house when they called, so a quick answer was in fact urgently needed.</p>

<p>Israelis are notoriously rude. Whether this is a result or the cause of New Yorkers famed ill-manners is moot.</p>
<p>Arabs on the other hand are famously polite. It used to be said that when you crossed the Allenby Bridge from Jordan to Israel you went from the politest country in the world to the rudest.</p>

		<p>About that &quot;nursery&quot; thing John Greenan brought up: I&#8217;ve heard the word before, but it wasn&#8217;t until after reading some comments I started suspecting that someone might not be having a baby. (I thought it a bit odd to have a friend call on their way to the hospital and asking if you wanted to come along. Particulary as the answer was no.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m Swedish, btw.</p>

		<p>I agree, if someone is rushing you then they can&#8217;t expect a well thought-out answer back in return. Nevermind the fact that most people won&#8217;t like to be pushed or pressured like that.</p>
<p>Either they stop the car and wait for you patiently, or they don&#8217;t bother calling or at least don&#8217;t get upset when your response is curt.</p>
<p>Totally agree.</p>

		<p>Are you debating if male engineers should consider the feelings of their male friends here? The first answer was the best. And if the friend can&#8217;t take it, he is not tech enough. Besides, buying babies from nurseries is boring.</p>

		<p>This is more to Michael J than Raymond&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot; is not acceptable. &nbsp;It&#8217;s basic social etiquette. &nbsp;Geeks (yes, I&#8217;m generalizing) have a hard time understanding that, because logically, &quot;No.&quot; makes perfect sense. &nbsp;It&#8217;s direct and concise, and answers in the manner they indicated was desired.</p>
<p>However, unless you&#8217;re communicating with some of identical mind, it&#8217;s the wrong thing to do. &nbsp;People (in general) don&#8217;t expect it, don&#8217;t want it, and will be insulted by it, no matter what they expressed beforehand. &nbsp;No amount of rationalization on your part can change their behavior. &nbsp;Knock yourself down a peg and learn how to socialize with the majority of humanity, because for better or worse, they&#8217;re here to stay.</p>
