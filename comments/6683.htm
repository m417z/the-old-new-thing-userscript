		<p>Back in the day when I used FVWM everyday for X-Window management, that focus-follows-mouse-with-raise delay was one of the things I felt I couldn&#39;t do without. &nbsp;These days, I never notice its not there anymore in Windows or GNOME. &nbsp;That&#39;s been a good experience for me &#8211; minor changes to people&#39;s favourite interface quirks generate a lot of heat (ask any Metro/KDE4/Gnome3 developer) but anyone with half-a-brain adapts to their new environment in a few days (albeit a few days of unfamiliar annoyances), and has found a new, productive workflow in weeks.</p>

<p>I think video game programmers still don&#39;t know that much about programming for Windows. I play an AAA game (developed by a big-name studio) from 2009 that still defaults to fullscreen at 1024&#215;768.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Focus follows mouse was always the first thing I disabled. To me it&#39;s totally annoying.</p>
<p>Many of the UNIX advocates preach that you should do almost everything with the keyboard and lifting your hand to reach the mouse is a stop gap. But then using the mouse to switch windows seems counter-intuitive, especially since a slight move (in contrast to clicking) could happen accidentally. Also, I much prefer Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V to the X-Clipboard.</p>
<p>Just my 2c.</p>

		<p>Wow X-Mouse memories! I once had a bug report from QA that I could never reproduce &#8211; until I went to the actual QA tester, and watched, and when the focus shifted automatically, I sat there going &quot;How did that happen?&quot;! X-Mouse! His was the only machine with X-Mouse turned on. Yikes!</p>

		<p>@Miff: there is a certain game company that makes a certain game that&#8230; oh what the hell, I&#39;ll say the name: Valve sucks at making games that work well with Windows. You need to be really lucky to be able to minimize them and restore them without much trouble (usually they hang for 3 minutes, and often they just crash), if you&#39;re in windowed mode the window is gonna show as &quot;not responding&quot; while it&#39;s loading, and of course they had to reimplement every single Windows control themselves (select file, simple text inputs&#8230;).</p>
<p>Good thing their gameplay is great.</p>

		<p>Rogue yes, but definately sold me a few copies of windows. &nbsp;Honestly, the availability of this &#39;rogue&#39; feature is what made me a windows developer in the first place. &nbsp;Before I found it, I couldn&#39;t stand to use windows. &nbsp;This is what you get when you actually listen to the user, rather than telling the user what they think (ahem: win8).</p>

		<p>If I were a game developer, and for some reason I had a valid reason to change the user&#39;s resolution by default, instead of just sticking with 1024&#215;768, I would find the nearest possible resolution around the size I want that maintains (where possible) the user&#39;s current resolution&#39;s aspect ratio. Is that so hard to do? Aspect ratios are everything! Who would want to play a stretched (or pillarboxed) game?</p>

		<p>Back in the good old days, MS developers were concerned with adding useful features instead of deleting them or deleting choice. Wish if I could *just mention* to one of the evil shell developers to disable auto sorting. Given the heinous butchery of the Windows shell in each NT6 version, Windows UX will continue to degrade. I am surprised no one is randomly deleting features yet. Oh wait, they are! In Windows 8.</p>

		<p>@AC: &quot;Also, I much prefer Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V to the X-Clipboard.&quot; &nbsp;Technically, that *is* the X clipboard, so you probably meant X selection.</p>
<p>On topic, this &quot;sorry I forgot that&quot; bit amuses me: these things might have been obvious to anyone used to using mouse-focus on *ix, where we traditionally configure our machines to the point nobody else can use it.</p>
<p>I also recall being distinctly disappointed when I had the PowerToys for Windows N, and they didn&#39;t work on Windows N+1: the mouse-focus set the window&#39;s &#39;attention-needed&#39; flag rather than focusing it. &nbsp;Fling the mouse around the screen, and the taskbar turns into a tow-truck&#39;s light bar. &nbsp;(I got the correct PowerToys, but it was not long after that I decided having the only non-ClickToFocus machine in a 50 mile radius was stupid, and reverted it both in windows and fvwm.)</p>

		<p>I do not like the X-Mouse feature, however there&#39;s one more feature that feels way more important to me. Intellipoint usually comes with it, mouse wheel affects the window below the pointer, and not the window with focus. That&#39;s one feature that needs to be incorporated into the shell.</p>

		<p>Intellipoint wheel focus is obnoxious. Unfortunately the software was required to emulate wheel scrolling in older software like the VB6IDE. Some new software is implementing this evil behavior on its own though, as a feature anyone would want.</p>

		<p>I am surprized to find so many people here that don&#39;t like X-Mouse. &nbsp;For me, Windows is unusable without. &nbsp;The key feature of focus follows mouse is that you can work in a window without it obstructing the window that holds the crucial information you need to work with. &nbsp;Try copy/paste something between two windows. &nbsp;In non-X-mouse mode the window you paste into jumps into your face as soon as you press the scroll wheel. &nbsp;You don&#39;t need to see the whole window as the input field is not obstructed by the window you are pasting from. &nbsp;But you need to see where you are coming from and that is gone now. &nbsp;Yuck.</p>
<p>But most people are overwhelmed by working with more than one window at a time anyway. &nbsp;Run everything in full screen mode.</p>

		<p>@Todd: &nbsp;Indeed; I run one of their games full screen on my ThinkPad T420 /w Intel graphics. &nbsp;Pressing the Windows key to bring up the start menu doesn&#39;t work right when I restore the game later; half the time restoring the game results in the game continuing to run (mouse still works, sound still works, stuff obviously going on), but the screen doesn&#39;t update at all. &nbsp;Funny thing is that it used to work fine: either an update to the game or graphics driver broke it.</p>
<p>On another desktop computer I have, their games wouldn&#39;t run full screen properly; they&#39;d hang on startup half the time. &nbsp;I had to run them in a window.</p>
<p>The games themselves run great, I just wish they&#39;d get a few of the windowing basics figured out.</p>

		<p>@Nick, go back to pre-school to learn your basics.</p>

		<p>@Mike 2</p>
<p>The nasty thing about X-mouse is that when you notice that the pointer is in the way of something you&#39;re trying to read, you absently move it out of the way, and bingo, some other window has focus.</p>
<p>Or, if you like, X is unusable without Windows-mouse.</p>
<p>(FWIW, I used X-based systems before using MS Windows, so it&#39;s not a case of what-you-used-first).</p>

<p>That&#39;s easy to avoid, you get used to it. &nbsp;But to learn to read obscured content is different feat.</p>

		<p>Oh, forgot one! I bought SpaceChem (on gog.com of course, I&#39;m not selling my freedom for a virtual pin), and I run it windowed (because I have no reason to have it fill the whole screen), which would work great if it weren&#39;t for the fact that there&#39;s only a preset list of accepted resolutions, and none of them fit my screen well. So it&#39;s either too small, or has a small part cut off on the bottom (and I have to enable auto-hide taskbar). Come on guys, I know flexible layouts are hard, but at least let me do a simple scaling.</p>

		<p>@David &quot;Focus should follow where you are LOOKING, not where the mouse is!&quot;</p>
<p>I know you&#39;re joking but I can&#39;t help shuddering when I think about transcribing text from one window to another with focus follows vision.</p>
<p>Or how programs are going to handle being clicked on while unfocused.</p>
