		<p>Great. Now all I need to know is how to kernel debug a machine without a COM port which only hangs when display power saving is active&#8230;</p>

<br />Comments:</p>
<p>i.e., no COM.  But your blog wouldn&#8217;t allow it.  Comments are REQUIRED.  Spoils the pun.</p>

		<p>Ran into this today &#8212; SQL server 2000 SP4 logged an error 17883 (UMS context &lt;whatever&gt; appears to be non-yielding, on scheduler &lt;whatever&gt;) while the server was having a bunch of other issues.  (TCP connections were timing out, local file access was being either really slow or failing altogether, etc., etc. &#8212; I now suspect the hardware; this server is several years old.)  When I first saw the error, I suspected SQL, but see below.</p>
<p>When SQL 2000 logs this error, it also writes out a mini-dump file.  I loaded this file into windbg, and it appeared that the OS thread that was running the SQL fiber that didn&#8217;t yield was actually sitting at a &quot;ret&quot; instruction inside ZwReadFile in kernel32.  I eventually remembered this posting, and figured out that SQL probably wasn&#8217;t the cause, just another symptom of whatever the problem was.  That leaves hardware as probably the only other option, I think.</p>
<p>The problem did clear up a couple minutes later, not that that&#8217;s any relief if it happens again&#8230;  but oh well.</p>
