		<p>&quot;This is the type of question that leads to tears and hurt feelings.&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe if they learn to do with that in pre-school they won&#39;t grow up into those types of adults who run around being hurt and offended (and demanding apologies) in the real world.</p>

		<p>Having been a &quot;Student 26&quot; myself: It&#39;s not about &quot;bringing people together&quot; it&#39;s probably more like &quot;don&#39;t really belong anywhere, but with those three I at least can play sometimes&quot;. Don&#39;t start to envy him over it&#8230;</p>

		<p>I agree with Joshua: the question is worded in such a way that a single answer seems expected. StudentÂ 26 is the only who challenged that assumption. I&#39;ll bet 23, 24, 30 and 31 all like to play with one another. And they&#39;re the only cycle involving more than 2 kids (that the question detected).</p>

		<p>I note some teachers actually use questions like that to figure out who&#39;s being excluded and do something about it. &nbsp;Although if they&#39;re printing in a yearbook, I suspect that isn&#39;t the case here. &nbsp;I&#39;m so glad we don&#39;t have yearbooks in the UK (or didn&#39;t back when I was at school anyway).</p>

		<p>@Joshua: Does the Apple keyboard have any way to click Shift+F10? &nbsp;That&#39;s how I bring up context menus on keyboards without a dedicated button (such as the full-size keyboard I&#39;m typing on now).</p>

		<p>Brian raises an interesting point but I dare say he has it backwards. The exercise artifically imposes, upon a group that&#39;s still learning social norms, a model of friendship in which it is a well-defined social network, that said links are not necessarily reciprocated, and where the structure in its current form is given permanence (it&#39;s going in the book). That social rigidity, and the moments in which one realises that he or she is not in the social position they assumed they were, strikes me as exactly the sort of thing that leads to needless butt-hurt in adult relationships. It would probably be more helpful to allow children to continue in the free-wheeling unstructured system to which they are accustomed.</p>
<p>Not to wildly extrapolate beyond all common sense of course.</p>

		<p>Advance all the ages by a couple of decades and we have the potential for some romantic comedies:</p>
<p>No C3s, but a C4: 23 =&gt; 30 =&gt; 31 =&gt; 24 (=&gt; 23)</p>
<p>26 and 37 would be an interesting challenge to write about, too.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m just impressed that they managed to get 40 different 4-and-5-year-olds to name a member of their own class!</p>
<p>When they asked my 4-year-old what her favorite sport was, she responded &quot;pig riding&quot;, so it seems unlikely that every single one gave a reasonable answer (and not a pet, fictional character, family member, neighbor, or toy) without coercion.</p>

		<p>Not surprising for at least two separate &#39;cliques&#39; in a group of school children: male and female -&gt; separation of the &#39;cooties&#39;. Certain societies may segregate things further, but again not surprising that there would be at least one sub-clique in each parent clique. Shmumans&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, student 36 gets to experience a hanger-on and reciprocal friendship with a popular person. What an honour! (said in a Zoidberg voice)</p>

		<p>Hey a sociogram :-) they do that at my kids school at least once a year. The question is a bit broader though. Which 3 kids do you play with most and which one do you never play with. </p>

		<p>@carbon twelve, nothing wrong. It is my opinion that by letting conventions be, idioms can continue to be a meaningful communication tool. Trying to fit a gender neutral sentiment into a gendered idiom with an omni-gender construct is not worth the effort to avoid accusations of sexism. Method seldom influences intent. Even the increasingly popular singular &quot;they&quot; is a forced fit. Or maybe, I&#39;m just showing my age :-)</p>

		<p>A regular viewer: The use of singular they has been around for centuries.

		<p>&quot;Singular they&quot; and &quot;genderless he&quot; are rather nonstandard usages of the respective words. However &quot;singular they&quot; has the advantage over &quot;genderless he&quot; in that the former&#39;s singularity is always obvious from context, whereas the latter&#39;s genderlessness is not. That ambiguity can easily lead the reader up the garden path. (E.g. in this instance we might conclude that student 14 is male.)</p>

<p>Ha! Ha! Raymond. I&#39;ve noticed; Manhattanite social skills aside. 10 years of reading your writings is not without its learnings. No, I&#39;m not on to your case. A peeve of mine, that&#39;s all. Will stop with this comment. Sorry for the thread usurp.</p>
<p>@others &#8211; If context is the decider, &#39;he&#39; is as good as &#39;she&#39; which is as good as &#39;they&#39; which is as good as &#39;ghoti&#39;. Last one, perhaps not! Which is what I&#39;m on about. Context is shorn of its validity if we keep trying to make explicit any and every implicit connotation.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m with Sockatume and others. I really dislike male-pronoun-as-generic. Why? Because I think there are two conclusions. If people regularly use &quot;he&quot; as generic, then it is right to assume that &quot;he&quot; is generic and thus there is no way to indicate that you *really* mean &quot;he&quot;, short of saying &quot;and by that I mean he is actually male.&quot; If people do not regularly use &quot;he&quot; as generic, then it is right to assume that &quot;he&quot; actually indicates a male sex, and thus the atypcial generic uses are exclusionary.</p>
<p>IMO both of those options suck, and the least bad one is to use &quot;he&quot; as actually referring to sex and then use something else, either &quot;he or she&quot; or singular &quot;they&quot;, when you want a generic word.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s interesting to note that some languages such as Finnish do not suffer from this problem. Instead, the Finnish language uses the gender neutral word &quot;hÃ¤n&quot; to refer to both he and she. But then, that brings up other problems, such as when you need to distinguish by gender but cannot easily do so.</p>

		<p>@A regular viewer: I&#39;m glad you clarified; I read your comment to mean quite the opposite.</p>
<p>@Gabe: Yes, Chaucer and Shakespeare may have used it but I wouldn&#39;t base correctness on their work &#8212; have you seen their spelling?!</p>
<p>Isn&#39;t English the only language in the top 10 (by use) that doesn&#39;t have some sort of organisation regulating its correct use (cf. The French Academy)? I think we should embrace this aspect of English.</p>

<p>This isn&#39;t even considering that there are multiple dialects of English, even within the United States. &nbsp;Not to mention just how huge the U.S. is, how resistant the population is in general to regulation, and so on. &nbsp;Sometimes there are good reasons to have such institutes, but it has to come from a majority consensus, not from people who are tired of pushing their standards on everyone else.</p>
