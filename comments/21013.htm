		<p>The cover letter is meh&#8230; the name is much, much more important.Recruiting events are all about face time with recruiters.</p>
<p>Being a woman in tech doesn&#8217;t give you many advantages, but getting singled out for 5 minutes attention by a recruiter? That was way way more important.</p>
<p>And remembering the geek&#8217;s name who talked to you? That&#8217;s good for a callback despite any cover letter. I&#8217;m not begrudging, I&#8217;m glad she got a chance. Microsoft is not exactly the bastion of women. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve never really paid much attention to a cover letter &#8211; others might. &nbsp;I guess it&#8217;s a way to demonstrate passion for a particular position. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The big mistake that I&#8217;ve seen some good people make is trying to solve problems like they would normally &#8211; a lot of people get stuck. &nbsp;With half a brain devoted to stress, people need to take smaller steps than they would normally.</p>
