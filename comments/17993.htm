		<p>Back when mortgage was all the rage, I&#8217;ve been getting calls from subprime mortgage companies. I then asked &quot;what&#8217;s your company name, address and phone number&quot;. Most of the time that was enough for the call to magically disonnect. If not, I asked, &quot;Is it OK that I will be recording our call?&quot;. That worked all the time.</p>

		<p>Assuming I have time and am not eager to get to some other activity, I like to act like an eager, but difficult, potential victim&#8230; I mean, investor.</p>
<p>For example, I want to invest with them, but I don&#8217;t have a bank account anymore- I used to, but then someone cleaned it out. Now I keep my money in a masonry jar above the kitchen cabinet. Why, yes, I can send it to you but I have to wait till my son gets home, you see, I can&#8217;t reach the jar. Any story that suggests I would love to send you money, but&#8230;</p>
<p>For some reason, I also like to do fake accents when I&#8217;m doing this. I&#8217;m not particular good at that, and end up going back and forth between a fake Mexican accent and a James Bond-movie style Russian accent.</p>
<p>&quot;No, Mr. Brian George, I expect you to die.&quot;</p>

		<p>But&#8230;but&#8230;thermonuclear device? &nbsp;This is more like the social skills of a passing butterfly in the slightest of breezes.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not to say that I don&#8217;t approve. &nbsp;I heartily approve. &nbsp;It just seems so uncharacteristic of you. &nbsp;Next time, could we get a thermonuclear story purely for entertainment value? &nbsp;&lt;grin&gt;</p>

		<p>My dad&#8217;s method is to ask them to hold the line for a second, then leave the phone off the hook (still on the call) and get on with whatever he&#8217;s doing (usually eating dinner when they call) until they hung up.</p>
<p>It wastes their time without wasting yours. Only a problem if you&#8217;re worried about missing some other call or running down a portable phone&#8217;s battery.</p>

		<p>We&#8217;ve got a dedicated voicemail we transfer these kinds of calls to at work. The recording gets switched around every few weeks. Some of the prior greetings have been The Picard Song and Still Alive. Nobody has yet sit through an entire song.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Why not simply hang up?
</p></blockquote>
<p>In the networking world this strategy is called &quot;tarpitting&quot;. &nbsp;The idea is to slow the telemarketer down to the point where the ROI of telemarketing drops below the ROI of less socially repugnant marketing methods.</p>
<p>If I get telemarketed by a robot, I wait patiently until I get the sucker instructions (press 1 to talk to a warm body) and follow them until I can tarpit a real human. &nbsp;(Tarpitting a real human is much more effective than tarpitting a robot.)</p>

		<p>@AsmGuru62: only if you made the call.</p>
<p>I once received such a call on my cell when I was at work. I told them my battery is going to run out and gave them my work number. They called, and got my extension. I answered (I had one of those handsfree thingies back then), and told them to just hold &#8211; and muted the conversation. After half a minute or so, they asked if I was still there &#8211; I said &quot;sure, I&#8217;m just finishing on the other line&quot;. Got the poor caller to wait for over an hour, and then I said &quot;listen, I have to go to lunch. Would you like to call me back in an hour and a half?&quot; They never called again.</p>

		<p>I had a telemarketer try to sell me credit card insurance (which is a complete and total ripoff <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.moneycentral.msn.com/smartspending/archive/2007/10/23/take-a-pass-on-credit-card-insurance.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.moneycentral.msn.com/smartspending/archive/2007/10/23/take-a-pass-on-credit-card-insurance.aspx</a> )</p>
<p>He wouldn&#8217;t take no for an answer. &nbsp;So after a while, I just started putting the phone down, and every so often picking it up and saying things like &quot;ummm, can you explain that again?&quot; &nbsp;I like to think I saved a number of people from being bothered by the guy :)</p>

		<p>An advantage of getting old is that you develop boilerplate answers for almost all flavors of telemarketers.</p>
<p>For example, many calls this year have been from companies wanting me to switch cellphones and/or operator, my reply is (it&#8217;s actually true):</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;ve had the same cellphone no. and operator for the last 18 years, and plan to keep it that way for the next 18 years. Could you call me after that?&quot;</p>
<p>They always say &quot;Ok, thank you.&quot; and hang up.</p>
<p>/Henry</p>

		<p>A similar thing happened to me in 1997, a week or two after I converted to being a full-time MS employee.</p>
<p>The marketer claimed to be working with a bunch of recent Microsoft hires on investment strategies. I asked questions like &quot;how did you get this number?&quot; and &quot;why are you calling me at work?&quot;, throwing him off his spiel.
