		<p>I can raise and lower my window (possibly) faster than some power window systems!</p>
<p>Oh, and steer around roundabouts using one hand without power steering (mid-to-large sedan with 6cyl engine, so there&#8217;s a bit of weight on the front tyres).</p>

		<p>This reminds me an old story of an ignorant King in ancient China. An official reported to him that people were starving due to lack of grains. He replied: &quot;Why don&#8217;t they eat meat (like I do)?&quot;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve occasionally wished I had non-power windows &#8211; usually in the winter where it&#8217;s iced shut and the wimpy electric motor doesn&#8217;t have enough torque to break it. Whenever I make this observation though, I&#8217;m reminded that odds are equally good that the mechanisms would break (or gradually wear out) if more torque is applied.</p>

		<p>A few months ago I told my children, they were born in the 1980&#8217;s and I was born in the 1940&#8217;s, that if they were to back in time to when I grew up, that that would be the equivalent to going to a foreign country today. They almost believed me!</p>

		<p>My almost-ten-years-old econobox has crank windows and manual locks too. &nbsp; I was actually happy to get them at the time because one of those items always seemed to break in my previous cars.</p>
<p>Now that I&#8217;m thinking about it, it didn&#8217;t help &#8212; the manual window mechanism actually broke in my car at one point. &nbsp;Was still under warranty then though.</p>

		<p>I think you got two of the three things that have changed lives completely since I was a kid (the internet, mobile phones, and computer games, I reckon). Compared to the late 19th and early 20th century, though, the changes are relatively small &#8211; in our grandparents&#8217; lives, the changes are things like world war, smallpox, penicillin, cars and electricity!</p>

		<p>There is a passage somewhat along these lines (the university bit) in Lionel Trilling&#8217;s story &quot;Of this Time, of This Place&quot;, as I recall.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m old enough to have seen seat belts come in, and manual chokes, ashtrays, and oh, I guess curb feelers go out. So it works both ways.</p>

		<p>Actually, that&#8217;s the original US title and was a translation error &#8211; the corrected title of the film is &quot;Bicycle Thieves&quot; (which newer releases list it as); it&#8217;s pretty central to the meaning of the film that it be plural, you&#8217;ll see why should one ever watch it (and I highly recommend doing so).</p>

<p>My old geezer story, back from when Civ 2 was new. Two boys, around 12, in the store, one holding up a box of the original Civilizaiton (I) &nbsp;shouting in excitement &quot;Look! Civilization for only ten marks!&quot; The other boy, not to be moved, looks at the box, wrinkling his nose, saying in dismissal &quot;that&#8217;s just an imitation&quot;.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s too bad that the photographs didn&#8217;t also turn into color when the rest of the world did.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a site, shorpy.com, that often posts large-format Kodachromes from the 1930s. &nbsp;Most of them have at least one comment from a visitor who accuses the site owner of Photoshopping in the color.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the opposite phenomenon &#8212; to think that everything must be a recent invention, because the past was so primitive.</p>

		<p>@Dominic Cronin: &nbsp;Actually, life was easier before color. &nbsp;No worrying whether your tie clashed with your shirt. &nbsp;Fall was less fun, though, because the leaves just turned a slightly different shade of grey. &nbsp;And don&#8217;t get me started about rainbows.</p>
<p>(Actually, I was born after color, but we did have a B/W TV for most of my childhood.)</p>

		<p>@peterchen: After seeing my friend play Civ 1, I asked my dad if we could get it. The next day he came home and told me &quot;I went to the store and looked at the box. We can&#8217;t run the game, it requires EGA graphics.&quot; We only had a CGA monitor. I was heartbroken.</p>

		<p>A friend&#8217;s father used to by pickup trucks for his business, a commercial stockyard. &nbsp;He always made sure to get vehicles with manual window cranks. &nbsp;His stated reason was that if you were stuck in a ditch that started to fill with water, you could get the manual window down, and abandon the vehicle. &nbsp;With an electric window it&#8217;s quite possible that the electrical system would not work by the time you decided to abandon the vehicle.</p>
<p>My understanding as to why nearly all cars have elctric windows now is that it requires much less equipment in the door. No one cares how many revolutions the electric motor takes to get the window up or down, but you certainly didn&#8217;t want to crank the window too many times to get it up or down.</p>

		<p>@Tom: Martin Gardner in his essay &quot;Mathematics and the Folkways&quot; cites German ethnologists (possibly inspired by W.E. Gladstone) who thought that the entire Greek population of Homer&#8217;s day was color-blind. Calvin&#8217;s dad (if I recall the comic correctly) worked in a great tradition.</p>
<p>Back in the day, I had a job that involved driving a company van. Something went wrong inside the door, making the window just a bear to roll up and down. At some point the window must have slipped out and interfered with the latch, for as I made a right turn, the door flew open. I slammed it shut, to see a shower of broken glass fly up and in. Fortunately, auto safety glass <em>had</em> been invented. (If not tints.)</p>

		<p>A friend of my younger brother was visiting our house and said he needed to phone his parents, we pointed him to our phone, a (then) normal black/coil-corded/dial phone, and he just stared at it, not knowing what to do. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The kid (about 8 years old) had only ever seen push-button phones. &nbsp;We had to show him how to chose each number he wanted, put his finger in the hole and spin the dial around until it hit the stopper. &nbsp;It was hilarious!</p>

		<p>When I was a kid, telling me not to touch the window cranks was enough to ‘disable’ them. If you need an automated disabler for that you&#8217;re not a very good parent. That said, most cars I&#8217;ve sat in as a kid didn&#8217;t have separate back doors nor back windows that could open.</p>
<p>Anyway, I didn&#8217;t discover internet until I grew up (or at least, got older) because my parents didn&#8217;t want internet (don&#8217;t know why not, the reason wasn&#8217;t and isn&#8217;t financial since cheap broadband arrived pretty soon where I live) and still I encounter young people who just left their parents place and have essentially never used the internet for that reason. Of course they at least know it exists, which I didn&#8217;t until it seemingly had always been there.</p>
<p>Regarding the buy-a-new-bike comment, that attitude creates a societal mood where bicycle theft is not dealt with properly. And then people get surprised how annoying it is when your bike is gone when you&#8217;re leaving the supermarket with several bags of groceries. And that even those ultra-cheap good-as-new bikes you can buy from junks behind the station do start adding up. And that there seem to be a lot more junks than before, and that they don&#8217;t keep sticking to nicking bikes. I know, I live in a city where we&#8217;ve had this happen. And the problem still persists to some extent, there are still places where you can&#8217;t leave your bike, and you&#8217;ve got to chain your bike up everywhere. When I was a kid you didn&#8217;t even really need to lock your bike.</p>
<p>Oh, and I remember that during the Colourisation we had a referendum on the colours to use in the national flag. We were all so excited!</p>

		<p>More on power windows &#8211; I&#8217;ve said a number of times that it would be nice to have a dual system, with a crank handle as a backup. That would require some sort of mechanism to engage the handle only when it&#8217;s used &#8211; maybe that&#8217;s seen as being too complex.</p>
<p>&quot;My understanding as to why nearly all cars have elctric windows now is that it requires much less equipment in the door.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d imagine that the mechanisms would be similar, with only the drive system being different, but I could be wrong.</p>
<p>To me, the main appeal of power windows and mirrors is being able to control them without reaching over to a distant/awkward part of the car.</p>
<p>What may be more surprising to people is seeing these types of accessories in older cars, e.g. from the early 1970s. On the other hand, Australia&#8217;s Holden Commodore didn&#8217;t have (all) power windows and air conditioning as standard equipment in base models until recently!</p>

<p>electricity was a big revolution, specially for women.</p>
<p>Electricity brang refrigerators which allow women no to spend the entire time in the kitchen finding ways to cook, store and preserve food. Which lead women to be able to seek independence, emancipation, jobs, etc.</p>

		<p>If you read the first Bourne book by Robert Ludlum, the first *half* is about how he goes about faking passports, travel documents and money to get from France to Switzerland. &nbsp;All very clever stuff. &nbsp;In the film he just gets on the train.</p>

		<p>I find the adoption of Cell Phones remarkable.</p>
<p>no.. not for the reasons you think..</p>
<p>The Cell Phone was always &quot;a solution looking for a problem&quot; because there wasnt really a problem!</p>
<p>Sure, a few ultra rich had big bulky (suitcase sized!) mobile phones (usualy installed in their car) because they felt it was important.. but nobody else needed one.</p>
<p>But as time went on they got cheaper.. and cheaper..</p>
<p>..and then payphones / booths started to disappear.</p>
<p>The solution finally found a problem&#8230; one that it created.</p>

<p>You can say that about any technological breakthrough since Fire.</p>

<p>Did people really need for all the computers in the world to communicate freely with each other using a global network and as such set ouy to create &quot;The Internet&quot;?</p>

		<p>My (4 year old) kids have never known a world without TiVo. We were in hotel once and they could not understand why we couldn&#8217;t simply rewind the TV show they happened across while flipping through channels so they could watch it from the beginning. To them the interface was the same, the TV set, they just thought their parents were just capriciously denying them TV :-).</p>

<p>He was a programmer, right? &nbsp;This is a clear case of optimizing for a highly unlikely situation.</p>

		<p>Cell phones solved problems we didn&#8217;t realize we had.</p>
<p>a) Getting separated from the people you&#8217;re with</p>
<p>b) Waiting for somebody who&#8217;s late and not knowing whether he&#8217;ll turn up or not</p>
<p>c) People who felt silly talking into answer machines and so never left you a message</p>
<p>d) Going shopping and being able to call home to find exactly what you need to buy</p>
<p>And of course if you live in most of the Third World</p>
<p>e) The ability to have a phone in the first place</p>

<p>Except that the phones are the reason for the separation to begin with.</p>

<p>If they cared enough they would let you know they will be late or they wouldn&#8217;t be late in the first place.</p>

<p>Yeah&#8230; convenient for those retards not capable of making lists <em>before</em> they go shopping who block the passages in the supermarket as they stand there with a phone oblivious to their surroundings.</p>

<p>Yes, that must be more important than having food.</p>

		<p>&lt;i&gt;If they cared enough they would let you know they will be late&lt;/i&gt;</p>
<p>And if I&#8217;m stuck in stationary traffic due to an accident, how exactly would I do that? CLUE: it involves a mobile phone.</p>

		<p>@asymtote</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve still never even seen a Tivo. I don&#8217;t think they exist on this side of the pond, although there are equivalent devices sold by major telecommunications companies. I think they only work if you&#8217;re in a digital area though.</p>
<p>Do they actually record a buffer of *every* available channel? I&#8217;m inferring that from the way you mentioned flipping through the channels, but I can&#8217;t see how they can tune them all concurrently.</p>
<p>I suspect that by the time I have children old enough to talk there&#8217;ll be no TV, only iPlayer or its descendents.</p>
