		<p>Personally, I think the Captain Koons method is the safest. &nbsp;Perhaps not very convenient (or comfortable), but I&#8217;m pretty sure no burglar would think to look there.</p>

		<p>Not many people would probably want to take my approach, but I hide my valuables with junk. I don&#8217;t have a garage, so have to keep some valuable stuff in my carport. I also keep a pile of junk in my carport (broken electronics, cardboard boxes, an old appliance, etc). Nobody touches the not-broken stuff&#8230;they probably assume it&#8217;s all junk.</p>

		<p>I try not to have valuable stuff. Sometimes you need or want such things of course, but then usually they wouldn&#8217;t be very useful if hidden away and you can&#8217;t go fetching and hiding away everything all the time. Maybe it&#8217;s better to invest in an alarm and/or a house in a safe neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Which may be why so many people believe it works in the digital world too; they just don&#8217;t get how different the parameters are.</p>

		<p>Security through obscurity only works when there are more methods of security in use.</p>
<p>E.g., junk in the carport, but that&#8217;s probably closed and/or locked, and otherwise hidden most of the time right? Or is it exposed 24/7? Or you have a tendency to have minimal surveillance so someone can&#8217;t slowly rifle through your stuff? (i.e., you look at it sometimes, maybe to make sure there aren&#8217;t any miscreants obviously rifling through your stuff).</p>
<p>After all, wasn&#8217;t Windows 2000 found out by someone scanning IPs?</p>
<p>Truth is, most people with physical objects use security by obscurity with other security measures &#8211; maybe a locked door, etc. In which case it helps. Security be obscurity alone is like keeping the housekey under the doormat or in the mailbox &#8211; a thief can duplicate the key and return it unknown, only to return much later.</p>

<p>Wow, and I thought Microsoft had a marketing department that announced products that they wanted to see!</p>

		<p>In my bachelor days I rented a house along with a shifting cast of other men. A neighbor a couple of doors up was burglarized at least twice during those years, with expensive stuff taken. We had somebody come through a window once and steal a backpack that might&#8217;ve cost $25 in 1975 dollars, but otherwise were so blatantly not worth bothering that we were left alone.</p>
<p>But then we had no TV, no computers, no stereos in that house. How many of us following this blog live that way?</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Security through obscurity (real or electronic) works only against drive-by threats. &nbsp;If your stuff or your data is targeted, obscurity won&#8217;t help much.</p>
<p>I have deadbolts on my doors and good locks on the windows. &nbsp;Not because I think it will keep a thief out, but because it will send him next door to an easier target.</p>
<p>Also, we keep the curtains up so they can clearly see that we own nothing of value :)</p>

<p>Worf, a carport is like a porch for a car. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a roof that extends off the side of the house, to protect the car and owner from the rain and snow. &nbsp;It can&#8217;t be locked, because most of the sides have no walls.</p>

		<p>Security depends on your objective. Obscurity isn&#8217;t very useful in most computer security scenarios because automation or tools work quickly.</p>
<p>Locks are security by obscurity. A better lock requires a burglar to spend a little more time fiddling with the lock &#8212; but all locks are are eventually defeatable.</p>

<p>Not sure about the first sentence, but your second points out precisely why I value obscurity.</p>
<p>Darin&#8217;s point &quot;If your stuff or your data is targeted, obscurity won&#8217;t help much.&quot; is pretty much the real danger.</p>
<p>I like the idea that I can zip a file, rename the extension and put it on a diskette and circulate around the globe and only about .01% of anybody would investigate the &quot;file is an unknown type&quot; error from the program. &nbsp;Then if you&#8217;ve got a fancy doohickey encrypt/decypter with DNA and retinal scanner, you&#8217;re good.</p>
