		<p>Getting data yourself and do analysis is difficult.</p>
<p>On the other hand, scrap data from other site and find the mode is easy, so usually the minimum energy path is chosen.</p>

		<p>My guess is that the $5 million comes from an early estimate used on the paperwork to start probate.  It was probably easy to show that the estate had at least $5 million, which is perhaps a threshold for the type of probate being requested.  Higher estimates likely came later after there was more time to determine the extent of the estate.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s about as far north as you can go.</p>

		<p>I love the &#8220;proprietary algorithm&#8221; schtick.  Almost as hilarious as the routine &#8220;you asked for it under the Freedom of Information Act, but we can&#8217;t tell you, because it would breach Commercial Confidentiality.&#8221;</p>
<p>In memory of the great John Mahoney, a Chicago stalwart, I would suggest that he would deny any figure &#8220;north of&#8221; but quite possibly accept one that was &#8220;north by northwest of.&#8221;</p>
<p>(Small geographical joke, incorporating the fact that both John and Cary Grant were born in England.)</p>

		<p>My guess is that these sites&#8217; analysis is based almost entirely on estimating total assets, and without accounting for the other half of &#8220;net worth,&#8221; i.e., total liabilities.</p>

		<p>Shouldn’t we just ask Facebook, because they have everybody’s authoritative data anyway?</p>
