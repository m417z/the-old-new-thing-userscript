		<p>I&#8217;m really annoyed by those cell phones with bright back-lit displays that people pull out during movies and such. Just because I can&#8217;t hear it doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t annoying. Since it&#8217;s the brightest thing in the room, one can&#8217;t help but be distracted by it.</p>

		<p>I actually did that once. &nbsp;I forget that it blinks. &nbsp;Fortunately, before the movie started, someone said something to me, so I turned it off. &nbsp;Since then, I take the headset off when I go to movies. &nbsp;I also put the phone on vibrate. &nbsp;On the off chance I get a call that&#8217;s actually an emergency, I don&#8217;t turn the phone off. &nbsp;If I get a call that requires me to answer it, I&#8217;ll leave the theater.</p>

		<p>He probably just didn&#8217;t realize&#8230; &nbsp;I don&#8217;t wear a headset, but if I did I&#8217;m not sure I would be aware of the blinking LED.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too bad that the people in the row right behind him didn&#8217;t let him know. &nbsp;I think that too many people in the Seattle area think it would be &#8216;rude&#8217; to lean over and say, &quot;Excuse me, would you mind turning off your headset? &nbsp;The LED is quite distracting&quot;.</p>

		<p>I agree with the devil&#8217;s advocate, Bob King. When I did my compulsory military service I got so used to carrying a gun at my side, since it was part of my uniform. There was a supermarket a little outside the camp (located close to a residential area, btw) where we went to shop snacks for the night guard/watch. Well, long story short I once forgot that I was wearing the gun and walked in there to shop. The shop manager wasn&#8217;t too pleased with that since it scared him &amp; his customers (and potentially bad guys could try to steal it from me and then use it to threat other people).</p>

		<p>I have to also agree with someone :)</p>
<p>I agree with mikeb: too many people are too shy to actually tell others that they are annoying. Chances are, they don&#8217;t even realise they are annoying others.</p>
<p>They may also be assholes but you have nothing to lose at trying.</p>

		<p>It may be that the people directly behind the headset wearer aren&#8217;t bothered by the blinkin&#8217; light because the stage occupies a bigger field of view vs. the headset. But it&#8217;s more noticable to people furthur away.</p>
<p>&#8220;pssst, tell the guy over there [pointing] to take off his headset. Pass it down.&#8221;</p>
<div class=post>[<i>The people distracted by the headset are not in a position to tap the person on the shoulder: You have to be a few seats to the side (because the headset is ear-mounted) and a few rows back (otherwise it&#8217;s not in your field of view). -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>While it&#8217;s not really an excuse to wearing a headset during a performance, I know my headset has the option to turn the blink off if I hold down the Volume Up and Volume Down buttons for a couple seconds.</p>

		<p>I just took my kid to a movie and they had added a notice about texting during the movie. &nbsp;I was quite pleased. &nbsp;It&#8217;s too bad in our society that movie theaters have to spend ten minutes telling us something we should do without the reminder. &nbsp;I&#8217;d rather they do it, but still&#8230; &nbsp;I&#8217;ve noticed that the warnings seem to get longer and longer for each movie I see. &nbsp;That&#8217;s probably a good thing. &nbsp;At least some of them are pretty funny.</p>

		<p>I think this is an insidious marketing gimick. What is the point of a flashing indicator that the user **cannot see when they are wearing the headeset?**</p>
<p>A little flash to confirm the headset has been turned on/off, or when one of its buttons is pressed, is useful. The only purpose that I can see for an idle indicator is to broadcast, &quot;hey, look at the way-cool headset this hip, trendy Important Person is wearing&quot;</p>
<p>One particular Motorola headset blinks when a call is active. The manual says that is a feature to let others know you are on a call. Most people do not know the blink codes of their own gadgets &#8211; how in h?ll are other people supposed to know what *your* headset is blinking for?!</p>

		<p>Amen&#8230;what happened to common courtesy??? &nbsp;It&#8217;s not just the stupid ring tones anymore, it *is* the bright screens while people text message during the movie. &nbsp;Once upon a time folks went to movies to see the movies, not to test their per-adolescent friends about how far they are getting with their new boyfriend(s). &nbsp;I bring a bag of Reeses Pieces with me and just wing candies at people who do this. &nbsp;If they get pissed enough to stand up and protest, I tell them to keep their f&#8217;ing phone closed.</p>
<p>Of course, not that I condone any of this, or the following, because such devices are not legal in the US&#8230;but a cell phone jammer is a beautiful thing to have. &nbsp;&lt;vbeg&gt;</p>

		<p>Oh, don&#8217;t spoil the fun! Bluetooth devices are fun things to hack &#8211; especially when you hijack an existing connection to blast people with&#8230;</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/clips/how-to-eavesdrop-on-bluetooth-headsets-328664.php" rel="nofollow">http://gizmodo.com/gadgets/clips/how-to-eavesdrop-on-bluetooth-headsets-328664.php</a></p>
<p>(It says evesdropping, but it&#8217;s bi-directional. You can play audio to the headset, as well as receive it&#8230;)</p>
<p>Might be fun to do in a theatre before the lights dim.</p>

		<p>I recently had a time in a class where a teacher&#8217;s cell phone rang, despite the fact that in school you are supposed to turn cell phones off. The teacher ignored it.</p>

		<p>it begs the question &#8211; why do all bluetooth things need to &#8216;flash&#8217; at all? can&#8217;t they do what they do &#8216;silently&#8217; ? &nbsp;&#8230; me thinks the flashing blue is nothing but a stupid marketing gimmick&#8230;</p>

		<p>I have one of those digital watches that bleeps every hour (yes, I like it). Unfortunately I forget to turn it off during a carol concert, and Silent Night happened to fall just on the hour&#8230; d&#8217;oh!</p>
