		<p>Not to pick nits, but a simple disclosure of data does not constitute a copyrightable work. Only the presentation may be protected. What this means is that you don&#8217;t need to pay attention to that second highlighted sentence. Somebody got a bit too happy with the legal boilerplate, methinks.</p>
<p>This reminds me of a college prof &#8211; he did an online course where the lecture notes were distributed as pdfs. At the top of every pdf was a big, scary copyright notice, complete with the sort of t&amp;c you have above. As if the notes were worth stealing &#8211; everybody knows that the interaction with the prof is the valuable part.</p>

		<p>I remember thinking about making a Microsoft Agent at one point &#8212; you know, like the paperclip.</p>
<p>BTW, Microsoft missed a big one by not licensing Jar Jar Binks.  Just imagine Jar Jar popping up on the desktop!  And you thought a *paperclip* was annoying&#8230;</p>
<p>The EULA for just downloading the DDK was intense.  Part of it boiled down to saying &quot;you cannot create an agent who espouses beliefs that denigrate Microsoft&quot;.  Err&#8230; so I could not make a paperclip that says &quot;Outlook is slow&quot;.</p>
<p>So I refused to download it.  A shame, looked like it would have been fun.  But content restrictions like that are just nasty.</p>

		<p>On the subject of licenses etc, Microsoft was the first company I spotted to change one part to something reasonable.  They warrant that a product will perform substantially in accordance with the accompanying documentation, for a period of 90 days.  I have this vision of Word turning into a flight simulator or a tax calculator on the 91st day :-)  (Yes I do know about the Excel easter egg).</p>
<p>For almost anyone else&#8217;s license, if the text editor turns out to calculate pi, well then tough luck.  Heck, if it turns out to be a can of baked beans then it is still tough.</p>

		<p>This isn&#8217;t a copyright issue or a licensing issue per se, it&#8217;s a non-disclosure issue.  There is often a non-disclosure term in commercial licenses, and refusal to accept that term means that you have no license to have/use the copyrighted work.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s still an open question, as the license typically is only available after purchase, and there&#8217;s no recourse if you don&#8217;t accept it. It also is tied to a retail purchase and has no expiration, so the Supremes may rule it to be a sale ala CDs.

		<p>Whether or not you are a religious person, the phrase &quot;acts of God&quot; does have a formal legal definition.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s just the insurance companies&#8217; definition of &quot;acts of god&quot;, and a generalized one.  My State Farm terms of service document spends a few paragraphs on it, explicitly delinteating certain things (and not others).</p>
<p>From what I understand, a spokesperson for the Yankees claimed that stupidity was also an act of god, which is why they should be allowed to sit out the games after their pitcher&#8230; well, had an &quot;act of god&quot; happen to him.  Sounded pretty lame to me, but&#8230;</p>

		<p>My favorite legal document has to be the Sony warranty.  It reads, and I quote:</p>
<p>&quot;This warranty is limited as set out herein and does not cover, inter alia, any consumable items (such as batteries) supplied with the Product; any accessory products which are not contained in the Product (such as mouse, port replicator, AC adapter and speaker); cosmetic damages; damage or loss to any software programs, data, or removable storage media; or damage due to *acts of God*, accident, misuse, abuse, negligence, commercial use or modifications of the Product.&quot;</p>
<p>Acts of God?  They actually use the phrase &quot;acts of god&quot; in their warranty.  Well depending on how religious you are, you could consider anything an act of God.<br /></p>

<p>A lack of that phrase would strike me as a good way to incite some judge out there to decide that the license is invalid.

		<p>I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a matter of two many lawyers, I think it&#8217;s a matter of bad lawyers. Most of this stuff gets written once by a lawyer who doesn&#8217;t understand the field they&#8217;re writing about, and would never stand up in court anyway.</p>

		<p>Some companies are responding to the obvious stupidity, partly due to court cases; I&#8217;ve noticed Winforms and some others now package their software in a DVD case with a folded license agreement stuck around it, so you actually have to read the long agreement before you can break the seal and open it.</p>
<p>Also I have the mother of all online agreements:<br />

<br />God knows where they got this.</p>

		<p>In general:</p>
<p>&#8211; There&#8217;s no claim of fitness for any particular purpose, nor any warranty, so no guarantee that the software does anything in particular.</p>
<p>&#8211; You are forbidden to reverse-engineer the software to find out what it really does.</p>
<p>Plus, with auto-update, the publisher can change the software if they feel like making you pay again for a feature.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t it feel great to be a con$um€r?</p>

		<p>Oh, and I thought this quotation was appropriate:</p>
<p>&quot;Crowley had been extremely impressed with the warranties offered by the computer industry, and had in fact sent a bundle Below to the department that drew up the Immortal Soul agreements, with a yellow memo form attached just saying: &#8216;Learn, guys.&#8217;&quot;</p>

<p>&gt; They warrant that a product will perform<br />
<br />&gt; substantially in accordance with the<br />
<br />&gt; accompanying documentation, for a period of<br />
<br />&gt; 90 days.</p>
<p>I wonder what &quot;warrant&quot; means in that sentence.  It certainly doesn&#8217;t mean &quot;provide warranty service&quot;, because Microsoft tells customers to go to the OEMs and the OEMs say they don&#8217;t have fixes for Microsoft bugs.  Microsoft told me to contact Microsoft&#8217;s legal department about this, but Microsoft&#8217;s legal department said &quot;&quot;.</p>

<p>&gt; WRT the copyright notice, the only thing<br />
<br />&gt; you&#8217;re getting a license to use is the<br />
<br />&gt; airline&#8217;s software.</p>
<p>The airline didn&#8217;t agree with you.  Mr. Chen quoted them in the base note:</p>
<p>&gt; You are authorized to access OnePass account<br />
<br />&gt; information solely to obtain information<br />
<br />&gt; regarding your OnePass account and for no<br />
<br />&gt; other purpose.</p>
<p>Whether or not the information can be copyrighted, the airline doesn&#8217;t give the information to Mr. Chen in the first place unless he says he agrees to its license.</p>
