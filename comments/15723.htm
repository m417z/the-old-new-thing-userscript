		<p>Sad thing shared folder icon was removed. That was the only overlay that was useful to me.</p>

		<p>There is one icon missing from this list:</p>
<p>A multi-colored shield icon. &nbsp;This means that a UAC prompt will appear when you access run this program.</p>
<p>Or at least I&#8217;ve only seen it on programs.</p>
<p>(I also find it amusing that the captcha I&#8217;m being presented with is 404.</p>

		<p>After being confused by it, then working out what it meant, I&#8217;ve found the padlock icon to be really useful.</p>
<p>I often move video files into a share that my HTPC can see and if I move them from a private folder on the same partition they don&#8217;t always get the permissions of the new folder (depending on which program I move them with, anyway). The padlock means I notice that straight away instead of when I&#8217;m downstairs trying to view the thing on my TV. &#8217;tis a good idea.</p>
<p>I missed the share overlays at first but not anymore. I think I just missed them because I was used to seeing them. It&#8217;s not like I am constantly sharing and unsharing folders and need a visual reminder of the state of them at all times. Shares are a rather static piece of configuration.</p>

		<p>What I&#8217;d like to know is: Was the overlay simply removed so users can still set their own overlay for shared items? Or was the ability to display an overlay for shared items itself removed? I hope it&#8217;s the former and if not I hope Windows 7 SP1 to make it the latter. User choice remember? After all these years!</p>

		<p>Btw why is HomeGroup flawed/insecure by design?: <a href="http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itpronetworking/thread/65a65b3a-b9b3-46da-8414-265797990c62" target=_new rel=nofollow rel="nofollow">http://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/w7itpronetworking/thread/65a65b3a-b9b3-46da-8414-265797990c62</a>. Of course I want HomeGroup to simplify sharing, of course I want HomeGroup to share my entire libraries but on downlevel OSes, libraries aren&#8217;t exactly the equivalent of special folders. By sharing the entire users folder and giving permission to &#8220;Everyone&#8221;, you are causing massive potential privacy/sharing issues. That essentially makes HomeGroup as secure as password less file sharing/simple file sharing.</p>

		<p>What about the little icon with two MSN-style people looking at each other?</p>
<p>I have a DVD encoder program that shoves this overlay on every file it creates, and I have absolutely no idea what it means or how to get rid of it.</p>

		<p>Yeah, I have the same question as James Schend. &nbsp;I frequently use Cygwin and any file it creates has that icon on it. &nbsp;(Here <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://i45.tinypic.com/1692uf6.png" rel="nofollow">http://i45.tinypic.com/1692uf6.png</a> is what it looks right.)</p>

		<p>@James Schend, Miff: as a guess, it has something to do with access control lists. Cygwin likes to set its own ACL instead of using the default one.</p>

		<p>We have gotten the gray X in another scenario. &nbsp;If a file is marked for offline but offline files are disabled (or allocated 0 space) on the machine and then the machine goes offline (or it believes it is offline) we will get the gray X. &nbsp;We thought it indicated an unavailable offline file. &nbsp;Before someone asks how this circumstance happens, it is User GPO vs Machine GPO when a student gets a loaner laptop.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m curious to know why is there a 15 image limit for overlays?</p>
<p>And do external overlay programs such as TortiseSVN that can place overlay icons on images need to use up the remaining slots out of the 15 images, or is there a new limit for new overlays?</p>

		<p>Bengt &#8211; Thanks. Do you know if there&#8217;s a help file or somewhere to get a complete list of icons and what they mean? Raymond&#8217;s article is great, but it&#8217;s only scratching the surface. :)</p>

		<blockquote><p>

<p>Bah. &nbsp;There are a finite number of overlay formats and a finite number of possible icons in each format. &nbsp;A complete list is therefore quite possible, though not perhaps as useful as James would like.</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8230;external overlay programs such as TortiseSVN&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>TortoiseSVN has to work within the limit of 15 as well. That&#8217;s why TortoiseSVN, TortoiseCVS, TortioseGit and TortoiseHG all share a common &quot;TortoiseOverlays&quot; component, otherwise if you had two or more of those programs installed, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to use all of the overlays.</p>
<p>As for finding out all the possible overlays, I believe the following registry key will show you all of your currently installed overlay handlers. You&#8217;ll just have to follow the tracks a bit:</p>
<p>HKLMSOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionExplorerShellIconOverlayIdentifiers</p>

		<p>@R. Bemrose:</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, the shield means that the app will request elevation when run. Whether that means you&#8217;ll get a UAC prompt is up to a variety of other factors (in Win7). Also, it doesn&#8217;t necessarily mean the app *requires* elevation; it&#8217;s possible Windows has detected it&#8217;s an older app that is simply *likely* to need elevation in order to work correctly. It&#8217;s still up to you to decide whether to grant elevation when it&#8217;s requested.</p>

		<p>What a nice example of how hard it must be to make changes in Windows without annoying some percentage of the user base. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve found the sharing overlay useful before, but haven&#8217;t particularly missed it.</p>
<p>(Personally, I&#8217;d have thought someone managing an enterprise network with thousands of shares changing daily would have required something other than these overlays to manage it, but I guess not.)</p>

<p>I can cope with the &quot;MSN people&quot; icon being there, as long as it doesn&#8217;t mean something like &quot;these files will self-destruct in 24 hours!&quot; Just bugs the heck out of me that there&#8217;s no way to look it up.</p>

		<p>I think the &quot;MSN people&quot; overlay is a bit like the opposite of the padlock overlay. I&#8217;ve seen it on &quot;public items in private places&quot; (as opposed to &quot;private items in public places&quot; which is what the padlock is for).</p>
<p>Not 100% sure, though.</p>
<p>If I create a new folder below my C:UsersLeo dir and then share it (via Advanced sharing, FWIW), then the &quot;MSN people&quot; overlay appears over that folder. But it then vanishes as soon as I refresh the directory. (Perhaps the overlay limit is being hit?)</p>

<p>Well, ok, but how about a complete list of the ones *built-in* to Windows? I&#8217;ve Googled, I&#8217;ve searched Windows Help, I can&#8217;t find any mention of that icon anywhere. (Admittedly, it&#8217;s not an easy thing to search for.)</p>
<p>I highly, highly doubt that my video program made by GNU-loving hippies integrates with Windows well-enough to provide its own icon overlay. But hey, I could be wrong.</p>

		<p>@asd, I wasn&#8217;t quoting him at all. I was just hoping that because a DCR has been made to PSS, MS might accept it.</p>

		<p>15 available overlay icons in an OS from 2009 is a joke.</p>
<p>And every new Windows version is allocating more and more of the scarce resources available, thus making existing apps work worse.</p>
<p>Windows 8 will propably work-a-round this problem somehow (in an even more flawed way). Not because the designers wants other apps to work better, but because the want &gt;15 icons themselves. That would be the only reason for them to fix this pathetically low limit.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>I don&#8217;t understand why you want to make a bad situation worse. In my opinion, overlays are a bad way of conveying information since you can display only one of them at a time. We should be making overlays <u>less</u> attractive, not more. -Raymond</i>]</div>
