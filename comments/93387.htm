		<p>If there&#8217;s one thing I&#8217;ve learned from Disney, it&#8217;s that everybody speaks English, they have always spoken English, and they follow exactly the same cultural norms everywhere.</p>

		<p>The characters speak whatever language is spoken in their target markets. And although Disney presumably spends a pretty penny getting people like Elton John and Phil Collins to contribute songs, they go and ruin that afterwards by getting nobodies (relatively speaking) to sing their translated lyrics.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know about the distant past, but modern Disney movies are dubbed into every language. They often even have alternate sound tracks for the UK and America (e.g. <a href="http://pixar.wikia.com/wiki/Harv" rel="nofollow">http://pixar.wikia.com/wiki/Harv</a>). Therefore what Mulan speaks is not what you hear.</p>
<p>The Mulan you met didn&#8217;t handle the question properly. She should have spun some line about not speaking Chinese because she is in the US to learn English. I was sitting out the back of a shop in Magic Kingdom years ago because the rest of my party were shopping and I was bored, Belle appeared to do a story reading but nobody had turned up. So I got to spend quite a while trying to get her to break character. While she was historically inaccurate as she said she flew with Beast from France to America, she managed quite well.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether they appreciate it or whether they just think you&#8217;re weird.</p>

		<p>But how can she be in the US to learn English if she lived a thousand years before the colonies were settled? :) I&#8217;d prefer something more like this (a bit simplified since I&#8217;m not that familiar with the Chinese language situation, and I&#8217;m not sure a Disney cartoon character would be either):</p>
<p>— Do you speak Chinese?<br />
— Sure I do!</p>
<p>The visitor tries Chinese.</p>
<p>— I&#8217;m sorry, what language is that?<br />
— Um, Chinese?<br />
— Well, but it can&#8217;t be Chinese since I only speak Chinese, isn&#8217;t that so? And we clearly understand each other perfectly!</p>
<p>Visitor shows her a dictionary of English.</p>
<p>— What does it say here?<br />
— Let&#8217;s see&#8230; the Chinese Language Dictionary!<br />

<p>Magic. If you&#8217;re there talking to her then she is definitely there. There are different characters from different time periods, so it&#8217;s not you that has travelled in time.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve never been to Disneyland, but I&#8217;d assume that those characters mostly inhabit their own virtual machines, without actually interacting with one another in any sort of meaningful manner? (How would that be scripted, let alone acted out spontaneously?) And if they cannot interact, then clearly they don&#8217;t inhabit the same environment, and it is rather the visitor who is jumping between their individual VMs.</p>

<p>That would be more confusing to children, because it obviously isn&#8217;t Chinese.</p>

		<p>Depends; children play-pretend all the time, which might include pretending they were Belle while knowing they don&#8217;t actually speak French.</p>

		<p>But Raymond&#8217;s daughter says that Mulan doesn&#8217;t speak Chinese, so it&#8217;s safe to imagine she doesn&#8217;t think Belle speaks French either.</p>
<p>She would almost certainly be right, the original story was written in 1740 and only 12% of people spoke French and they lived in cities. It was only after the 1798 revolution that French started to be universally used in France. While it&#8217;s possible she could speak French, it&#8217;s unlikely that every other character in the story would. I doubt most children even know that Belle is from France.</p>
<p>Whatever the cast members say has to be appropriate for children of every age and understanding. You don&#8217;t need to worry about the ones that think that it&#8217;s just a person in a costume.</p>

		<p>Sorry, I didn&#8217;t quite get which language you think the character should be speaking? I don&#8217;t know anything about the story, but a quick glance at the Wikipedia plot summary reveals French names such as Maurice, Gaston, Philippe, Lumière, so I assume she&#8217;d speak French according to the internal logic of the Disney film version.</p>
<p>Yes, the actor would have to be experienced in talking to children; there may be other ways to manipulate the question without breaking character.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know enough about the language situation in Mulan&#8217;s time or what language / dialect she&#8217;d be speaking, but the important thing to consider is that for the purposes of interaction with visitors, English maps to that particular language, the character being essentially dubbed. Therefore, not addressing Mulan in English means using a different language, one she need not be familiar with as a character. However, if she is asked in English whether she speaks Chinese (meaning Mandarin), then the answer would depend on whether such a question would be meaningful to the character at that time in history (I thought one only spoke languages such as Mandarin or Cantonese?). I just hope that &#8220;Sorry, no&#8221; wasn&#8217;t a case of breaking the fourth wall, a UI exception of sorts.</p>

<p>All Disney princesses understand what cameras are, so they aren&#8217;t stuck in their time period (whatever Mulan&#8217;s time period actually is)</p>

		<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be so sure&#8230;</p>
<p>You see, those who have taken a course in translation and linguistics know of a middle-eastern word that today translates to &#8220;China&#8221; but originally meant &#8220;India&#8221;. I can give more details if you wish, but in summary, a loss in translation might have occurred and the story might have been &#8220;Indian&#8221; instead of &#8220;Chinese&#8221;. Reinforcing this fact is that the original Aladdin story is devoid of key signature Chinese cultural elements and has a middle eastern setting instead.</p>

		<p>Well the Chinese spoken language never really unified, and that far back it&#8217;s entirely possible that Mulan (presuming there is a person behind the legend) would speak none of the modern dialects.</p>

		<p>Mulan almost certainly would not have spoken Mandarin. While the legends place her in the generally right geographic area, she&#8217;s about 900-600 years too early for the local dialects to have been combined into (old) Mandarin.</p>

		<p>@Maurits,<br />
While the original story is said to be set in &#8220;China&#8221;, the writer seems to know nothing about Chinese culture, so the story as presented is a lot more at home with some sort of &#8220;Arabia&#8221;.</p>

<p>Jasmine definitely doesn&#8217;t speak Arabic because she was from a Persian-speaking locale. The genie, however, did know at least a little Persian, enough to write &#8220;بوقلمون&#8221;, Persian for Turkey the bird.</p>

		<p>The histo-lengendary Mulan was from southern China, so more likely to speak Cantonese than the invader language of the north.</p>

		<p>If that is the case, she may really speak Cantonese then.</p>
<p>Cantonese pronounciation has not been changed much over time since the &#8220;Spring and autumn period&#8221;, that&#8217;s why most of the &#8220;楚詞&#8221; still sound correct when recited in Cantonese but may not match the &#8220;oblique rule&#8221; when recited in Mandarin.</p>
