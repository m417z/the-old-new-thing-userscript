		<p>Hmm&#8230; There wasn&#39;t by any chance a startup overhead to running the program in question, which would&#39;ve remained the same even if the validation rule = don&#39;t validate? It could&#39;ve been the reason they wanted to remove the validation in the first place.</p>

		<p>And then, everyone begins abusing it by starting all their record descriptions with &quot;EMERGENCY&quot;.</p>

		<p>@DebugErr: There&#39;s nothing physically stopping you from pressing the fire alarm button at your office. &nbsp;If you see smoke, pressing it is fine and you will be praised for it. &nbsp;However, if you repeatedly press it without good reason, that will be career-limiting.</p>
<p>An emergency change process could be dealt with by management in the same way &#8211; using it for genuine emergencies is fine and you will be praised for it; abusing it for non-emergencies should have consequences.</p>
<p>Even if management won&#39;t take it seriously, it&#39;s possible to have more technical limits on an EMERGENCY process &#8211; e.g. if you abuse it then your access to the EMERGENCY process is revoked:</p>
<p>&gt; if (record.description.beginsWith(&quot;EMERGENCY&quot;) and record.author != &#39;DebugErr&#39;)</p>

<p>Emmm&#8230; I thought it&#39;s sent to some senior management above according to approval path settings, instead of database administrators.</p>
<p>There will also be reason and a link of approval page provided.</p>
<p>Virtually all Accounting (for adjust of past months data) / HR (for leave and OT approval) / Purchasing Dept. applications I worked for have this kind of settings.</p>
<p>In fact, for a lot of systems, DBA is not allowed to modify production data directly (except when running schema upgrade script for system updates). I don&#39;t think sending them request could help. :P</p>

		<p>@Raymond</p>
<p>This is why I find the term DBA to be ambiguous. &nbsp;First, you have the database operator who keeps the server running, applies patches, makes sure there&#39;s enough disk for everybody&#39;s databases, and babysits the DBMS if/when it decides to wet the bed at 2AM. &nbsp;Then there&#39;s the database developer, who writes and tunes schemas and application queries, perhaps assisting with reporting as well depending on the database in question, and works with the database operator to troubleshoot failures. &nbsp;Finally, there&#39;s what I&#39;ll call a &quot;data custodian&quot; &#8212; someone, usually from the business side, who has responsibility for making sure that the data in the database is satisfactory from a business standpoint.</p>

		<p>@Raymond: At my workplace, filing critical-severity change requests is considered part of a normal workflow which is used multiple times per week. &nbsp;This is generally not the result of a bug or anything like that; it is &quot;I want to roll my code out by Thursday&quot;-type requests.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;m just too cynical.</p>
