		<p>Many companies would be happy to rely on things that will break in the next version because it gives them a reason to charge an upgrade fee for a new version of the software.</p>

		<p>I imagine the review meant that Vista would have been a better OS if the PowerToys had been made to work with Vista or rewritten so that they did, not that they should magically work even though it says explicitly that they won&#39;t. That doesn&#39;t really have to do with expectations.</p>

		<p>I agree with James. &nbsp;&quot;Flaw&quot; was probably a poor choice of a word to describe it. &nbsp;If they had said, &quot;A real shortcoming in Vista is that lack of support for the PowerToys available in XP&quot; then there&#39;s really no argument (and many people probably agree with the statement).</p>
<p>To be honest, the lack of PowerToys in Vista and 7 did kind of disappoint me. &nbsp;I realize you guys may not even be paid to develop them, but I always really liked the idea they represented.</p>
<p>Do you mind if I ask if the development of PowerToys has been discouraged by MS, or if there&#39;s some other reason none have shown up for Vista or 7?</p>

		<p>The only powertoy I really really really miss like CRAZY is Super Fast User Switcher. I hope some version of Windows incorporates this fantastic functionality. With recent versions of Windows (read Vista and later), fast user switching is no longer fast. It&#39;s slow and requires several clicks to actually switch the user. Although it was pulled, it still works nicely with XPSP3. Also MS could make the Color Control Panel applet which is a .NET 1.1 somehow just run on Vista/7 so we can view the gamut graph of a color profile which Vista/7&#39;s CM applet doesn&#39;t show.</p>

		<p>Regarding FUS, there is an unfortunate &quot;feature&quot; that the switch involves video hardware reset. Certain very popular video chipset vendor NNNNNN has 5 second delay in the driver, which makes the user switch very annoying. The delay was there in Vista driver, and it&#39;s still there in the latest W7 driver.</p>
<p>Also, I wonder whose &quot;smart&quot; idea was to make Win+L in Vista+ with FUS to go to &quot;Lock&quot; screen (like XP does with FUS disabled), instead of FUS screen. What was the rationale? Isn&#39;t FUS screen good enough as lock? Now everybody has either to use start menu item to switch users, or click &quot;switch user&quot; from the lock screen.</p>
<p>Also, when on &quot;lock&quot; screen, and another host is trying to connect through RDP, the other host will get &quot;console in use&quot; response. While the console is definitely not in use.</p>

		<p>@Jeffrey Bosboom: That&#39;s sad but true.</p>
<p>I know of one or two companies that makes software that ALWAYS break in each Windows upgrade, have to provide some &quot;workaround&quot; for certain mission critical functions and people wonders. It&#39;s not about software QC because their software are otherwise quite reliable. I can&#39;t help but think it&#39;s (at least partly) because of the reason you said.</p>

		<p>I have to say that the inability to use Tweak UI in Vista and Win7 is a big weakness of the OS for me. I completely understand that it wasn&#39;t *intended* to work with other OSs, but that doesn&#39;t change the fact that I miss them a lot.</p>

		<p>well, raymond, maybe you should spend less time on the blog and update the powertoys to run on win 7.&lt;g&gt;</p>

		<p>@Boris, the powertoy I mentioned allowed FUS with one keystroke (Win+Q) combination. Even if you don&#39;t use that powertoy, in XP you just have to press Win+L, click on another account name and type the credentials. There&#39;s no transitioning between screens involved (which is slow btw) on Vista/7. Plus, currently if you have biometric authentication like say a fingerprint reader, on Vista/7, I have to press Win+L then Other Credentials then Switch User (wait for 3-4 seconds) till it transitions to a screen that lists all users) then click on another user name and type the password. Not exactly fast is it. Even if you go the Ctrl-Alt-Del method, you have to click Switch User then click user name again. And you can&#39;t argue that this method is faster.</p>
<p>@Cheong, What&#39;s the speed and steps required for FUS got to do with being able to FUS in a domain? I am fully aware that FUS can&#39;t be done on XP for domain computers. However for workgroups, it&#39;s so much quicker than 7/Vista. The performance of transitioning between screens where we get a (black screen for few seconds) during FUS has improved in 7 over Vista but still not as fast as XP.</p>

		<p>@Boris, and btw somewhat related is the usability of the CTRL-ALT-DEL screen, where keyboard control vanishes, and the user (who just USED the KEYBOARD to enter the CTL-ALT-DEL sequence) must now return to the mouse to enter a menu selection. &nbsp;Who was the user that asked for these &quot;features&quot;?</p>

		<p>Hmm. &nbsp;I was trying to make this same &quot;your solution may work now, but how about future versions of Windows?&quot; point to Microsoft support not too long ago. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think I got through to them, though, as they never responded to my post. &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/vcgeneral/thread/c14ba77e-53c5-4d7f-9395-0d99af02587c" rel="nofollow">social.msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/c14ba77e-53c5-4d7f-9395-0d99af02587c</a></p>
<p>After reading your blog for a while, this kind of answer made me extremely nervous.</p>
<p>I guess, since the support personnel never said that it WOULDN&#39;T work, that I&#39;m safe, since as you say, it needs to be explicitly spelled out if the expectation that my software will keep working on future versions of Windows is not valid.</p>

		<p>XP Power Toys has a lot of cool features! &nbsp;This is off-topic, of course, but&#8230; the Command Prompt Here context menu item, which gives you a command prompt window on the folder you&#39;re pointing at&#8230; this is tedious to do by hand when you&#39;re WAY deep in a folder hierarchy and you need a command prompt in that folder; Send To Clipboard As Name will send the whole file name and path of a file to the clipboard; TweakUI (which I got from the same place) has Rebuild Icons (yes, there are other ways to do this) and also &quot;light arrow&quot; for the shortcut arrow overlay, which is a big improvement over the big default shortcut arrow; and so on.</p>
<p>I know the Power Toys were created by some Microsoft programmers in their spare time, and hence they are not supported. &nbsp;I&#39;m glad MS allowed the tools to be released. &nbsp;For the same thing to happen in Windows 7, someone would have to take it on their own time to write a program with the same functionality. &nbsp;There are others (some from non-MS sources), but this was a good collection all in one place.</p>

		<p>There is a registry tweak you can do to get the Command Prompt Here &#8211; even through you can do it by shift right-click (awful &#8211; it isn&#39;t discoverable and until I found out in this blog, I used my registry tweak).</p>
