		<p>These two statements seem contradictory:</p>
<p>&gt; If a window is subclassed with a function pointer, then the new window procedure is Unicode if it was set with Set­Window­Long­PtrW(GWLP_WNDPROC) and ANSI if it was set with Set­Window­Long­PtrA(GWLP_WNDPROC). </p>
<p>&gt; Note that calling Set­Window­Long­PtrA(GWLP_WNDPROC) can result in a window procedure that is Unicode. </p>
<p>Under what conditions will SetWindowLongPtrA(GWLP_WNDPROC) give you a Unicode window procedure?</p>

		<p>Note carefully: If a window is subclassed with <u>a function pointer</u>&hellip; The next paragraph talks about what happens if you subclass it with a thunk, which is the case that you are asking about.</p>

		<p>The one thing that I keep wondering, especially with:<br />
&#8220;It means that messages like WM_CHAR will report characters as Unicode code units rather than as ANSI code units. &#8221;<br />
Does this mean that codepoints from the supplementary planes can be sent using surrogates?<br />
The reason why I ask this is because the documentation isn&#8217;t exactly the clearest, but it does state that WM_CHAR uses UTF-16, which implies surrogates, and that there isn&#8217;t a one to one mapping between keys pressed and messages generated. But then explicitly states that WM_UNICHAR can handle supplementary plane codepoints.<br />
I just find this a little unclear about whether supplementary plane codepoints/surrogates can be used in a Unicode window without Windows itself not liking it. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the major problem for this is developers just ignoring surrogates though.</p>

		<p>WM_CHAR is interpreted by the window procedure so It depends on the window procedure how it interprets it. I think the question is really only relevant for an Edit control so if you are really interested my suggestion is to code up an example and send it a surrogate pair in two sequential WM_CHAR messages. :-) Documentation will get you only so far.</p>

		<p>The issue with &#8220;Documentation will get you only so far&#8221; is that there is such a thing as undocumented behaviour. In general, if something isn&#8217;t in the documentation or public API, it is easier to err on the side of caution and assume that something is undocumented.<br />
And this leads to the problem with samples when you are working with potentially undocumented behaviour. It may work, and then it will keep working until it doesn&#8217;t.<br />
Of course, I could be overthinking this, and UTF-16 really does mean UTF-16. But if you have trouble picking out some subtleties in the documentation, especially if you have some kind of disorder that makes this harder (Asperger&#8217;s for example) then your only option is to ask.</p>
