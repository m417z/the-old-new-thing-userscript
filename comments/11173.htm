		<p>&quot;And yet nobody bothers writing #define _DLL before they #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;.&quot;</p>
<p>Because doing so would be undefined behavior. &nbsp;The C language standard reserves all identifiers beginning with an underscore followed by either a capital letter or another underscore, and defining a reserved identifier as a macro is undefined behavior (C90 ยง4.1.2 or C99 ยง7.1.3). &nbsp;That&#39;s why all compiler-defined macros begin with /<em>[A-Z</em>]/, so that they won&#39;t conflict with any macros user code might write.</p>

		<p>@Adam exactly. That wasn&#39;t a question or statement saying that people SHOULD do it, it was saying nobody does that, let&#39;s find out why. The sentence right after clears this up.</p>
<p>(I&#39;m beginning to think people are trying to find something wrong with these posts to earn an award or something)</p>

		<p>@Adam</p>
<p>Also remember, not everyone who uses C has read the standard. So would they know that _DLL is reserved by the compiler?</p>

		<p>@Crescens2k</p>
<p>That is neither here nor there. If you don&#39;t know the standard&#39;s rules then you can&#39;t complain when unexpected things happen to you. Ignorance of the standard does not protect you.</p>

		<p>@Adam</p>
<p>It is very relevant. You quoted the standard yet it is very likely that most people who use VC, especially learners have never even read the standard. So quoting the standard in this kind of situation is pointless. Also, people tend to follow what they see, and there have been people who used uglified identifiers in classes after using the STL. So if people will use uglified names, is there any surprise if people end up using these definitions without reading the standard?</p>
<p>@Sunil</p>
<p>Well it is obvious that if you don&#39;t know the rules then you can&#39;t be surprised. But people like to stay ignorant. Also, no book/guide etc that I have read even mentions about any preprocessor directives begining with _ are reserved by the compiler. Also, if you look at the place that people are likely to hit first, wikipedia, then again, there is no mention of directives begining with _ is compiler reserved.</p>

		<p>I always wondered why dllimport is needed at all. After all, in the end the things are linked against an import library. Is there any technical reason (other than &quot;it is already done this way&quot;) that would require usage of dllimport?</p>

		<p>waleri: in short, mismatched dllimport is merely inefficient for functions (it costs a stub for statically linking an imported function, and a data indirection for importing a statically linked function), and completely broken for external data</p>

		<p>@Rangoric: I wasn&#39;t trying to find fault with Raymond&#39;s post, I was providing additional background information on *why* nobody defines _DLL.</p>
<p>@Crescens2k: That&#39;s irrelevant. &nbsp;Nobody would go out of there way to explicitly define _DLL because there&#39;s no reason to. &nbsp;It&#39;s a short enough (and odd-looking) macro name that hopefully someone would think twice before using it for their own purposes; even if someone did choose to use it, they would run into a macro redefinition error with MSVC with the default settings for new projects (/MD).</p>

<p>I was going to ask how to get that whole series, since that article isn&#39;t linked up, then it occurred to me&#8230; search for dllimport! &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/27/680250.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/680250.aspx</a></p>

		<p>Thanks for the clarification. Actually the answer was in one of the articles pointed by Skyborne &#8211; why cannot/should not fixup addresses in place. Now I know how it worked before dllimport was invented :)</p>

		<p>Before dllimport/dllexport you used .def</p>
<p>Actually still the easiest way to compile &amp; use dlls.</p>

		<p>&quot;Actually still the easiest way to compile &amp; use dlls.&quot;</p>
<p>Seriously? &nbsp;I assume you do not use C++ and work with DLLs with very few exports, because exporting classes or even just name-mangled functions through a .def file is a complete nightmare, especially when you get different name mangling for different configurations. &nbsp;Having to keep a long list of exports in sync with the source, no thank you.</p>
