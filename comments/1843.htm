		<p>It looks very much like they went to Etsy and searched for &quot;flag sweater&quot;. &nbsp;Uhg.</p>
<p>And where did they even get a 48-state flag??? </p>

		<p>In Internet RFCs, &quot;should&quot; and &quot;must&quot; mean different things. &nbsp;Since the USC says &quot;should not&quot; instead of &quot;must not&quot; it might not actually be illegal.</p>
<p>@BC: Presumably they had one made. &nbsp;It wouldn&#39;t be any more difficult than the uniforms themselves. &nbsp;The bigger question, of course, is _why_.</p>

		<p>If it&#39;s illegal to use &quot;any part&quot; of the flag, does that mean any clothes with red and white stripes are illegal? Or for any real pedants, any clothes any part of which is red, white or blue?</p>

		<p>I personally have no problem with recognizable parts of the flag being used on clothing. I don&#39;t like complete renditions of the flag being used with disrespect, but has others have said, expressing opinions both for and against the US is really protected speech.</p>
<p>I would not want to wear one, but I did not think they were that ugly.</p>

		<p>According to Wikipedia [1],</p>
<p>&quot;One of the most commonly ignored and misunderstood aspects of the Flag Code is section 8. &quot;The flag should never be used as wearing apparel, bedding, or drapery.&quot; Section 3 of the Flag Code[25] defines a flag for the purposes of the code. Contrary to popular belief, the U.S. Flag Code does permit the use of flag design in fashion et cetera, provided that such a design was not formed using the actual design of the flag. The wearing of any article of clothing representing the flag is allowed; however, wearing the flag itself is not.&quot;</p>
<p>I.e. you&#39;re allowed to star-and-stripe your clothing, but you&#39;re not allowed to make clothing &#39;with real flag parts&#39;. Basically, the flag becomes &#39;holy&#39; when it&#39;s finished as flag.</p>

		<p>One could make the argument that the US Olympic Team comprises a patriotic organization and that this is their uniform.</p>

		<p>@Maurits</p>
<p>The First Amendment nullifies the entire thing. The flag can be used in any way, shape, or form, whether for display or kindling.</p>
<p>It only remains in the USC because there&#39;s no penalty and, as such, the SCOTUS will never accept that anyone can possibly have standing to challenge it.</p>

		<p>@Martjin,</p>
<p>I don&#39;t see that from the code itself:</p>
<p>The words “flag, standard, colors, or ensign”, as used herein, shall include any flag, standard, colors, ensign, or any picture or representation of either, or of any part or parts of either, made of any substance or represented on any substance, of any size evidently purporting to be either of said flag, standard, colors, or ensign of the United States of America or a picture or a representation of either, upon which shall be shown the colors, the stars and the stripes, in any number of either thereof, or of any part or parts of either, by which the average person seeing the same without deliberation may believe the same to represent the flag, colors, standard, or ensign of the United States of America.</p>
<p>Seems a pretty broad prohibition to me.</p>

		<p>I guess they had to put the 2014 into the design so that nobody would think this was the uniform in 1976. At least it looks like it could have come from 1976 to me.</p>

		<p>@Anon</p>
<p>&gt; &quot;The First Amendment nullifies the entire thing.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s not that simple. First, it is at least arguable that the U.S. Olympic Committee, given its status as a federally chartered corporation under 36 U.S.C. &sect; 220502, and its exclusive privileges under that chapter, is an instrumentality of the United States Government. In such case, it has no free speech rights against its creator &#8211; just as the President can&#39;t claim freedom of speech as a basis for, say, displaying a different flag design at U.S. naval vessels.</p>
<p>Second, the First Amendment only says that Congress shall make no law restricting freedom of speech. Absent a sanction (civil, criminal, or otherwise), there is no restriction &#8211; just an expression of what Congress considers, as Raymond termed it, &quot;a standard for respectful behavior.&quot; Congress is certainly free to enact such a standard, even if it can&#39;t punish its violations. And an organization representing the United States &#8211; at the Congress&#39;s pleasure &#8211; should be expected to respect it.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>There may even be a clause somewhere in the charter that says that the corporation must observe the laws of the United States, in which case it must follow even the laws that specify no punishment for violation. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Well, by having an incorrect amount of stars, doesn&#39;t that actually mean they&#39;re not incorporating The Flag(TM) into their clothing, and such aren&#39;t even close to doing anything &quot;illegal&quot;? How *hideously* clever ;)</p>

		<p>&gt; 39 stars because there is nobody from &#8230; Delaware &#8230;</p>
<p>WHAT??! Nobody from Delaware made it on the US Winder Olympic team this year??! No wonder we beat you at Curling almost half the time. Also, taking away a star from the first state in the union would be heresy :)</p>

		<p>@Asbjørn: In my dictionary the definition of respect is &quot;a feeling of deep admiration for someone or something elicited by their abilities, qualities, or achievements&quot;. Anyhow this whole preoccupation with flags is a very American thing in my experience. I haven&#39;t met many Europeans who&#39;d get particularly upset if their flag got &quot;desecrated&quot; (the rest of the world is also rather split on that topic I find).</p>
<p>But then I find the whole concept of patriotism worrisome, or as George Bernhard Shaw used to define it: &quot;Patriotism is, fundamentally, a conviction that a particular country is the best in the world because you were born in it.&quot;</p>

		<p>@Azarien: *Any* national flag should be treated with the utmost respect. Which sadly, was not how most participants at the opening ceremony handled their flags. They were waving them all over the place and frequently dragging them along the ground. That is *not* how you treat a national flag &#8211; especially not your own! That also means you don&#39;t wrap the flag around you at sporting events. That is simply disgraceful behavior. </p>

		<p>well, methinks the difference between Asbjørns and the general european attitude stems from the history of &quot;real&quot; flags being consecrated but simply parts of fabric having the &quot;right&quot; colours not being protected so much, i.e. the (ancient) difference between &quot;Fahne&quot; and &quot;Flagge&quot; in german (a &quot;Fahne&quot; being the non-replaceable (consecrated) banner of an institution (military unit, firefighters, &#8230;)).</p>

		<p>@Asbjørn A flag is a piece of cloth with a pattern on it. It baffles me that (I find this attitude disproportionately more common in Americans than Europeans) there are so many rules regarding &#39;proper flag use&#39; and how people can get so emotional regarding its use. I don&#39;t believe there is any such thing as a &#39;flag code&#39; in my country and I fail to see how wrapping a flag around oneself would qualify as disgraceful behaviour, for example.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, Europeans have laws prohibiting the flying of certain flags, mostly from the WWII era, whereas such an action is protected speech in America.</p>
