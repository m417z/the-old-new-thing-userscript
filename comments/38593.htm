		<p>Part of the problem is that no one likes to tell some in power anything that could be remotely considered critisism.</p>
<p>So, he/she had someone read it and they said &quot;yes sir, yes sir, it&#8217;s great, send it out&quot;.</p>
<p>This is the same reason that Steven King&#8217;s later books are so bloated. No editor has the guts to edit the Great One&#8217;s prose.</p>

<p>Or any author who gets famous.  Look at the Harry Potter series; each book is half an inch thicker than the previous.   There&#8217;s more being written but but more being said.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also wondered by computer books (from any publisher on any topic) is almost always 2 inches thick.  Is there some unspoken rule that these books must be at least this thickness or they can&#8217;t possibly be good?<br />

		<p>Actually there is an unwritten rule.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that if a computer book really doesn&#8217;t have enough content it will be printed on thicker paper in bigger type in order to make it fat.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s thicker it looks like more value for the money in many people&#8217;s eyes.  Sadly this thinking actually works.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s why I go for stuff that resembles textbooks &#8211; small, hardbound, and expensive. It&#8217;s done remarkably well in weeding out the crap. Also, avoid publishers like SAMS or anything with &#8216;bible&#8217; in the title.

		<p>I think it&#8217;s a matter of focus. Upper mngt types often make it up the latter by schmoozing, not biz accomplishments. For instance, one of my friends a few years back was demoted several times from an environment support engineer to company director (huh?) by simply failing to do his job and schmoozing 4-6 hours per day. The execs liked him and everybody else knew him to be deadweight, so he was de(pro)moted out of each position until he became a director.</p>

		<p>Well, he said &quot;relatively brief&quot;. I guess compared to the Encyclopaedia Britannica four pages can be considered brief. If you&#8217;re in upper mngmt out-of-box isn&#8217;t enough anymore, you gotta be willing to think out of domain, so don&#8217;t tell me that was comparing apples and oranges.</p>

		<p>Actually, I think this is called The Peter Principle and the principle is &quot;Everyone will rise one level above their level of competence&quot;. It&#8217;s true mostly in management. You keep getting promoted until you are no longer capable of doing the job and then they put you on &quot;Special Projects&quot; or you leave to &quot;Spend more time with your family&quot;. Not too long after they usually pop up somewhere else to run a Godzilla-like wake of destruction through their comapany.</p>

		<p>Regarding the thickness of computer books &#8211; I never ever buy a thick one if I can help it since they are nearly invariably chatty and bloated with anecdotes you never wanted to read. This also makes it nearly impossible to look something up in such a book.</p>
<p>Less is more.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Being in upper management must damage<br />
  <br />&gt; certain portions of your brain</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the other way around.  You have to have certain portions of your brain already damaged in order to get into upper management.  Birds of a feather promote each other.  It&#8217;s not only in upper management, it&#8217;s also politics, police departments, etc.</p>
<p>&#8216;Course us abnormal people such as developers (and some even more abnormal people such as honest people) obviously have portions of our brains damaged too, but they&#8217;re the wrong portions.

		<p>I used to edit computer books for a living.  Still do sometimes, freelance.  Your average Barnes and Noble has hundreds of computer books on the shelf, most of which arranged spine out.  The conventional wisdom at most computer-book publishers is that a book with a thick spine is easier to see on the shelf than one with a thin spine.  The thick-spined book is therefore more likely to be purchased.</p>
<p>And yes, it is absolutely true that publishers use thicker paper to fatten up books.  If the book is part of a series, however, they won&#8217;t increase the typeface sizes &#8212; those are laid into reusable page templates and it screws up the page flows.  Also, acquisitions editors at the bigger publishers, such as Que and Sams, actually plan a book&#8217;s rough page count even before they have an author and an outline.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to this rule.  I recently copy edited a book for Apress that ran exactly as many pages as the author wrote.  It was kind of refreshing.</p>

		<p>As a Sams author, I can validate Jim&#8217;s comments about Sams. I was often told to write off-topic chapters and drag out short chapters.</p>
