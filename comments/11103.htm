		<p>I problem I have seen with IShellLink::SetIconLocation is that the shell tries to be nice and automatically transforms c:program files&#8230; to %programfiles% even on x64 and you end up with a broken icon for x86 apps&#8230;</p>

		<p>asf sounds like a compatibility shiv, I would wonder if an application manifest would turn off that behavior.</p>

		<p>What about ShellIconCache? What does it do exactly? I thought it existed specifically to mitigate issues like the one in question.</p>

		<p>Ah yes, law of unintended consequences. In retrospect, the best place to store the icon of a shortcut would have been in the shortcut file itself, but that was not known when this was designed.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>That creates its own problems, because it means that the icon is &quot;locked in&quot; at shortcut creation time. &quot;Why do some of my HTML shortcuts have the Firefox 3 icon, others have the Firefox 4 icon, and still others have the IE icon?

		<p>Been there done that. &nbsp;I deployed a installer that created a desktop shortcut pointing to a local executable, &nbsp;but the icon image was accidentally pointing at the server. &nbsp; Everything worked fine and nobody noticed. &nbsp; &nbsp;Two years later the server gets decommissioned then after a while lots of complaints about missing icons&#8230; &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Having the icon file included in the shortcut itself doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re locked in at all. Not to put too fine a point on it, but Macs have a good UI for setting icons. I say this knowing full well this will devolve to Mac vs PC arguments :(</p>
<p>Right now, depending on which media player I installed last, the exact same problem Raymond describes happens to my media files. I&#39;m fairly certain users are already in some kind of icon hell.</p>

		<p>&quot;Right now, depending on which media player I installed last, the exact same problem Raymond describes happens to my media files.&quot; No it doesn&#39;t. All of your files of <em>the same type</em> [where &quot;type&quot; is e.g. &quot;AVI&quot; or &quot;MP3&quot;, not &quot;media files&quot;] have the same icon. And all of your files open with the application implied by the icon.</p>
<p>The Mac (I assume you mean mac classic, I don&#39;t know what OSX does) way, where you can copy an icon to the clipboard and paste it in file properties, puts the icon in the file [I think it&#39;s the actual file, not the alias &#8211; this works because all mac files can have resources] as a resource. The icon will not change if you uninstall the program that can open the file, or install a new program that opens that kind of file. (Even one that takes over the same creator code, such as a new version of the same program). So, yes, you <em>are</em> locked in to that icon.</p>

		<p>How is using IShellLink::SetIconLocation not the same type of lock in as storing icons in shortcuts? Sure it has narrower scope, but depending on what you&#39;re doing with it, could cause exactly the problem Raymond describes.</p>

		<p>One of my pet peeves is installers that create shortcuts with *an icon on the CD itself*. Yes, it exists; some people apparently assume one never switches disks.</p>

		<p>Boris, because the icon that the shortcut points to (&quot;by reference&quot;) can change. You aren&#39;t copying the icon&#39;s bitmap into the shortcut (&quot;by value&quot;).</p>

		<p>&gt; That creates its own problems, because it means that the icon is &quot;locked in&quot; at shortcut creation time.</p>
<p>I think if the &quot;lock in&quot; is only provided for paths that&#39;s clearly network path, people would understand. The &quot;Change Icon&quot; button can be used to refetch the icon if it&#39;s needed to refresh (handly to put in online help).</p>
<p>I think most people concern more about performance than &quot;icons that doesn&#39;t refresh&quot;. And those who&#39;d really concern are likely to be capable of remembering the new rule once it&#39;s been told.</p>

		<p>@Cheong</p>
<p>We weren&#39;t talking about a performance issue. &nbsp;This is about avoiding login failure alerts at the server.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not some blocking call and there is an icon cache already noted. &nbsp;The user isn&#39;t really going to see any real performance problems from this &#8212; being unable to see the icon for a couple seconds would be an extreme circumstance. &nbsp;You could maybe come up with circumstances where a crappy server or crappy network is DOS&#39;d by a bunch of machines booting up simultaneously, but that&#39;s not going to be an issue for &quot;most people&quot;, whereas locked in icons would.</p>

		<p>@Ens: Yes, it&#39;s not about performance. I&#39;m just talking about whether &quot;embedding the icon to shortcut file itself if target is EXE on network&quot; would be acceptable / could be justified.</p>
<p>Also note that any access to non-local resources bears performance cost. Since even the cache may miss, performance benefit would be another reason to favour it behave that way.</p>

		<p>@Cheong</p>
<p>Around me people accept the things they can understand: it appears slower because it is on the network is fine. Firefox 3 icons opening Firefox 4 is a lot harder to explain and understand. But maybe that is only us.</p>
