		<p>&quot;The asterisk stayed with the numeric keypad, while the PrtSc function moved to the top row as a function key (sharing a key with the SysRq key).&quot;</p>
<p>What exactly was/is the SysRq key for? It&#8217;s probably the only key I&#8217;ve never used and pressing it doesn&#8217;t seem to do anything.</p>

		<p>As I remember, one use of the scroll lock key was back in DOS days to stop the text scrolling off the top of the screen. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Even now, some ssh programs will use this key to do the same thing on Unix boxen!</p>

		<p>scroll lock locks the window scrolling to the arrow keys in excel. &nbsp;Makes for some frantic help desk calls. &nbsp;&quot;My excel is broken, when I try to go to the next cell the whole screen moves!!!!&quot; But it can be useful on large spreadsheets and you want to stick to keyboard navigation.</p>

		<p>I remember PA1 on a 3270 keyboard &#8212; it was an &quot;attention&quot; key, which took your input window from CMS mode into the lower-level CP mode. &nbsp;Not that this info will help anyone&#8230;</p>
<p>PA2 was another type of attention key on a 3270.</p>

		<p>I used to call it the &quot;ScrollLock-break.&quot; I probably still would, should I have any reason to say it. I expect it would be confusing.</p>
<p>I never did figure out the unmodified use of it. I mean, I know what it does, I just never figured out WHY. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>@mark: SysRq was for System Request. At the time the IBM introduced the 286, memory protection was new to the line, and they probably had visions of it being used as a multi-tasking/multi-user kind of machine, needing a new key to explicitly request an OS prompt or something. Linux actually now uses SysRq key in something close to its original intent:</p>

		<p>I kind of miss the final point where it says why ctrl-break acts like the (on modern systems nonexistent) cancel key. Is it because the cancel key has the same keycode as ctrl-break?</p>

		<p>Is this related to why control+scrlk fixes DevStudio?</p>
<p>Sometimes, DevStudio&#8217;s find-in-files gets confused, and it thinks that there are no files in the project/solution/directory. Pressing Control+ScrollLock, somehow, fixes this, and it&#8217;ll start searching files again &#8212; I picked this tip up somewhere, and it&#8217;s been very helpful ever since, but I couldn&#8217;t work out <em>why</em> it works..</p>

		<p>The question is: Why didn&#8217;t Microsoft use SysRq f√ºr BSODing the machine by keyboard (cf. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244139/en" target=_new rel=nofollow rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/244139/en</a>)? It would be the &#8220;natural choice&#8221;, wouldn&#8217;t it, instead of having to use Right-CTRL and Scroll-lock. Perhaps, SysRq was already used in other circumstances, right?</p>

		<p>Interestingly, when you press Ctrl+Break TranslateMessage synthesizes a Ctrl+C character, and I was able to find both Microsoft and non-Microsoft software that mistakenly(?) copies instead of cancelling.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ll spare everyone my keyboard gripe, except to say that the keyboard is easily the least usable part of computing in this day and age, and also the one that has the least chance of changing. Apple did some brilliant things with their keyboard (notably, providing &quot;return&quot; and &quot;enter&quot; as separate keys), but they&#8217;ve actually reverted to the old behavior as their ranks are filled with Windows converts.</p>
<p>But even ignoring adding new functionality, there are several keys which are basically nothing but support call generators&#8230; Num Lock, Scroll Lock, Pause, Insert. The 0.05% of people who use these keys on purpose certainly don&#8217;t outweigh the 99.95% of people who use them on accident, then think their computer is broken.</p>
<p>Vista gave us the ability to disable Caps Lock (FINALLY!) When will we get the ability to disable Num Lock? (Does anybody have a program/hack to disable the function of NumLock while keeping the key working? I like to use it for some functions in video games, but I always want the keypad to be numbers, not arrows. Any ideas?)</p>

		<p>OK, I&#8217;m missing something. You&#8217;ve explained why Ctrl-ScrollLock and Ctrl-Break are equivalent. And you&#8217;ve explained that VK_CANCEL will cancel a dialog. But why does Ctrl-Break map to VK_CANCEL?</p>

		<p>To answer the question that Raymond already answered:</p>
<p>CTRL+Break maps to VK_CANCEL because on some obscure and long-forgotten but once popular keyboard layout that was used on a machine where MS-DOS Run, there was a cancel key, which the developers used to cancel dialogs.</p>
<p>To make sure everything is compatible/equal on all platforms, they needed to &quot;emulate&quot; the cancel key and mapped it to CTRL+Break/CTRL+ScrollLock.</p>

		<p>OK so now I have to ask another obvious question, if all this stems from the DOS days why does VK_CANCEL not map to CTRL+C? CTRL+C &nbsp;was used quite often in DOS to &quot;break out&quot;/stop programs, TSR&#8217;s and other things.</p>

		<p>One keyboard of interest was the DEC LK-450 which came with the Alpha NT systems. &nbsp;The LK-450 provided NT with a full VT-520 keyboard complete with 20 function keys, Help, Do, Find, Insert, Remove, Prev, Next, Compose, and PF1 to PF4 keys.</p>
<p>This was a great keyboard. &nbsp;Its a shame that drivers are not available for more recent versions of Windows.</p>

		<p>&quot;So why doesn&#8217;t it cancel all dialogs, for example the Visual Studio &quot;Open File&#8230;&quot; dialog?&quot;</p>
<p>I would have thought the answer to that was pretty obvious&#8230; Visual Studio implements it&#8217;s own File-&gt;Open dialog (you can tell because it doesn&#8217;t get the new Vista style when running on Vista &#8212; also, take a look at it in Spy++). They obviously didn&#8217;t re-implement all of the features of the window manager when they did it.</p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>There are MANY dialogs in Windows itself which do not respond to the Escape and Enter keys. I would really prefer to know why those dialogs ignore those keys then to know all this about Ctrl+ScrollLock.</p>

		<p>Steve: &quot;why does VK_CANCEL not map to CTRL+C? CTRL+C &nbsp;was used quite often in DOS to &quot;break out&quot;/stop programs, TSR&#8217;s and other things.&quot;</p>
<p>CTRL+C and CTRL+BREAK were not the same thing under DOS. The rule was that if CTRL+C would not break then CTRL+BREAK would work (as a last resource, but often enough).</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, you could make a batch file ignore CTRL+C (something like &quot;BREAK=OFF&quot;) but couldn&#8217;t make it ignore CTRL+BREAK.</p>

<p>Easy. I think it was IBM that needed a soft-reset keystroke. Since you lost all your data when this occurred, it must be a keystroke you intend on putpose. CTRL and ALT on one hand, and DEL on the other side of the keyboard. Far apart so it&#8217;s hard to hit accidentally.</p>
<p>Of course, badly behaved DOS programs crashed a lot, so people started hitting CTRL-ALT-DEL when things went awry. (There&#8217;s a joke that went &quot;IBM invented Ctrl-Alt-Del, and Microsoft popularized it&quot;).</p>
<p>Windows comes along, and hey, what would people do with a non-responsive Windows app? Ctrl-Alt-Del. So thus, it was sort of ingrained in years of hitting those three keys&#8230;</p>

<p>Except that in the NT line, CAD is no longer used for (just) killing an unresponsive app, it brings up the &quot;Windows Security&quot; (GINA) screen/dialog/menu (except on XP with FUS enabled, then it maps to &quot;please start the task manager, if it&#8217;s not too much trouble&quot;).</p>
<p>It would make much more sense for CAD to be &quot;bring up a priority-boosted task manager&quot; and SysRq to be the &quot;Windows Security&quot; button, although I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s impossible these days. (But surely giving the task manager a priority boost by default isn&#8217;t so hard&#8230;)</p>

		<p>ntl, BREAK=OFF (which is the default) only checks for Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Break during screen I/O while BREAK=ON checks during all I/O so for instance when using dir/s to find a file, you can Ctrl+C after the first hit.</p>
<p>Interestingly Ctrl+Break doesn&#8217;t seem to break a dir/s/p properly on Windows 2000/XP.</p>

		<p>Neil: this is probably because dir uses some internally blocking function to wait for a keypress, but Ctrl+Break is still queued up to the input buffer&#8230;</p>
<p>The only other question (that I think was confusing other people above) is why Break on its own doesn&#8217;t cancel dialogs. &nbsp;It does.</p>

		<p>The old Wang micro/mini keyboards had a &quot;Cancel&quot; key. &nbsp;They also had &quot;Execute&quot; and &quot;Help&quot; keys, both of which seem to have a VK_ shortcuts.</p>
<p>The Wang systems were PC-compatible (with a special board) and it&#8217;s possible that Windows might have run on them. &nbsp;This was 8086-era and I was still running DOS at the time, so I&#8217;m not sure on that point. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I found a pic with a blurry version:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://home.planet.nl/~janvdv/images/WangClassic.JPG" rel="nofollow">http://home.planet.nl/~janvdv/images/WangClassic.JPG</a></p>
<p>Help is on the top left, cancel on the top right (or was that reversed) and execute is either the big button above the arrows or the small one below it.</p>

		<p>Sorta off-topic, sorry.</p>
<p>@James Schend: You can remap the keyboard scan codes. See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/Q181348" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/Q181348</a> or google &quot;Scancode Map&quot;.</p>
<p>The scan code for the NumLock key is 0x45. CapsLock is 0x3a. However, if I understand you correctly, then you&#8217;ll probably want to remap all the keys on the numeric pad with NumLock off. Wouldn&#8217;t be hard to do, just tedious. You can use Spy++ to figure out which scan codes you need.</p>
<p>Other than that, you&#8217;re on your own.</p>

		<p>&quot;I answered this question over three years ago.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh but I read that. Problem is that those dialogs that don&#8217;t work look like regular message boxes. How is user supposed to distinguish between real dialog with IDOK and IDCANCEL or IDYES and IDNO, and some fake which looks identical but ignores the keys?</p>
<p>What is even worse for Yes/No they do not make the buttons with &amp;Yes/&amp;No so you can&#8217;t dismiss it with Alt+Y/Alt+N.</p>
<p>As for boosting Task Manager &#8212; that doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>Few days ago I mistakenly set the real-time priority on Prime95 benchmark which was running on both cores of my dual-core system.</p>
<p>I immediately tried to hit Alt+E to End Task but it was too late. Keyboard didn&#8217;t respond anymore and even Ctrl+Alt+Del didn&#8217;t do anyrhing even though I waited for 5 minutes. Window manager stopped repainting the desktop and it has gone black (because it actually tried to bring up the Task Manager). After a while I figured out I will have to reboot.</p>
<p>I wonder now how could the keyboard input get ignored? Isn&#8217;t the input thread running at realtime priority itself? After all user input is a realtime event.</p>
<p>I believe that such a spectacular hang should&#8217;ve never happened in a system with a properly designed multitasking and with scheduler using fixed 20ms time slices.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  there are several keys which are basically nothing but support call generators&#8230; Num Lock, Scroll Lock, Pause, Insert.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Num Lock and Caps Lock in my opinion aren&#8217;t too bad, but you are right that for a while, I did not even know what the Insert and Scroll Lock keys are for. In fact only now I know that the Pause key were intended to stop console output. Ctrl-S and Ctrl-Q were also intended to stop console output.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Apple did some brilliant things with their keyboard (notably, providing &quot;return&quot; and &quot;enter&quot; as separate keys), but they&#8217;ve actually reverted to the old behavior as their ranks are filled with Windows converts.
</p></blockquote>
<p>On the other hand, Mac keyboards have backspace labeled as &quot;delete&quot;. Plus the Apple logo on the &nbsp;Command key lasted far longer than it should have lasted. For those interested, the first Apple computer to use ADB was the Apple IIgs. Later ADB was used on the Mac with Mac SE and II. ADB allowed the Apple IIgs and Mac to share the same keyboard, thus a key that could act as both an Apple key on the Apple IIgs and the Command key on the Mac was needed, thus the presence of both the cloverleaf and the apple on the Apple/Command key. Even Apple&#8217;s USB keyboard, which would not work on the IIgs without an USB-to-ADB adapter, had the Apple logo on the Command key. Apple finally got rid of the Apple logo on the Command key and labeled it as &quot;Command&quot; with the recent Apple Aluminum Keyboards. On the Control/Command key confusion on Windows/Mac: Microsoft copied the Command key on the Mac as the Control key, and then Apple added a Control key on the ADB keyboard to support the Apple IIgs.</p>

		<p>SysRq/PrtSc and Pause/Break spew out really weird sequences. Here&#8217;s some screwy stuff I&#8217;ve found:</p>
<ul>
<li>SysRq: e0 2a e0 37 (LShift + PrtSc)</li>
<li>
<p>{Shift | Ctrl} + SysRq: e0 37 (PrtSc)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Alt + SysRq: 54</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It makes some sense that Shift+PrtSc is SysRq; after all, it is the same key on most keyboards these days.</p>
<ul>
<li>Break (none on release): e1 1d 45 e1 9d c5 (a third &#8211; Ctrl key + NumLock, instantly released)</li>
</ul>
<li>
<p>Ctrl + Break (none on release): e0 46 e0 c6 (a second ScrollLock, instantly released)</p>
</li>
<p>Ctrl+Break does not need to be the same as Ctrl+ScrollLock, because it is treated as a second ScrollLock when pressed, and should be detectable.</p>
<p>I hate those AT keys&#8230;</p>

		<p>On the other hand however, Apple&#8217;s ADB keyboards replaced NumLock with a Clear key (Mac OS did not support the arrow mode at all and the numeric keypad did not have arrows), and replaced the Insert key with a Help key. And the keys SysRq/PrtSc, Scroll Lock, and the Pause/Break were replaced with the additional function keys F13-F15. On the Apple Extended Keyboard, the corresponding PC keys were written in smaller letters and there were the normal NumLock/CapsLock/ScrollLock lights for use in, for example, PC emulation.</p>
