		<p>Slightly off-topic: in your Scrabble entry, someone somehow managed to write a comment quite a while after the comments were turned off. Weird.</p>

		<p>Would it be possible to extend the duration for which it&#8217;s possible to post replies?</p>

		<p>@Old New Thing: Thanks for the reviews. Appreciate it. One thing: The NFL book is out in paperback &#8212; with a much shorter subtitle.</p>

<p>@GWO. George Plimpton did this already? No way! If you bothered reading even an excerpt or a review, readily available online, you&#8217;d see that my book is an homage to Plimpton. I&#8217;d say that the NFL has changed rather a lot since Plimpton went to Lions camp in 1963, wouldn&#8217;t you? And if a writer could actually get inside the league as a player, might that not be a pretty unusual opportunity? Fans and media think they understand sports &#8212; the blessing and curse of our 24/7 media &#8212; but in reality they don&#8217;t. I had a chance to do something no one had done in 40+ years, and deliver readers a view they just don&#8217;t ever get. </p>
<p>But it&#8217;s much easier to be a smart ass than to actually think about something.</p>

<p>Indeed it is. I think that&#8217;s why being a smart ass is so popular- It&#8217;s easy.</p>
