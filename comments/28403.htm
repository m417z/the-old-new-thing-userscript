		<p>Speaking of MLK, I saw a comic over the weekend, who was a laughing, energetic Mexican (&quot;MEZikan&quot;, as he put it) from LA.</p>
<p>&quot;LA is an amazing place,&quot; he said. &nbsp;&quot;The city has such a wonderful grouping of people. &nbsp;A black buddy of mine married a Korean girl and they had a son. &nbsp;They named him Martin Luther Kim!&quot;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not familiar with American education system, so could anyone tell me how old those seventh graders are? My guess would be 14 years old, may be younger (Just in case, I&#8217;m not trolling. Just playing a little game of age guessing while waiting for answer).</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll need to make a correction, &#8217;cause the Beatles and AC/DC were both around in the 70&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Or did you mean that 1 out of 4 is a great band (who&#8217;d have guessed that you were an AC/DC fan)?</p>

<p>They released their last album in 1969. &nbsp;However, their music remained played on the air for quite a while afterwards (not as a golden oldie).</p>

		<p>What exactly is the point of this post? Are we supposed to think these kids are stupid? Are you making fun of them or do you think the errors are cute? I can&#8217;t tell.</p>
<p>You know what I think is really, really funny? When an eighth grader spells something wrong. That&#8217;s great stuff! I don&#8217;t even care what they were trying to say. That doesn&#8217;t matter at all. Some people give them the benefit of the doubt because they&#8217;re only 14 and they&#8217;re trying to write. I prefer to make fun of them.</p>

		<p>&#8216;I think thirteen years old, is too young to have such an &nbsp;incredulous offer thrown upon you.&#8217;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not certain if it&#8217;s incredible that a teacher would foist a non-credible offer on a student.</p>
<p>&#8216;I never got to do any of these things with [my grandmother], let alone see her; which was nearly every 1 or 2 years. [This is a meaning of the word &#8220;never&#8221; with which I was previously unfamiliar.]&#8217;</p>
<p>A broken way of saying &#8220;I saw her every one or two years but I never was given the time to visit with her and do things with her&#8221;?</p>

		<p>&#8216;[incredible ≠ incredulous. -Raymond]&#8217;</p>
<p>From your m-w.com link to incredulous:</p>
<p>&#8220;</p>
<p>1 : unwilling to admit or accept what is offered as true : not credulous : SKEPTICAL</p>
<p>2 : INCREDIBLE 1</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t very surprising given what incredible means:</p>
<p>&#8220;</p>
<p>1 : too extraordinary and improbable to be believed &lt;making incredible claims&gt;</p>
<p>2 : AMAZING, EXTRAORDINARY </p>

		<p>According to Wikipedia (which pretty much matches my own recollection, although I was only 11 at the time):</p>
<p>&quot;On 8 May 1970, the Spector-produced version of Get Back was released as Let It Be, followed by the documentary film of the same name. The Beatles&#8217; partnership was legally dissolved after McCartney filed a lawsuit on 31 December 1970.&quot;</p>
<p>And I saw AC/DC (the great line-up with Bon Scott, not the hugely successful dull one with the other guy) in, I think, 76 and 77.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m agreeing with two in the 70s and both great.</p>
<p>Funny which parts of a post get picked up on, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

		<p>dsn: No, 1980 was the first year of the 80s. This does mean the &#8216;0s&#8217; would have been a year shorter than the others, but the year 0 doesn&#8217;t have a lawyer to fight us over it, so that&#8217;s OK :-)</p>

		<p>Well, AC/DC was formed in 1973 and continued through all of the 70s, so (for me at least) this &nbsp;makes them more of a &quot;70s band&quot; than the Beatles.</p>
<p>&quot;The gourds whore heavy steel mail and where armed with large pikes.&quot;</p>
<p>Were they using voice recognition to enter the essays? This reminds me of the MS &quot;Dear aunt&#8230;&quot; demo</p>
