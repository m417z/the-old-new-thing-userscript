		<p>&quot;Now, they could have turned this lie into a truth by a simple change in wording.&quot;</p>
<p>Nit &#8211; the simple change in wording you recommend would still be a lie. &nbsp;The changes may have little or no impact on their most frequent (not necessarily loyal) customers, but they&#8217;re not making these changes to serve anyone or anything but thelmselves and their bottom line.</p>

		<p>American Airlines actually dropped theirs to 18 months also. &nbsp;(The race to the bottom here.)</p>

		<p>Two points:</p>
<ul>
<li>They may have changed the policy at the beginning of the year, but their FAQ (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.united.com/page/article/1,,52106,00.html" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://www.united.com/page/article/1" rel="nofollow">http://www.united.com/page/article/1</a>,,52106,00.html) states that the policy does not go into effect until the end of the year:</li>
</ul>
<p>Q. When will my miles expire?</p>
<p>A. As of December 31, 2007, miles will expire after 18 months of no activity on your account.</p>
<p>(Of course, the answer could be wrong, they could mean 2006, which would agree with what you wrote)</p>
<ul>
<li>Their FAQ also states the policy in the terms you ask for:</li>
</ul>
<p>Q. Miles formerly expired after no activity for 36 months. Why is that policy now shortened to 18 months?</p>
<p>A. This change makes our Mileage Plus program better for customers who are most loyal to United while also reducing our operating costs</p>
<p>By shortening the amount of time a Mileage Plus account can remain inactive, United’s most loyal customers will compete with less people for award seats, making it easier for them to redeem their miles. This change also reduces the airline’s mileage liability for members who have become inactive and lowers the program’s administrative costs.</p>

		<p>&quot;I understand why the airlines are doing this. It is widely reported that there are over 9.7 trillion unredeemed points in frequent flyer programs, and the threat of having to redeem those points for flights means having to account for them in their balance sheets.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, they have to account for them, but it&#8217;s not like they could all be redeemed in the same year.</p>
<p>They consistently limit the amount of seats that are available for redemption, and you can&#8217;t redeem miles for flights years in advance, so in any given period of time, their liability is limited to exactly how many seats they allow to be redeemed this way. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Who cares if you hand out a million coupons for a free widget if you only have 40 widgets available a month available for free redemption?</p>
<p>So, if they are getting killed with free flights, then they could quickly reduce the number of free seats available. &nbsp;So, even though I have a gazillion miles, I can&#8217;t use them at will&#8230;I still have to play by their quite restrictive rules.</p>

<p>This is like a bank, under permanent threat that all customers can go and withdraw their money. They knew this when they started the program.</p>

		<p>&nbsp; This would seem a good place to remind people that there are various charities and programs that you can donate your points to, like one for families of soldiers visiting them while they are at another base inside the US (I think it is a program where you can just tell the airline to transfer your points to it, it isn&#8217;t an official charity). &nbsp;Also, you may be able to give them to a close relative, especially one who would have been paying for a ticket somewhere.</p>

		<p>It seems to me that expiring the miles earlier will actually increase the competition for seats that the loyal customers experience as people rush to redeem their miles, at least in the short term, similar to how the US government&#8217;s recent passport requirements have caused a huge increase in the wait time to receive a passport.</p>

		<p>Well, I think banks have policies on how long they honor a check for. &nbsp;From a quick search it seems like periods of anywhere from 6 to 18 months are not uncommon. &nbsp;Some checks (i.e. business, refunds, etc) have expiration dates printed on them that the banks honor. &nbsp;So, you need to keep that $100 in your account until your bank will no longer honor the check. &nbsp;Maybe you could put a note like &#8220;Expires in 3 months&#8221; in the memo field to expedite the process.</p>

		<p>Nintendo recently announced they were doing something similar with their Star Points (which I think you only get in Europe).</p>
<p>When you buy certain first-party games or hardware you get a card which you can enter into their website to gain the points which can be traded in for various things. The benefit to them, I assume, is that they can build up profiles of different people and the types of games and hardware they buy, which can be quite useful. (&quot;People who bought this seem to also buy that, so let&#8217;s try to sell them this new thing.&quot; Same as in-store discount cards.)</p>
<p>I had been registering my points but then hoarding them as there was nothing that I could cash them in for that I wanted. Now that they are going to expire old points I simply won&#8217;t register them in the first place. Unless the cards themselves expire (which isn&#8217;t clear, and even if they do they&#8217;ll probably expire much later in case a game was left on a retail shelf) I have nothing to lose from holding on to the cards in case something I want comes along, at which point I will register them. Nintendo, on the other hand, now won&#8217;t get any data from me unless they provide something that I actually want&#8230;</p>
<p>(I know they&#8217;re soon going to allow us to transfer star points into Wii points which let us buy old games &#8212; much more interesting than buying wallpapers and other tat that was on offer in return for Stars before &#8212; but I don&#8217;t want much of what&#8217;s on offer there either so I&#8217;ll hold on to my cards rather than register them. It seems a very stupid move all-round.)</p>

		<p>&quot;In order to server you better&quot;&#8211;ah, another example of what Peopleware called &quot;proof by repeated assertion.&quot; &nbsp;We know it&#8217;s not intended to serve us better, but we eventually give up because it&#8217;s too much effort to fight it.</p>
<p>It amazes me that this sort of thing is legal. &nbsp;In some states it&#8217;s not, when they try to do it on gift cards.</p>
<p>In my state it&#8217;s still legal to steal from gift cards, but I once got my money back on a gift card, which supposedly you can&#8217;t do. &nbsp;The card had one of those &quot;We&#8217;re going to start stealing the money after two years&quot; clauses, but it was on the back of the card, and you couldn&#8217;t see it until you peeled the card away from the backing.</p>
<p>So I told the store that (1) these conditions were not presented at time of sale, and (2) I did not agree to them. &nbsp;It took two or three people, but I did get the money back. &nbsp;(I might well have used the card before it expired anyway&#8230;but the real problem was the queasy feeling that this company was admitting it was planning to steal from me in the future. &nbsp;Why would I want to do business with a company like that? &nbsp;Now you see why CompUSA had to close all those stores.)</p>
<p>(Thanks go to Cem Kaner&#8217;s book, <em>Bad Software</em>, for how to approach the problem, referencing the Uniform Commercial Code.)</p>

		<p>Air Canada has also reduced their expiry times to a mere 12 months. &nbsp;My deadline is at the end of this month, and I&#8217;ve sent my wife flowers to earn a couple points and show activity (also just to send her flowers). &nbsp;Now I&#8217;m stuck in the limbo where the points from the flowers haven&#8217;t shown up on the account yet, with the deadline fast approaching.</p>

		<p>Raymond:</p>
<p>I fail to see your point&#8230; The flyer miles were expiring before, it&#8217;s just that they were expiring after 3 years instead of 18 months now.</p>
<p>So if the question is: How long are you going to keep the 100$ if the check&#8217;s validity was 3 years when you gave it to him&#8230; well I have to say &#8220;3 years&#8221;, since that&#8217;s what the (implicit) agreement was at the time.</p>
<p>If the consumer where abusing a loophole while the company was doing them a favor, I might have followed the &#8220;friend&#8221; argument, but that is not the case here I think.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Technically, the points don&#8217;t expire. It&#8217;s the <u>account</u> that expires. They are changing the terms under which accounts expire. It&#8217;s as if your friend could call you every three years and say &#8220;I&#8217;m still here!&#8221; and the check stays valid for another three years. But I&#8217;m not sure what point we&#8217;re discussing any more. I&#8217;m saying that the airlines don&#8217;t like having all these accounts outstanding. I didn&#8217;t realize that point was open to debate. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<blockquote><p>
  This change also reduces the airline’s mileage liability
</p></blockquote>
<p>The airlines probably have some legal way to weasel out of it, but IMO they should escheat† the full-fare cash value of unused miles.</p>
<p>If a business writes you a check and you fail to cash it after a reasonable‡ amount of time, they are required‡ to make a good faith effort‡ to contact you, and failing that they must‡ remit the money to the state. It is not their money, it is yours. If you do not claim it then it belongs to the commonwealth: it is not a windfall for whoever happened to owe it to you.</p>
<p>† Escheat: reversion of unclaimed or abandoned property to the state.</p>
<p>‡ Legal⊜ specifics vary by state.</p>
<p>⊜ I am not a lawyer. Do not believe anything I say. (Do not believe anything lawyers say either.)</p>

		<p>Since someone mentioned gift cards, our state (New Mexico) passed a law that just became effective, mandating that gift card balances not be &quot;siphoned off&quot; or have fees charged by the issuer for 5 years.</p>

		<p>The airline industry is run by morons. &nbsp;That&#8217;s one of the reasons the industry has been a complete business failure for 100 years. &nbsp; Shortening the expiration period for miles will not save the airlines more than a trivial amount of money. &nbsp;Infrequent fliers, who the only ones affected, don&#8217;t claim a free ticket but once every few years. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There may be some reason I don&#8217;t see, but here&#8217;s my scorecard:</p>
<ol>
<li>Airlines&#8217; reason: flat-out lie.</li>
<li>
<p>Raymond&#8217;s reason: stupid.*</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>There&#8217;s lots of evidence that airlines have no compunction about pissing their customers off for no particular reason. &nbsp;So #2 does have that going for it. &nbsp;</p>

		<ul>
<li>Note that I did not say, nor imply that Raymond is stupid, or that it was stupid for him to claim that was the reason. &nbsp;I am saying that the airlines are stupid if that&#8217;s their reason for cutting back the expiration period.</li>

		<p>If you give someone $50 in cash, it&#8217;s gone, even if your friend sticks it in a drawer and forgets about for 50 years. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So why should writing a check be any different?</p>
<p>Why are you looking for a chance to un-give your friend the money?</p>
