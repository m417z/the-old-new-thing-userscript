		<p>How to get rid of an annoying behavior when EDIT control automatically selects the whole text when the dialog box restores focus to it on app activation?</p>

		<p>@alegr1: Basically, use Raymond&#39;s code above to check if the edit control has focus, and save the selection range when the window loses focus and restore the selection range when the window regains focus.</p>

		<p>No need to remember the edit control selection. It already remembers its own selection. To avoid changing the selection on focus changes, the edit box needs to not return the flag DLGC_HASSETSEL when processing the message WM_GETDLGCODE. Of course then you are changing the behavior not only when the dialog is activated, but also when you Tab between controls. I don&#39;t know of an easy way to distinguish between these cases.</p>

		<p>While I&#39;ve known that the application should keep track of the last child to have focus and to restore it, it&#39;s never been clear to me when to do this. &nbsp;Your sample uses WM_ACTIVATE, which makes sense, but I&#39;ve also seen it done on WM_SETFOCUS itself (when the host window gets focus, it redirects it to the appropriate child). &nbsp;I&#39;m wondering if this is effectively the same behavior, or if there&#39;s some subtlety that makes handling WM_ACTIVATE more appropriate.</p>

		<p>It strikes me that this is the sort of standard behaviour that the window manager should do, especially since doing it yourself is tricky and easy to get wrong.</p>

		<p>I can&#39;t reproduce the alleged space key system menu behaviour on a minimised window, and I tried it in Windows 95, 2000, XP and 7 just to be sure.</p>
<p>@Adrian WM_SETFOCUS does look as if it might be a better idea because you don&#39;t seem to get that message for minimised windows.</p>

		<p>@alegr1: To some it&#39;s not annoying. &nbsp;I&#39;m actually very annoyed when clicking on an edit control does not select the contents. &nbsp;Nine times out of 10, my goal is to delete the existing text and replace it. &nbsp;Those controls that don&#39;t adhere to the Windows convention make more work for me.</p>

		<p>@Neil. I got this to work on Windows 7 by: 1. Killing explorer.exe via task manager. 2. Closing all app windows except the one I wanted to pick on (this included Task Manager). 3. Minimising the desired Window. Without explorer there is no taskbar to take over things (my theory). If it is the only window it should have its minimised caption bar highlighted. 4. Press spacebar. The system menu opens. Caveats: 1. I run Win7 in classic mode (or whatever it&#39;s called). 2. There&#39;s probably a better way to skin the cat.</p>

		<p>@foo: Explorer and most other shell replacements apply SPI_SETMINIMIZEDMETRICS with ARW_HIDE (&quot;Hide minimized windows by moving them off the visible area of the screen&quot;) which is probably why you have to kill explorer to get back to the progman minimized style.</p>

		<p>&#8230;or I want to copy the text to the clipboard for further use. &nbsp;Either way, having the edit control select the contents on focus has been highly useful for me.</p>

		<p>The difference between your use-case and that of alegr1 is: You are talking about focus change within the same app, or the same dialog. alegr1 is talking about switching between different apps. An app switch in itself should not alter the input or dialog state on one of the apps.</p>

		<p>Sorry, how exactly do you put focus on a minimized window? Or rather, when would the user get to this situation?, I suppose is a better question.</p>
<p>No wonder &quot;it is not well-known&quot;!</p>

		<p>@foo Not wanting to kill explorer.exe I searched for another way to create a minimised window but so far I&#39;ve only been able to achieve this on one application running on Windows 95, which just beeps if I hit space on a minimised window.</p>

		<p>One way to set focus on a mimimized window is to use the Alt+Esc and Alt+Shift+Esc keys. &nbsp;I remember finding out about this as a way to switch from a full screen application back in the days of Windows 95 and Windows 98. &nbsp;The keyboard I was using back then didn&#39;t have the Windows key, but I knew about Ctrl+Esc. &nbsp;However, one time I accidentally pressed Alt+Esc instead, and noticed that the taskbar came up front without the start menu displaying (which is what I wanted), so I became accustomed to Alt+Esc, and favored it more than Alt+Tab. &nbsp;There was also an entry on this blog some time ago on exactly what the combination does, and, because it&#39;s much lesser known than the Alt+Tab combination, most utility apps which intercept the Alt+Tab don&#39;t intercept the Alt+Esc. &nbsp;Alt+Esc takes the current active window, puts it on the bottom of the window stack and at the same time takes the second window on the stack and makes it active. &nbsp;Alt+Shift+Esc does the exact opposite. &nbsp;The only effect this keyboard shortcut has is modifying the window stack as well as making sure the window on top of the stack is active (though it may possibly be a job of the window manager to do the latter, I&#39;m not sure). &nbsp;In most cases, the stack order has all minimized windows on bottom, and all not minimized windows on top, but Alt+Esc can change this order to have minimized windows on top, and thus active. &nbsp;This should allow a simple way to have a minimized window be active without having to kill explorer or attempt to start minimized or anything like that. &nbsp;In fact, I just tested this with Internet Explorer 11 on Windows 7, and I in fact did see the system menu open when pressing space. &nbsp;In fact, I think I may have seen this happen once before and I had wondered how and why this happens, and now I know.</p>
