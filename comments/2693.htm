		<p>@Rick C: In Firefox 25, comment links are still as broken as they have been for me for the last couple of years. &nbsp;When you first open a linked comment, it doesn&#39;t scroll to the anchor since the comment hasn&#39;t loaded yet (they&#39;re loaded asynchronously). &nbsp;But if you hit enter in the URL bar, it scrolls to the comment then.</p>
<p>Internet Explorer 10 and Chrome 30 don&#39;t have this behavior &#8212; they both automatically scroll to the comment as soon as it finishes loading. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know what (if anything) the HTML spec says about this, but I certainly prefer the IE/Chrome behavior.</p>

<p>On another side note, the comment links also work in IE11.</p>

		<p>It certainly is an interesting post. Too bad bad your Marauder&#39;s Map only lasted for the first two books, er, years.</p>

		<p>Oh how I wish I attended college during an era when a man might dial a pay-phone, scream into the mouthpiece, listen for a moment, hang up, and then resume normal activities.</p>

		<p>On a related look regarding the terminal ID, since occasional I lend my hand to help reinstall the bootloader softwares in computer labs, I helped so many times so I actually remembered the IP ranges of individual PCs there.</p>
<p>And then I was a campus BBS user, and like most IP based BBS it has the login IP address shown on the user info page if the user is login.</p>
<p>There was one case that another BBS user who was my classmate needs help and I was in the affilated clubs&#39; room of studuent union. I told him to wait and &quot;I&#39;ll go and find you at room ST502&quot; and he was amazed.</p>
<p>On a not so related note of this post, after I acquired knowledge of how to write &quot;expect&quot; script to prevent idle kickouts, I kept login the BBS straight 2 years (expect downtime of both servers) through the UNIX clusters and they can&#39;t guess my actual location using that infomation, yet I can still find them with finger. :P</p>

		<p>&gt; &quot;How&#39;d you know I was in the Physics Lab?&quot; </p>
<p>Not so hi-tech, but I fondly remember working in my office when a friend visited. &nbsp;My office shared a phone with someone who was many cubicles away, but while talking, I heard the faint ringing of the other cubicle. &nbsp;Without even thinking, I put my hand over the phone, and two second later it rang and I picked it up.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t think anything of it until I noticed my friend staring at me open mouthed. &nbsp;&quot;How&#8230; how&#8230; how did you know it was going to ring?&quot; &nbsp;He was almost white.</p>
<p>I shrugged, and said &quot;After a few years here, you just get a sense when it&#39;s going to ring. &nbsp;Nothing special.&quot;</p>
<p>Sadly, and I&#39;ve regretted it ever since, I could not keep a straight face the moment I finished the sentence. &nbsp;I&#39;ve had to live with my failure to pull that off for years now, as it would have been, just, perfect.</p>

		<p>&gt;&quot;listening to a portable cassette recorder&quot; [&#8230;] &quot;screaming the carrier into the phone&quot;.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#39;s just me, but it seems like there&#39;s a fundamental disconnect at work here in terms of tools available vs. tools used.</p>

		<p>@Dave &#8211; the portable cassette recorder wasn&#39;t all that portable I imagine. &nbsp;And to change tapes just to have carrier sounds would be annoying :) &nbsp;But kudos for noticing the disconnect &#8211; I had overlooked it.</p>

		<p>Not exactly analogous to the marauder&#39;s map, but when I was in college we used a DEC VAX 6400 cluster. I once sat there and changed the group ACL properties of one of my files to every possible value and then checked the directory listing. I learned that the numeric group values were in Octal, and compiled a list of all numeric values and corresponding names. The campus system administrator wanted to know where I got the campus-wide ACL information after I showed him the list&#8230;</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a story that a friend of mine once told me. At the time, he was working for Bell Labs in Batavia IL, and he was trying to troubleshoot a problem where one of their dial-ups was crashing intermittently. At one point he manually dialed the number on his phone, and for some reason he decided to blow into the receiver. He was surprised when this reproduced the crash! (and he was later able to replicate the error predictably). His coworkers called this the &quot;blowjob&quot; test.</p>

		<p>I regularly hypnotise and insert micro-tracking devices into my colleagues&#39; bodies. I once thought tracking their location could be more easily done by exploiting their smart phones, but decided against it as that loses the personal touch (hypnosis, the insertion ritual, and subsequent recollection via posthypnotic suggestion to retrieve the device from their stool, clean it, and return it for recharging, reinsertion, and [imagined] reward).</p>
