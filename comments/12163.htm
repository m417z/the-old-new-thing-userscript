		<p>This is one of those bits of microspeak that gets to me. About the only thing more annoying would be using &quot;announce&quot; instead of &quot;announcement&quot; (as in the recent &quot;Windows Phone 7 Announce&quot; stupidity) and &quot;ask&quot; instead of &quot;request&quot;. Is it really that hard to stop trying to shoehorn verbs into nouns here?</p>

		<p>Flagging up what the &quot;key take-away&quot; from your presentation is is just an admission that your presentation skills lack the clarity for the audience to figure out the most relevant information on their own. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen a similar thing where a presentation ends with a slide captioned &#39;call-to-action&#39;. These presenters have been told that a good, persuasive presentation ends with a call to action for the participants. They haven&#39;t realised that a good call-to-action at the end of a persuasive presentation doesn&#39;t need to be labelled as such.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Or because the presenters have been told by the conference organizers that &quot;Call to action&quot; is a mandatory presentation slide. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I think this language has escaped Microsoft and become &quot;business speak&quot; rather than Microspeak. Either that or every place I&#39;ve worked recently (and that&#39;s a lot as a consultant) is full of ex-Microsoft people.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll admit to using it occasionally. Sometimes no matter what you do there&#39;s execs in the room who just can&#39;t figure out what parts of the presentation are important. Not entirely their fault, as it was written for technical audience and they invited themselves.</p>

		<p>So, if every take-away is a key take-away, doesn&#39;t that make the &#39;key&#39; part redundant?</p>
<p>What happens if there&#39;s a take-away so crucially important, that&#39;s it&#39;s even more important than the regular key take-aways? A key-key take-away? Key^2? :P</p>

<p>yes, it’s the same logic as making all tasks have a critical priority. when you define all take-aways as having the same importance there is no room for a more import one.</p>

		<p>The conference organizers probably require a &quot;call to action&quot; slide because they&#39;re used to presenters who can&#39;t make their presentations clear.</p>
<p>And when you think about it, most good technical presentations are done by people who know stuff, and not necessarily by people who&#39;s primary job skill is &quot;teaching stuff to other people&quot;. This means the information can be accurate, but not necessarily presented perfectly. This is usually better than a brilliant and memorable presentation of inaccurate information.</p>
<p>If you care about the information, then you may need to make some effort in order to learn, and not just have everything spoon-fed to you.</p>

		<p>@Tim: Check your OED: &quot;ask&quot; has been a noun as long as it has been a verb, for over 1000 years. Don&#39;t start complaining now just because people in the past few hundred years have decided that &quot;ask&quot; should only be a verb.</p>

		<p>As somebody who rarely has time for complete presentations, I prefer to just read the slides. That means I want all pertinent information available in the slideshow. And for reference, I want to be able to skip right to the end and see slides with the &quot;call to action&quot; or &quot;key take-aways&quot; and a table of URLs.</p>
<p>I hate having to filter through an hour of presentation just to figure out what the two new APIs are, or whatever. Saying that a &quot;call to action&quot; slide is unnecessary in a good presentation is like saying that an abstract is unnecessary in a well-written paper. I consider both to be valuable reference material.</p>

		<p>&quot;Key take-away&quot; sounds like a tool of parental discipline. I can remember it being inflicted on an acquaintance for a bad grade in 10th-grade trigonometry, and have used it myself.</p>
<p>The key take-away will last until your grades improve, young man!</p>

		<p>@APardoe</p>
<p>It&#39;s rather ironic that you follow &quot;Don&#39;t start complaining now just because people in the past few hundred years have decided that &#39;ask&#39; should only be a verb.&quot; by &quot;I hate when people claim that English should be a static language.&quot;</p>
<p>Abiding by a centuries old definition of a word is what makes a language static. &nbsp;Dynamic languages lose usages just as often as they gain them. &nbsp;Sure, they can revert too, but there&#39;s also nothing wrong with criticizing forced language for the sake of sounding &#39;businessy&#39; either :)</p>

		<p>@none: You&#39;re correct, I did not disambiguate between two distinct points. My first assertion is that Tim&#39;s specific example does not support his argument. My second assertion is that I generally dislike arguments of this sort, favoring a dynamic language.</p>
<p>First assertion: Tim implies that &quot;ask&quot; is a verb being shoehorned into a noun, and suggests that we use another verb, &quot;request&quot;, in its place. I assert that, based on historical evidence from the OED, no shoehorning is taking place. In fact &quot;ask&quot; as a noun has a grand old tradition.</p>
<p>Second assertion: I dislike complaints that the language is evolving (or, in the case of &quot;ask&quot;, reverting a few hundred years.) I believe that it&#39;s futile to attempt to strictly codify spoken languages over long periods of time. I&#39;ll stop before I start unfairly criticizing the French :)</p>
