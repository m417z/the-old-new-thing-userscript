		<p>I guess that after calling GetClipboardOwner, some other application could have opened the clipboard, become the new owner and closed the clipboard, before we get to OpenClipboard call.</p>
<p>Which means that the OpenClipboard call will succeed (since the clipboard was closed by the other application), but we are not the owner anymore (oops?).</p>
<p><!-- 

<p>BTW, your reference implementation of WM_RENDERALLFORMATS wrongly uses "case WM_RENDERFORMAT". --></p>

		<p>Wait, the clipboard has a timeout? I&#39;m forever accidentally (WinDbg interprets a right-click as a paste, presumably something to do with the rich text control it uses?) pasting from the debuggee into the debugger, which as you can imagine doesn&#39;t work too well&#8230;</p>

		<p>Many Windows apps use MVC, and use either a flag or a list to select nodes in the model by reference. &nbsp;Pasting, then, walks the list.</p>
<p>If you have read consistency, you can pin the version of the data, and so your copy and paste is consistent. &nbsp;That could be on MVVM, for example, having a separate clipboard View Model and building it at the copy time. &nbsp;Or on MVC, you could make your objects generational or w/e. &nbsp;The point is that if your traversal is consistent, every time, then you&#39;re correct that the Empty is optional.</p>
<p>However, if the traversal is not consistent &#8212; and that is the case for the vast majority of apps on the Windows platform &#8212; then for render all formats you really have to empty out first, then render each format in turn. &nbsp;The reason being it is more important that the renders be consistent with one another than that the routine returns faster.</p>
<p>It isn&#39;t the server app that gets a choice here &#8212; its the client. &nbsp;If someone goes to paste special, and it shows different data, they&#39;re going to blame the client app &#8212; not the server. &nbsp;They&#39;re not going to go &quot;oh, fabrikam screwed up copy.&quot; &nbsp;It&#39;ll be &quot;stupid word, can&#39;t even paste correctly.&quot;</p>
<p>Because they&#39;ll notice the difference when they&#39;re in some other app pasting.</p>
