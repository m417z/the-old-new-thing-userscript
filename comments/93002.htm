		<p>While I can probably find out (or wait for someone to comment on it), the obvious question is why Windows 10 for Phone mixes photos with Microsoft wallpaper. I see on my iPhone that Apple keeps theirs in a separate section of wallpaper settings.</p>

		<p>The photo chooser wants to surface your photos, no matter where they&#8217;re stored. At least that&#8217;s my experience using the OS.</p>

		<p>My wallpaper is almost always something I snapped myself or saved from the web, so Apple was right to downplay theirs by stashing it away under Settings.</p>

		<p>I worked for Microsoft for about a dozen years (ending about 4 years ago).  I&#8217;m surprised at the number of times that I do know the person I get asked about in these situations.  Often, however, it&#8217;s distant knowledge &#8211; knowing that someone is the go-to person for some technology, perhaps having exchanged a handful of emails, etc.  Hey, I even exchanged emails with Raymond several times (I was one of those &#8220;customer representatives&#8221; that he mentions in this blog occasionally).</p>

		<p>Being a customer liaison you probably had a better chance to interact with many employees, more than 97.8% of the employees listed above</p>

		<p>Maybe someone had to explain to his manager why the percentages didn&#8217;t sum up to 100%, not including CEO was the accepted answer.</p>
<p>BTW, once I had to explain to a customer why the percentages didn&#8217;t sum up to 100%, it is vexing&#8230;</p>

		<p>Add them all up, subtract from 100 and hide the error in one of the results. It saves having to explain and the customer is happy. There are various strategies for picking which entry the error should be included in, I&#8217;d probably go for the middle one.</p>

		<p>My wild guess is that when people were officially categorizing roles, they were unsure what role to assign to the CEO since a CEO should be touching all of those areas of the business.  (Yes, both Bill and Satya could credibly claim &#8220;Engineering&#8221;&#8230;Satya does have a CS degree)</p>
<p>So, that poor flunky created a separate CEO role with only one member. That&#8217;s why they didn&#8217;t want to include the CEO in the table.  They would have to add a separate &#8220;CEO&#8221; line with either 0.001%  (forcing the other percentages to an absurd precision) or rounded to 0.0% which would be silly.</p>

		<p>Great story.  I can confirm the prevalence of the &#8220;do you know&#8230;?&#8221; question.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m from Denmark, and on a few occasions, I have even gotten the question in relation to that.  &#8220;Oh, I was there once, and I met Finn Larseks, or something like that.  Do you know him?&#8221;  I have to look at the questioner to see if they are serious, and at least a couple of times, they actually were.  Sure, Denmark is a small country, but it&#8217;s not *that* small.</p>

&gt;and I met Finn Larseks, or something like that. Do you know him?”</p>
<p>You should tell them &#8220;oh, I know him, he lives in Smeerenburg.  You should go visit some time&#8221;.</p>

		<p>When I visited India, I did get a &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re Canadian, my cousin&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Oddly enough, it turned out that his cousin worked in a nearby store that I frequented.  I didn&#8217;t know him by name, but his description matched my memory of someone working there, so I went in, told him his cousin says hi, and amused us both.</p>

		<p>oh, btw the official name is &#8220;Windows 10 Mobile&#8221;, not Windows 10 for Phone. I know I am nitpicking, but since there was a version of OS called Windows Phone, and had 8.1 version, wanted to call it out.</p>

		<p>Let me guess, you&#8217;re part of the 47.0%, who spend their time renaming Windows Mobile, to Windows Phone, to Windows 10 Mobile. ;) Pretty shocking that almost half of Microsoft is Sales and Marketing. Curious what the numbers are for other big tech companies.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s funny when that does happen. Back in 2000, on my first visit to Houston, I was introduced to some people from NASA and got talking. At some point, one of them mentioned that one of the cleaners from my old high school (in Scotland, six time zones away) had died that summer. (It turned out he was Scottish, and this was actually his own old home town, so he kept in touch with people back there too.) A few years later, I bumped into one of those Americans back in Scotland &#8211; she&#8217;d just emigrated, and ended up working for the same university as me, in the building next door.</p>
