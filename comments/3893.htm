		<p>So it means that with Win 8.1 (codenamed Blue) we&#39;re living with a build of the trunk? Are we going to receive nightly builds every day with Windows Update? Wow, that&#39;s bleeding edge :)</p>
<p>(btw: I&#39;d love to, but I know that it will never be possible &#8211; even if I&#39;m sure that nowadays a nightly build of windows would also be always somehow working)</p>
<p>btw: thanks for your posts, as always very interesting and funny!</p>

		<p>Perhaps if people knew where the name came from, they&#39;d still be using it.</p>

		<p>So is the checked build called &quot;The Thin Blue Line&quot;? Yes, I&#39;m joking (although the TV show was very good if you like Rowan Atkinson!)</p>

		<p>@j b: It&#39;s not three lines; the javascript garbage is on a single line which may be split up due to long line wrapping. But that depends on your browser windows width and font size. So for me, for example, it&#39;s only two lines.</p>

		<p>Assuming 12-point lines, three lines of garbage = 36 points = 1/2 inch = 43200 AH.</p>

		<p>You&#39;d probably find lots of such names/labels if you dig deep down in history &#8211; the IBM &quot;801&quot; RISC chip and the &quot;Winchester&quot; disk technology are quite famous.</p>
<p>My variant of the history: In the very early 1980s, I was on a develpment team for an office automation suite (*before* the arrival of MSO!). We used an internal measurement unit of 1/86400 inch, called an &quot;AH&quot; both in the code and in the system documentation. Most younger programmers had no idea of the origin of the name, but some of us had been present at the early design disdussion where one of my colleagues argued strongly in favor of adopting 1/86javascript:WebForm_DoPostBackWithOptions(new WebForm_PostBackOptions(&quot;ctl00$content$ctl00$w_4996$_b00ab5$ctl00$ctl00$ctl00$ctl05$bpCommentForm$ctl05$btnSubmit&quot;, &quot;&quot;, true, &quot;BlogPostCommentForm-ctl00_content_ctl00_w_4996__b00ab5_ctl00_ctl00&quot;, &quot;&quot;, false, true))400 inch as a basic unit, and as a joke, some took to referring to it by the initials of this guy. By the end of the meeting, everybody had adopted &quot;AH&quot; as a replacement for &quot;one eightsix thousand four hundreds of an inch&quot;. And so it was: AH was the name of the new unit.</p>

		<p>We&#39;ve had this exact same thing happen here from a whiteboard diagram made of a system and its data flow interactions, with the same color in fact. &nbsp;One particular process came to be known as the &#39;Blue Pipe&#39; because it was the pipe of data that was drawn in blue on a diagram. &nbsp;That was 8 years ago, since then other new, similar processes that didn&#39;t have diagrams of their own have been playfully given other colors as names to fit the theme (Yellow Pipe, Red Pipe); including one colorful euphemism, the Brown Pipe which was intended for processing of corrupt and unreliable data that was&#8230; well&#8230; crap.</p>

		<p>@Stefano the trunk is the *least* bleeding-edge of all the branches, because nothing is ever checked into the trunk directly; changes start at the leaves and work their way toward the trunk.</p>
<p>Once a change hits the trunk it then heads outward along all the branches simultaneously (other than the one it came in on, which already has the change.)</p>
<p>If a change breaks something, it is (hopefully) caught before it reaches the trunk, so only that branch is broken. When the fix is found, it is checked in, and the breaking change and the fixing change are both pulled into the trunk together.</p>

		<p>If I&#39;m not mistaken that&#39;s also how red-black trees came into existence. It seems surprising on first glance, but if you think about it, it&#39;s rather intuitive &#8211; lots of whiteboards involved when creatively working and naming things is generally annoyingly hard (&quot;There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things.&quot;)</p>

		<p>This is also why in the Roslyn syntax trees there is a private property &quot;Green&quot; that points to another tree node. The user-visible &quot;red&quot; tree is actually a facade over the immutable &quot;green&quot; tree, so named because those were the markers at hand when the architect drew the diagram.</p>

		<p>j b: One of my old hw profs mentioned it once on the side and it stuck. I don&#39;t think he mentioned the source, in any case I&#39;ve no idea who came up with it :(</p>
<p>A google search mentions Phil Karlton, whom I&#39;ve never heard of, so I&#39;ll just attribute it to him. I did stumble upon the following gem though: &quot;There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation, naming things and off-by-1 errors&quot; </p>
