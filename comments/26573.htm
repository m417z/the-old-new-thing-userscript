		<p>I&#8217;d expect scale numbers one and two to be swapped. &nbsp;Both imply that you found a movie bad, hence an automatic waste of your time, but I&#8217;d think &#8220;Would advise against&#8221; implies that a movie was so horribly bad that you couldn&#8217;t imagine anyone else finding it enjoyable.</p>

		<p>Raymond, if you liked the &quot;the troubles keep piling on&quot; nature of the first movie, you might like Oscar, with Sylvester Stallone, as a 30s-era gangster trying to go legit. &nbsp;It&#8217;s quite different from most of the rest of the stuff he does.</p>

		<p>Having read the novel &#8220;Tell No One&#8221; a few years ago, I&#8217;m interested in seeing the movie (despite it being in French, and &#8211;from the description&#8211; a bit different from the book). &nbsp;The novel itself had the unique property that about about half-way through, you say to your self &#8220;This is the most outlandish, contrived story I&#8217;ve ever heard&#8221;. &nbsp;Then, at the end, when everyone&#8217;s motives and justifications are revealed, you think &#8220;DAMN!! This could really happen!&#8221;</p>

		<p>&quot;Death at a funeral, Cashback, Tell No One&quot; &#8211; the three titles together sounds like the plot of yet another movie :)</p>

		<p>Ah, I didn&#8217;t realise they were film titles. I read the post subject and thought, cor, this is a more spicy title than the norm! Slightly disappointed that they&#8217;ve turned out to just be films you&#8217;ve watched. :-)</p>
