		<p>The guy&#39;s shock at finding it reminds me of a great story Sylvester McCoy tells in the DVD extras of Remembrance of the Daleks. Apparently the pyrotechnics were sufficiently realistic that the emergency services showed up, thinking there had been a bombing. Instead, they got quite a fright when a trio of Daleks trundled towards them out of a cloud of smoke.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve watched Doctor Who on and off since I was a kid. If you have too, here&#39;s a mental challenge: imagine yourself in the position of cleaning up a pond (in the UK of course). You&#39;re thinking about whatever and with no warning at all, you lift something out of the water and find yourself facing the instantly familiar figure of.. a dalek. Surely, you will be *thrilled*, after all you just found an original prop from a famous TV show. You might find yourself *puzzled*: &quot;uh? how did this end up here?&quot;. But the real question is: will you find yourself, even for the tiniest fraction of a second&#8230; *frightened*? Will it take just an instant, before you are able to remind yourself &quot;they are not real&quot;?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know. I think I would be. Even though I never found the show scary. I think such images have a way to weave themselves in the subconscious, particularly that of a young mind.</p>
