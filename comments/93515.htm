		<p>Sounds like they want the equivalent of the &#8220;sticky&#8221; bit from UNIX. Linux has had full ACLs on most filesystems for years now, but it&#8217;s amazing what could be accomplished with just a few permission bits.</p>

		<p>Raymond, thanks is this is very timely.  I passed this blog post on to our internal support team (i.e., sys admins) because they are dealing with something similar right now.  Again, thanks!</p>

		<p>Attempting to translate &#8220;it is a template that gets applied to newly-created objects&#8221; into real-world implications&#8230;</p>
<p>This means that exercising the &#8220;Take Ownership&#8221; action will not actually grant privileges associated with CREATOR/OWNER to the newly designated owner; those remain with the original (at the time of file creation) owner.  Correct?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Take ownership&#8221; doesn&#8217;t modify the ACL, it just changes the owner. CREATOR-OWNER permissions are set up to apply to the contained objects. If you check the permissions info, the files actually lose it, they have an entry for an actual user. Thus, the new owner will not automatically have the access.</p>

		<p>@alegr1 Well, changing a user&#8217;s (or his token&#8217;s, in the case of UAC) group membership doesn&#8217;t modify ACLs either, but it certainly does affect the effective permissions.  It&#8217;s good to know that the change in owner doesn&#8217;t impact permission evaluation.</p>

		<p>If I got it right, &#8220;Creator Owner&#8221; permissions should always be marked &#8220;Inherit Only&#8221;, correct?</p>

		<p>Doesn&#8217;t really matter, since as an ACE applying to &#8216;this object&#8217;, it will never be matched against an accessor.<br />
But yes, for clarity make it inherit-only.</p>

		<p>CREATOR OWNER has been a very helpful.  I was lucky enough to encounter a sample set up by another admin years ago.  It&#8217;s very handy for allowing user profile folders with the proper permissions to be created by the user during the first logon.</p>

		<p>CREATOR GROUP is another handy one if you&#8217;re willing to go out on a limb and change a user&#8217;s primary group. I came up with an idea many years ago to create a unique group per user for all our admin accounts, make it the primary group for each admin user, and then assign an audit ACL, from the top down, to everything on the file server and have the audit ACL set to CREATOR GROUP on an obscure operation that&#8217;s likely to rarely be used (such as failure to take ownership). Why?</p>
<p>Well, suppose you have a non-Windows system, like a NetApp filer, and therefore cannot be assured that the group policy setting to make files written by Administrators group be owned by the individual account will be honoured in all circumstances. Or, you do not want to lose the flexibility that having the file owned by Administrators gives you, but want traceability too. Take three admin users &#8230; Alice, Bob and Sue. You create an AdminUser:Alice, AdminUser:Bob, AdminUser:Sue group. Assign respectively as the primary group for Alice, Bob and Sue.</p>
<p>When Alice, Bob and Sue create files/folders, they will be owned by Administrators. However, if you look at the security ACL it will have an entry created from your inheritable CREATOR GROUP ACE. When this ACL is written, it will have the primary group of each user and therefore tell you which one actually created it &#8211; while allowing you to retain the flexibility that ownership by Administrators was designed to give you in the first place.</p>
<p>I tested this and it worked, but it never made it into production. Instead, we limited the number of admins. But someone out there might want to try it and see how it works. You may run into limits for direct membership of Domain Users if you have a large number of admins and an AD domain set at a very old functional level (like, Windows 2000 level). Caveat emptor ;)</p>

		<p>I should also add: it doesn&#8217;t need to be a security ACL but that way, it does not show up in discretionary ACLs, and also does not run the risk of disrupting normal file permissions. Say you set a CREATOR GROUP, full access, discretionary ACL and an ordinary user creates a folder? It suddenly has Domain Users FULL access&#8230;</p>
