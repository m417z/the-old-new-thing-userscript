		<p>Query 1:</p>
<p>The handle is being signalled after the launched process terminates. But the process they launched just handed over control to an existing explorer process, which hasn&#39;t terminated.</p>
<p>Query 2:</p>
<p>Host an explorer browser control in a 32-bit process in which the shell extension is loaded.</p>
<p>Query 3:</p>
<p>Host an explorer browswer control in an elevated process in which the shell extension is loaded.</p>

		<p>I smell a trap at the end. The shell is not limited to explorer.exe, it can be nearly any program on the computer that is using it. As such, a shell extension does not just need explorer.exe elevanted, but every possible application that loads the shell extension (lets assume it can be loaded by all shell users). The consequences are way too big to justify running the shell extension elevated, because it would mean that (nearly) everything is elevated.</p>
<p>And that is before we discuss the fact that when explorer.exe starts stuff said stuff will inherit the elevation.</p>

		<p>&quot;We have a wizard that creates some files in a directory based on information provided by the user, and we want to launch Explorer to view that directory so users can verify that things are set up the way they want them. When users close the Explorer window, we ask them if everything was good;&quot;</p>

<p>Q1: A program that calls CreateProcess doesn&#39;t have a clue about what the target process does. The handle state only reflects the target process state, nothing more.</p>

		<p>Funny that this sample program with c:\Program Files &nbsp;hard-coded comes so soon after a posting on SHGetFolderPath. &nbsp;I know&#8230;just a stripped down sample program to demonstrate the concepts&#8230;but it shows how seductive it can be to do things the easy way.</p>

<p>I know that &#8211; the problem in customer query 1 is just another example of the original problem that Mr Chen handles at the top of the article.</p>

		<p>@sunil Neither 2 or 3 indicate they want to host an explorer window. &nbsp;The whole point of a shell extension is that it is available in ANY explorer window&#8230; otherwise it&#39;s fairly useless and you might as well just have the functionality incorporated in the program you were going to host the Explorer window in.</p>
<p>Plus, you can only host Explorer windows starting with Vista, and plenty of people still use XP.</p>
<p>My answers:</p>
<p>1) Explorer can only run as a single instance except in a very specific circumstance, so other instances will signal the main process and immediately exit.</p>
<p>2) Build a 64-bit version of your shell extension for 64-bit systems if you have the source, or install the 32-bit version of your OS.</p>
<p>3) This is a bad idea, since if you succeed all processes run afterwards will be elevated, so you have in effect disabled UAC anyway. &nbsp;Instead, change necessary folder/registry key permissions so the extension can run under a normal user account. &nbsp;Though it would be best just to fix the extension if possible.</p>

		<p>This is unrelated to customer #1&#39;s problem (others have already pointed out the problem), but this command line:</p>
<p>CreateProcess(TEXT(&quot;C:\Windows\Explorer.exe&quot;), TEXT(&quot; /e,C:\usr&quot;), &#8230;)</p>
<p>Will start up Explorer with argv[0] as &quot;/e,C:\usr&quot; instead of argv[1] as that, which will fail to set the starting directory of the new window.</p>

		<p>@The MAZZTer</p>
<p>I think in Q2 and Q3 it&#39;s strongly implied that the extensions are 3rd party and that the sources aren&#39;t to hand. Clearly they need some functionality in the extension which they can&#39;t otherwise reproduce.</p>

		<p>Actually I take that back, it will start Explorer with argv[0] as the empty string, which is probably ok (most programs ignore argv[0]; sometimes they print it out with error messages, but even that is harmless). &nbsp;I didn&#39;t notice the leading space, which I presume is meaningful to CommandLineToArgvW.</p>

		<p>@Bob</p>
<p>I think you will find the use of hard coded paths isn&#39;t a case of doing things the &quot;easy way&quot; but actually results in an example free from code noise that isn&#39;t relevant to the point.</p>

		<p>Would substituting something like &quot;common open&quot; avoid the customer&#39;s problem, or is it tied too much to explorer?</p>

		<p>I think if you use the program group (program manager) api&#39;s you can get explorer to do this for you.</p>

		<p>My immediate thought (besides &quot;that&#39;s maybe not a wonderful thing to want to do&quot;) was that explorer takes a /separate flag that tells it to start a new process. (I&#39;ve used that to make explorer windows with &#39;runas&#39;.) I wonder if that would work.</p>
<p>@Paul:</p>
<p>And why does using hard-coded paths result in an example &quot;free from code noise&quot;? Because it&#39;s easier and more direct than doing it right.</p>

		<p>The way the shell team has handled 32-bit shell extensions in 64-bit Windows is the most wrongest and worst possible way for users who want to migrate to 64-bit Windows. They even killed off the ability to run 32-bit Explorer in 64-bit Windows 7. Ultimately, users suffer because MS didn&#39;t bother to create a bridge for 32-bit shell extensions in 64-bit Explorer. I recently found a little tool (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.gasanov.net/WOW64Menu.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.gasanov.net/WOW64Menu.asp</a>) that lets you access 32-bit context menu and property sheet handlers at least in 64-bit Explorer. Something like this should be built-in into WIndows. Windows 8 maybe. Shell team, take a look at that tool and ease people&#39;s lives.</p>
<p>MS even screwed up with their own Windows Live Essentials which wrongly install 32-bit AutoPlay handlers on 64-bit Windows. See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://sticklebackplastic.com/post/2009/05/20/The-case-of-the-missing-AutoPlay-handler.aspx" rel="nofollow">sticklebackplastic.com/&#8230;/The-case-of-the-missing-AutoPlay-handler.aspx</a></p>

		<p>@Evan</p>
<p>I guess I was just annoyed at this cropping up again, nearly every single post Raymond does that includes a hard coded path gets a comment like that. The main part of the example in this article is about 11 lines, if wrapping is ignored) &#8211; would it really be improved by adding another 10 lines or so of code that is dealing with simply returning a path?</p>
