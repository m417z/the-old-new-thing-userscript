		<p>Using WriteProcessMemory will certainly help with their memory usage. This way, the client can just poke the appropriate data values directly into the server&#39;s data structures. This will be much faster than the hack of using a file as a proxy, and use less memory because it won&#39;t have to load or parse it.</p>
<p>Cleaner, faster, smaller&#8230; I cannot see any downsides to this technique!</p>
<p>(Yes, this is a joke)</p>

		<p>Hmmm. If loopback TCP/IP proves not fast enough, I&#39;d be using WriteProcessMemory the other way around. The privileged server will call the API (and ReadProcessMemory) targeting the unprivileged client (the control channel would still use TCP/IP). If you have to worry about the server attacking the client then you have bigger problems. I tend to not bother to make my services work without admin privileges (besides the fact they&#39;re often given working directories by the customer that only admin has write access to) so anybody who can exploit that already has the machine.</p>
<p>Address space exhaustion sucks. /3GB to the rescue sometimes. amd64 to the rescue more frequently.</p>

		<p>Or maybe client doesn&#39;t mean what you think, and refers to architecture alone, not to where it runs or how (un)privileged it is. In that case the customer may have thought ‘these people don&#39;t know what they&#39;re talking about’ and went on to seek help elsewhere. (They&#39;d be wrong, but they would have no way of knowing.)</p>

		<p>@Joshua: named pipes are also worth considering if you&#39;re only doing message-based local communication (although they also work remotely, they have some quirks and security implications that mean you&#39;re probably not better off than with TCP/IP). Locally they&#39;re faster than TCP/IP and they free you from having to write a message layer over shared memory yourself.</p>
<p>If you are going the shared memory route, there is still no excuse for using ReadProcessMemory()/WriteProcessMemory() as opposed to CreateFileMapping()/MapViewOfFile(). WriteProcessMemory() has no restrictions whatsoever &#8212; even if you don&#39;t care about the security, a simple bug could hose the receiving party in unforeseen and unboundedly subtle ways. At least a file mapping allows you to have a well-defined interface (well, more or less).</p>

		<p>@JM &quot;Locally they&#39;re faster than TCP/IP&quot;</p>
<p>They both run equally fast on the same machine. Connecting to localhost doesn&#39;t put packets on the network donchaknow. &#8230;</p>
<p>I think something that is worth mentioning is that shared memory is a BAD choice for IPC unless you REALLY know what you&#39;re doing. You have to be really careful about Time-of-check Time-of-use bugs since when you&#39;re reading the memory in the server there&#39;s nothing to stop a malicious program on the other side writing to that data. You have to manually buffer the content to avoid these TOCTOU bugs.</p>
<p>If you use a named pipe or a socket, the bytes you&#39;ve read in aren&#39;t subject to those race-conditions, and whilst you&#39;re waiting on the pipe or the socket the guy on the other side gets a short scheduler boost, so using those makes your programs more reliable AND faster; and you don&#39;t need to allocate funky memory sections which consume lots of Virtual Memory in your process to do it :)</p>

		<p>@Matt: last time I measured it, pipes were faster. Obviously local TCP/IP doesn&#39;t go over the network, but the overhead characteristics still differ from pipes. Of course, benchmarks always lie, nor do I remember what version of Windows I tested it on &#8212; probably Server 2008. Disregarding speed, named pipes don&#39;t take up ports.</p>

		<p>@JM @Matt:</p>
<p>Moreover, pipes have an ACL. &nbsp;TCP/IP on localhost does not, an attacker could race the client for connecting to the server.</p>

		<p>Additionally, using WriteProcessMemory in a production application is ill-advised because anti-virus programs&#39; heuristics will often assume that your application is malware. &nbsp;After all, the two primary users of WriteProcessMemory are debuggers and malware, and debuggers are uncommon in the wild.</p>

		<p>@Ken Hagan: Let&#39;s say that you want to spawn a child process of your same .exe and only want to give it one of your handles. &nbsp;One solution, though not the best, is to spawn a copy of yourself with CREATE_SUSPENDED but no handle inheritance, DuplicateHandle the handle into the target process, then WriteProcessMemory the new handle&#39;s value into a global variable within the .exe before resuming the new process. &nbsp;This works, but is extremely hacky.</p>
<p>Another non-development use is cheating in games. =)</p>

		<p>Let&#39;s assume that security is not a concern. The client is already in the &quot;inner ring&quot; and trusted. The problem is still valid. Which way is the fastest to copy data from the client to the server? One real-life example would be data analysis done by No Such Agency that receives from spy satellites images (or live video feed) and each satellite is focusing on it&#39;s perimeter. To achieve a good analysis for an entire given region (let&#39;s say Taliban mountains) you would need that each client to fast upload it&#39;s data to the server whom will then start the algorithm that will spit out the response to the question &quot;Do they have an increased activity in the north or the south?&quot; received from White House war room. As you can see in the above illustrated example the clients can do whatever they like, including but not limited to directly inject data into server process. So, in this case, what is the fastest way do achieve it?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Okay, well if you&#39;re uploading data, then that&#39;s your bottleneck, not the performance of intra-computer data transfer. And if you read the question, you&#39;ll see that the customer already knew which one was faster. They just wanted to know whether WriteProcessMemory was fast enough for their needs. And there&#39;s only one way to know for sure: Measure it and see if it&#39;s fast enough for your needs. -Raymond</em>]</div>
