		<p>is that the same system that shows up in control panel&#8217;s add/remove programs applet, which seems to know which programs have been used often and not so often?</p>
<p>you have a point that you can&#8217;t expose the details for protecting the &#8220;system&#8221; from unfair manipulation, but wouldn&#8217;t it be legitimate to offer the information as &#8220;read only&#8221; property via some API? I.e. not &#8220;SetAppPopularity&#8221; but &#8220;GetAppPopularity&#8221;</p>
<div class="post">[<i>But what practical use would that function be? The only thing I can think of is that it would make it easier for people to tweak their program so it increased its popularity artificially, the same way people game Google&#8217;s ranking system. And what happens if the Start menu is redesigned so it no longer sorts by popularity? Would it still have to do all the calculations &#8220;just in case somebody calls GetAppPopularity&#8221;? -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>umeca74,</p>
<p>Raymond beat me to it, but Google exposes the final result of their pagerank algorithm without exposing the exact method the score was calculated&#8230; do you think this prevents sites from gaming Google&#8217;s listings? Not a chance, in fact, gaming Google&#8217;s listings is a major industry on the web.</p>

		<p>I wish the recently used programs list were sorted alphabetically. &nbsp;In its current state (sorted by points, presumably) it&#8217;s too volatile to be useful to me since the items jumble themselves around too much (even though it&#8217;s the same XX items) and so it takes too much time to find what one is looking for; in Vista it&#8217;s faster to just type it into the search box. &nbsp;Pity.</p>

		<p>When I launch something using Google Desktop Search, it doesn&#8217;t count for the purposes of frequently used programs. There are several other common ways for me to launch things (double-click on actual exe? from quicklaunch?) that don&#8217;t seem to count. It makes more sense to set the recently used list to 0 and just drag everything I want into the pinned area.</p>

		<p>My roommate pointed out that in his Add/Remove programs list in XP, the entry for IE7 says it is used &#8220;rarely&#8221;.</p>
<p>He wonders how using a program &#8220;all day, every day&#8221; can be considered &#8220;rarely&#8221;.</p>
<p>Maybe it counts invocations rather than run duration. &nbsp;But IE7 is invoked as often as anything else on his system! &nbsp;He just thinks the program usage counter is broken.</p>

		<p>Mark: If you change the Start menu to small icons, as I have (in XP), you can pin 15-20 (or more) programs there&#8230; and they will stay in the order in which you pin them. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then you can ignore the frequently used item list.</p>

		<p>Maybe you&#8217;ll cover this in the next two weeks&#8230; I&#8217;ve noticed that things preinstalled keep showing up on the list. &nbsp;Like &#8220;Take a tour of Windows XP&#8221; or something like that. &nbsp;There are about five things that seem to stay there, even after I choose &#8220;remove this from start menu&#8221; and never run them manually.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t really care anymore though, in Vista I don&#8217;t have to click on anything, I just hit windows key and start typing what I want and hit enter (honestly that&#8217;s my favorite new Vista feature by far).</p>

		<p>Funny, nobody has raised my pet beef. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t want the system mysteriously adding and removing programs at all (or menus for that matter). &nbsp;A lot of my learning is pretty rote when it comes to where things are and how to do things. &nbsp;I find it very annoying to have something that worked last week suddenly disappear and be nowhere to be found. &nbsp;While I can see the features guys sitting around thinking this is going to be cool, I cannot believe that the usability labs found users that liked the system hiding things on them.</p>

		<p>Brian, first of all, I think that a lot of users like their system to work automagically &#8211; as long as the start menu shows the few programs they use, they will be happy (I would guess many users use pre-installed desktop icons exclusively, but what do I know).</p>
<p>And if you don&#8217;t like the way the Start Menu works, you can switch to the &quot;Classic&quot; Menu somewhere in its options.</p>
<p>But the fact that Windows has this thing pre-enabled most likely shows that usability tests have shown that people like it; otherwise it wouldn&#8217;t be enabled&#8230; the user Interface designers aren&#8217;t dumb after all.</p>

		<p>Well, one thing at least that&#8217;s &quot;good&quot; about software patents. &nbsp;You say that this technique is still patent-pending? &nbsp;If it&#8217;s granted, that guarantees it&#8217;s documented, for anyone that wants to game the system.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  The details of the method by which the programs on the Start menu are selected are still patent-pending
</p></blockquote>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t this mean that the patent has already been submitted? According to my somewhat limited understanding of patents, don&#8217;t you have a year <em>after</em> publishing to submit the patent?</p>

		<p>BTW, I really hope that the people being jerks in the comments don&#8217;t cause a total end to your blogging. It&#8217;s good stuff. I do have to say that the &quot;nitpicker&#8217;s corner&quot; and &quot;pre-emptive snarky comments&quot; do make me smile. It&#8217;s a rare type that can pre-emptively nitpick their own stuff.</p>
<p>Anyhow, thanks, and if the commenters get you down remember you can always disable comments&#8230; :-)</p>

		<p>I realize that you will be continuing this series, but figured I&#8217;d throw out a couple things I&#8217;ve noticed:</p>
<p>&#8211; The Start Menu does seem to keep track of programs run via other methods than clicking an item in the menu. After about a week of using a fresh install of XP, my frequently-used list always has CMD and Notepad right at the top. The only way I ever run Notepad is via the Run box, and CMD is usually launched the same way, or via a custom shell context menu item I add to Folders.</p>
<p>&#8211; In addition to the Run box, I see one specific MMC snap-in that floats to the top after a while (Diskeeper). Since I nearly never run this snap-in, my only thought is that it gets counted when I run the Manage MMC snap-in because it&#8217;s included in the &#8220;pre-loaded&#8221; snapins.</p>
<p>&#8211; One question/annoyance I&#8217;ve noticed is with CMD. &nbsp;Somehow, after a couple weeks, &#8220;Command Prompt&#8221; (the generic cmd.exe program) gets replaced with the &#8220;Visual Studio Build Environment&#8221; (not exact wording) version of the command prompt.</p>
<p>In any case, I do look forward to this series because the way programs get chosen seems to be nearly random once you get past the top 10-15 or so. &nbsp;Sometimes it cracks me up when the &#8220;Tour of Windows XP&#8221; program shows up after I click &#8220;Remove this item from the list&#8221; a few times. (Speaking of that, and I assume it&#8217;s one of the things you&#8217;ll address: what effect does the &#8216;remove from the list&#8217; option have beyond removing the item? Does it simply reset the point counter, or something similar?)</p>
<p>This kind of stuff is one of the biggest reasons I read your blog. &nbsp;Even if the more vocal people nitpick and complain, I hope you know that there are lots of us who don&#8217;t comment often that really enjoy reading these entries.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d just like to take the opportunity to mention how much I enjoy entries like this:</p>
<p>While I also develop software professionally, my software is for individual customers or a rather small circle of users (I think, my most used program is used by about 20000 people). Entries like this make me realize the huge non-technical difficulties that influence the design of Microsoft (and all really widely used) software that I don&#8217;t have to worry about.</p>
<p>So, instead of just cursing about some stupid (Microsoft or other) program, I try to think what the reasons behind some (in my opinion) idiotic design were. Sometimes I even succeed.</p>

		<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t want the system mysteriously adding and removing programs at all (or menus for that matter)&quot;</p>
<p>Hear, hear! Here&#8217;s the analogy I use to rationalize this: what if, some day, your house is on fire, and you discover that someone moved your fire hose away from its easily reached position &quot;because you were never using it&quot;. I still think energy should be spent on making it easier for mere users to adjust their start menu to their likings than on attempting to automate that need away.</p>
<p>&quot;The average user probably uses Email and Internet (both pinned by default) together with Word or Excel and maybe 3 other apps. For these people the front page of the Start Menu really does always list all of their most frequently used apps, and they pretty much never see apps popping on and off.&quot;</p>
<p>So, what does such a user do when an app disappears? Can he solve that problem, or does he need help? Quite possibly, he will think that &quot;Excel stopped working&quot; on his PC and give up using it.</p>

		<p>I always found the way this feature works kind of disappointing for this reason: notepad is always at the top of my list. Always. But I NEVER Open Notepad from the Start menu. I use it only by clicking on text files, doing right-click open-with, etc.</p>

		<p>Another series of interesting posts Raymond! Most of your readers are not typical Windows users, that is obvious. For a subject like this it could be enough to explain why it was designed in a certain way etc, not explaining how it works. But since atypical Window users, there will be questions.</p>
<p>Only writing to tell that Tweak UI can be used to exclude applications from the Most Frequently Used Programs section of the Start menu (check boxes for allowing to appear). The menu list will only include shortcuts for executeable files (.exe), but the registry also holds some exceptions.</p>
<p>Tweak UI &gt; Taskbar and Start menu &gt; Start menu. Yep, you can remove &quot;Tour Windows XP&quot;/tourstart.exe if you like from this list. I have not done so. And I have never seen it come back after a right-click and remove this item.</p>
<p>And I do think an average user can find their spreadsheet app, if it somehove is lost from the list. (Speaking of things that changes: Office menus at default setting not showing whole menu, is much worse.)</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  &gt; Here&#8217;s the analogy I use to rationalize this: what if, some day, your house is on fire, and you discover that someone moved your fire hose away from its easily reached position &quot;because you were never using it&quot;. &lt;&lt;

<p>Actually &#8211; that&#8217;s probably the unfortunate state of the fire extinguishers at my house. &nbsp;I&#8217;ll have to go home tonight and make sure they&#8217;re all where I expect they are (and still have some sort of good charge indication)&#8230;</p>
<p>That said, I sure don&#8217;t consider finding the launch icon for an application quite as urgent as I&#8217;d consider finding some way to put out a fire!</p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>Good try. You have an asterisk and two daggers. However, the order is wrong. The asterisk needs to be first. This is followed by the single dagger. And last is the double dagger. Keep trying.</p>

		<p>There are three major usage patterns I have encountered so far:</p>
<ul>
<li>Users which never ever click on Start Menu, those who put all their shortcuts on the desktop which then looks like a mess. There is a refined version of this &#8212; quicklaunch toolbar full of icons instead of desktop but it is all the same, Start Menu is not used at all.</li>
<li>
<p>Users which arrange and sort their Start Menu so pedantically that they even rename shortcuts and classify them into categories (guilty)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Users who do most of their stuff by opening documents which launch the applications and only rarely use Start Menu to launch programs which do not work with documents like calculator or command prompt.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Counting all program starts therefore cannot give good indication about application usage pattern because those clicking on txt files will have Notepad in the top of the list while they might prefer some totally different program. IMO, those &quot;passive&quot; starts through document association should not be counted.</p>

		<p>One thing people seem to forget is that the people that read Raymond&#8217;s blog are in no way close to being &quot;normal&quot; Windows users. All of the people talking about having things popping on and off the bottom of the list, or pinning 16 items to the Menu are atypical.</p>
<p>Working in support I see a *lot* of different people&#8217;s Start Menus, and I can honestly count on one hand the number of people outside the IT department who have more than 4 or 5 programs on the front page. The average user probably uses Email and Internet (both pinned by default) together with Word or Excel and maybe 3 other apps. For these people the front page of the Start Menu really does always list all of their most frequently used apps, and they pretty much never see apps popping on and off.</p>

		<p>These are the post I enjoy most Raymond, they &nbsp;give insight into things otherwise not encountered by many of us. Now instead of saying &#8216;I don&#8217;t understand how to could have been so stupid to do such-and-such&#8217; I can start telling people why you did it, and that the reasons were good (or sometimes not, but the point is, these posts change my mind about what decisions are &quot;dumb&quot; and which ones are &quot;clever&quot;.).</p>

		<p>+1 for Nick about Visual Studio.</p>
<p>How does the Start Menu decide to use the &#8220;Visual Studio 2005 x64 Cross Tools Command Prompt&#8221; instead of the simple Command Prompt link, especially since I always use the &#8220;run&#8221; box ?</p>
<p>Is it because it&#8217;s the last of the list ?</p>
<p>What &#8220;last&#8221; is it ? (order in the menu? path alphabetic order ? title alphabetic order ?)</p>

		<p>A reflection on the Start Menu front page list:</p>
<p>Why not have an &#8216;X most popular&#8217; list in no order, the emphasis being once an app&#8217;s on there, it never moves unless it becomes unpopular (and the next app takes its place)? If you keep using it, it&#8217;ll be in the same place every time instead of moving around after a few days of using some other application.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>&#8220;Microsoft&#8217;s program X gets position 2, but the competitor&#8217;s program Y gets position 3, and the positions never switch no matter how much you use program Y. Clearly anti-competitive behavior.&#8221; -Raymond</i>]</div>
<p>&#8220;- Users which arrange and sort their Start Menu so pedantically that they even rename shortcuts and classify them into categories (guilty)&#8221;</p>
<p>I was guilty of that recently after my Start Menu fell into the fourth, 20-pixel-wide column. It&#8217;s a pity Windows doesn&#8217;t have a menu like GNOME/KDE already in categories, if only for if you uninstall something you&#8217;ve categorised yourself.</p>

		<p>Such auto-learning behaviour tends to suffer from what I could call &quot;learning the wrong thing&quot;. Like the auto-learning on the text input of some cell phones, which not only fails to learn the correct word after you have typed it several times, but also somehow learns the typo version of the word which you have typed only once.</p>
<p>The Start Menu version of this would be it failing to learn what you want it to learn, and learning something which is of no use (how come the Cygwin command prompt, which I use all the time, is not on the list, while a program I only ever open by double-clicking on a document is on it?). It could even lead to embarrasing results, if it shows some program you want to deliberately keep your use of hidden.</p>

<p>Or even simply picks up some program that you run, but don&#8217;t want to be able to get to easily. Like games, which I find myself wasting too much time on, and right-click-remove-from-start-menu-ing all the time. But then, before long, the mood hits me and I run them again, and they come back on it again. Sigh.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  OT: How do you type a dagger? Or a double-dagger?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Character Map is your friend :-) If you do it often enough, you could probably learn the Alt+nnn shortcut too&#8230;</p>
<p>Alternatively, the &amp;dagger; and &amp;Dagger; HTML code works (not for us writing comments, though &#8212; we don&#8217;t get HTML&#8230;)</p>

<p>Ok, and that&#8217;s a fair reason. Just the anti-competitive angle seemed a bit much (but I suppose not too much of a stretch for some angry lawyer).</p>

<p>This is how I use the Vista start menu; I pin things I use most, and almost never use &#8216;all programs&#8217;.</p>
