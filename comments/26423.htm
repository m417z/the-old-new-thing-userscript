		<p>(Please ignore if this will be written about later in your series!)</p>
<p>Will a &quot;pinned program&quot; still get points, so if you unpin it &amp; you&#8217;ve used it a lot it should then show up in the &quot;frequently used list&quot;?</p>
<p>I just tried this, by removing my pinned shortcut to cmd.exe. After it was unpinned it did not show up in the &quot;frequently used list&quot;. Is this by-design, a design-glitch, or&#8230;?</p>

		<p>Correct me if I&#8217;m wrong &#8211; the &quot;Unpin from Start menu&quot; command won&#8217;t change the number of &#8216;points&#8217; that shortcut has accumulated, but &quot;Remove from This List&quot; does.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve noticed you can pin/unpin programs in the frequently used list and they just jump back to where they were, so that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m assuming this.</p>

		<p>Ops.. I see that my experiment was flawed. I chose &quot;Remove from this list&quot; instead of &quot;Unpin&quot; :/. Was &nbsp;actually looking for &quot;Unpin&quot;, but didn&#8217;t see it first.</p>
<p>Perhaps you could do something to the context-menu so the &quot;Start menu management menu items&quot;(i.e., Remove/Unpin items) are placed for instance at the bottom of the list for easy access? Quite difficult currently since it&#8217;s just somewhere in the middle between the rest of the stuff from extensions++.</p>

<p>if you remove it from your pinned list IMHO it should not show up in the frequently used list. You are probably done with the program and it should re-earn its place in The List. Althought that would have been the behaviour I would expect from the remove from list function also.</p>

		<p>Would having un-pin and remove both take away the program&#8217;s points be elephant-compliant?</p>

		<p>On my home machine (running XP), Excel shows up in the pinned list and the frequently used list. &nbsp;I tried removing the one from the frequently used list, and it it removed both shortcuts. &nbsp;I then re-added it to the pin list, and it only showed up in the pin list for a while. &nbsp;Recently it has appeared in the frequently used list again. &nbsp;Is this a bug? &nbsp;Can you think of any circumstances where this would happen? &nbsp;I usually launch Excel either by opening a shortcut to a specific spreadsheet or by choosing the Excel shortcut from the start menu.</p>

		<p>Maybe you&#8217;ll touch on this later, but I had a particular annoyance with the frequently-used programs list.</p>
<p>I had a program that I updated by running the latest installer (once or twice). &nbsp;Each time I ran the installer I would delete the shortcut it placed on the desktop (and get the dialog &#8216;Uninstall this if you want to get rid of the program&#8230;&#8217;).</p>
<p>The last time I did this, the program, that I use frequently, was taken off the frequently-used programs list. &nbsp;And no matter what I do it won&#8217;t come back. &nbsp;I always wondered if the program was &#8216;punished&#8217; because I deleted the desktop shortcut.</p>

		<p>&quot;I then re-added it to the pin list, and it only showed up in the pin list for a while.&quot;</p>
<p>That part sounds like a bug. &nbsp;Everything I&#8217;ve ever added to the pin list has never gone away on any of my PCs in the years I&#8217;ve been using it. &nbsp;You&#8217;re sure you&#8217;re really pinning it right (by right-clicking on the shortcut and selecting &quot;Pin to Start menu&quot;).</p>

		<p>J, you need to include the next sentence too, where it says that it then started showing up in the MRU too.</p>

		<p>I wonder if the two icons refer to different programs? &nbsp;My shortcut for Excel doesn&#8217;t actually say c:Program filesetc, but &quot;Microsoft Office Professional Edition 2003&quot; in the Target box.</p>

		<p>Rick C: Those are special icky MSI shortcuts probably (They often point to some weird exe inside %windir%installer%guid%, and is related to the &quot;installer later&quot; features of Office)</p>

		<p>And of course&#8230; Windows Installer won&#8217;t show in the list of a freshly install system, where and when I suspect the installer would be the &quot;most frequently used application&quot; at the time.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of pointless to show it there too. :P</p>

		<p>The same happens to me for Microsoft Word. It appears both on my pin list and the frequently used list.</p>

		<p>As pointed out above, this seems to be because the Office applications use a different means of starting up.</p>
<p>Same goes for WMP, Outlook and IE I think, because whenever you update those you get a new quicklaunch icon, even if you had an icon pointing to the exe already.</p>

		<p>&quot;icky MSI shortcuts&quot; (great description!) can be disabled by setting DISABLEADVTSHORTCUTS=1 during app installation.</p>
<p>For normal MSIs, that would be &quot;msiexec.exe /i app.msi DISABLEADVTSHORTCUTS=1&quot;. Never tried it on Office though.</p>
<p>BTW, %windir%installer%ProductId%name.exe are dummy EXEs that only include icons.</p>
<p>Personally, I never cared much for this list. I like the XP-style menu mostly for its always-there &quot;My Computer&quot;, &quot;My Documents&quot;, etc. I prefer going to someone&#8217;s computer and finding them there, instead of looking for them among the other 50 desktop shortcuts.</p>
<p>I do like the Vista instant-search thing much more &#8211; finally one can type &quot;word&quot; and get Word!</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m still getting used to vista&#8217;s start menu &#8211; it sems a backwards step, but maybe I&#8217;m not using it &#8216;properly&#8217;. Maybe its because I don&#8217;t want to type anything in there &#8211; I want to remember its location in the menu so I know where it is. Vista makes me search for it.</p>
<p>So Raymond &#8211; at the end of this suite of articles can we have an explanation of how and why Vista does things with its start menu please.</p>

		<p>&quot;If a program is pinned, then it is removed from consideration as a frequently-used program.&quot;</p>
<p>This was a fantastic move, indeed.</p>
