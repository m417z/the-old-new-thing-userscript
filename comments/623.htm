		<p>Why does MS not document the system metrics used by classic/pre-uxtheme windows and common controls? <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070301202835/http://shellrevealed.com/photos/blog_images/images/4538/original.aspx">web.archive.org/&#8230;/original.aspx</a> is really useful and I wish all of this was actually documented.</p>

		<p>@skSdnW: The size of those metrics can vary depending on the DPI settings (otherwise known as &quot;adjust this ruler on your screen control&quot;) or if you adjusted the size of the various elements in the Appearances control panel.</p>

		<p>They can vary, but knowing when to use which metric is indeed very useful. For example when custom drawing a column in a listview, its not always straightforward to figure out the various alignment issues, and when to use which value.</p>

		<p>@MNGoldenEagle: When visual styles are off GetSystemMetrics and SystemParametersInfo are then only things you have to work with and knowing which SM_ values are used where would be useful. Some controls hardcode a pixel value in some places (ListView? Menu?) but most of the time there should be a metric you can use&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#39;m surprised you can QueryInterface an IAccessible into an IEnumVARIANT: IEnumXxxxx are one-time used objects; that would mean the IAccessible&#39;s children can only be enumerated once&#8230;</p>

		<p>It could be creating a subobject and returning it when handling the QI. As long as QIing the IEnumVARIANT to IUnknown returns the same IUnknown pointer as QIing the base object to IUnknown it should be legal COM. This just means going from the IEnumVariant -&gt; IUnknown -&gt;IEnumVariant would reset the enumeration.</p>

		<p>@Joker_vD: Isn&#39;t that what IServiceProvider does? The services it provides don&#39;t have to implement QueryService&#8230;</p>

		<p>Yeah, that&#39;s an exciting quirk of COM: while it stands for *Component* Object Model, you actually don&#39;t get to see any components! You only see interfaces that you cast one to another, which causes many interesting things to the components behind the scenes. Really, why couldn&#39;t we have actual components with QI to dispense interfaces? Then interfaces themselves wouldn&#39;t have QI, and I bet that would simplify aggregation tremendously.</p>

		<p>@SI, It&#39;s barely legal COM, if at all.</p>
<p>If the QueryInterface for IEnumVARIANT returns the same enumerator but resetting it before, then QI is having completely undesired and unreliable side effects, most probably not observable across apartments due to interface pointer caching.</p>
<p>If, on the other hand, it returns a new kind-of-aggregatee enumerator (remember, QI for IUnknown must return the same pointer), given CComQIPtr&lt;IEnumVARIANT&gt; spenum1(spacc) and CComQIPtr&lt;IEnumVARIANT&gt; spenum2(spacc), the calls to spenum1-&gt;Next will not affect the calls to spenum2-&gt;Next, so it becomes apparent you&#39;re violating identity.</p>
<p>Either way, you should always call Clone on such QI&#39;ed IEnumVARIANT, which should provide a fresh, non-aggregated and single-identity enumerator.</p>
<p>Unless, Of Course™, in this instance, Clone itself misbehaves, such as simply resetting the current enumerator and returning it (or one that shares state), because it was most likely implemented by teh the same m̶o̶r̶o̶n̶ person that miscoded QueryInterface.</p>
<p>@Joker_vD, I can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re being serious. &nbsp;QueryInterface is so essential in IUnknown that, without it, COM wouldn&#39;t even get to first base, much less being likened to love.</p>
<p>For instance, what good would an IUnknown pointer be, by itself, without QueryInterface? &nbsp;Or pick your favorite widespread used interface and ask the same question.</p>
<p>Objects would implement an ubiquitous casting interface e.g. IDynamicCast, you&#39;d reduce IUnknown or have a separate interface for reference count e.g. IReferenceCount, and you&#39;d have to decide when it was interesting to pass IDynamicCast or one of its descendants.</p>
<p>You can easily reach the conclusion that IDynamicCast is way (WWAAYY) more interesting, because you can get IReferenceCount, or anything at all from it.</p>
<p>But you&#39;ll soon find it hard to properly maintain an object&#39;s lifetime. &nbsp;If there was a rule stating that casting doesn&#39;t automatically increment the count, you&#39;d have a serious Release race condition on the client. &nbsp;If there was a rule stating that casting to IReferenceCount doesn&#39;t increase the count, it would make only pointer to this interface, but such an important one, subject to the Release race condition. &nbsp;If casting would always increase the count, how would to keep the count of casts you&#39;ve made? &nbsp;Also, how would you allow interfaces to be actual inner instances (e.g. tear-offs) or an aggregatee?</p>
<p>So, you easily reach the conclusion that every interface pointer must have lifetime management. &nbsp;Seems like IUnknown.</p>
<p>@Medinoc, the closest is actually IObjectProvider-&gt;QueryObject, because IServiceProvider-&gt;QueryService may delegate to a chain or hierarchy of objects. &nbsp;But only IUnknown-&gt;QueryInterface requires and guarantees a set of properties, such as object identity, essential to even the most basic purposes.</p>
