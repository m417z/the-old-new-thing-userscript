		<p>Updating extremely often is bad, but the reasons before it are nothing but excuses. There is benefit in showing stuff even if you can&#39;t technically read any single name. When you have lots of files flying by, you can easily make out a pattern and see the parts that are changing. In other words, you see progress. But I know Microsoft has a dumb decision quota to balance out the good they do. At least 7 gives the option back.</p>

		<p>Why not update the file name every 5 seconds to the file that is being copied at that time? &nbsp;This would hardly kill the performance, and would give you a clue of what is being copied if you&#39;re copying a bunch of rather big files from just one directory.</p>

		<p>I like the rapidly-changing filenames. It gives me a feeling that the computer is working, as opposed to being stuck. However, the Windows 7 design sounds right to me &#8211; &quot;normal&quot; people who are afraid of computers get their stability, slow remote desktop users can still live, and I get to make one more click to see action.</p>

		<p>As someone who prefers to see what is going on, I am wondering why the obvious solution (updating the name of the file being copied only every five seconds or so) hasn&#39;t been chosen.</p>
<p>Regarding the new blog system, I&#39;ll need to get used to having a link to the comments only at the top of the blog, and to entering comments at the top of earlier comments.</p>
<p>Some older issues:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The Microsoft Translator applet (I believe) blocks IE6 for a several seconds while the page is being loaded.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Amazon Book link may allow third parties to collect blog usage statistics.</p>
</li>
</ul>

		<p>The silliest of reasons are being given on this blog for removed features. Long-standing features that users actually depended on for years. Also why does this completely eliminate the possibility that the user could be copying several huge files each of whose file names can be easily read for 15 seconds? As pointed out in the comments, there can be several benefits to displaying the file name.</p>

		<p>While Windows 7 file copy is significantly better now than Vista&#39;s, it&#39;s not completely out of the woods yet. For example, if you do disk-to-disk copy of sevaral large files at once, it will run multiple copy threads. So, instead of nice linear reads/writes it will continuously jump between files.</p>
<p>Also, if you copy a large file from a fast (disk) to a slow (USB flash) device, it would post the whole file to the cache, and then you&#39;ll have to wait for it to finish. This is not the problem, though; the problem is that you&#39;re not able to cancel it in the meantime (which could be a minute or so).</p>

		<p>It&#39;s pointless to argue the merits of different approaches here, as I&#39;m sure Microsoft had many people smarter and more informed (as well as dumber, but still more informed) debating the design.</p>
<p>Personally, though, in situations like this, I generally update the UI every N milliseconds. &nbsp;This way I give feedback without bogging down the process with GDI interactions. &nbsp;I would probably start out at 1/10th second, or 1/4 second and see how it goes.</p>

		<p>Microsoft isn&#39;t very informed. They somehow missed the minor fact that just about everybody didn&#39;t realize at first that they loaded a million things into the MSO2007 orb menu. And that many people hate the ribbon in general. I&#39;d love to see their usability study that totally missed the mark.</p>

		<p>@Matteo Italia:</p>
<p>It makes sense to have read-ahead buffer of reasonable size (1 to 4 MB should be OK) with file queue. And a write queue that span several files. And also open a number of files in a bunch. That will make the copy of many small files very effective.</p>

		<p>@Gabest: Yeah, the .lnk extension is magical and gets hidden even if all other extensions are shown. &nbsp;(.pif does the same thing.) &nbsp;It&#39;s usually a good thing, because usually when you have extensions shown you still don&#39;t care that a particular file is a shortcut (and before you disagree: think what it&#39;d look like if Every.Single.Application on the Start Menu appeared as &quot;Application Name.lnk&quot;).</p>
<p>You can rename it back using the command prompt. &nbsp;Arguably, since it does treat .lnk and .pif specially, Explorer shouldn&#39;t let you rename files to use those extensions in the first place, since you can&#39;t reverse it from within Explorer itself.</p>

		<p>Thanks Raymond!</p>
<p>I was asking myself this question just yesterday becauseI was copying a large amount of files and not seeing the filenames gave me the impression it was going slow&#8230;</p>
<p>Seeing the filenames give an idea on the progress and where it&#39;s copying.</p>
<p>Windows 7 is how it should have been done in Vista but I&#39;m glad they put&#39; it back in 7.</p>
<p>And in general I am happy with Vista and think a lot of reactions are just a cheap shot to bash Microsoft that can never do things right even if it&#39;s the best solution on the market. Probably Windows 8 will be an excuse to bash again.</p>

		<p>@NickA: it was not an impression of slowness Nick. Sadly the file copy from a Vista machine is exteremely slow (not to mention the time it spends checking the size of the stuff you are copying). Copying the same number of files from, for example, a windows 2003 machine goes about 3 times as fast in my office setup. It&#39;s one of very few things I&#39;m sad about in Vista.</p>

		<p>[ On Chinese systems, for example, the file whose name is Calculator.lnk is displayed to the user as 計算器. ]</p>
<p>This is somewhat bothersome with the shell folders (Program Files, Users etc.) &#8211; I&#39;ve seen several confused users because Explorer shows one thing, but when you try to access those directories, you have to use the English name. I&#39;ve also had complaints both when a directory picker showed localised names, but the input box above the actual name, and when the directory picker showed actual names&#8230; IMHO, on non-Ultimate SKU, the directory names should be localised, since you can&#39;t (legally) change the operating system language anyway.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Localizing the file system name has its own problems, primarily in test burden. There are now two ways to get a system with French UI, either with French file names or with English file names. And what if the user upgrades to Ultimate? Now you have N^2 test cases. (French file names upgraded to Ultimate + German UI, etc.) And then there are preinstalled non-Ultimate systems that let you pick your language at first boot. But the files have already been created with their file system names (say, French since the computer manufacturer is French). Say the user chooses German. You now have French file names without a French UI! All the options suck. You just have to pick one that sucks less. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>WRT using Explorer for complex activities&#8230; I&#39;ve always thought of Explorer is a program aimed at the day-to-day activities of normal users &#8211; not the specialised needs of developers, power users or sys admins.</p>
<p>If you aren&#39;t knowledgable enougn to be able to use an alternate file manager or the command line, then you aren&#39;t knowledgeable enough to be doing things that Explorer won&#39;t let you do. Adding the &#39;.lnk&#39; extension does seem like something that Explorer shouldn&#39;t allow though, seeing as it doesn&#39;t allow them to be removed.</p>

		<p>Okay, with filesnames. Some people do complain that you shouldn&#39;t hide extensions, because then some not-so-savvy computer users might be misled by phishers and social engineers into doing Bad Things(tm).</p>
<p>What&#39;s wrong with viewing files arranged by file extension / file type? Windows knows, even if it doesn&#39;t show it to you, and something that&#39;s supposed to be a .TXT showing up amongst the .EXEs should ring very loud bells. Besides, if I&#39;ve hidden file extensions, and suddenly *one* file shows up with an extension, that too should ring some alarm bells.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a context menu extension that shows what extension a file has, and allows you to rename the extension. Probably more than one out there, actually. Can&#39;t remember what the one I use is called, though.</p>

<p>Windows 7, with the useful details hidden behind a simple button, is adequate. &nbsp;The Vista version was inadequate. &nbsp;What&#39;s more, it was immediately and obviously inadequate. &nbsp;No excuses, just blatantly poor design choices.</p>

		<p>I brought a robust Dell laptop in 2004 with WinXP and kept it going with the maintenance I have learned over 25 years in the computer field, until I went on vacation in 2009, returned home, powered up my laptop and it died. &nbsp;It must have missed me. &nbsp;Anyway, I purchased a HP laptop running Vista and found the O/S acceptable, but I made some changes for the system to suit my needs. &nbsp;Early this year I upgraded my Vista to Win7. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That copy feature, showing files, is something I&#39;ve always liked. &nbsp;Yes, some of it flows by quickly, but to tell me, it is (or was) for my own good, sounds like Microsoft is in bed with the governments that want to tell me what I am going to do over what I want to do. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It is all about options. &nbsp;There is no one set way to perform something in Windows (or Mac) and I would like to keep it that way. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It has always irked me when a handful of people get together, create something user communities like only to have a later &#39;committee&#39; make &#39;enhanced&#39; changes, telling me this is for my own good. &nbsp;Yes, give newer features, but retain &#39;options&#39; to have it &#39;your way&#39;. &nbsp;Some may like seeing the files fly pass while being copied, others may like not viewing files being copied. &nbsp;This feature has been enhanced when both options are in place, this feature is not enhanced when the option has been changed, period. &nbsp;</p>
<p>MS really removed the feature and then gave it back with options. &nbsp;This tells me someone screwed up and a sizable group complained about it.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t need Bob to tell me what to do, make decisions for me or make changes for me, in the doublespeak that I will like it. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>There is a better way of handling this. &nbsp;To display the current file being copied, but only update the screen every half second or so. &nbsp;This keeps the file name readable and does not slow the system by displaying too much. &nbsp;This method may miss out lots of file names but it gives you an indication of how far things have gone.</p>
<p>We use this method in AJC Sync, see:</p>

		<p>WRT &quot;show file names, but update only each (N) seconds&quot;: This works, but may create the impression that it&#39;s skiping some files. I prefer the file names flying by, but I&#39;m not a typical user.</p>

<p>Less code, less functionalities, more faster will be the execution.</p>

		<p>one thing i don&#39;t &nbsp;understand. yes updating to the screen slows down the program. but how can this be the case</p>
<p>here when obiously the copy rate and copy completion precent are updated to the screen constantly?</p>
<p>and &quot;updates too fast&quot;? as suggested incremental updating whould fix that.</p>
<p>it seems the programer simply got lazy &nbsp;in implementing this feature or even tried to implement it but left it so</p>
<p>he won&#39;t have to attened to fixing it.(probably left it to work on another resource hoging, redundent feature for vista)</p>
<p>too bad.</p>

		<p>Dear John Smith, Simón, Balaji, Drak,</p>
<p>Please take this comment in the spirit in which it is intended. You are all idiots. If you thought about the problem for two seconds, read any of the linked articles, or (in your case Balaji!) bothered to look at Raymond&#39;s response; you would see that there are rational logical minds behind these decisions. You may not agree with the decision that was ultimately taken, but the general attitude that &quot;the programer simply got lazy&quot; is a rude, unhelpful, and ultimately wrong take on the issue at hand. Your comments add nothing to the discussion, and are likely to discourage Raymond from posting any of this interesting information in the future.</p>
