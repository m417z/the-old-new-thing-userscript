		<p>I&#8217;m used to not understanding the programming articles here, but apparently I&#8217;m such a dim bulb I don&#8217;t understand the humor either. Why is this worthy of a chuckle?</p>
<div class=post>[<i>A bicycle falling onto its side is a totally insignificant event (indeed most of them start the ferry ride on their side already). It&#8217;s like saying, &#8220;Your attention please: There is car on deck B with a map that has not been folded up properly.&#8221; It&#8217;s funny because the initial wording of the announcement suggests that something dire has happened, but when you get to the end, you realize it&#8217;s something insignificant. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I would say I have at least 50/50 shot of somewhat understanding the programming articles (caring is a different matter; I don&#8217;t do Windows programming right now), but I also didn&#8217;t get it until Raymond was kind enough to explain.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m too used to having a kickstand, and thinking of it as vital equipment or something like that. ;-)</p>

		<p>Maybe the bike hit someone&#8217;s car, and scratched some paint.</p>

		<p>It is a lot funnier if you put yourself in the perspective of the guy looking over the deck, some standing up but probably most casually strewn about lying whichever way; and then making the announcement. &nbsp;It helps if you like your humor so dry it crumbles to dust in your fingers. &nbsp;It also helps if you think having to explain such a joke is even funnier.</p>

		<p>I must admit, after visualizing an entire parking deck cluttered with bicycles, the majority of them laying on their sides&#8230; it is worthy of a chuckle :D</p>

		<p>How was the ride? My wife and I had planned to go this year but they were calling for pretty bad weather and we were not relishing the thought of those hills in the rain. :) Turned out to be a simply fantastic day! At least we got a 7 mile run in&#8230; but we&#8217;re still regretting not attending.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>It was a fine ride, thanks for asking. I assess each Chilly Hilly as a win/lose/draw. My goal was to fight Chilly Hilly to a draw, but I beat it this year. (I measure success by how well I fare on the last few hills.) My record is now 2 wins, 1 loss. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Wow. I never realised programmers were so humourless :/</p>

		<p>I enjoy commuting on this ferry daily. &nbsp;Most of the announcements are either safety related or asking people to turn off their car alarms in their sensitive cars. &nbsp;They are mostly humorless and functional.</p>
<p>We do get the occasional announcements of about Orca whales, boomer submarines on their way into Bremerton, lunar eclipses, or funerals as people’s ashes are sent on their way. &nbsp;It’s all pretty relaxed.</p>
<p>A few years back, I finally got my wife to ride on my motorcycle that I commute on, so we went to the grocery store in downtown Bainbridge Island. &nbsp;I parked my bike with the kick stand (side stand) and went inside. &nbsp;A few minutes later there was an announcement for the owner of the motorcycle to please return to it. &nbsp;It turns out we had a “little” earthquake and the bike fell over onto a leased BMW. &nbsp;As it turns out, there was no harm done, but my wife took this as a omen and hasn’t ridden on it since.</p>
