		<p>The first thing I thought of when I read the title was the &quot;report&quot; that 60% of the code in Windows Vista was going to be rewritten. &nbsp;The next thing I thought of was the perception that Windows 7 is just a fixup of Windows Vista.</p>

		<p>Or more simply, immediate mode operands aren&#8217;t code, they&#8217;re data (albeit inside the text segment which is marked executable).</p>
<p>As a related aside, if/when this data is interpreted as code (i.e. instruction pointer is mid-instruction) bad things happen. &nbsp;Unless some hacker over-enthused with efficiency and code obfuscation designed it that way.</p>

		<p>&gt; George also made the common mistake not only of calling this Web site a &#8220;document from MSDN&#8221;</p>
<p>Erm, Raymond, in case you haven&#8217;t noticed, the URL of this website is &#8220;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing%22" target=_new rel=nofollow rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://blogs.MSDN.com/oldnewthing" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.MSDN.com/oldnewthing</a>&#8220; and it says &#8220;Welcome to MSDN Blogs&#8221; at the top of the page. While clearly this blog is not part of the &#8220;MSDN Library&#8221; it is branded as part of MSDN, so calling it a &#8220;document from MSDN&#8221; is not inaccurate.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Then it depends what you mean by &#8220;from MSDN&#8221;. If you mean &#8220;from a Web site that has MSDN in its URL&#8221; then, well, that could be anything. (Besides, the MSDN Web site isn&#8217;t even msdn.com; it&#8217;s msdn.microsoft.com.) I prefer to think of it as meaning &#8220;from a Web site that MSDN has editorial control over.&#8221; Otherwise, you could say that all of social.msdn.microsoft.com is &#8220;from MSDN.&#8221; -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t so much a stupid question as a rather poor assumption that something that is obviously a blog should bear any sort of credibility.</p>
<p>I love Raymond&#8217;s blog. Most of the stuff he posts to it is factual or at least insightful. But it is still a blog. It is not written by a professional doc writer. It is not peer reviewed.</p>
<p>This should be pretty obvious.</p>

		<p>Raymond: &quot;The MSDN folks have nothing to do with running msdn.com.&quot;</p>
<p>Might be. But, how should the average John Doe find out about this? As already mentioned, on the top, there is &quot;Welcome to MSDN Blogs&quot;, and at the bottom, there is &quot;&#169; 2009 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.&quot;</p>
<p>I think you are asking too much from the average user, especially if that one does not read here regularly and only stumbled upon your posting via a $SEARCHENGINE search.</p>

<p>The word &quot;Blogs&quot; should probably tip you off.</p>
<p>Would you cite information on someone&#8217;s MySpace page as some sort of inside information on Fox Interactive Media just because &quot;myspace&quot; appears in the URL and the page is branded with MySpace logos and legal text?</p>

<p>Of course!</p>
<p>Also, on this very page, Microsoft claimed that &quot;people are idiots&quot;. I find that very offensive and would like a formal apology from Microsoft.</p>

		<p>I would say the original poster is not off base in his assumption that everything printed here is &quot;from MSDN&quot;. &nbsp;This blog is part of the Microsoft Developer Network. &nbsp;It is a network (or collection) of resources, which includes Web sites that have documentation and other content. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Why should the OP care who has &quot;editorial control&quot; over some of the content, and which parts are not &quot;editorially controlled&quot; by some group of people that Raymond claims he is not part of? &nbsp;(Yes, I know, you would not be a member of any club that would accept you as a member&#8230;)</p>
<p>I would go so far as to claim that Raymond himself is a resource that is part of the network (or collection) of resources that developers use. &nbsp;Hence, Raymond is part of MSDN! &nbsp;:-)</p>

		<p>Of course no-one is going to think that any/all content on MySpace comes from Fox, because most people know that MySpace is just a medium through which any number of people communicate with the world.</p>
<p>Similarly, in the tech world, most people know that MSDN is (ostensibly) a Microsoft community.</p>
<p>The site is branded &quot;MSDN&quot;. &nbsp;It is copyright &quot;Microsoft&quot;. &nbsp;The &quot;Terms of Use&quot;, &quot;Trademarks&quot; and &quot;Privacy Statement&quot; links ALL refer visitors to OFFICIAL Microsoft pages (Terms of Use referring specifically to the actual, Microsoft MSDN &quot;Terms of Use&quot;).</p>
<p>It really is NOT surprising that someone might think that this blog is an MSDN product, directly or indirectly.</p>

		<p>Regarding George&#8217;s actual question, he no doubt comes from a background where a Linker is not something that you see everyday. (he could be used to Visual Basic, Delphi, lots of things). So his original problem is completely forgivable.</p>
<p>But where he loses his way is in treating something with &quot;blog&quot; in the URL as official documentation. The MySpace example above is a good one, and saying &quot;Most people know what Myspace is&quot; is not a defense (most people visiting this site know what a blog is).</p>
<p>Saying that, if I was Raymond, I would probably try to get something added somewhere that says &quot;this blog is NOT for beginners!&quot;.</p>

		<p>Since this whole discussion appears to revolve around what you mean by &quot;re-write&quot; (or &quot;MSDN&quot;), perhaps I should insert some confusion over &quot;linker&quot;.</p>
<p>/LTCG anyone?</p>
<p>Raymond&#8217;s comments are perfectly true for a traditional compiler/linker separation of powers, but Microsoft&#8217;s own offering in this area hasn&#8217;t /really/ worked that way for many years. That&#8217;s where George went wrong. He has a mental model of his tools that is a decade or two out of date.</p>
