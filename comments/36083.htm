		<p>There are quite a few companies that do similar things here.</p>
<p>I remember a few years back a shampoo company advertised a new lower price. Well what they didn&#8217;t mention is that they also reduced the size of the bottle to compensate.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve actually seen US furniture companies do something similar. I was shopping for a new kitchen table and found one I liked for one price, but decided to sleep on it. The next day they were having a &quot;sale&quot; in which the sale price was HIGHER than the previous price yet it was &quot;marked down&quot; 20% (They first marked it way up then gave the 20% discount from that price!)</p>
<p>Needless to say I stopped even looking at their stores.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know about Coop, I never buy from them, but ICA&#8230; before the day they were supposed to lower their prices, some of the ICA stores had already lowered on some of the merchandise, which had the effect that some people could show that the marked down price was the same as before the day they were supposed to lower them.<br />
<br />IIRC, there was however other items that got a lower price claim, when they had had that price for far longer already.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time swedish stores do this. Right after christmas when everyone have big sales, there were several cases where they had just taken the old price and put it on a &quot;lower price&quot; sticker. People found out because they had not even bothered to remove the original price sticker, so you could remove the new one and see that the price was the same.</p>

		<p>As an aside to the above, ICA and other chains have recently also REMOVED prices for some packed merchandise, like meat, and only put up a sticker that says the price per kg, and a barcode sticker on the package itself.<br />
<br />They did put up barcode terminals so that you can actually find out what it costs without having to calculate it or ask at the counter.<br />
<br />Either way, it&#8217;s just another thing that wants me to leave this rotting country.</p>

		<p>Even better: the local gas station near me has good prices on milk, the best I&#8217;ve found.  But, they don&#8217;t advertise the price anymore outside the store.  Not only that, they don&#8217;t even tell you what it is *in* the store.  You have to buy it to find out.</p>
<p>You might say &quot;well, just ask the person at the counter&quot;.  Result: vacant teenager stare, with a 20% possibliity of drool, and still no price.<br /></p>

		<p>In other news, don&#8217;t buy a flash MP3 player that has no stopwatch. The stopwatch is an important feature. You think that you don&#8217;t need a stinking stopwatch in your MP3 player? THINK AGAIN!</p>
<p>So why, you ask, would you need a stopwatch on your MP3 player? I admit, I have not the faintest idea. I&#8217;ve got the info from this source of reliable information, along with other invaluable hints on how to chose an MP3 player:</p>
<p><a target="_new" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/devices/flash.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/devices/flash.aspx</a></p>
<p>So, how does all this relate to super market pricing in Sweden? Here&#8217;s the common morale: DON&#8217;T  TRUST  MARKETING.</p>

		<p>Insane Troll, your choice of name fits. ;)</p>
<p>As for the marketing scheme, the same thing happens here in Denmark, must be a scandinavian thing. But then again, Coop also has branches here.</p>

		<p>Scott, that&#8217;s interesting.</p>
<p>Not having prices in the store is illegal where I live:<br />

<p>For the items that they aren&#8217;t required to put price stickers on, they are required to have signs that state the price.</p>

<p>In Australia, we have something called the &quot;Trade Practices Act (1974)&quot;, designed to prevent this kind of behaviour (among others), and impose penalties where it is breached: <a target="_new" href="http://www.consumersonline.gov.au/content/ConsumerRights/TradePracticesAct.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.consumersonline.gov.au/content/ConsumerRights/TradePracticesAct.asp</a></p>

		<p>In England (and possibly but not necessarily throughout the UK) there is a law that requires that the price with which &quot;sale&quot; prices are compared with must have been used for, I think, at least 28 days out of the last 6 months.</p>

		<p>That reminds me of a sale that some clothes store had a couple years back.  The signs were promising :</p>
<p>&quot;Buy any item at twice the regular price, receive any item of equal or lesser value, absolutely free!&quot;</p>
<p>A friend of mine was working there, and she said that you wouldn&#8217;t believe how many people came up and bought a $20 shirt for $40, just so they could get a $15 pair of pants for free.</p>
