		<p>Whatever happens to plain text!?</p>
<p>Plain text, you can skim, but you can&#8217;t skim a video.</p>
<p>Plain text loads faster on slow connections.</p>
<p>Also, I have terrible hearing, so I need subtitles to follow along with a video. &nbsp;Plain text does not need subtitles.</p>

		<p>I think Miff&#8217;s annoyance was more directed to the author than you, Raymond, in which case I agree with him. There is in this case really no benefit to using video and I&#8217;m sure that if it had been a written document, we could have read it (never mind skimming) in under 20 minutes, but the video takes an hour.</p>
<p>Also, I didn&#8217;t think the YouTube version started faster, it took two seconds in both cases.</p>

		<p>Miff: don&#8217;t be helpless. Search for &#8216;&quot;searching for evil&quot; anderson&#8217; found <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rnc1/talks/070814-searching.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rnc1/talks/070814-searching.pdf</a>, the slides for the presentation.</p>

		<p>I think Miff has a point, although this might not be the best example &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure I didn&#8217;t click the link, because I can&#8217;t.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s the part of the point, Where I work they don&#8217;t allow streaming video, it&#8217;s all been blocked &#8211; to many people where doing it, and bandwidth was suffering. SO they did away with it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The other part is I prefer to read because I can scan over the crap and only read what I want. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I never understood pod casts, or blogs on video, or for that matter news on video over the internet. &nbsp; The only place I get my news is on the internet, for one very good reason, I can&#8217;t stand listening to newscasters and waiting for them to get to the story I want to know about.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t care about their agenda, I don&#8217;t care if they want to tease a news story for an hour only to give me 2 minutes of the story at the end of the program which is always incomplete.</p>
<p>And thanks to the internet I don&#8217;t have to care about these idiotic talking heads. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t need someone to interpret the news for me. What I want is the news, on my time, when I want it, and what I want, with the ability to skip over what I don&#8217;t care about and if there isn&#8217;t enough information, I search more on the same story and fill in the blanks.</p>
<p>All this is best and only possible in print.</p>
<p>I dont&#8217; want to be entertained with the news, and there is no need to hear about Michael Jackson for an hour and a half &#8211; unless of course I really want to, but that&#8217;s not news that&#8217;s entertainment. The news part is maybe a couple of minutes.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m alone, or in the minority, but I like my information in print so I can read what I want, re-read it if I want, and skim if I want, and without wearing headphones or subjecting people to what I want to listen to. &nbsp;</p>
<p>okay, I&#8217;m done ranting</p>
<p>thanks : )</p>

		<p>Well&#8230; In this particular case, as far as I can tell, 070814-searching.pdf is much less interesting. Raymond was (of course) right &#8212; for this material watching actually brings more.</p>

		<p>The PDF is good for viewing the bad websites themselves ;-)</p>

		<p>Best line: &quot;You setup a bank. &nbsp;Which is easy nowadays, a bank is just a Perl script.&quot;</p>
