		<blockquote><p>If a user has permission to delete children of a folder, the user can delete files and subfolders in the folder regardless of the permission on the files or subfolders.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now that&#8217;s interesting.</p>
<p>Coming from a Unix background, deleting files you can&#8217;t modify (or even read!) from a directory you can modify makes sense, because you&#8217;re modifying the directory, not the file. Thinking about the problem in the case of multiple hard links to the file clarifies the situation, because deleting one link to a file (or &#8216;unlinking&#8217; it) doesn&#8217;t *necessarily* delete the file, unless it happens to be the last link to the file.</p>
<p>However, the situation is different for subdirectories. If you don&#8217;t have permission to modify a subdirectory, you can&#8217;t make the subdirectory empty. If you can&#8217;t make the subdirectory empty, you can&#8217;t unlink the subdirectory from the current directory, no matter what permissions you have on the current directory.</p>
<p>The requirement that a directory be empty before it can be unlinked is there because it is generally assumed that directories are only linked from a single parent (&#8220;..&#8221; links excepted) and form a DAG &#8211; normal users simply aren&#8217;t allowed to make multiple links to a directory, and the operation may even fail for &#8220;root&#8221; for a number of reasons. And you&#8217;re not allowed to delete a non-empty directory, because then you&#8217;d lose the links to the files within. Unless the operation was automatically recursive, but recursiveness is generally &#8220;not done&#8221; for system calls.</p>

		<p>I think you misinterpreted the statement. It&#8217;s not saying that you have delete permission recursively all the way down. It&#8217;s saying you can remove subfolders of the thing you have DELETE_CHILD permission on. (Those subfolders must first be empty, and emptying the subfolder requires its own permissions.)</p>

		<p>Perhaps a clearer version of the strengthened statement would be &#8220;and <b>empty</b> subfolders.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Ah, yes, that is what I had read into it. My mistake.</p>
<p>(What&#8217;s that? Yes, I have been bitten by not being able to delete a subdirectory, despite having full access to its parent, in the past. How did you guess?)</p>

		<p>Well, hmmm. I discovered that the claim that SMB shares leaked password-equivalents over the wires in 1999, but this was in the days of telnet for my college so nobody cared. What do you know, a security fix for this comes out in 2012 and the lowest OS version to get it is Vista.</p>
<p>It was kind of too bad partly that XP didn&#8217;t get it, but worse in a way. DOS didn&#8217;t get it, and networked DOS was still a thing for image deployment. Having to run an old server version just so the DOS CDs could connect was painful.</p>

		<p>There have been many times when I called in a support issue and later when I read the actual text of the ticket, it wasn&#8217;t even close to what I told the technician.  These were always the most critical problems because we were encouraged to call in instead of using the online ticket system in order to get a faster response.  These days, I put in cases first and then just call to request an escalation.</p>
