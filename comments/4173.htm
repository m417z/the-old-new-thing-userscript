		<p>Much as I love the dieresis in &quot;coöperate&quot;, I feel I should point out that it is archaic and the usual spelling today is &quot;cooperate&quot;.</p>

		<p>I have attached thread input queues cross-process in order to get windows stacked on top of each other cross-process. It seems to me this is nicer then setting topmost. As to whether or not this action should attach thread queues I have no idea.</p>

		<p>@Joker_vD:</p>
<p>Not everyone knows that the second o in cooperative is not pronounced with the first. The dieresis is used to indicate that the vowels are pronounced separately.</p>
<p>But I guess as a native speaker of English, there are some things that you take for granted. Well, I always write it as co-operative.</p>

		<p>3/4 (or 4/5 including this) comments focusing on the dieresis. Looks like Raymond is going to need to add diphthongs to the list of things to avoid!</p>

		<p>I&#39;m looking forward to more in this series.</p>
<p>Lately I&#39;ve been wondering why all sorts of normally well-behaved apps often show a blinking caret when they don&#39;t have the keyboard focus and often aren&#39;t even the active window. &nbsp;It happens far more frequently on Vista and Windows 7 than it did on Windows XP, so I assume it&#39;s a combination of not-quite-right app code and some subtle change in the input model on the newer versions of the OS. &nbsp;I&#39;d love to understand that better and to make sure my applications don&#39;t confuse the user in the same way.</p>

		<p>There is one type of input that a bad program can delay by accident. It is the media keys. I hope that this week will end up explaining how that happened.</p>

		<p>With all the complexities of queues, ordering, attaching queues across threads, sharing windows across processes, do you think that the model is self-consistent? Or are there inherently broken or undefined behaviors that can be triggered by calling the right APIs? Maybe ones that would destabilize the system (crash, create undestroyable windows, leaks, &#8230;).</p>

		<p>@Maurits: &nbsp;I think you&#39;re reading too much into Wiktionary. &nbsp;It says &quot;the dieresis is becoming increasingly rare in US English typography, so the spelling cooperate predominates&quot;. &nbsp;Just because something predominates doesn&#39;t mean that it is preferred. &nbsp;Heck, txt-spk might soon predominate.</p>
<p>Do you ever read The New Yorker magazine? &nbsp;:-)</p>

		<p>Also need to mention: kernel-user callbacks, locks, windows classes and window-associated state, GDI (which seems to be integrated into user32 internally), direct x drawing to window handles, the DWM, messaging windows, hooks, sessions, window stations and desktops, UIPI. What crazy behaviors and bugs can we trigger by combining all of those pairwise? :)</p>

		<p>@xor88:</p>
<p>It is more like User and GDI have some cross dependencies. But User has more dependencies on GDI (an example, BeginPaint, it is a User function, but requires a HDC, which is a GDI structure.)</p>
<p>User and GDI are part of the Win32 Subsystem, so they are implemented in the same location. Up until NT 3.51, they were implemented in csrss.exe afair, and from NT4 they were both moved to Win32k.sys.</p>

		<p>@640K</p>
<p>Are you thinking of Multilingual User Interface or NLS? If so, you have it backwards, the locale is a system/session setting which affects the UI. There is no real cross dependencies between Kernel and User or GDI. The only little hiccup that I can think of is that DuplicateHandle can duplicate desktop handles, but that is about it.</p>
<p>@Joshua:</p>
<p>User should be responsible for allocating its own heap memory, so any fixes to Kernel would have no effect on your problem.</p>

		<p>Do people really order their book collections? </p>
<p>My daughter maybe when she was younger, but half the fun (for me) of having a unorganised book collection is that when I&#39;m looking for a specific book I bump into unexpected books along the way!</p>

		<p>@Adrian, @alegr1: My understanding is that the classic caret API doesn&#39;t interoperate well with the newer drawing systems, such as Windows Presentation Foundation, Direct2D or DirectWrite. WPF has its own CaretElement; I don&#39;t think DirectWrite implements one at all. Visual Studio has been a WPF app since VS2010; Internet Explorer uses DirectWrite rather than GDI from version 9. Office 2013 is now a DirectWrite app and the caret behaviour is reported as being quite strange, often not keeping up with typing even if you have the &#39;smooth caret positioning&#39; option turned off (can&#39;t remember exactly what it&#39;s called).</p>
<p>I do find that often, when entering text on web pages in IE9 or later, the caret either doesn&#39;t appear, doesn&#39;t blink, or doesn&#39;t move correctly. This might be more to do with the &#39;enhanced&#39; edit controls that are often used by web designers, rather than just using a standard multiline input control.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know whether Windows Runtime has more sensible/compatible caret behaviour.</p>

		<p>@Mike Dimmick: &nbsp;Thanks for the insight. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t realize that all the new-fangled drawing schemes re-invented the caret on their own. &nbsp;But I&#39;ve even seen good ol&#39; Notepad blinking a caret when it doesn&#39;t have the focus. &nbsp;Surely Notepad hasn&#39;t been corrupted?!</p>
