		<p>I remember that back when I did some graphics in QB4.5 the fact that almost any SCREEN mode had nonsquare pixel ratios made me quite upset. Fortunately I had a VGA card, so when I found SCREEN 12 I forgot about all the other modes.</p>
<p>Uh, there&#39;s still the KB article&#8230; <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/51858/en" rel="nofollow">support.microsoft.com/&#8230;/en</a> &quot;640 x 480 pixel very high-resolution graphics.&quot;, read today it&#39;s quite funny :)</p>

		<p>If the resolution&#39;s aspect ratio doesn&#39;t match your monitor&#39;s aspect ratio (8:5 for widescreen monitors and 4:3 for standard monitors), then the pixels aren&#39;t square. &nbsp;Much to my annoyance, one of those standard resolutions, 1280&#215;1024, does not have square pixels, as its aspect ratio is 5:4. &nbsp;If you want square pixels, you need 1280&#215;960, which very few cards support. &nbsp;I had one for a while, but that was a long time ago. &nbsp;Fortunately, I then moved up to 1600&#215;1200, which is back to square pixels again, and then 1920&#215;1200 on widescreen monitors. &nbsp;The software that I write allows entering your monitor dimensions so that we can deal with these non-square pixels, so that a circle actually looks round on your screen, and also so that we can make a 6&quot; circle at a scale of 1:1 actually be 6&quot; on your screen.</p>

		<p>“all aspect ratios are given in the form width:height for some reason”</p>
<p>Well, 2D coordinates specify the width first and the height second. It would be kinda silly if the biggest coordinate on a 480&#215;640 display would be addressed as (640,480), wouldn&#39;t it?</p>

		<p>Hexagonal pixels make a lot of sense. If you build a screen with square pixels, you can display horizontal/vertical signals with a 2px wavelength perfectly well (i.e. alternating on/off columns or rows), but the worst case is diagonal signals where the minimum wavelength is sqrt(2)*2px. Rotate a high-frequency signal (e.g. small sharp text) by 45 degrees and it will turn into a blurred mess, because the pixels are 41% larger (lower resolution) in the diagonal direction.</p>
<p>Hexagons have a much smaller difference between their best and worst directions &#8211; I believe they&#39;re optimal among all tiling patterns. So replace the screen&#39;s square pixels with the same number of hexagons, and you get the best possible worst-case resolution. Admittedly it&#39;s less good for straight horizontal and vertical lines, but it&#39;d be great for photographs and for the modern world of rounded corners and GPU effects.</p>
<p>But triangular pixels? That&#39;s just crazy.</p>

		<p>@GregM: Monitors with native 1280&#215;1024 resolution are indeed 5:4, not 4:3. &nbsp;Take out a ruler and measure one.</p>
<p>Many widescreen monitors are 16:9 rather than 16:10 (or, as you prefer, 8:5). &nbsp;Largely because the manufacturer can then reuse panels designed for HDTVs.</p>

		<p>You can always split your hexagonal tiling into a triangular tiling. So, triangles can do everything that hexagons can, but also let you operate at a finer level.</p>

		<p>Pretty sure that first CGA resolution should be 320&#215;200, not 240 :)</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Fixed, thanks. -Raymond</i>]</div>
<p>The old CGA I remember supported a green/yellow/black/red mode&#8230; I might be misremembering though, my first computer was EGA (still have my EGA/VGA programmer&#39;s reference guide&#8230;)</p>

		<p>JamesW: I was assuming the number of pixels (and the area of each pixel) was a constant (probably determined by the hardware cost). If you are able to split each hexagon into six triangles, each with a sixth of the original hexagon&#39;s area, you could instead replace each hexagon with six smaller hexagons and you&#39;d have even finer resolution.</p>

		<p>Using ASPECTX and ASPECTY sounds straight-forward, except that there is LOGPIXELSX/Y, and HORZ/VERTSIZE+HORZ/VERTRES, two more ways to apparently do the same thing. I know that LOGPIXELSX/Y can be modified by the user and is by default 96, regardless of the display, but I am at a loss to decide which function to use when. There is also SCALINGFACTORX/Y, but I guess that&#39;s only for printers?</p>

		<p>@Ridley: Yeah, it was 320&#215;200. And you&#39;re being kind to CGA. The two palettes were (in EGA/VGA/QBColor terms) 0/2/4/6 (old-style brown) and 0/11/13/15, though as I recall you could map color 0 (normally black) to any of the 16 standard colors.</p>

		<p>@Philip: the six triangles of each hexagon could actually be exploited as subpixels, it would be quite an intelligent solution.</p>

		<p>If you deal with printers, you still have to worry about non-square pixels &#8212; and broken drivers. &nbsp;I remember having to put shims in for certain drivers that forgot to swap their horizontal and vertical resolutions when you switched from portrait to landscape in the middle of a print job.</p>
<p>And I&#39;ve always wondered how to specify the lfHeight field when you&#39;re displaying rotated text on a device with non-square pixels. &nbsp;Empirically, there seems to be no &quot;right&quot; way, as different drivers handle it differently.</p>

		<p>Then there was ICL&#39;s EGA adaptor. &nbsp;(ICL was a large UK computer company.) &nbsp;It had an extra row at the bottom of the screen where you could put additional messages. &nbsp;One use was using the computer in an office environment and it would integrate with the phone system displaying caller and similar information in that extra row. &nbsp;Of course almost no programs knew about the extra area so they didn&#39;t clear it when changing the screen contents leaving all sorts of detritus there.</p>
<p>You are probably wondering how the telephony program ran at the same time as your office applications since MS-DOS didn&#39;t support multi-tasking. &nbsp;The answer is MS-DOS version 4. &nbsp;Not what was released as the MS-DOS 4 we all know today, but an earlier release named MS-DOS 4 done by Microsoft for ICL (and Apricot I believe) that did support multi-tasking.</p>

<p>Does this depend on the driver or hardware? I just did EnumDisplaySettings/ChangeDisplaySettings on my machine and got ASPECTX=36, ASPECTY=36, HORZSIZE=320, VERTSIZE=240 for all display modes (26). Is there a way to set ASPECTX and ASPECTY to different values for testing programs?</p>

		<p>I run Win7 Media Center through my plasma TV which has rectangular pixels. It&#39;s 16:9 with native res of 1280&#215;768.</p>
<p>I have to run Windows at 1280&#215;720 instead of the native res as otherwise all video content gets squashed.</p>
<p>Anyone know if Media Center (and the MPEG2 decoder if relevant) understand rectangular pixels? I&#39;ve always assumed they simply don&#39;t but maybe the OS just doesn&#39;t realise the display&#39;s aspect and I need to force the information in somewhere.</p>

		<p>Back in the old days, a CGA card plugged into a CGA monitor, so any program talking to a CGA device knew the dimensions of each pixel. The EGA, VGA, and XGA (8514) were the same way. Once monitors came out that could show arbitrary resolutions, it became nearly impossible to tell the size of a pixel on the monitor, and you had to rely on the user telling you (and short of that, assume 96dpi square pixels).</p>

		<p>&quot;Pixel&quot; is a fuzzy notion, something that only exists for convenience. In the real world, there are only dots.</p>
<p>Many digital camera displays use a setup where even rows have RGRGRGRG&#8230; dots (no blue), and odd rows have GBGBGBGB&#8230; dots (not red). Each dot being usually about square. It&#39;s pretty hard to come up with a pleasing notion of pixel in these conditions.</p>

		<p>I never understood why &quot;Super-VGA&quot; went with the weird 1280*1024 res (on 4:3 CRTs). Maybe it was so you could fix a 24-bit frame buffer on a 4MB card. That was certainly the motivation for the Mac&#39;s 1152*864 res, which is almost exactly 1 megapixel.</p>
<p>VGA also had the handy mode 0x13, which was 320*200*256colors, which was really easy to program to &#8211; 1 byte = 1 pixel. The pixels were 1.2:1 though, like CGA.</p>
<p>And let&#39;s not forget the unofficial &quot;Mode X&quot;, which could get 320*240*256 out of VGA, and even 320*480 with 1:2 aspect ratio (or 360X480 with 9:16 aspect ratio). It sure benefited games like Pinball Fantasies or Scorched Earth.</p>

		<p>I wonder how we got this far in comments on an article containing the words &quot;pixel&quot; and &quot;square&quot; in the same sentence without mentioning the &quot;A Pixel Is Not A Little Square&quot; memo by Microsoft&#39;s own Alvy Ray Smith.</p>

		<p>The Sims 2, I think, provides circle pixels as an option. I sometimes wondered what the pixel shader looked like that allowed them to do that (and sometimes I wondered what was the point of doing that, too)</p>

		<p>@Erzengel:</p>
<p>Never had a CM8833 CGA monitor? The pixels on it were sort of faded around the edges, making them look round. I always preferred that because it was kind-of a built in anti-aliasing. I always thought PCs with vga had too &#39;well-defined&#39; pixels making everything look jagged.</p>
<p>Of course, these days, with more pixels / inch it&#39;s not so bad anymore :)</p>

		<p>I fondly remember how the Acorn BBC Micro did it. The non-text screeen modes all had a virtual size of 1280&#215;1024, which was way oversize anything we&#39;d ever need back then. No matter what size or shape the actual pixels were, you would always get the right image when running the same draw-line commands within the virtual screen.</p>
<p>They also put the 0,0 pixel in the lower left, cartesian like. It seemed very odd when I moved to other machines which had 0,0 in the top left.</p>

		<p>@fowl</p>
<p>Thanks for the suggestion. I hadn&#39;t noticed that before in Media Player. Unfortunately, it doesn&#39;t seem to affect Media Center (at least not playback of MPEG2 DVB-T digital TV, which still comes out assuming square pixels).</p>

		<p>What about the hercules graphics adapter? With a resolution of 720×348 and the ability to work as a CGA Adapter with an emulator software. Only monochrome but it didn&#39;t really matter. It was programable with e.g. QuickBasic/Basic PDS (Screen 3 and using a special driver).</p>

		<p><!-- p>I think the statement "but the ratio of height to width has varies." is correct, just missing a comma: "but the ratio of height to width has, varies.". Meaning the ratio varies depending on the system/resolution you are working with. A better version might be: "but the height to width ratio varies." or &nbsp;"but the height to width ratio a monitor has, varies."
I think the width to height ratio was driven more by the top down/left right way we read and from the original dot matrix printers instead of the cartesian coordinate system. (Total guess on my part.) I&#39;m happy we don&#39;t have to rotate text to get it to display properly on computers.
