<div class="post">[<em>That would have been even <span style="text-decoration:underline;">more</span> work, because there was at the time no infrastructure in Setup for having 32-bit-only components.

		<p>I noticed HyperTerminal disappeared in 7. &nbsp;My investigation led me to discover a third-party had developed it for MS to include in Windows in the past (probably similar to Pinball?). &nbsp;I assume the contract expired or something. &nbsp;The original company still has free/paid versions available.</p>

		<p>@RP How does Remote Desktop work with RS-232 serial ports and non-Windows-type thingies that you connect to them? The nice thing about HyperTerm was that is was guaranteed to be on every computer that our equipment needed to work with so our customers weren&#39;t required to buy a terminal program.</p>

		<p>At the risk of inciting world war 3, is there any possibility that Pinball could be open sourced? I am certain I know the answer to this question already, but there is a part of me that hopes if this particular dead horse is beaten enough, the answer will eventually be &quot;yes&quot;.</p>

		<p>So basically, not much commitment to backward compatibility/effort was taken to understand the code and fix the bug. Good thing, at least the 64-bit version of XP got it. Whatever the reason, the result is the same &#8211; customer not WOWed.</p>

		<p>xpclient, do you not read or follow links, or do you just reflexively bash Microsoft whenever you get the chance[1]? &nbsp;The program was written by someone else, and Microsoft wasn&#39;t supplied with any information about how it worked. &nbsp;I don&#39;t blame them for not wanting to spend who knows how much time fixing it.</p>
<p>[1] rhetorical question; we all know the answer.</p>

		<p>@Matt: &nbsp;The blog software has a nasty habit of loading comments after the page is otherwise finished loading, in such a way that breaks the ability to link to individual comments. &nbsp;As Raymond said, one of his links was to a comment. &nbsp;The only thing you can really do is notice that if you mouse over the # on each comment, you can figure out with a little work which comment he was linking to.</p>

		<p>@Rick C, the XP x64 version works fine on Windows 8 x64. So I don&#39;t see why the XP versions couldn&#39;t be shipped if they could not be ported (probably some reason like it doesn&#39;t pass SDL). Then it could be made for download. There are many ways to make it available if MS wants to.</p>

		<p>[That would have been even more work, because there was at the time no infrastructure in Setup for having 32-bit-only components. (And then automatically uninstalling it when WOW64 was disabled.)]</p>
<p>The obvious solution would have been to package it as part of WOW64, and make it not start if some other game (say minesweeper) was not present so the pointy heads are happy. Not-present components seem to take up their disk space anyway so this sounds to me like no disk space wasted if WOW64 on but games off.</p>

		<p>@xpclient, Pinball x64 works fine <em>for you</em>. &nbsp;Have you ever run into the problem Raymond mentioned, about it ignoring the flipper? &nbsp;If that happened on even a semi-regular basis (as in, probably more than one or two times ever for a couple percent of users) then Microsoft would get no end of complaints about it (just like all the people who don&#39;t understand floating-point math used to mock &quot;bugs&quot; in the calculator) and you&#39;d be complaining instead that stupid Microsoft can&#39;t fix buggy software.</p>

		<p>@Rick C, the bug happened while porting code as mentioned. Please don&#39;t accuse me of complaining for sake of it, I don&#39;t do that :), it is the lost continuity of features which very naturally pisses off many users. Fell short of time is not acceptable to many end users.</p>

		<p>Ah yes, how can we have a post here without a backwards compatibility Smart Alec-y off topic comment from xpclient aka Mr. Kale himself.</p>
<p>I&#39;m with Chris here &#8211; if only it had been open sourced, I&#39;m sure there would have been enough interest from developers to have fixed and even improved the game in no time at all. Oh well, there are always alternatives.</p>

		<p>Workaround for the comment link navigatio problem: wait for the page to load, then focus on the url bar and hit Enter. This works because browsers will jump within the currently loaded page instead of reloading it when the link to navigate to contains an anchor.</p>

		<p>Wow. So here we have a port abandoned because of a lack of time but that simply means not enough effort was put into it. Because priorities don&#39;t exist.</p>
<p>Add project management to the list of things I never hope xpclient is in charge of.</p>

<p>Any way to find out the name of that company? &nbsp;That would most likely be step one in getting the source &#39;open sourced&#39;.</p>
<p>(what if they don&#39;t exist any more? &#8211; some legal entity most likely exists &#8230;) &nbsp;Does someone have insight into how to negotiate or ask a firm that wrote something in ~1995 (that may not exist anymore) to release their code &#8230;</p>

		<p>Ah, the quantum tunneling pinball!</p>
<p>We ran into this while writing the original code at Cinematronics in 1994. Since the ball motion, physics, and coordinates were all in floating point, and the ball is constantly being pushed &quot;down&quot; the sloped table by the gravity vector in every frame, we found that floating point error would gradually accumulate until the ball&#39;s position was suddenly on the other side of the barrier!</p>
<p>(To simplify collision detection, the ball was reduced to a single point/vector and all barriers were inflated by the ball radius. So, if the mathematical point got too &quot;close&quot; to the mathematical line barrier, a tiny amount of floating point rounding or truncation error could push the point to the other side of the line)</p>
<p>To mitigate that, we added a tiny amount of extra bounce to push the ball away from the barrier when it was nearly at rest, to keep the floating point error accumulation at bay. This became known as the Brownian Motion solution.</p>
<p>Since much of the original code was written in x86 asm to hand tailor Pentium U/V pipelines and interleave FPU instructions, but wiki says Microsoft ported the code to C for non-Intel platforms, I&#39;m sure the code had passed through many hands by the time it got to you. The Brownian Motion solution may have been refactored into oblivion.</p>

		<p>Curious, how much approximately Microsoft paid for Pinball to that company before shipping it. Is it millions, tens of millions or what? I am just wondering what the order of the amount is.</p>

		<p>@GaryF: The Pinball core code was created by Cinematronics starting in 1994. Microsoft licensed the code. Maxis acquired Cinematronics and published the game as FullTilt! Pinball in 1996. Maxis was acquired by Electronic Arts in 1997. <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Full_Tilt!_Pinball" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Full_Tilt!_Pinball</a></p>
<p>I doubt the Microsoft license permits Microsoft to publish it or release it open source. You&#39;d have to go to EA for that.</p>

		<p>@alpb: On the order of thousands at best, definitely not millions. It was nearly a freebie. Cinematronics wanted the exposure / name in front of millions of Windows users in the hope of driving future sales. The Win95 Plus! pack started out as a promotional thing with dozens of game developers signed up. MSFT initially tried to get the devs to pay for the privilege of MSFT distribution, but that didn&#39;t fly. Nearly all of the other game titles dropped out before the Plus Pack release date.</p>

		<p>The strange part is, I know I played Pinball in the 64-bit version of Windows 2000 for Alpha. &nbsp;The RC before it got pulled. &nbsp;Unless Pinball was running under the embedded FX!32 in that release? &nbsp;If it was, it ran pretty smoothly!</p>
<p>Since 2000 already had 64-bit clean code for Alpha, why was there so much code in XP to fix?</p>

		<p>JailBird: 64-bit version? I think the Win2000 RC was 32-bit like NT4 Alpha, with 32-bit pointers sign-extended to 64-bit by the processor. It did have VLM that allowed access to the entire 64-bit address space unlike NT4 Alpha though (wonder where PVOID64 and __ptr64 came from?).</p>

		<p>I can suggest following technic to debug such problem:</p>
<p>1) create reproducible testcase:</p>
<p>a) find machine where sometime it reproed</p>
<p>b) make special pinball build, that logs all relevant input values &#8211; both user&#39;s ones and generated by internal random</p>
<p>c) try to reproduce issue, once did it..</p>
<p>d) make a special pinall with hardcoded input from last logs</p>
<p>2) make another special pinball with hardcoded input, that logs <em>everything</em> in calculations. Every line of code, that contains +, -, *, / or even (or especially) typecast must be logged</p>
<p>3) start 32 &amp; 64 bit versions of it.</p>
<p>4) diff logs, drink beer, grep diffs, drink beer, diff greps, dink beer, write custom diff-grep, drink beer&#8230; awake at morning, compile what you have in IDE, start it ==&gt; PROFIT!</p>
<p>5) ..hope Win8 SP1 will introduce pinball. Its just must have for finger interface</p>

		<p>[That would have been even more work, because there was at the time no infrastructure in Setup for having 32-bit-only components. (And then automatically uninstalling it when WOW64 was disabled.)]</p>

		<p>The barrier needed to be implemented as a flexible border with reflection loss. Then any quantum fluctuations will decay to the floating underflow. Beware that some old AMD processors might slow down their pipeline in a case of underflow (that was a big compat problem in some audio processing software).</p>

		<p>Nice to see there&#39;s still interest in our little pinball game from the mid nineties. &nbsp;Cinematronics was founded by David Stafford, Mike Sandige and I in 1994, and Space Cadet was our first published game (Mike was the lead, I was the producer/designer, and a host of others did some coding on it including David, Danny, John Taylor, Jim Mischel and others). &nbsp;Mike is an excellent engineer, so I&#39;d be surprised if his original code was unreadable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The deal David did with Microsoft was non-exclusive. &nbsp;As Danny noted, we were more interested in the exposure and didn&#39;t see much revenue from it. &nbsp;However, it did lead to our relationship and eventual acquisition by Maxis. &nbsp;EA owns the code now, as part of Full Tilt (which included two other tables we built). &nbsp;The sequel, Full Tilt II, got a revamped physics engine designed by Mark Kness that solved the ball/flipper problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The code for the game is probably buried somewhere deep in the bowels of EA &#8212; I&#39;d be surprised if they even knew where it was. &nbsp;Probably sitting in a cardboard box that hasn&#39;t been opened since 1997. &nbsp;Microsoft had rights to continue publishing Space Cadet in future operating systems, so I don&#39;t see why they wouldn&#39;t have the right to update the code to that end. &nbsp;I may have a copy of the contract still, no doubt also sitting in a box that hasn&#39;t been opened since 1997.</p>

		<p>The other virtue of Pinball was that it included an (apparently) totally unrelated OS/2 HPFS. &nbsp;Before I gave up doing OS/2 migrations, I installed Pinball just to be able to access HPFS formatted partitions.</p>

		<p>@Danny Thorpe: Interesting. I&#39;ll admit that I&#39;m completely spoiled by modern machines and can&#39;t easily imagine needing to reduce the ball&#39;s radius to 0 for performance reasons. I once wrote a floating point math library for my own education and toyed around with various ways of performing certain operations, and was surprised by how easily floating point error can add up over time. Definitely an exercise I would recommend for anyone going into a field that relies on them, like games development.</p>
<p>I still had to think for a moment about the math-near-zero possibilities that could crop up. I could easily see some later programmer who was porting the game to another language not realize the significance of clever hacks like Brownian motion.</p>

		<p>[Running on a computer not licensed to run the matching version of Windows is prohibited by the licensing agreement. -Raymond]</p>
<p>I think when following the upgrade path, this licensing limitation does not apply. Kodak Imaging is said to be licensed up to Win2k only, but there&#39;s article somewhere in Technet that explains if your WinXP is upgrading directly from Win2k, you can still use it because the license is covered with the part from Win2k license.

		<p>The &#39;full&#39; version of the Pinball game was included as an extra in the CD version of Marble Drop I owned. It is significantly improved, apart from the graphics, in that the ball seems to go down the middle a lot less often. Things seem to have been shifted around to give a much nicer &#39;feel&#39; to the game. I spent many hours playing the game, and was really quite surprised to find the rougher version that shipped with Windows a few years later.</p>

		<p>From experience I found that relying on purely pre-emptive multitasking in windows wasn&#39;t all it should have been, so bounding any potentially greedy loop by adding even a sleep(1) call inside it made for greatly lower cpu usage as long as you&#39;d never possibly need to run it more than 1000x/sec. &nbsp;I know, it shouldn&#39;t have been necessary but in practice it made a huge difference.</p>

<p>What&#39;s the big deal? &nbsp;The software works, it&#39;s been tested on millions of machines, and it hasn&#39;t needed a significant change in roughly a decade. &nbsp;Who cares if nobody is around who still knows the code?</p>
<p>This situation is probably more normal than someone still understanding decade-old code on some random project that isn&#39;t even part of the mainline business. &nbsp;I mean really, what are you going to do, train new employees on the pinball game &quot;just in case&quot;?</p>

		<p>&quot;That would have been even more work, because there was at the time no infrastructure in Setup for having 32-bit-only components. (And then automatically uninstalling it when WOW64 was disabled.)&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe there could have been a dummy 64-bit version that was shim that spawned the 32-bit version (and provided some sane error message if WOW64 was unavailable).</p>

<p>Maybe the x64 port for XP x64 got done by somebody else as a bare compile as the simplest way to resolve a merge disaster. I would suspect that bug is waiting for you under the circumstances it happened before.</p>

		<p>Yeeeeaaah, so, if you could just go ahead and finish porting that code, negotiate a license for source with the current owners ,open-source it and then post up the names and phone numbers of all the original developers whilst you&#39;re at it, that would be great.</p>
<p>Seriously though, for what it&#39;s worth; thanks for at least making the effort back then to get it working&#8230;I always try to remember posts like this when I am trying toexplain for the nth time to someone why I can&#39;t &quot;just make it work&quot; with System X/Y/Z/World+Dog.</p>

		<p>I love that Descent I was ported to Direct3D, and that allowed me to play Descent I levels in Windows XP (and 7?). It was a great game for those times (circa 1995). I wish there was the port of the original Lost Vikings.</p>

		<p>So were you the one who tweaked solitaire so the card animation after winning wasn&#39;t hooked to CPU speed? I was pretty upset that, after watching it get faster and faster over the years, when I upgraded to a new system and installed (XP? Vista?) suddenly the cards were back to slow, stately jumps.</p>

		<p>I was technical lead on the project, and did a lot of the coding along with Danny Thorpe and a handful of others. &nbsp;It&#39;s great to see that folks still remember the game. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks, Raymond, for putting in the frame rate limiter, btw. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It wouldn’t surprise me if the code was sensitive to changes in floating point rounding when compiled for 64 bits. &nbsp; Or perhaps the data files had implicit 32 bit data fields that don’t match 64 bit compiled structures when loaded. &nbsp; It’s also possible that, even with your frame rate limiter, the code still isn’t properly handling the numeric ranges for small time slices that happen with faster computers. &nbsp; In any rate, I would have been happy to help keep Pinball working. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Oh, and I’m pretty sure I put collision detection code in there. &nbsp;If I remember right, the collision detection was distributed – each table object class handled collisions in potentially different ways. &nbsp; I’m pretty sure there was a base class with basic collision, though, and a handful of geometric primitives for computing intersections.</p>

<p>And going still further offtopic, why is the FAT driver called fastfat.sys? Was there an earlier slower fat driver? What could you possibly get so wrong with a FAT implementation that it needed to be chucked out?</p>

		<p>Raymon, kudos for for attempting the port &#8211; and even more kudos for giving up and focusing on more important tasks.</p>
<p>For the people whining, you most likely have a legit Windows XP license &#8211; while it might not be EULA-kosher for you to do this, I don&#39;t think anybody in their right mind is going ot mind. Bring out your XP CD, copy PINBALL.* from it, and EXPAND the files (yes, you will have to either guess the correct extensions or hunt through installation files, but it&#39;s not rocket science). I did this earlier today, and the XP32SP2 PINBALL works just fine on Win7X64SP1.</p>
<p>As for ZOMG IT&#39;S NOT ON WINDOWS ANYMORE, whatever. I&#39;m glad that piece of fluff is gone, and would love that a lot of other fluff was gone as well &#8211; a power-user supermodular windows would rock. Probably not gonna happen, but kudos to the kernel+core teams for doing a lot of nice work wrt. module boundaries.</p>

		<p>The Windows 8 game, Pinball FX2, is *infinitely* better&#8230;</p>

		<p>I, myself, *would* in fact argue for paying 10x for full rights; &quot;just because (*you* think) we don&#39;t need them *now* does *not* mean we *never will;* and, trust me, it is possible to delay too long and end up regretting it.&quot;</p>

		<p>@Chris C well, it turns out they didn&#39;t need the source code until Windows Vista came out, and by that time a circa-early ninties pinball game was pretty much worthless, so it looks to have been a pretty smart move on Microsoft&#39;s part.</p>

		<p>For those that ask for the source code all the time. It is easy. Reverse engineer it !</p>
<p>Pinball is a basic game so it should be relatively easy to get the needed parts and write a clone with the same physics and graphics.</p>
<p>These license agreements in software is bullshit. Made by lawyers to get money.</p>
<p>License&#39;s only hurt the evolution in software (and hardware) !</p>

		<p>&quot;Running on a computer not licensed to run the matching version of Windows is prohibited by the licensing agreement.&quot;</p>
<p>Does that mean microsoft broke their own hypocritical agreement by releasing vista with invalid hardware requirements ?</p>
<p>Seems like that applies to Surface with 1 gb memory too. You can&#39;t multitask with that little memory yet it say multitask on the ads ?!</p>
<p>False advertisements ? That is illegal isn&#39;t it ?</p>

		<p>&quot;Windows 8 game, Pinball FX2&quot;</p>
<p>What about those people that do not own a touch enabled screen or do not want to be locked-in to the bad desktop user experience that is windows 8 ?</p>
<p>Bring back the start button and make metro optional !</p>
<p>Than i will upgrade.</p>
<p>That reverse engineer idea was good.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen many good games in the comments.</p>
<p>This could be a movement &#39;do not let the games be forgotten&#39; or something like that.</p>
<p>EA have probably misplaced the code for pinball :(</p>
<p>I know of many projects that are gone forever due to licensing and the fact that the owner do not give a crap about preserving it.</p>
<p>Lots of music have disappeared on tapes this way too (back before &quot;pirates&quot; helped preserve history)</p>
<p>Should be illegal for the owner to let such things disappear.</p>
<p>I mean they are the owner no one else can legally preserve it. Should that not be a requirement for ownership ?</p>

  &gt; Lol, what a bunch of noobs.</p>
<p>  &gt; &quot;Can&#39;t even find the collision detector&quot;?!?</p>
<p>  &gt; Seriously? Do you know about &quot;grep&quot; or &quot;Find in Files&quot;?

<p>Right. &nbsp;Because all you have to do is search for Here_Be_The_Collision_Detector.</p>
