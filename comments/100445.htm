		<p>This reminds me of this one time I wrote an example application for a client of ours. It was supposed to be a demo on how to use our API but it showed them how to do the few things they needed to do. I think I even made the app show a &#8220;This is a demo only&#8221;  popup when it started up. The whole endeavor was billed as a &#8220;consultation&#8221; with a pretty ridiculous hourly rate but they still happily paid that.</p>
<p>A year or so later they asked if I could add a modification to the app. Turns out they didn&#8217;t want to touch it at all and had just deployed it as-is in production. For over a year the demo app had been used by people in the field to perform actual work.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s lucky I still had the source code lying around in a folder; it wasn&#8217;t even in source control. When management heard about this they had a good laugh and then went to talk with them. I don&#8217;t know how it ended but I still got to make the modification. This time I checked it in our source control.</p>

		<p>This is why I always make sure that demos don&#8217;t actually work, because the sales guys will sell the demo without asking. They assume that a shiny UI means it&#8217;s done.</p>

		<p>Or if you can&#8217;t make it so that it doesn&#8217;t work for whatever reason, go out of your way to make it a really bad demo.<br />
I have done things like make it very inefficient, only implemented partial features, only allow the demo to be active for a certain length of time, and make it start randomly crashing after some time.<br />
The last one is perfect if the timing ends up getting the demo to crash around when they ask about the state of the demo.</p>

		<p>This reminds me about something similar&#8230; a POC feature is made for demo for bid a contract, I explained to my boss that this feature is not compatible with our database schema and we&#8217;ll need over 3 man-month effort to rework the tables in order to make it work without breaking existing program logic, all data saved by the feature is stored in a set of table that is isolated to other systems instead.</p>
<p>In the end we didn&#8217;t won that bid. Instead, another customer saw the demo and want it, and the sales quoted only 3 mandays. Afterall, all things *seems* to work, how difficult would it be to make it actually work, right?</p>
<p>I refused to do it because I&#8217;ve submitted resignation at that time point, because clearly you won&#8217;t handover half-baked feature to *non-existant* *next* developer.</p>
<p>I have no idea how did the matter ends.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve seen the exact thing happen to me. We had an API and had to provide a sample on how to use it. We ended up with a ton of bug reports from a customer that the sample code provided didn&#8217;t do their exact integration and use case. It was just a few example API calls; our sample code didn&#8217;t do anything useful. But it was deployed as-is, the customer noticed it didn&#8217;t do anything and said we had bugs. It is amazing how quick crucial information like that gets lost or glossed over.</p>

		<p>Way back when I did Word for Windows support, probably version 6, someone called in to complain that a feature stopped working.</p>
<p>Said feature was technically impossible. I couldn&#8217;t explain to him how it ever even worked in the first place and that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to break the software in such a way that it would do what they liked again.</p>
<p>They did not take it well.</p>

		<p>We&#8217;ve had quite a few customers calling for technical support complaining about a feature that stopped working when we know that feature never existed.</p>
<p>I recall more than one case where we could prove the feature never existed by information theory: the software didn&#8217;t have enough information to implement the requested data processing.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t imaging what&#8217;s going through the customer&#8217;s heads when they try this stunt. When we don&#8217;t know immediately the feature never existed, we can waste days tracking it down before closing the case when &#8220;does not exist&#8221;. This never turns into an add feature even if it&#8217;s a really good idea, which usually it isn&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>Never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by incompetence.  They don&#8217;t know their actual inputs, they don&#8217;t know their actual outputs, they don&#8217;t know their actual processes.  So they can&#8217;t correctly conclude that &#8220;existing feature X does (or at least used to do ) such and such/&#8221;</p>
<p>Or at least the person tasked to take the &#8220;broken feature&#8221; case to the vendor doesn&#8217;t know those things.  How Suzy in Accounting or Bob in Sales actually uses the tool is anyone&#8217;s guess.  I&#8217;m reminded (for the second time this week) of <a href="https://xkcd.com/763/" rel="nofollow">https://xkcd.com/763/</a></p>

		<p>We had seen something like this in one of my previous company:</p>
<p>1) Some high rank user don&#8217;t want to enter some financial figure in the system, and told us we should deduce the figure from other data.<br />
2) However, that required figure is used for verifying the correctness of other systems.</p>
<p>Have told them about this and they say &#8220;just do it&#8221;, and now we have a system that &#8220;always works&#8221; but don&#8217;t actually work in any sense.</p>

		<p>We once had a customer complain that a button that they didn&#8217;t need didn&#8217;t exist. (We speculated that mid-call they realized that the information they wanted was elsewhere in the app, and that they were saving face.)</p>

		<p>So long as the customer pays for each such incident, does it really matter?  Or are we talking some sort of fixed-price support contract here?</p>

		<p>The deal is that the customer paid for the incident, and the response from the feature team is &#8220;Sorry, we don&#8217;t support that technique any more.&#8221; The customer is now mad. &#8220;Well you are the ones who gave me that technique in the first place, and my product / deployment relies on it! You must keep it working!&#8221;</p>

		<p>It seems to me that your analysis can be rephrased more simply: providing an answer to the *initial* request is also &#8220;support&#8221;.</p>
<p>The fact that the customer lies when they say they won&#8217;t ask for help if it stops working is immaterial. The real reason to not provide answers to such questions is that you can&#8217;t truthfully say that a technique is &#8220;unsupported&#8221;, while at the same time actually *supporting* the technique by describing it to the customer.</p>

		<p>There may be some confirmation bias here, since the customers who don&#8217;t understand are the ones you&#8217;ll hear from again.</p>
<p>We use one of our SaaS systems in a somewhat non-standard way; we do all the normal processes, but to get all the information we need out of it we need to use a bunch of internal tables in our final reports. Every time there&#8217;s a patch or new release I have to verify that these queries are still valid &#8211; and there have been times that I&#8217;ve had to update them, as the application changed the way it handled various cases internally. But we always knew we were signing up for that; it&#8217;s just part of the cost of doing business.</p>

		<p>In Android, using the system libraries, e.g. libssl.so used to be &#8216;unsupported&#8217; for long time. Since recently, it is strictly forbidden.</p>
