		<p>Surely it should be:</p>
<p>• The file last-modified time definitely changed. </p>
<p>• The file size might have changed. </p>
<p>• The file last-access time definitely changed. </p>

		<p>@Electron starting with Vista, the last-access time is no longer updated.</p>

		<p>It was more the &quot;file size has definitely changed&quot; part. Whether the size changes or not depends on the edits made &#8211; there&#39;s no &quot;definitely&quot; about it.</p>

		<p>There&#39;s no &quot;definitely&quot; about the last-modified time too. If the last-modified time on the filesystem was in the future, and you time the click on the save button just right, you could in theory get the same last-modified time.</p>
<p>(Raymond, sorry for contributing to the nitpicking. I will shut up now.)</p>

		<p>Maybe by change he means a write. Even an update by the same value is also a change, in this context.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>That&#39;s what I meant, yes. The file system change notification does not check whether a write was equal to the previous data. (This gets really expensive for large file writes.) Remember the purpose of change notifications. Spurious notifications are legal. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@kinokijuf: The reason why the last-accessed time &quot;might have&quot; changed is that it&#39;s a configurable option in Windows. &nbsp;Sure, it&#39;s off by default in modern versions, but it&#39;s possible to enable it even in Windows 7 &amp; 8. &nbsp;Defrag Tools on Channel9 recently did an episode on last-access time and symbols. &nbsp;Look for it on the Channel9 website; or, lookup the documentation for fsutil.</p>

		<p>Even in older versions of Windows, which did have last-accessed modification turned on by default, NTFS wouldn&#39;t update it if it had been updated less than an hour ago. Given the design goals, I would expect the notification to only indicate the last-access change if NTFS had stored a new value, not for every actual access.</p>
<p>This API is maddening if you&#39;re trying to write an event-driven service that detects the presence of a new file to operate on. You want to be told when the writer has finished writing. Let&#39;s say some generic process that you can&#39;t control is creating the file, such as copying a file into a folder through Windows Explorer or uploading via FTP, so you can&#39;t get a notification from the writing process. The FileSystemWatcher API does not tell you that. It tells you that the name was created when the file is opened. It tells you that the modified time has changed, but it&#39;s not entirely clear from the documentation whether that is a valid signal that the process has finished writing to the file (since NTFS only updates modified time when you close the file) and it mentions deferring the notification until the cache is sufficiently flushed. This leaves the developer handling the creation notification by polling, attempting to open the file for reading and backing off on failure.</p>

		<p>@Mike Dimmick: To be fair, there&#39;s no good way for a filesystem monitor API to really notify you that a new file has been created and can be safely opened. &nbsp;Such an event would be subject to many race conditions and sloppy programming: another program may open the file, a virus scanner could kick in, the security ACLs could be changed, the network could become unavailable, etc. &nbsp;The best way in any case is to attempt to open, gracefully handle any failures, and try again if necessary. &nbsp;That&#39;s what you should do any time you&#39;re working with files.</p>

		<p>For the first time since I&#39;ve become a regular reader, you&#39;ve written about a topic that I had just been learning myself. I implemented a system to to monitor file changes in a failed attempt to achieve my goals as described in my latest blog post: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://amish-programmer.blogspot.ca/2014/05/desperate-measures-time-to-hack.html">amish-programmer.blogspot.ca/&#8230;/desperate-measures-time-to-hack.html</a></p>
<p>I had to discover the properties described in this post for myself. Perhaps next time you could schedule relevant posts ahead of my working on related projects ;)</p>
