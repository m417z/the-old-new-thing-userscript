		<p>I wonder how different they grip compared to hiking shoes. &nbsp;Up here in the Great White North (Edmonton, Alberta) a lot of people including me just wear hiking shoes all the time. &nbsp;I really don&#8217;t have much problem on ice.</p>

		<p>Hahaha&#8230; Yes, they are much easier to put on sitting down. &nbsp;I like them because they pack so small (I keep mine in a ziplock bag in my day pack) and they are cheap. &nbsp;I did find that walking in really deep snow (3+ feet) caused one to pop off but it also could have been loose or not firmly attached to begin with. &nbsp;After putting it back on, I had no other troubles with them. &nbsp;They work well in mud too.</p>

		<p>And they say computer people have no fashion sense. ;)</p>
<p>For what it&#8217;s worth, I&#8217;ve never seen anyone use ice-walking aids like these, in my thirty years in &#8230; well, Iceland. (Yeah, appeal to authority and all that.)</p>
<p>You should not overlook the merits of ice. Walking on it tones the inner thighs nicely (because of the effort of orienting one&#8217;s step force near-vertically to minimize slippage). Slipping on it improves reflexes and balance. And falling on it raises one&#8217;s pain tolerance, when repeated over a long period. And culls the ranks of the elderly.</p>
<p>I realize I should have skipped that last one. I&#8217;m feeling unusually mischievous today. Sorry.</p>

		<p>Regarding the walker, what did you have in mind? Reenacting the credits from Office Space?</p>

		<p>Ya, the traffic was bad, though 520 into Redmond was no worse then normal if you were taking the Advindale exit.</p>
<p>Though I have to say, the pedestrions caused as much trouble as the snow. It was very common to see them crossing EVERYWHERE and whenever they wanted. I was sitting at a light, I had the green and the room to actualy move when a dozen people wonder though the intersection, right in front of me, blocking my way.</p>
<p>I saw this the whole trip home. People thinking because it was a traffic jam that they can cross when and wherever they wanted. I think a good 1/5th of the slowdown was because of them.</p>

		<p>Did you review the normal version of these, or the Pros? Why wouldn&#8217;t anyone just opt to get the Pro version, unless they both offer the same amount of grip. It is difficult to tell from the site what the differences are.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>It was the Tracker version. From the pictures, it looks like the Pro has a strap that goes over the shoe and is heavier duty. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Oy. I was in Kirkland. 20 minutes to get out of my parking lot. I settled into a Starbucks to wait for traffic to die down. I also did this the night of the big windstorm. If I can&#8217;t go home for 2-3 hours, at least I should have coffee, chocolate and internet to console me. And having the DOT traffic page up makes me very popular with the non-laptop-toting patrons&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve seen USPS workers use similar devices when delivering mail here (in Colorado). They sound pretty spiffy&#8230;I may have to get some.</p>

		<p>I used to use these to go running in Anchorage. &nbsp;Worked for me. &nbsp;Most of my running was on snow-covered trails, and running shoes usually gave me enough grip &#8211; but running across streets was hazardous. &nbsp;Not so with Yaktrax. &nbsp;I usually didn&#8217;t bother with them, and just skated across streets, but on really snowy days when the trails were too deep to be any fun, they made the streets more safe.</p>
<p>Running on icy surfaces is nice for your form, too &#8211; you learn not to overstride.</p>

		<p>I had picked up some el-cheapo traction devices at Target prior to the first time it snowed. &nbsp;5 bucks.</p>
<p>The worked fine, the first and only time I was able to wear them. &nbsp;They had fallen apart the second time I had tried to put them on. &nbsp;I&#8217;d probably try them once again if I could find them.</p>

		<p>&nbsp; One of the great spectator sports in Canada is watching a sequence of people exit a bus onto an icy sidewalk, then doing the arm-waving-balancing act. &nbsp;Its also fun watching a cat/dog walk across snow with a thin ice crust, occasionally falling through the crust up to their armpits :)</p>

		<p>Another great new footwear thing at REI are Chacos.</p>
<p>Man, my teva&#8217;s got to stink, and now my chacos don&#8217;t smell at all. At least that&#8217;s what I think.</p>

		<p>For some reson REI don&#8217;t stock &#8216;small&#8217; or provide an option to order &#8216;small&#8217;, &nbsp;maybe they think only BIG people risk walking in the snow and ice, &nbsp;maybe I should stay at home&#8230; &#8230;no wait&#8230; &nbsp;Amazon is less size-ist&#8230;</p>

		<p>Tyler, you should have been glad those dozen people weren&#8217;t in cars sitting in front of you. &nbsp;The fact that it took you 30 seconds longer to pull through the intersection before coming to a stop did not impact the length of your trip home at all &#8212; you still pulled forward and you still stopped at the same location you were bitching about not being able to pull into.</p>

<p>Why? It&#8217;s perfectly reasonable to get pissed at that sort of behavior.</p>

		<p>Could have used those in college. &nbsp;I went to school way up in northern NY, which is pretty famous for cold and crappy weather. &nbsp;The one rule is this: class is NEVER CANCELLED for weather. &nbsp;Ever. &nbsp;In four years, the only time anything was ever cancelled was for a bomb threat.</p>
<p>One evening we got a huge snowstorm, an ice storm, and then it immediately got just above freezing and rained. &nbsp;All right after each other.</p>
<p>That day I got up and walked from my off-campus apartment, downhill, over slippery water-covered ice sitting on top of 2 feet of unstable snow. &nbsp;It took me about 45 minutes, but I made to it class on time for my 8am class. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t even fall.</p>
<p>And&#8230;</p>
<p>The door to the building was locked. &nbsp;Oh yeah, I wonder why I didn&#8217;t see anyone else walking out there? &nbsp;I was concentrating so hard on walking I didn&#8217;t notice the quad was deserted.</p>
<p>I turned to walk home&#8230; and immediately wheelhoused onto my ass. &nbsp;Fell about 15 more times on the way home.</p>
<p>I think school opened a few hours later. &nbsp;I just stayed in bed for the rest of the day.</p>
