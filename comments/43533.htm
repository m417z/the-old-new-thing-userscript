		<p>Ah, CodeView. </p>
<p>Here in Britain CV is the term for résumé (Curriculum vitae), therefore the fact that installing CodeView meant that everyone&#39;s PC had a file called CV.DOC was a cause of some minor amusement (implying that the PC user was looking for a new job and was working on their CV in work time). </p>

		<p>I wasn&#39;t really fancy &#8211; I was on a budget, so my first IBM PC had only a monochrome adapter. &nbsp;When I eventually got a graphics card, CodeView on the monochrome monitor was the most awesome debugging experience I think I&#39;ve ever had.</p>

		<p>Hmmm I wonder how BC4.5 did it. I recall placing breakpoints in WM_PAINT and hitting them. To be fair I was on W95 at the time; however BC4.5 predates W95 and is 16 bit and debugs 16 bit.</p>
<p>Breakpoint with call instruction to a Yield() loop should do it; but would require special compilation to put the loop where it can be reached by a near call (or the patch might not fit). Maybe there&#39;s something more fancy.</p>

		<p>The first machine I worked on didn&#39;t have a software based debugger &#8212; strictly hardware. &nbsp;The console (no video) had a keyboard and a IO writer (printer with a roll of paper). &nbsp;To debug, we would execute a CPU halt instruction from the keyboard. &nbsp;Earlier models had an actual CPU halt button. &nbsp;From there, one could look at memory by flipping switches and seeing which lights came on. &nbsp;You could also view/change the contents of registers including the PC (program counter register). &nbsp;One could also walk all over the Supervisor and patch that. &nbsp;The Supervisor in today&#39;s world would be called the Operating System. &nbsp;This was on a machine that did not use an 8-bit bite. &nbsp;It used 12-bit slabs. &nbsp;In a 12-bit slab, one could hold 2 6-bit alphas or 3 4-bit digits.</p>
<p>The machine was an NCR Model 315. &nbsp;Now you know where my &quot;handle&quot; came from.</p>
<p>We have come a LONG way over the years.</p>

		<p>Fascinating, thanks for the history lesson. &nbsp;I remember reading some game programming books by André LaMothe in the late 90&#39;s/early 2000&#39;s and somewhere he was talking about some debugging framework he was using (or that he wrote? don&#39;t remember) of use on a secondary monochrome display. &nbsp;It didn&#39;t really make sense to me at the time because I was used to using Visual Studio 6 (or so) to debug programs locally in a GUI, so why would anyone ever need another display and go through all that trouble?</p>

		<p>If BC 4.5 was like BC 3.1, it used the same text-mode trick as CodeView. We had a saying around my office that bugs were easier to see if they were in yellow text on a blue background. That saying derived from the fact that those were the default colors in the text-mode source code window in the BC debugger, and that single-stepping through code had a tendency to focus your attention on it.</p>
<p>SoftICE also had the monochrome monitor trick. I used that well into the Windows 2000 era. </p>

		<p>At my first experience of this I had no real dumb terminal. I ended up using a psion organizer connected to the serial port. This has (had) a &#39;screen&#39; of 2 16 character lines. You can pan around on a larger virtual screen but it was a true labor of love to debug using it</p>

		<p>Back then, switching to text mode and back was easy. The graphics cards didn&#39;t have a lot of state to save/restore, saving/restoring a few tens of registers would be enough to switch modes.</p>
<p>Nowadays, switching to text mode and back is a LOT more complex.</p>
<p>As an aside: using the serial port for debugging is still done today, mostly for embedded systems which don&#39;t even have a keyboard. And there&#39;s always the &quot;big gun&quot; of debugging: JTAG. With JTAG, a debugger running in a separate machine can halt the target processor and inspect its state directly, even if the target processor is deep within the operating system kernel.</p>

		<p>I used the Hercules second monitor option &#8211; worked great. We also had SoftICE and it came with a pushbutton where the other end of the wire would slide into the NMI contact of one of your ISA cards. Push the button and SoftICE would take over no matter what state the machine was in.</p>

		<p>Well for once Youhong Bao is completely on-topic. I&#39;ll bet dollars to donuts that BC4.5 uses one Hard Mode or Soft Mode. Since I don&#39;t have a Win3.1 system handy anymore I&#39;m probably not going to find out which.</p>

		<p>Regarding debugging of embedded systems: </p>
<p>I tried my hand at that, but realized soon that the most important debug tool was an analog scope (a kind of device I had seen only briefly during my student years), I decided to request transfer to another project.</p>
<p>Nowadays those guys have replaced half of their debugging with use of logic analyzers with a Windows GUI. Maybe I now could have reentered the team, even though the hardcore guys still prefer the scope. I guess I am happy where I am now, at a somewhat higher level in the protocol stack.</p>

		<p>I have been working on embedded for a while. &nbsp;Debugging with a scope is pretty standard when bringing up new hardware or working at the hardware level. &nbsp;JTAG is nice if you have an emulator for the hardware you are working on (I currently have JTAG emulators for two of three products I work on). &nbsp;Overall I would say logging and serial consoles are the most useful. &nbsp;If you don&#39;t have a console or some other way to output data from your device, JTAG is basically a must but is otherwise just a nicety.</p>

		<p>@Adam: That seems like a likely explanation. &nbsp;It was game programming, after all, and full-screen DirectDraw/Direct3D was definitely one of the major topics. &nbsp;Back in those days I wasn&#39;t doing anything that complicated so I was always able to debug in windowed mode instead of fulls creen.</p>

		<p>Don&#39;t care about days of yore, but with Visual Studio 201x I still can lock the whole session GUI by having a breakpoint in the wrong message hander. Not exactly lock, but make it impossible to move the VS (or any) window to the foreground. The whole session has to be killed by the separate admin session.</p>

		<p>On an almost, but not entirely, completely unrelated note: the Commodore 128 had two video chips, the VDC capable of producing 80&#215;25 text output and a VIC-II that produced 40&#215;25 text output, befitting the machine&#39;s hybrid nature as something that was supposed to run CP/M as well as all your existing C64 software. As these were independent down to the outputs, you could hook them up to different monitors, allowing you to write software on the VDC business end that displayed on the VIC-II party end &#8212; if you had the cash for two monitors, of course. I didn&#39;t, but I did have the fancy monitor that accepted both inputs and allowed you to switch between them, and that did come in handy for debugging graphics applications.</p>

		<p>@j b My final project for Uni involved connecting two embedded devices together. The devices themselves were debugged using serial ports but we used an oscilloscope to monitor the actual data being sent between them. That experience taught me that &#39;U&#39; is a very useful character.</p>

		<p>I believe some versions of CodeView could save and restore the actual graphics pixels, thus avoiding having to switch display modes.</p>
<p>My biggest beef with WinDbg is that if you accidentally paste while the clipboard is owned by the debugged process then it just hangs and you have to take over using a second copy of WinDbg with the -pe command-line option.</p>

		<p>In the early 90s we had a Periscope hardware debugger which was OK, as I remember getting it access to source was a bit of a pig but it came with a beautiful turned metal casing for a big red button to break into the debugger, it felt great in the hand. &nbsp;Of course it went missing and was replaced with a paper clip.</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to have the second BW monitor for debugging of DOS16M protected mode apps back then too, that was a nice setup.</p>

		<p>Windows did the serial debug trick from the early days. I worked on sound drivers for Win 0.8 that way back in &#39;85.</p>
<p>Having said that the first computer I used properly did multi-screen. It was a Research Machines 380Z (essentially S100 bus) and had a 40&#215;25(?) scrolling text display, an 80&#215;25(?) rich text (bold, reverse, underline) display and a graphics display (forget the res but fairly crap). The output for all these was merged but I quickly realised I could split them out so I had a graphics plotter which used a separate display for entering the equations. The world was a lot crapper for years after I lost that computer.</p>

		<p>@Wear: Reading off &#39;U&#39; with a scope from a serial link is useful?</p>
<p>C:&gt;perl -we &quot;printf(qq(%08Bn),ord U)&quot;</p>
<p>01010101</p>
<p>Oh, I see&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Neil: I think this is because of the support in the Windows clipboard APIs for &quot;delayed rendering&quot;. I get around this by copying to the Scratch Pad while the program is still running.</p>

		<p>I remember debugging MS-DOS device drivers for graphics software on a Compaq Portable III &#8212; it had a plasma display connected to a MDA attached to the case, and I had an EGA in the &quot;expansion pod&quot; connected to a colour monitor. I ran the SoftICE debugger on the plasma display while running the graphics software on the EGA. It always seemed to me that SoftICE was letting me see &quot;inside the box&quot;, as I was staring at the actual case while I was using it.</p>

		<p>Wolf Logan: Mentioning that old gas plasma display reminds me that they used to be monochrome screens in amber because they used neon as the gas. When flat-screen TVs came out and I heard they were plasma displays, I was initially confused because I didn&#39;t think plasma could be made colored.</p>

		<p>I guess I should feel privileged in the embedded world &#8211; I&#39;ve always had JTAG debuggers for use (ARM and DSPs made by an instruments company located in a large republic in the southern US). I get glaring looks when the SW team comes with a problem and I ask what the signal looked like on the oscilloscope. It&#39;s handy to show that they didn&#39;t program some peripheral register properly.</p>
