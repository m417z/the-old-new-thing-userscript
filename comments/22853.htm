		<p>People should see the Blog of Raymond Chen for what it is &#8211; a place of further education.</p>
<p>Information he has given us about the registry, the roll of DOS under Windows 95, what many functions of the Win32 API does and why they act the way they do is invaluable.</p>
<p>To there are morons who don&#8217;t see the gold mine I see.</p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Chen, for your hard work.</p>

		<p>I had a similar reaction when I saw Fox promoting &#8216;Final 24 Trailer&#8217;, wondering where the other 24 trailers were, until I found it was for a show called &#8216;Final 24&#8217;. Poor choice of name; on the bright side, it does make me feel a little more sympathetic towards those who confused Windows XP and Office XP.</p>
<p>Metasnark: Perhaps Igor wants to post snarky comments, but can&#8217;t get his web browser working well enough ;-)</p>

<p>BE said explicitly that he was unsubscribing because of your arrogance. &nbsp;i.e., he&#8217;s unsubscribing because of you. &nbsp;It happens that, in his opinion, the arrogance is typified by your preemptive snarky comments.</p>
<p>What BE got wrong is that those comments actually typify your douchiness far more than your arrogance.</p>

<p>I read this blog in spite of my deep personal dislike for Raymond. &nbsp;I truly believe Raymond keeps comments open so he can be rude and superior to commentators. &nbsp;What kind of douche would do something like that?</p>
<p>He&#8217;s like someone volunteering to teach an adult literacy class and then mocking the students for being unable to read.</p>

		<p>I come because i&#8217;m addicted to absorbing random bits of information most of which will never be of much use for the single piece of information that i actually use at some point in 10 years time.</p>
<p>The same reason I read the HTTP RFCs, which turned out to be very useful later on when implimenting a client and after extensive testing, the deployment server was mysteriously sending numbers in the middle of the response &#8211; I immediately recognised it as chunked encoding, but had I not read the RFCs then I imagine it would have taken weeks, not having known where to even start a search for fixing a &quot;random numbers in the middle of HTTP response&quot; bug!</p>
<p>Although I can&#8217;t think of any time a post from here has helped out in such a situation, I imagine the knowledge of how something is done that I read on here has probably saved some research and probably prevented my software being featured on here!</p>
<p>So that explains why I read Raymond&#8217;s posts, why do I read the comments? well every now and then there&#8217;s a comment that I can&#8217;t help but laugh at the poster &#8211; it&#8217;s good entertainment (does that make me a bad person for laughing at them? not that I am concerned if I am or not, would just be nice to know)</p>

		<p>My initial reaction was that the season would be three episodes short this year because of the writers&#8217; strike. :)</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s a film about blackjack? Gee, that really has me itching to see it already. Where would we be without Hollywood? (Of course I am judging the film by its cover. Maybe it&#8217;s really good. I don&#8217;t know. The cover puts me off enough not to look any further.)</p>

		<p>Just rewatching season 1, and it&#8217;s the only season where they make a big deal of it being a &quot;long day&quot; &#8211; probably because it starts at midnight, and assuming jack got up at 8am the dat before, then it does make it longer than the later seasons where the season starts during the day. Has the clock never ticked back in after a break to show jack coming out of the men&#8217;s room?</p>

		<p>The first season was nasty in that it started around midnight; later seasons have tended to start early in the morning (which is a bit of a cheat), so staying up six hours longer isn&#8217;t really a big deal.</p>

		<p>[If I say that my product doesn&#8217;t suck, then I&#8217;m arrogant. If I say that my product sucks, then I&#8217;m arrogant. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s the pre-emptive snarky comments that you&#8217;re objecting to. You&#8217;re objecting to me. Which is still a perfectly legitimate reason to unsubscribe. I&#8217;d just prefer that you be honest about why you&#8217;re leaving. -Raymond]</p>
<p>Your premptive snarks don&#8217;t come across as saying your product sucks. They come across as making fun of anyone who levels a criticism against your product by comparing it to a statement that has no value. This is something you do very often without realising it. It&#8217;s why people who don&#8217;t know you well acuse you of having a thermonuclear personality. It&#8217;s not hard to see you&#8217;re a kind humble person, if you look hard enough. But most people only give a single glance before forming their opinion.</p>

		<p>Congratulations Raymond! &nbsp;You know that you and your blog have worth when losers line up to insult you and/or say goodbye. &nbsp;If you and your blog didn&#8217;t matter then no-one would ever bother &#8211; they&#8217;d just leave.</p>
<p>Wanna-bs, posers, Conrads, Alis, and the like don&#8217;t care to be shown their foolishness or their mistakes. &nbsp;They don&#8217;t care to learn, especially when what they learn is that they don&#8217;t know as much as they thought. &nbsp;They don&#8217;t care to grow except in their ego.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve appreciated and applauded your efforts in aiding and assisting others for over a decade (when you first assisted me in the newgroups). &nbsp;You rock Raymond. &nbsp;Ignore the guys who crawl from under their rocks. &nbsp;They&#8217;re more suited to thedailywtf &#8211; as examples. &nbsp;They couldn&#8217; find the humor in that site either.</p>

		<p>@ Long offtopic comment: Raymond is making fun of people who post criticisms against his product that are completely off topic. &nbsp;For example, it seems there are a few people who read this blog who post some random criticism of vista in the comments of a blog posting about a movie. In that sense, the criticisms really do add no value to the current discussion.</p>

<p>The reason we never see any restroom breaks on 24: because nothing escapes Jack Bauer!</p>

		<p>There is plenty of time on 24 for Jack to hit the restroom. &nbsp;He&#8217;s not in every scene. &nbsp;But, they would do good to throw the audience a bone and show him exciting the restroom at a scene change one time just as Lost had one scene of Jack shaving to explain why people on the island don&#8217;t seem to be growing beards. &nbsp;&#8212; I thought they also did a decent job of explaining why the fat guy doesn&#8217;t get thin. :)</p>

		<p>&quot;I simply assumed it was the same as 24, except that Jack Bauer gets some sleep.&quot;</p>
<p>ROFLOL! (OK without the rolling bit but with the out loud bit.)</p>
<p>In defense of the pre-emptive snarky comment, the best ideas that i come up with come when i&#8217;m about to sleep or just started to (can be difficult to tell the difference).</p>

		<p>I think Raymond keeps the comments open not because of evil intentions, but rather because sometimes we get interesting technical discussions, with good comments and sometimes even good (or not good but common) questions.</p>
<p>In those cases it&#8217;s completely worth it.</p>
<p>Pity about the 90% troll ratio, though.</p>
