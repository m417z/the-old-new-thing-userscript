		<p>You normally go to lengths to make sure companies who write bad code etc aren&#8217;t named and shamed, but here you make a personal attack on an idividual&#185;.</p>
<p>I understand why you may dislike Naveen or view him with scepticism, but is a little consistancy too much to ask? &#8230;I&#8217;d rather you named everyone that no-one btw!</p>
<p>&#185;What, no &#8216;The opinions expressed herein are my own and are not an official position of Microsoft Corporation&#8217;?</p>

		<p>Okay, this is fascinating! The entry has been updated again, and Raymond&#8217;s name has been removed but it is mentioned that he&#8217;s a Program Manager (with citation to this blog entry). Raymond actually said he was a middle manager, so it&#8217;s likely that Naveen&#8217;s actual designation may have been more on the lines of Lead/Group PM. I can&#8217;t believe Wikipedia moderators are this active &#8211; it&#8217;s truly amazing!</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t see this as being inconsistent at all. &nbsp;Developers who write bad code are just ignorant (usually); this guy is a major league asshole.</p>

		<p>Jain&#8217;s personal web page (linked from Wikipedia) has a quite overblown-sounding biography. &nbsp;He &quot;worked on several crucial projects&quot; such as OS/2, Windows NT, and Windows 95. &nbsp;I presume that many Microsoft employees who worked at Microsoft in the same time period, would have &quot;worked on&quot; those same projects.</p>
<p>Then he &quot;got tired of making billions for Bill.&quot; &nbsp;Wow.</p>

		<p>Wow, Jain&#8217;s biography says he won the &quot;Albert Einstein Technology Medal&quot;. &nbsp;Wikipedia says this is formally called the &quot;Albert Einstein award&quot; and comes with a gold medal.</p>
<p>It is an award for work in theoretical physics. &nbsp;Jain has never won it.</p>
<p>There are other similarly named awards:</p>
<p>The Albert Einstein Medal <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein_Medal" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein_Medal</a> is an award presented by the Albert Einstein Society in Bern. &nbsp;From what I can see, Jain has not won this.</p>
<p>The Albert Einstein World Award of Science <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/winners-science.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/winners-science.php</a> &quot;was created as a means of recognition, and as an incentive to scientific and technological research and development. It takes into special consideration those researches, which have brought true benefit and well being to mankind&quot;. &nbsp;From what I can see, Jain has not won this award either.</p>
<p>It sounds like Jain is deluded and makes up things.</p>

		<p>The founder of eXfuze, an MLM company with an 8-ball compensation plan that screams &quot;pyramid scam&quot; to anyone in the know is apparently &quot;a former Microsoft executive&quot;.</p>
<p>Much is made of this, but with such high employee numbers the statistics suggest Microsoft&#8217;s ex-employees ought to include among them a fair share of fraudsters, and even more serious criminals, as well as the novelists, Olympic athletes, oboe players or Price Is Right contestants.</p>
<p>In fact it would be odd if we discovered that no ex-Microsoft employees were involved in anything shady &#8211; they&#8217;re not saints after all.</p>

		<p>The discussion page on Jain&#8217;s Wikipedia entry is actually more interesting than the article itself.</p>

		<p>When I read that headline I thought it was going to be something about the use of the Prefix &#8216;Inteli&#8217; &nbsp;&#8211; as Microsoft use that a lot (InteliMouse and InteliSense spring to mind) but I was totally wrong ! Interesting read anyway :)</p>

<p>All three changes to the article today are by the same editor. It&#8217;s just a single guy thinking over what it should say.</p>
<p>(And Wikipedia has no &#8220;moderators&#8221;).</p>

		<p>[And also violating Wikipedia policy by using a primary instead of a secondary source. -Raymond]</p>
<p>Yes, but a primary source is better than no source at all (which was the prior state of the article), and he later found a secondary source.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I would imagine that identifying code that Raymond sees at work would open him/Ms up to liability and at the very least make people less willing to send him code to fix. Naveen, not so much &#8211; his whole business model is creepy.</p>
