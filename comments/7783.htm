		<p>Am I the only one wondering what did the poor tiff filed do to the customer so that they didn&#39;t want people to (easily) view them?</p>

		<p>Probably scared due to an exploit in some application they were using that associated with TIFFs.</p>
<p>Yeah this is a case where it would be nice to know what the customer&#39;s ACTUAL problem is before deciding on a solution.</p>

		<p>The real problem here is a separation between creation of company policy and its implementation.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the employee analogy is quite apt. There are plenty of reasons I wouldn&#39;t want employees (even trusted ones) from sneaking around in ventilation shafts, but few reasons I wouldn&#39;t want them all to have a key to the front door.</p>

		<p>Well, maybe it&#39;s not really a security requirement, since policy allows them to set their own associations; maybe it&#39;s just a handy reminder to think about what they&#39;re doing when they do so. &nbsp;It&#39;s a speedbump at the entrance to the carpark so people slow down and don&#39;t dent anyone else&#39;s car, not a lock on the front door.</p>

		<p>I suppose that you could break Windows&#39; auto-repair by explicitly putting deny-all write permissions on the registration keys, but I don&#39;t see any good coming from that method. Tinkering with system internals is rarely a good thing.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a pretty silly restriction anyways, because most image viewers don&#39;t care about the file extension (try renaming a JPEG to .BMP and it will probably open just fine!)</p>

<p>All security policies at companies and organisations I&#39;ve worked for were like that I&#39;m afraid. Not to mention the fact that in two independent instances the user password was [ company name + same suffix ] for all users and couldn&#39;t be changed due to self-contradictory password policies. Yes, my account was a developer account that had more access than the regular admin accounts.</p>

		<p>@ErikF: &quot;I suppose that you could break Windows&#39; auto-repair by explicitly putting deny-all write permissions on the registration keys [&#8230;]&quot;</p>
<p>No, because then the autorepair feature for the registry kicks in and resets those permissions.</p>
<p>Well, not really, but you can see how this could be escalated.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a little surprised I&#39;m the first one to ask this question: why did people feel the need for an autorepair feature for associations in the first place, and why was .TIFF included in the list? I&#39;m guessing users aren&#39;t expected to delete these associations by accident, so perhaps broken programs did so. I smell a good story.</p>

		<p>@JM, it&#39;s quite common to install a program that handles extensions that another installed program already handles, so the new program might take over images or web pages from the program that previously handled them. &nbsp;Usually(?) it will prompt before doing so, though this may have been less common formerly. &nbsp;If you then uninstall the new program, has it kept a record of the original file associations? &nbsp;If not, it will presumably either delete them or (worse perhaps) leave them associated with a now-uninstalled program.</p>

<p>&quot;Wow! If I pass an image file to DirectShow, it will render its content to the display surface! Let&#39;s associate by default the BMP, GIF, JPG, PNG and TIF extensions to our Super Amazing Hyper Media Player, and pretend it is a picture viewer! It doesn&#39;t matter that it takes 20 seconds and 500 MB of RAM to launch &#8211; the user will be amazed!&quot; Yes, s/he will be, definitely. But not in a good way :-( .</p>

		<p>@dave: It&#39;s not always entirely the apps fault. If they obligingly saved the user&#39;s previous associations and the user then goes and uninstalls that old app (because their new picture viewer is teh awesome!) then restoring them on uninstall isn&#39;t any better tham never backing them up in the first place. The whole process of managing what installed apps can and can&#39;t open certain file types and what they default to on uninstall is something better left to the OS. Thankfully Windows 8 seems to be doing more to ensure this.</p>

		<p>I have a sneaking suspicion I know why they would want to disable viewing of TIFF files&#8230; once upon a time, TIFF was the only format in which patent images were available. Lots of companies have default policies against employees reading patents unless they *really* need to. </p>
<p>Either that or someone implemented a static Snow Crash virus and was faxing it with automatic forwarding to people&#39;s email. </p>

		<p>Natively, Windows XP did not support viewing of TIF files, as Kodak Imaging for Windows was not included in WinXP. (kb308979). &nbsp;I know this as it was a one of the major issues that was preventing a 20,000+ WinXP deployment for one of my customers.</p>
<p>My customer had a corporate accounting package which stored scanned (from paper copy) invoices. &nbsp;The customer could view the invoice by pressing a button, and Kodak Imaging would load. &nbsp;The invoices &nbsp;were stored in TIF format.</p>
<p>&quot;Worked with Windows 2000, but not in WinXP! &nbsp;You can&#39;t deploy WinXP until you fix it.&quot;</p>
<p>Our Microsoft Technical Account Manager helped us out by providing us with something called &#39;Windows XP Professional Direct CD Imaging Control&#39;. &nbsp;It worked a treat.</p>

The accountant need a program that requires Kodak Imaging automation to work, but have a new WinXP PC installed about 1 month ago. In the end, I found the old Win2000 installation disk, found the INF file and the files listed in the INF and copied to the accountant&#39;s machine, right click the INF and install.

		<p>It makes you wonder whether file associations should be stored in a stack. Say the following happens:</p>
<p>(1) Program &#39;A&#39; associates with BMP. BMP association stack = {A}.</p>
<p>(2) Program &#39;B&#39; steals that file association. Stack now = {A,B}.</p>
<p>(3) Program &#39;C&#39; steals it! Stack = {A,B,C}.</p>
<p>(4) Program &#39;B&#39; is uninstalled. &#39;B&#39;s uninstaller removes all of &#39;B&#39;s entries in all file association stacks. BMP stack now = {A,C}.</p>
<p>(5) Program &#39;C&#39; is uninstalled. &#39;C&#39;s uninstaller removes all of &#39;C&#39;s entries in all file association stacks. BMP stack now = {A}.</p>
<p>Voila! Despite the out of order uninstalls, BMP&#39;s have now correctly reverted to opening in the last still-present program that associated with them.</p>
<p>Yes? No?</p>

		<p>Surprised nobody&#39;s mentioned this, instead of assuming some terrible kind of anti-security to protect poorly protected files. Maybe the company used some other program that saved its files as .TIF (e.g. &quot;Truetech Information Files&quot;) and people without the app installed (because of licensing issues) were opening them with the default .TIF viewer and corrupting the files? Seems more likely.</p>
<p>As for why IT would want to stop people sneaking in through ventilation shafts when everyone has a front door key &#8211; sometimes auditing access is critical, even when everyone has access.</p>

		<p>@Wisefaq: I don&#39;t think that&#39;d be any legal issue as long as you have license sticker of Win2000 on that box. As the press release of removal of Kodak Imaging said, you&#39;re allowed to continue using it if you upgrade it from Win2000, I think as long as you fulfilled the licensing condition of a Win2000 to WinXP upgrade, there shouldn&#39;t be problem.</p>

I have to right-click the .TIF file and choose Properties (not so easy when the .TIF file is an attachment in a fax-to-email message) and then where it says &quot;Opens With: Unknown [Change]&quot; I click Change and then the repair kicks in &#8211; so I can actually cancel the change, so to speak.</p>

<p>Being well aware we could *technically* do that, we were not licensed to do so. &nbsp;Which we confirmed with Microsoft at the time. &nbsp;And it was a solution which wouldn&#39;t scale either.</p>
<p>ie. the &quot;new&quot; owner of Kodak Imaging at that time (eiStream), probably wouldn&#39;t have cared if we did what you suggested &nbsp;for 1 desktop, but for 20,000 desktops, my customer and I would have been a good target for ligation over license violations.</p>

		<p>The simplest solution is to fix the stupid company security policy. But to some people it is obviously more preferable to let thousands suffer than to admit a mistake.</p>

		<p>I think it&#39;s safe to say the people who implement the policy don&#39;t care and think it&#39;s stupid to do it too, but if it&#39;s coming from higherup you just follow orders, so you implement it, no matter how stupid it is..</p>

		<p>Maybe the customer was using Small Business server 2003, you know, the Microsoft product that requires all users to be administrators on their own machines?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Wait, you&#39;re saying that the customer set up each employee to log into the central server for normal day-to-day activities? I think I found the problem. -Raymond</i>]</div>
