		<p>Ah yes the oldest case of a boolean pointer. It might be entertaining to write a hundred bytes or so to disk at that point to see what it points too, but I can&#39;t imagine what there is to do with it. Can&#39;t do much w/ no heap anyway.</p>

		<p>So what is the point of calling the DLL entry point in this case? &nbsp;Why doesn&#39;t Win32 just terminate the main thread too?</p>

		<p>@Joshua: I&#39;d expect the pointer to point to something useful in the DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH or DLL_THREAD_ATTACH cases, and to have been repurposed as a boolean in the DLL_PROCESS_DETACH or DLL_THREAD_DETACH cases. Something internal like the PEB, the TEB, or the PE header.</p>
<p>Wine seems to always either pass 0 or 1 as the pointer, so even if it ever pointed to something useful, there should not be many programs in the wild depending on it.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#39;s a Win16 leftover? I found a documentation for Win16&#39;s LibMain where the last parameter was lpszCmdLine. So my final guess would be: in DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH, when the DLL was imported directly by the executable, it was originally designed to point to the command line or something related to the command line, to ease porting from Win16; when the DLL was loaded dynamically, it&#39;s NULL. In all the other cases (thread attach and thread/process detach), it&#39;s free, so it was overloaded in the DLL_PROCESS_DETACH case to allow the DLLs to know when to free resources or not (as explained by Raymond in this post).</p>

		<p>[How would you implement C++ global destructors? -Raymond]</p>
<p>It&#39;s not safe to call global destructors, too, because those objects can try to free some heap buffers, without knowing it&#39;s not safe.</p>
<p>It would make sense, though, to have some global flag in HeapFree, set at ExitProcess call time, to skip actual heap freeing.</p>

		<p>&quot;[How would you implement C++ global destructors? -Raymond]&quot;</p>
<p>Since you couldn&#39;t generally depend on those destructors not doing dangerous stuff with the heap, perhaps you would decide that it is better not to call those destructors in this case. :)</p>

<p>I also am in the habit of trying to make sure that all threads besides the main thread exits before the application itself closes. Obviously that isn&#39;t always possible though.</p>

		<p>@Yuhong Bao: It seems you nailed it. Searching the web for &quot;DllMain PCONTEXT&quot; returns articles like this one: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.nynaeve.net/?p=127">http://www.nynaeve.net/?p=127</a></p>
<p>From that article: &quot;Win9x is, of course, completely dissimilar as far as DllMain goes. None of this information applies there.&quot;</p>
<p>&#8230;so yeah, it screams &quot;implementation detail&quot;, as I had expected.</p>

		<p>@Ishai: We drew different lessons. You concluded &quot;don&#39;t do anything in DllMain().&quot; I concluded &quot;Make sure your threads are done before exiting the process.&quot; &nbsp;If you write a DLL and use threads, design a way to make the threads exit before DllMain gets called. Correctly implement DllCanUnloadNow(). Etc. (I once had a case where the ATL framework gave me the wrong result for DllCanUnloadNow() and I had to write my own, possibly because I did something wrong with ATL).</p>

		<p>@Raymond: If I discover that a library I use calls ExitProcess, or any of its cousins, like abort() or TerminateProcess(), I will at the least rewrite my use of the library to prevent the code-path that triggers it. &nbsp;At worst, I will happily take the hit to replace the library. &nbsp;I feel that strongly about it.</p>
<p>I realize that doesn&#39;t work when your product supports run-time configuration of plug-ins. &nbsp;I haven&#39;t worked on a product that relied heavily on plug-ins, and when encountering such a plug-in, I have been known to ask CS to tell users with it to uninstall it.</p>
<p>I also realize there are exceptional circumstances, such as a rarely seen exception. &nbsp;Depending how often it occurs, I might have bigger priorities, but again, my preference would be to either rewrite code to avoid that exception from being thrown, or write an error-handler for it and exit cleanly, if possible.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>I&#39;m not talking about some random DLL calling ExitProcess. That&#39;s also rude. I&#39;m talking about you, a DLL, a guest in someone else&#39;s house, creating additional rules for the house. You may not even have been invited to the house by the owner. Maybe the main process loaded a DLL, and that DLL in turn loads your DLL. How can the intermediate DLL communicate its restrictions back to the host process? -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@Raymond, after I see your response to Joshua, I realized you mean, how do I prevent someone from calling ExitProcess before my threads in my DLL is finished. &nbsp;When I provide a DLL, I usually provide it through COM interfaces, and I rely on DllCanUnloadNow() to tell me when it&#39;s time to exit and let the host know it is safe to do so, as the name implies. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know how safe that is, but I have generally have had good luck with it. &nbsp;Also, such DLLs rarely has as much in-memory state that I&#39;m concerned about losing (for instance, I don&#39;t remember the last time I have had any critical IO going on inside a DLL.) &nbsp;</p>

		<p>@Raymond: Yes, the call is a foregone conclusion, and I learned that the hard way, but I still get the chance to check on internal state and do my housekeeping. &nbsp;By this time, any threads I started will have been told it&#39;s time to quit, so all I have to do is WaitFor&#8230;(). &nbsp;My worker threads tend to exit quickly when told to do so.</p>

		<p>&gt; What is this inconsistent heap state that MSDN is talking about here?</p>

		<p>[it&#39;s your responsibility to follow the host process&#39;s rules, not vice versa.) -Raymond]</p>
<p>Which has led to me on more than one occasion when using a DLL with different rules, to isolate it by spawning another EXE and marshaling calls to it. The general form of this rule is not being followed at all. Especially when some EXEs have the rule &quot;Don&#39;t create windows&quot; or &quot;Don&#39;t start COM (because of the previous rule)&quot;.</p>

		<p>&gt; [Hwo do you prevent someone from calling ExitProcess before your threads are finished? -Raymond]</p>
<p>You don&#39;t. ExitProcess (and abort()) etc are all dangerous functions if the caller doesn&#39;t know that there is only one thread currently running. If you&#39;re writing a DLL, implement some kind of &quot;detach&quot; function if one is provided, and expect your EXE to call it before aborting your background threads.</p>
<p>If the EXE doesn&#39;t have some interface whereby it calls your DLL to safely tell you that it&#39;s about to yank out your threads from under you via ExitProcess, then the fault for the deadlocks and memory corruptions that might ensue are the fault of the caller of ExitProcess, not the fault of the DLL that failed to safely recover from it.</p>

		<p>I remember the API documentation of some webcam explicitly said that you have to call &lt;their_DLL_name&gt;_Cleanup() before exit or the cam will fail to initialize the next time you want to load it.</p>
<p>Maybe when all else fails, just create separate function that allow the hosting process calls for cleanup?</p>
<p>Generally if someone always fails the second time, the programmer should know they should check the documentation or ask.</p>

		<p>Probably, but the parts I&#39;m interested in are more OS-interaction specific, and those seem to not be in his domain of expertise. You can&#39;t really point to a section in the standard for what happens to thread_local variables in a DLL when the DLL is dynamically unloaded. But, thank you.</p>
