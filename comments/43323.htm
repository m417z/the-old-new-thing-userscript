		<p>Is that a few hard drives with TENS of Megabytes I spy? Who would ever need that much disk space. Next you will be telling me I need the whole 640kB of ram just for my OS, preposterous I say!</p>

		<p>What, no prices?</p>
<p>I recently found a Micron catalog for &quot;Holiday 1997&quot;. &nbsp;16MB of memory was $55.99. &nbsp;64MB was $248.00. &nbsp;A 17&quot; monitor was $499.99. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A ClientPro VXE 166 computer (with a 166MHz Pentium) was $1449.00. &nbsp;A Millenia MME 266MHz computer with 48MB of SDRAM and Office 97 SBE was $2199.00. &nbsp;Monitor included. &nbsp;(Office 97 Pro was $259.99, close to the same price it is now.)</p>
<p>If you wanted to go all the way to a server-class 300 MHz Pentium II processor, with 64MB memory, the price was $6199.00.</p>
<p>Good times&#8230;..</p>

		<p>It blows my mind that companies like Broderbund and Sierra are, for the most part, distant memories, but some of our business areas are still using Lotus Notes. Then again, that business software category would logically have a lot more staying power than the others just by nature of the sector.</p>

		<p>The Microsoft Mouse at position 2&#8230; I still remember my Logitech MouseMan with fondness, but it wasn&#39;t introduced until 1990. And to this day I&#39;m still replacing my mouse when I get a new computer &#8212; now I couldn&#39;t live with a free-spin wheel.</p>
<p>My keyboard, not so much. As far as I&#39;m concerned development of that stopped with the Model M. I have a modern remake that includes the Windows keys, but that&#39;s it.</p>

		<p>@John:</p>
<p>Broderbund specializes in educational software; they&#39;re very much still around. &nbsp;They always were focused on the educational market, with the other software as kind of a tag-along. &nbsp;Where else are you going to find an app to teach you to play the violin, complete with a working violin?</p>

		<p>Daisywheel? &nbsp;That brings back the memories. &nbsp;My dad had a daisywheel-based printer hooked up to a series of bitty boxes through the 70s-90s, but I think the last system to use it was an Amiga 500. &nbsp;When we finally got a Windows 95 PC, we got an inkjet to go with it. &nbsp;With patience, it could produce 300dpi output!</p>
<p>Whenever my mom complained about the noise of the daisywheel, he&#39;d tell her to be thankful it wasn&#39;t a chain printer.</p>

		<p>What surprised me most about the list is that MS Word was actually on the list nearly a half-year longer (161 weeks vs. 138) than WordPerfect!</p>

		<p>I longed for a FileCard. This was a 3.5&quot; disk, welded to an ISA controller board. One slot, no bays, big drive (for the time). About the size of a modern high-end video card, but generated far less heat (although it ran very hot for its day).</p>

		<p>I remember using most of the software titles for the Apple II listed there. Back in the day. I feel old.</p>
<p>@Gabe: Microsoft Word and WordPerfect were second generation word processors. They replaced the first generation kings: Wordstar and Apple Writer, both from the late 70s.</p>

		<p>I remember the first NEC MultiSync with fondness. Before that, every time you changed adapters you basically needed a new display, so the ability to keep the display was amazing! There was one at my high school and it managed to last almost 10 years before the vacuum tube inside started to die. Its last use was to display VGA on an original 2-floppy, 64KB, 4.77 MHz IBM PC with a 10MB HardCard and a 512KB multifunction card; I think that we even were able to get Windows 2.0 installed, although you didn&#39;t want to actually use it because the computer was so frustratingly slow. It still beat the pathetic Olivettis that we had kicking around though! Good times.</p>
