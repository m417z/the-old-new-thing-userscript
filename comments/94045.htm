		<p>So in other words, OOBE asks Windows Update for just the high-priority ZDPs.</p>
<p>And if the machine is not connected to the internet during OOBE, are the OOBE ZDPs treated as normal ZDPs or do they get installed as soon as you connect?</p>

		<p>I helped build the feature to download and install the OOBE ZDP in Windows 8.1. Having been there, I have some minor quibbles in terminology.</p>
<p>First, the P in ZDP did not stand for &#8220;Package.&#8221; It may do so now through usage, but in the original specs, the P was for &#8220;Priority,&#8221; as in &#8220;Zero Day Priority update.&#8221; We often talked about the &#8220;ZDP update&#8221; in the Windows Update team; unlike &#8220;ZDP package&#8221; in your definition, this was no redundancy.</p>
<p>Second, while I think the User Experience team folks who built the OOBE part of the feature called the update installed by OOBE the &#8220;OOBE ZDP update,&#8221; our custom in Windows Update was just to call it the &#8220;ZDP update.&#8221; The update that is available on Windows&#8217; release day, but _not_ installed by OOBE, was called the &#8220;General Availability update,&#8221; or &#8220;GA update,&#8221; not the ZDP update or ZDP. And of course this update existed for Windows versions prior 8.1, when the OOBE ZDP was introduced.</p>
<p>These definitions by me are probably about 2 years out of date, but they were correct then as I remember it.</p>
<p>Besides those minor definition issues, the discussion seems 100% right. No complaints there&#8230;</p>
<p>skSdnW:<br />
&gt; And if the machine is not connected to the internet during OOBE, are the OOBE ZDPs treated as normal ZDPs or do they get installed as soon as you connect?</p>
<p>My memory is fuzzy on what happens if the computer starts OOBE disconnected but then gets the network cable plugged in/connected to the wireless network during OOBE.</p>
<p>But if the computer is disconnected throughout all of OOBE, then the OOBE ZDP update is downloaded and installed automatically during normal computer usage, but may still be installed faster than other updates.</p>
<p>This is because OOBE ZDP updates are published in a special update category within the Windows Update system. (You can see this category in the WSUS list in the first linked blog.) This category makes OOBE ZDP updates, at least in Windows 8.1, eligible for &#8220;accelerated install&#8221; &#8211; download and install during the first 24 hours after OOBE completes, during which time automatically downloading and installing other updates is suspended to reduce the frequency and length of reboots when you are first using the computer.</p>

		<p>(Just to be clear, my discussion of &#8220;accelerated install&#8221; only applies to Windows 8.1, and not necessarily to Windows 10 or future Windows versions.)</p>

		<p>&gt; This artificial delay before installing the ZDP means that the official release version of Windows needs to be solid enough to survive a week without any help.</p>
<p>Call me whatever you like, but I really miss the good old days when the official release version of Windows needed to be solid enough to survive&#8230; like&#8230; forever?..</p>

		<p>That would result in much less new features, since every feature you add or change is one that could potentially fail. Nice-to-haves like virtual desktops would not make it over the then much higher hurdle.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s safe to say there was never a say when the release-day version of Windows was solid enough to last forever.</p>
<p>It just meant that bugs were not fix &#8211; because it was the days when people did not have Internet access. If you were ambitious, you could go to <a href="http://ftp.microsoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://ftp.microsoft.com</a> and download a service pack. I still have the box with the twenty-some-off 3.5&#8243; floppies of Windows NT 3.5 in my closet. But it has bugs that would today would be classified as critical.</p>

		<p>OS released with bugs that these days would be classified as &#8220;critical&#8221; and yet &#8220;mission critical&#8221; systems were successfully built and deployed on top of said systems.</p>
<p>Makes one wonder exactly what &#8220;critical&#8221; means and whether we haven&#8217;t just gotten a little bit soft in the intervening years.  :)</p>

		<p>Maybe something about dozens of developer-years, millions in coss and totally forzen and unmovable codebase with very little featores or user-friendliness running for decades after manufacture supported system on extremly outdated hardware.</p>
<p>And still with load of bugs and missing features (either old promised or new wanted by users). And cost of maintenance continually rising&#8230;</p>

		<p>Let me say that, in fact, we didn&#8217;t get anything but yet another level of UX complexity by nagging a user with requests to update (or just updating silently, like some version of a well-known S-something-E messenger used to do).</p>
<p>In those days one wouldn&#8217;t update if (s)he didn&#8217;t want/feel the need to, now they still ignore the requests, but the experience became more annoying. Maybe some statistics lie^Wshow that the new way to force updates made our world safer, I can&#8217;t believe it is true: from what I can see, those who do update at least weekly would do it even if it meant downloading (or buying a disc with already downloaded) a service pack manually or &#8220;offline&#8221;. But the rest, those who are in the group of the biggest risk, just cancel it. Because it&#8217;s annoying. Because it takes &#8220;too long&#8221;.</p>
<p>I even saw notebook owners who thought their notebooks were broken. Why? Because Windows got stuck updating itself for a few hours. I also had a few &#8220;chances&#8221; to update Windows on a brand new notebook the whole night with about 300-400 updates. Installing service packs took much less time.</p>
<p>What I try to say is that the way updates are delivered nowadays don&#8217;t really solve any of the problems of past days. Maybe just hides some of them. People still use slow and expensive Internet connections (hello, 3G Internet in a country-side house far from towns and cities!), still need to do their work no matter how important and critical the update is. People are still lazy. It&#8217;s not the way it should be done. What is &#8220;the right way&#8221;? I don&#8217;t know either. But was it worth changing anything? Not for me.</p>

		<p>I still think that every programmer only releases code that he or she thinks is not only defensible, but good.  Despite this, humanity still sent probes to Mars and to Jupiter&#8217;s moon with bugs. Meh. It&#8217;s a learning experience, and the more people and complexity involved the better.</p>

		<p>Humm&#8230; I&#8217;d imagine that if those ZDP exists and internet connection is available when the product installer is launched, those patches should have had slipstreamed into the update process, much like when I install the VS IDE updates. (The installer will also download other updates applicable and try to install them in one go in order to reduce the number of reboot involved.)</p>
