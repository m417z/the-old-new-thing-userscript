		<p>I have trouble buying that&#8230; I mean Microsoft&#8217;s Speech recognition lags on my 2.8Ghz machine with 1GB of RAM, what chance will it have on whatever processor they can fit inside a pen body? Not to mention the entire scanner that reads text in (from the page? or as it&#8217;s written?). </p>
<p>I would also like to add that it is not very functional if you think about it. I mean you&#8217;re sitting in the library writing up some essay and the pen is talking to you? RI&#8211;GH&#8211;T that won&#8217;t be annoying at all will it. </p>
<p>One thing dyslexics don&#8217;t want is to stand out in a crowd (in relation to writing). If you are going to get a pen that talks to you, why not just get a giant red stick that glues to your head that reads: &quot;I&#8217;m stupid&quot;? </p>
<p>Not that I&#8217;m saying speech recognition isn&#8217;t extremely helpful while proof-reading stuff in Microsoft Word (dyslexic or otherwise).</p>

		<p>Manip: That&#8217;s not a very big problem &#8211; just use a headset&#8230; a little mini-jack plug shouldn&#8217;t be impossible to add to a pen.</p>

<p>It is in swedish but it has an picture of the pen. </p>
<p>It uses a headset so it is safe to use in the library for reading, maybe not to have it write for you&#8230; ;) </p>

		<p>Well the headset is a good idea&#8230; Having &#8216;ISpell&#8217; down the side &#8211; not such a great idea&#8230; </p>
<p>I was considering it and I see another problem, dyslexics can&#8217;t learn to read because they have an under-formed area of the brain where they &#8216;understand&#8217; sounds of words. If you use the pen instead of practising, this area of the brain will remain under-developed and in fact the pen will only make things worse, not better. </p>
<p>Really the only cure to dyslexia is not magic pens, it&#8217;s not coloured card, it&#8217;s not psychical activity &lt;shudder&gt; it is good old fashioned practise. Instead of taking dyslexic kids and side tracking them with crazy ideas that don&#8217;t work you could have them read a lot more than their &#8216;normal&#8217; peers and write a lot more too. </p>
<p>Writing won&#8217;t improve much without help but reading, by just reading will improve all on its own.</p>
