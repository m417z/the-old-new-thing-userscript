		<p>What is this semi-audible chord you speak of? &nbsp;I&#8217;ve never been to a casino, nor do I expect to anytime. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I first brought my new noise-canceling headphones to work, I was surprised to find out there was a considerable level of white noise going on that I&#8217;d never noticed. &nbsp;A coworker told me it was done because it reduces the perception of crowd noise in our converted-warehouse office building.</p>

		<p>i saw a presentation by the leader of the group a few months ago and I was completely underwhelmed. I&#8217;ve seen people make great music with two sticks and a piece of string, or with random bits of electronics, but this was really technology for technology&#8217;s sake. After the presentation someone asked (completely reasonably IMO) for the leader to hum the tune of one of their pieces and the guy pretended not to understand the question. yawn.</p>
