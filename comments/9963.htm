		<p>My guess: No because it will only change the menu, not the buttons (which are tied to the window styles), and the WM_INITMENU will disable them again. &nbsp;Just set the window styles.</p>
<p>My second guess if the first one is wrong: Yes, but only if it was possible in Win 3.11 and some programs still rely on that behavior.</p>

		<p>Come on, &quot;Question for Microsoft&quot; is such a helpful, explanatory subject line for a message!</p>

		<p>The &quot;question for Microsoft&quot; subject line is an example of a very common problem.</p>
<p>For example, I edit a newsletter. &nbsp;If you were to write an article for me, you might well call it &quot;newsletter_article.doc&quot; because that might fit your naming scheme. &nbsp;Of course, that wouldn&#39;t work for me to have so many similarly named files. &nbsp;I might change it to &quot;raymond_chen.doc&quot; which would be very helpful to identify the file in my directory. &nbsp;However, it wouldn&#39;t be a useful name on your end.</p>

		<p>I think that many would find it helpful if email clients auto created a subject, based on the contents of the email, in the event that the subject field was blank. If it were useful, more and more people wouldn&#39;t fill in the subject in the first place, and we&#39;d get more useful email subjects.</p>

		<p>@jader: If it was possible to auto-generate a quality summary, e-mail clients would display that instead of the sender-specified subject line. &nbsp;It&#39;s a very very difficult problem in general though. &nbsp;(Most) Humans are still better at writing human-readable summaries than any computer algorithm</p>

		<p>Re. &quot;question for Microsoft&quot;:</p>
<p>Every man and his dog, has at some stage written a blog post: &quot;How To Ask Your Question Effectively&quot;. Unfortunately, the people who really need to read that post, will never actually do so. The only people who&#39;ll actually read that post, are the very people who don&#39;t need to!</p>

		<p>jader3rd: Word does something similar for file names. When you save an untitled document, it will helpfully suggest the first few words from the document as filename. This has worked for me in many cases.</p>
<p>However, for e-mail I&#39;m afraid we&#39;ll end up with courtesies as titles: &quot;Hello Raymond, hope you can answer this&quot;&#8230;</p>

		<p>You stated:</p>
<p>&lt;blockquote&gt;It also meant that there was one less thing you had to change when porting your program to Windows 95.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
<p>You meant &quot;fewer&quot;, not less. (Sorry, knee jerk for these, almost OCD level you know.)</p>

		<p>We got off topic (maybe I led us there), but the original point of the article was in line with &quot;don&#39;t do work now that you can do later, or never do&quot;. &nbsp;That&#39;s always a good idea, as long as everyone understands it.</p>
