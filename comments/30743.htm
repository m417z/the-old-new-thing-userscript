		<p>The tooltip doesn&#8217;t have a black border on Windows 2000. &nbsp;Any clue ?</p>
<p>Worst on Vista, the tooltip has a black border once out of four&#8230;<br /></p>

		<p>As a note regarding GetTextExtentPoint at MSDN says:<br />
<br />&quot;This function is provided only for compatibility with 16-bit versions of Windows. Applications should call the GetTextExtentPoint32 function, which provides more accurate results.&quot;</p>
<p>So why not use the &quot;proper&quot; one? [besides not needing the increased accurancy]<br />
<br />Do you suggest to still be compatible with 16-bit Windows or did you use it just for simplicity&#8217;s sake? Just curious of your point of view.</p>
<p>Anyway thanks for the tip, Raymond!</p>

		<p>So, how did they get it so wrong in Microsoft Document Explorer for the tree view in the left pane, bundled with VS 2005? </p>
<p>If the pane is narrow (or the text is wide) the entire pane flickers when the tooltip is displayed. </p>
<p>Or are you still building with VC 6 Raymond, so haven&#8217;t had the japanese style flashing animations? </p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t expect you to know. &nbsp;It was more of a rhetorical discussion point; just wondered if you had noticed, and had perhaps applied your &quot;psychic powers&quot; of debugging as you&#8217;ve mentioned before.</p>
<p>Sorry if it came over the wrong way.</p>
<p>Your timing is spookily weird though sometimes. &nbsp;Just the other day I built a DDE server for a client, and what pops up, but an article on DDE from you.<br /></p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>This kind of posts are worth gold. Straight to the point, solving real-world programming problems.<br />
<br />The thing I just can&#8217;t understand is how many hours you can pack in 24! Keep up with the great blog.</p>

<p>First, imagine we could fix a bug in Windows in one day.</p>
<p>On the second day, imagine we fix two bugs in Windows. &nbsp;On the<br />
  third day, four bugs. &nbsp;Each day, imagine we double the number of<br />
  bugs we fix.</p>
<p>By the end of the twenty-seventh day, we would imagine that we&#8217;ve fixed all of the bugs in Windows.</p>
<p>I understand. &nbsp;In the real world, it isn&#8217;t going to happen.</p>
<p>&gt; nor inclination</p>
<p>Therefore we fix zero.</p>
<p>For this I almost have less understanding, but actually enough<br />
  experience working for other companies that prohibit bugfixing does<br />
  make me understand. &nbsp;After a while, everyone who has the<br />
  capability to fix bugs loses interest in trying to buck the system.<br />
  &nbsp;You even mentioned how you were penalized for your efforts to<br />
  help improve bug reduction in Windows 98. &nbsp;OK, I understand.</p>
<p>Time for a brainstorm.</p>
<p>Suppose you imagine that Outlook Express isn&#8217;t a crucial integral<br />
  component of a crucial integral component of Windows. &nbsp;Then you<br />
  could put an appcompat hack into Windows to work around the bug in the<br />
  third-party app. &nbsp;Oops sorry, this is more crackpot science,<br />

<p>OK, I give up. &nbsp;Sorry for disturbing you.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

<p>Be as impressed as you wish. &nbsp;Customers are located even farther away from that crucial component of a crucial component of your company&#8217;s product than you are. &nbsp;Somehow I have a feeling that even if a customer paid Microsoft&#8217;s fee to report a bug, the customer wouldn&#8217;t be able to get it fixed either.</p>
<p>While reading your article, I noticed its relevance to a long-standing bug. &nbsp;Temporarily I forgot that your company discourages bug fixing internally as much as it does with customers, therefore I made a worthless suggestion. &nbsp;Again I apologize to you for this lapse.

		<p>I&#8217;ve implemented something very similar to this some time ago. I<br />
respond to TTN_SHOW just like you do, but instead of using<br />
SendMessage(&#8230;, TTM_ADJUSTRECT, &#8230;), I call SetWindowPos() without<br />
SWP_NOSIZE and with the desired size. It works fine, but is it wrong?</p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>Without TTM_ADJUSTRECT, how do you know how big the tooltip should be (relative to your desired size) and how it should be positioned? Do you just hard-code a number? -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>&quot;therefore I made a worthless suggestion.&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s not that your suggestions are worthless, but instead it&#8217;s just that you complain so much that everything you say starts to become this annoying buzz that people try to ignore. &nbsp;Perhaps you can try to be constructive once in your life and you&#8217;ll actually get people who want work with you instead of wanting nothing to do with you.</p>
<p>Nobody likes a chronic complainer.<br /></p>

		<p>Sorry, I&#8217;ve never heard of TTM_ADJUSTRECT and I should have read the documentation before bothering you with this&#8230; You are right, I am &#8220;hard-coding&#8221; a number: it&#8217;s an owner-drawn list with an owner-drawn tooltip, so I know exactly how big the tooltip should be. Before reading about TTM_ADJUSTRECT on MSDN, I thought it was being used only to set the tooltip&#8217;s size.</p>

<br />&gt; Perhaps you can try to be constructive once<br />

<p>so I think I&#8217;m genetically incapable of it, sorry. &nbsp;The only constructive things I get to do are code.</p>

<p>Right. &nbsp;Even I don&#8217;t. &nbsp;I wish that the number of causes for complaint would go down.</p>
