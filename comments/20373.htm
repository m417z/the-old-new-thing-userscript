		<p>John &gt; Commenters to the original article also point out that timestamps should be stored and manipulated as UTC, and that they should be displayed/taken as user input in the local time format.</p>
<p>Where user input is ambiguous or invalid, the UI needs to get clarification, but then that&#8217;s always the case with validating user input.</p>
<p>Once it&#8217;s in the system, it should never be a problem.</p>

		<p>Karellen,</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not that simple. Consider a calendar manager, and a recurring meeting that happens every Friday at 2:00 PM. With high probability, this means 2:00 PM local time, even when daylight savings time kicks in or out.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it probably means 2:00 PM local, even if Congress changes the daylight savings time rules after the meeting was scheduled.</p>

		<p>The worst part is that the displayed time for dates beyond daylight time also shifts one hour. In Windows Explorer.</p>

		<p>Oh! That&#8217;s the reason a Windows Smart Phone alarm rings an hour early after the DST switch, if you program the alarm before the switch!</p>

		<p>@Jim Lyon:</p>
<p>What you describe has intersting implications when going global.</p>
<p>Say someone in California wants to schedule a recurring meeting Friday 2pm. Now, try and import that meeting inside a German calendar. The meeting invite has to really be handled as &quot;2pm current DST-correct pacific time&quot;, no matter what the time zone in Germany is. So&#8230; It would have an 8 hour difference this week, but 9 last week or next week (we are right in the week where Europe switched but not most of US).</p>
<p>In fact, what you really want to store is which timezone the invite was created in, no matter what timezone it will be used in.</p>
<p>Well, unless of course the person who created the invite wanted to schedule it at 3am German time. I never found a way in most Calendars to specify which time-zone I wanted to schedule my meeting in without changing my environment itself.</p>

		<p>Bahbar said: &nbsp;I never found a way in most Calendars to specify which time-zone I wanted to schedule my meeting in without changing my environment itself.</p>
<p>This is partly because, to the best of my knowledge, there aren&#8217;t any operating systems that track time changes for more than one locale at a time. World-wide, daylight savings time transitions occur at about 100 different times.</p>
<p>All of which goes to show that the notion of &quot;store it in UTC and don&#8217;t worry&quot; is overly simplistic.</p>

		<p>@Jim Lyon:</p>
<p>To be fair, Karellen was talking about timeSTAMPS, i.e. references to single, definite points on a global timescale. For these, storing things as UTC does solve everyting.</p>
<p>Finding out which point in absolute time to speak about in the first place is a different can of worms, but still mostly a user-interface one.</p>

		<p>Mr Cranky &gt; I can agree on that one!</p>
<p>FFS &#8211; if you want more daylight in your evenings over the summer, get up an hour earlier and work 7 &#8211; 5 instead of 8 &#8211; 6. You get the same effect, only you don&#8217;t need to make all the clocks in the damn country wrong!</p>
<p>I hardly know anyone who doesn&#8217;t have this sort of latitude in their working hours these days.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Apple&#8217;s iCal can do this. In preferences -&gt; Advanced check the &quot;Turn on time zone support&quot; box.</p>
<p>You can now select the time zone for each event and also change which time zone iCal is currently using for displaying events (top right of the window).</p>

<p>I already work 7 &#8211; 3:30. &nbsp;They won&#8217;t let me start at 6:00am (I usually get in the door around 6:20, and do my OT before the day starts)</p>
<p>(me? &nbsp;An early bird? &nbsp;what gives you that idea. &nbsp;Feels strange going to bed when it&#8217;s still light out in late June (hint, when you get up at 4:00am, bedtime comes real early)</p>

		<p>Random managed code / date handling story: I once installed Windows on a machine whose BIOS date was wrong. &nbsp;I mean well and truly wrong. &nbsp;I mean, so wrong that it is (1) a valid date and time for NTFS yet (2) not a valid date and time as far as the CLI&#8217;s filesystem handling code is concerned.</p>
<p>Result: all .NET applications throw an exception on startup, because they try to read the timestamp on the global assembly cache directory, and fail. &nbsp;Oops.</p>

		<p>Henning Makholm: good point.</p>
<p>Think of it this way. &nbsp;Most people work 9-5 (or some similar timeframe). &nbsp;That&#8217;s symmetrical around 1pm. &nbsp;The day (when we&#8217;re not in DST) is symmetrical around noon. &nbsp;Something&#8217;s wrong there. &nbsp;The day&#8217;s biased towards mornings being brighter and evenings darker&#8230;?!</p>
<p>DST all year round. &nbsp;It&#8217;s the only way that makes sense.</p>

		<p>@Jules, Henning Makholm:</p>
<p>Apparently, you two need another couple of whacks with the clue stick. &nbsp;Try to understand that the universe, the space-time continuum, and your dog do not care what number you assign to any particular part of the day. &nbsp;If you feel you want more daylight after work, then get your ass out of bed earlier and leave work earlier. &nbsp;But f*****g around with clocks not only does nothing to actually accomplish what you want, it causes some serious problems that have already wasted man-centuries of programming time. &nbsp;So stop it. &nbsp;Now.</p>
<p>btw, I work &lt;7-16&lt; most days. &nbsp;Is that balanced enough for you?</p>
