		<p>I would go with the helicopter &#8212; even though it is not handy &#8212; as well as the 50 cheeseburgers and call it a day.</p>

		<p>The one that confounds me is the puppy. Is it like the colored pencils and the Gameboy, so you have something to play with? Presumably it wasn&#39;t the intention to use the puppy as a hunting dog. Or food, for that matter&#8230; The puppy does meet the criterion of fitting in a backpack, although presumably you wouldn&#39;t actually leave it there.</p>
<p>My emergency survival kit just contains my tablet. Not the water purification kind, the electronic kind. With it I can contact the outside world for help and browse the Internet while waiting for said help. Of course, I might end up somewhere where there&#39;s no reception for a mobile network, but in that case, life has surely stopped being worthwhile anyway. I shall read the remainder of my e-books and go quietly into that good night.</p>

		<p>This list doesn&#39;t surprise me at all. It&#39;s a result of the (civilized) world we&#39;re living in today. We&#39;re at such an advanced technological level that we don&#39;t care for basic knowledge like how to survive without a grocery store or how to make a fire without a match or lighter. Knowledge that was established over thousands of years, it&#39;s getting more and more forgotten because we think we don&#39;t need it anymore, and therefore assume it&#39;s no longer important to teach to our kids. We depend on technology, our gadgets, McD, and 24/7 instead. Who needs purification tablets or a knife in the backback?</p>
<p>I&#39;m not that old but I still remember the time when I went to school during the mid-90s and there were no cell phones and the web was just about to take-off. Now when a look at people today, I&#39;m a bit surprised (sometimes shocked) tell me they couldn&#39;t manage to live without their phone or the internet for one day or a week. Gosh, I don&#39;t wanna know the hell that would brake loose if there were no GPS or network for 24h.</p>

		<p>I&#39;d be happy to blame the water thing on not using the metric system. &nbsp;When you do use the metric system it is trivial to convert water into volumes/dimensions and weights (all involve multiples of 10). &nbsp;The backward system used in the US (and one other country) makes it way harder.</p>

		<p>@sevenacids: Teaching kids isn&#39;t free. Time is limited. If you want to teach them how to survive in the wilderness, then you&#39;re going to have to sacrifice something less important instead. So what are kids learning today that&#39;s less important to their happiness and well-being than wilderness survival?</p>
<p>@Roger: The imperial system does a pretty good job making it trivial to convert gallons to volume, in my opinion.</p>

		<p>Roger: 1 gallon of water weighs 8 pounds. &quot;A pint&#39;s a pound the world around.&quot; An ounce of water takes up one fluid ounce of volume. It has everything to do with a kid thinking a tap is infinite and not thinking of putting 50 milk jugs into his backpack.</p>

		<p>@ JM:</p>

<p>Given how many people ended up calling emergency services after FaceBook had an outage, that is *barely* satire&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Nick: Only in the same sense as the &quot;World Series&quot;. A pint of water weighs a pound and a quarter outside of the US.</p>

		<p>@Dave Liney: Actually the phrase used to be accurate. Prior to 1824, England had a &quot;wine gallon&quot; that was equal to today&#39;s US Gallon (which is the gallon used on the American continents).</p>

		<p>I wonder why there&#39;s no chocolate / snack bar in the list. It&#39;s a valid choice of emergency food that provides you energy to perform whatever survival task you&#39;re facing.</p>
<p>I guess kids in these days are taught not to eat sweet food.</p>
<p>Some generic drugs like aspirin pills would be helpful in case you may have difficulty to find a doctor in serious disaster. If you got hurt badly on the way to escape, fever can kill.</p>

		<p>Also, I wonder if they still teach people to put plastic sheets in their survival kit. Plastic sheets are very useful in surviving a in the wild.</p>
