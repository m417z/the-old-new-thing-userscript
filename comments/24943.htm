		<p>Raymond, any chance you could open Suggestion Box 4?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got some questions, of a sentence or two in size, to do with Shell_NotifyIcon, that I think you&#8217;d be able to delve into more deeply than I could&#8230;</p>

		<p>Wow, thanks for answering my question on focusing w/o raising (I must have been frustrated at the time.. making so many spelling errors).</p>
<p>FWIW, the ability to focus without raising has been in the window manager for years though. TweakUI allows you to turn on the focus-follows-mouse option and it does this by flipping a bit in the registry (Control PanelDesktopUserPreferencesMask). Admittedly, just because the window manager is able to do something doesn’t mean a lowly application should, but clearly the ability is there.</p>
<p>Your answer confirms that I didn’t miss some documented way of accomplishing this though. Good stuff.</p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/07/10/3799014.aspx#3800932" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/07/10/3799014.aspx#3800932</a></p>
<p>the current suggestion box backlog will last at least into 2010. &nbsp;That&#8217;s why it isn&#8217;t open now: suggestions were getting added so fast that had it stayed open, Raymond would have just kept falling farther and farther behind.</p>
<p>Not sure what sort of questions might arise from the Shell_NotifyIcon API that wouldn&#8217;t be covered by a combination of &quot;NEVER do that from a service!&quot; and the documentation, but hey, whatever.</p>

		<p>Fair enough, Raymond. The bit flip is the result of calling SystemParametersInfo() with SPI_SETACTIVEWINDOWTRACKING. Regardless, my point was the window manager still has this (apparently documented) ability.</p>

		<p>MSDN examples probably use gotos for the purpose that they are most useful: Cleaning up after an exception.</p>
<p>C# has try/finally for this. C++ doesn&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s no reason not to use the same structure. Better than risking a memory leak.</p>

		<p>Gazpacho, C++ doesn&#8217;t have try/finally because it doesn&#8217;t need try/finally. &nbsp;Also, MSDN examples, with respect to the Win32 API, are written in C.</p>

		<p>&quot;Why doesn&#8217;t AltGr+Del act like Ctrl+Alt+Del?&quot;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>IBM programmer David Bradley arbitrarily decided in 1981 to make it that way.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Changing it now would break programs that happen to use AltGr+Del for their own purposes.</p>

		<p>Johnny, you&#8217;re already getting pretty far afield. I don&#8217;t think this is a question of what features a language should or shouldn&#8217;t have, nor what language most of the examples are written in (the question said C and C++). It&#8217;s about why they use goto.</p>
<p>No, C++ does not &quot;need&quot; try/finally, but Windows programs generally need to allocate resources temporarily and make sure they are always properly released. Many MSDN examples use goto for this. The resulting code structure differs only superficially from C# code that uses try/finally for the same purpose.</p>

		<p>The guy commenting on the Access bug wasn&#8217;t complaining. He was merely suggesting it was an amusing failure that you might get some light relief out of mentioning.</p>
<p>He had of course no knowledge of the famous Photo Draw bug, when Photo Draw would not install if you had an odd number of fonts on the machine. Yep, didn&#8217;t matter if it was one or 497, it wouldn&#8217;t install unless there was an even number of fonts in the folder.</p>
<p>The Access bug does touch tangentially on another point. Why are software error messages so totally out. The Access 97 bug, where it wouldn&#8217;t install if you had a particular font (that came with Publisher I believe) on the machine, gave the error message that you didn&#8217;t have a license to install Access on the machine, which led to some unpleasant scenes when I was accused of installing pirated software.</p>
<p>(Actually, maybe error messages like this are written on purpose. I still remember a colleague who returned to the UK from Saudi and went off and while installing one of the pirate CDs he had come back with received about an illegal operation causing the machine to shut down. He immediately went off and spent a few hundred pounds on legal copies before the boys in blue arrived at the door to arrest him!).</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know what to make of the Access 97 bug, but The PhotoDraw installation bug sounds like a case of someone allocating an array one item too short. It&#8217;s an embarrassing bug that should have been caught in testing, but it (like other bugs) has a non-devious explanation.</p>

		<p>&quot;Why can&#8217;t you call SetFocus() on a window in another thread?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I covered this in my PDC 2005 talk.</p>
<p>Another category is people who ask a question I&#8217;ve already answered or ask a question that has already been asked.&quot;</p>
<p>So basically, before asking a question, we are not only supposed to have read every article ever posted on this blog, but also watched/listened to/read/etc every other thing that Raymond has ever published/said/etc!?</p>
<p>Seriously Raymond maybe it is slightly annoying if people keep asking questions that have been answered, but pointing people in the right direction is fine, there is no need to be so angry about it. Chill out!</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  SPI_SETACTIVEWINDOWTRACKING
</p></blockquote>
<p>In TweakUI there are two checkboxes: &quot;activation follows mouse&quot; and &quot;raise active window to top&quot;. &quot;Active window tracking&quot; manages only one of these two.</p>

		<p>I apologize for not reading the manual.</p>
<p>The proper action is called</p>
<p>SPI_SETACTIVEWNDTRKZORDER</p>
<p>In context of this discussion this proves that it IS possible to activate a window without raising it to the top. What if I want to do that, but do not want to use &quot;active window tracking&quot;?</p>

		<p>Triangle: &nbsp;You said &quot;On firefox 1.5.0.12 searching from blogs.msdn.com it fails with a Javascript error about __doPostBack being undefined.&quot;</p>
<p>Try using IE then; it searches just fine. &nbsp;Maybe Firefox is broken.</p>

		<p>C(++) *does* have try/finally: it&#8217;s called Structured Exception Handling.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s implemented using the syntax __try/__finally. There&#8217;s also __except.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s supported by MSVC, but not sure about other compilers.</p>
<p>(C++ obviously supports standard exceptions using try, catch, but I believe they are implemented internally using Win32 SEH, see Richter&#8217;s book).</p>

		<p>Scorpion007: SEH is a Windows feature that MSVC exposes through the __try/__except/__finally keywords. Other compilers targeting Windows might support it (not sure), compilers that don&#8217;t target Windows most certainly will not. SEH is *not* in any way part of ISO standard C++.</p>
<p>Gazpacho: goto is not a valid replacement for try/finally, because it is not exception safe. The cleanup code in the finally block gets run regardless of how the try block is exitted, whether that be regular flow, a return statement, or an exception. Using goto will not cover the &quot;early return&quot; scenario and most certainly also not the exception scenario.</p>
<p>However, C++ has a proper mechanism to deal with this, where whatever resource you need to clean up is wrapped in a class which is created on the stack. In this case, the class&#8217;s destructor is responsible for the cleanup. Since exceptions in C++ do proper stack unwinding, this destructor will always get called, regardless of how the function exits. This principle is called Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII). It&#8217;s a little more work than try/finally (and is probably overkill for a code sample on MSDN), but it works very well. See also this article I wrote on the topic a while back: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.ookii.org/post/tryfinally_vs_raii.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.ookii.org/post/tryfinally_vs_raii.aspx</a></p>

		<p>&#8212;&quot;but it (like other bugs) has a non-devious explanation.&quot;&#8212;</p>
<p>Microsoft are not guilty on this one. The bug was &nbsp;there before they bought Photodraw, and MS actually fixed it.</p>

		<p>andg &#8212; You can do the same, but you&#8217;d better give the user some way to undo the change. &nbsp;Call SystemParametersInfo with the setting SPI_SETACTIVEWINDOWTRACKING and the appropriate value. &nbsp;That&#8217;s all that TweakUI does (or seems to do).</p>
<p>Note that TweakUI does *NOT* set each window up to get activation without being raised, individually. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a system-level setting; either it&#8217;s off or on for each individual system. &nbsp;(Or each desktop, I&#8217;m not exactly sure. &nbsp;It&#8217;s way less granular than &quot;per window&quot;, in any case.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why you&#8217;d better give the user the opportunity to turn it off; if your program turns it on without notification and without the opportunity to cancel (and without any other way to turn it off again), then your program is being antisocial. &nbsp;Or worse.</p>

		<p>Gazpacho: score Internet points? I have no idea what that even means.</p>
<p>The original question was why MSDN uses goto in some samples. Raymond suggested that it was a matter of style, which is fine with me (I have no strong feelings towards goto either way). You suggested that they used it as an alternative to try/finally, which is not fine, because the semantics of try/finally cannot be duplicated with goto in the context of exceptions.</p>
<p>My explanation of a alternate method to do cleanup in C++ that does have the same semantics as try/finally was arguably off-topic, but I didn&#8217;t realize that was a crime these days.</p>

		<p>&quot;So basically, before asking a question, we are not only supposed to have read every article ever posted on this blog, but also watched/listened to/read/etc every other thing that Raymond has ever published/said/etc!?&quot;</p>
<p>Er, yes? (Seriously, it *is* reasonable to use the available search facilities to see if it has come up before. There&#8217;s a search on this blog and there&#8217;s Google.)</p>
<p>Raymond: thanks for giving these lazy suggestions a good kicking. I feel much better for reading today&#8217;s blog.</p>

		<p>Shame about the Outlook sound. I thought it might tickle Raymond&#8217;s curiosity. Ho hum.</p>
<p>I suppose you have to experience the culture shock of hearing a sound that happens at your desk in the UK, in a hot, crowded railway station in a faraway tropical country.</p>
