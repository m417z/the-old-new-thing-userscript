		<p>What I don&#8217;t get is why Microsoft didn&#8217;t let it default to &#8220;not dpi aware, enable upscaling&#8221; unless the program actively opts in. So many programs don&#8217;t handle high dpi but somehow end up not being scaled, including a lot of Microsofts own programs. Makes me hate working on high DPI machines.</p>

		<p>According to Raymond&#8217;s article here, that IS the default. The program was declaring itself as DPI aware (the developer probably did not like the blurriness and didn&#8217;t have the visual resources to make it look nice at high-DPI).</p>

		<p>&#8220;The lowest level of DPI awareness is &#8220;none&#8221;, which is what you get if you do not manifest your application,&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m reading that as &#8220;once you have a manifest you have to opt-out&#8221;, which is stupid, because these days most applications have a manifest.</p>

		<p>Semi related: Is there a simple way of converting a size in pixels in a DPI unaware app into the pixel size on the native display? We needed to hack together a function that did this because the coordinates used by ::SHAppBarMessage are not scaled for DPI unaware apps, which means that not the entire area covered by the window is removed from the monitor&#8217;s work area.</p>

		<p>No, it just reminds me of how weird/wrong DPI awareness can be.  You read 100 articles and all have their own special little tricks that kindof sortof work at the moment unless you do this or that and it explodes.  It&#8217;s too much like web design, especially that bit about only looking for t-r-u-e which is right along the same lines as various CSS selector tricks.</p>
<p>Right after obscure metadata flags and manifests, the next biggest problem is the Visual Studio designer itself and its propensity to change or hide properties and then crash into a heap, expecting you to sort out whatever unwanted cruft it decided to choke on.  I almost miss the way we used to have to set up GUIs in Visual C++ 6, as much of a mystery as some of that MFC/AFX macro syntax was at times.</p>

		<p>I have been planning to get a large, high DPI monitor, but even with Windows 10, some things don&#8217;t look good yet (including some tiny dialog boxes that show up at installation, which is probably unavoidable during installation when the system isn&#8217;t fully &#8220;there&#8221; yet).  So I haven&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I wish monitors for sale weren&#8217;t getting so &#8220;wide and short&#8221;.  My current 26-inch monitors are 1920 wide by 1200 tall; I had to search to find one that wasn&#8217;t 1920 wide by only 1080 tall.  </p>
<p>I WANT my monitors to be 1920 wide by 1600 tall.  :-)  I have unused vertical space between the bottom of my monitors and the top of my desk, and that space could be filled with lines of code that I am working on!!!  </p>
<p>If I could find the right monitor.  Sigh.</p>

		<p>Also, buy two ultra-wide (i.e., 2.35:1) monitors and place one on top of the other. Just kidding.</p>
<p>I understand the consumer wants panoramic monitors for viewing films and TV, but they are terrible for web browsing and productivity applications (coding is, perhaps, one of the few exceptions when you realize that two code windows fit nicely side-by-side at 16:9). Why on Earth don&#8217;t makers of &#8220;professional&#8221; equipment realize this and make 4:3 or 1:1 monitors?</p>

		<p>Right, I think that a 1:1 monitor would be fine for coding.  </p>
<p>I could set three 16:9 monitors side by side, turned vertically, but that&#8217;s not ideal.  a 1:1 ratio monitor would be ideal, at 1920 x 1920.</p>

		<p>Nice!  That&#8217;s what I need.   I have also found some other industrial monitors that are square; intended for medical applications like looking at X-rays and mammograms; and they are about $11,000 each.</p>

		<p>I noticed that Explorer has the setting explorer. I could not find any documentation about it. My guess is that it is a special setting that allows Explorer to turn on DPI awareness per shell extension. But in that case &#8211; HOW do you actually make a DPI aware shell extension, in particular one that is per-monitor aware?</p>

		<p>‚ÄúTrue/PM‚Äù</p>
<p>How does something like that get past code reviews?  Why not just add another property that works in conjunction with  instead of overloading a boolean property?  It doesn&#8217;t seem like this terrible hack is actually needed.</p>

		<p>While neither agreeing or disagreeing with the design, I can see the logic:</p>
<p>If you add a completely new state to the property (true / false / per-monitor), you break things on Windows 7.</p>
<p>If you add a new property you potentially break things on Windows 7 (what if they set the new property to true, but omit the  property, thereby letting it default to false?).</p>
<p>At least this way every valid permutation is both forward and backward compatible.  I suspect that is how it passed code review.</p>

		<p>Personally, I usually just test the first character &#8212; and I usually default to true.  Carry over from what they used to teach when I was growing up &#8212; anything not false is true, and then why make whoever is editing type the entire word, they might have a audio cassette player as their only storage.</p>
<p>Anyway &#8212; the easy way to implement high DPI is to have each app render to a texture in the background, then map that to a quad.  Your low DPI app just sets up the texture at the lower resolution.</p>
<p>In that event, if you have an array with the hard coded DPI in the first element, the system DPI in the second element, and then the real resolutions past that, you can use just bitwise operators and a couple variables to return the correct DPI.  If you used that approach, it&#8217;d be less costly than a compare and jump &#8211;but it&#8217;d become really important that you only set those variables if you were in high DPI mode, or else really stupid things would happen.</p>
<p>And so in that case, you might want a single element &#8212; that&#8217;d particularly be the case with XML if you allowed the elements to occur in any order in the file.  I&#8217;d envision a dispatch table checking the element name and then calling some function to do the work &#8212; and so if you allow the elements to occur in any order, you&#8217;d have issues setting up the mask directly.  You&#8217;d have to set some variables and process them only after the entire manifest was parsed.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a lot harder to verify as correct, too.</p>

		<p>Raymond, would you consider the implementation of checking dpiAware if it begins with t-r-u-e to be foresight, or dumb luck? Obviously in hindsight there are benefits (not that a second XML element/attribute is a huge impact), but just curious how the implementation came to be.</p>

		<p>I had an old winforms app that was not dpi aware, yet it kept being rendered as if it was dpi aware. We set all the obvious switches to disable being dpi awareness, yet it still was being rendered tiny and dpi aware. It took us weeks to figure out that in one small corner of our app, we hosted a WPF control, and that control was telling the entire application that we were high dpi aware. </p>
<p>The fix? In our assemblyinfo.cs file, add a line for<br />
[assembly: System.Windows.Media.DisableDpiAwareness]</p>

		<p>Very useful information.</p>
<p>However, it also reminds me of Microsoft&#8217;s annoying habit of fiddling with this every OS revision, and in particular the latest incarnation of DPI-handling, in Windows 10.</p>
<p>Previously, you would just set the scaling of the fonts. This actually worked pretty well for most applications, as control sizes would scale up accordingly, and the text would still be rendered sharply. It did have the problem that some programs didn&#8217;t provide enough wiggle room in the layout, so some text got truncated or otherwise hidden. But that came up rarely, and IMHO was less of an issue than *always* having to ready fuzzy text.</p>
<p>Then the default became (in 7 or 8, I forget which) this new approach where the program was rendered at the nominal 96 dpi no matter what and then scaled up, producing a fuzzy image. This fixed the layout issue, but at the cost of visual quality. Fortunately, the display settings still included a check box to revert to the previous behavior, scaling just the fonts and not the entire window.</p>
<p>Sadly, Windows 10 has removed this capability, for the most part. Yes, there&#8217;s a way to set specific UI fonts individually, but it&#8217;s a pain to use and is based on specific font sizes instead of percentages. And to effectively use that part of the UI, you have to set the nominal display scaling to 100%, making all the DPI-aware programs too small. There is a &#8220;compatibility tab&#8221; setting that will revert to the old behavior for specific programs, but that&#8217;s a royal pain, having to track down every program you think you might use and which needs to be toggled off. I guess that wouldn&#8217;t be so bad, except that the set of programs that need that setting toggled off includes a number of programs included with the OS (e.g. Device Manager).</p>
<p>The not-DPI-aware experience sucks in some respect no matter what one does. But IMHO, visual quality has to take precedence. The default for not-DPI-aware programs should have been to scale the fonts and render at the real resolution. If an option needed to be provided, it should have been for the &#8220;render at 96dpi and scale up to the monitor&#8221; behavior, so users have to opt-in for fuzzy, hard-to-read text.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Previously, you would just set the scaling of the fonts. This actually worked pretty well for most applications, as control sizes would scale up accordingly&#8221;</p>
<p>Most apps didn&#8217;t handle it properly at all. It also doesn&#8217;t work well for multiple monitors, when the monitors have different dpi. Most people gave up and either put up with small fonts, or bought a lower dpi monitor.</p>
<p>The problem is still not fixed &amp; I can still cope with 1920&#215;1080. I would have got a 4k laptop a couple of months ago, but I don&#8217;t think my eyes could have taken it.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve got a Dell m3800 with the 4K screen and I love it. However, there are many Java apps that don&#8217;t do DPI. Number one of these is Eclipse.</p>
<p>I was doing some hacking on an Intel Edison using their Eclipse-based IDE and I had to use the magnifier tool to read the icons.</p>
<p>So, scaling just the text in an application is not really a good idea.</p>

		<p>DPI is the wrong unit. Or, rather, misleading.</p>
<p>A TV screen or, god forbid, a projector has very low DPI, so if you display actual honest-to-goodness 10pt (5/36 inch) text on it, there are not enough device pixels to make it legible. The system has to cope by lying about the DPI in order to present the user(s) with readable text.</p>
<p>The important unit is device pixels per degree. An inch at one standard arm‚Äôs length is about two degrees. So, 24 DPI at 3 meters is roughly the same visual density as the ordinary monitor DPI at 70 cm.</p>

		<p>There is an important special case where you can scale up without any blurriness: any integer ratio. Apple exploited this when introducing retina displays. IMO this is the only way to scale legacy apps that doesn&#8217;t result in awful blurriness and headache due to squinting.</p>

		<p>In testing Windows Forms, I found that WIndows Forms code by default is high DPI enabled if you use the forms designer or place things in the constructor, and not high DPI enabled otherwise.</p>
<p>There are two bugs, both of the same type. CheckedListBoxControl and CheckboxControl have a hardcoded 13 for checkbox size. Thankfully you can get at it easily and change it in a derived class. (13 * DPI + 48) / 96 works just fine.</p>
<p>Incidentally, I found that almost all ancient programs do not support high DPI. I loaded the old-school smash all anti-aliasing settings to keep the blur from doing something dumb; however if you load a web browser control you will get an accessibility bug filed against you. (This recreates the really stupid accessibility bug that I had to make the jump to high DPI to fix.)</p>

		<p>&#8220;True/PM&#8221; &#8230; oh what a shame.  Such a Golden Opportunity, missed.</p>
<p>If Windows 8.0 only checks for &#8220;t-r-u-e&#8221; in the first 4 characters of this value, then it would have been possible to use a more completely accurate value to achieve the same end.  Specifically:</p>
<p>    t-r-u-e-r</p>
<p>This would even have left room for future improvements in DPI awareness being signalled with:</p>
<p>    t-r-u-e-r-s-t-i-l-l</p>
<p>(Not being entirely serious, obviously.  Or at all in fact)  :)</p>

		<p>I think a lot of programs set the DPI aware flag to true just to avoid blurriness back when 125% was the most that might be set.  Now that 4K monitors are becoming more common, this bad decision is coming out of hiding.</p>

		<p>At 125% Vista, 7 and 8.x did not use blurry rendering (they still used the old-style scaling) &#8211; you had to go at least 126% to get it without editing the Registry directly. I had to do this at a client that wanted to use 125%, but had a proprietary program that refused to run at anything other than 96 DPI.</p>

		<p>While you are it, raymond, can you tell when Win10 new DPI APIs will see the light? EnableNonClientDpiScaling, EnableChildWindowDpiMessage and new per-thread stuff?</p>
