		<p>Well, that kind of things happen often. People generally just deal with it, but you, you seem to get pissed of each time.</p>
<p>Why, WWWWHHHHHHHYYYYYYYY?</p>

<p>Low tolerance for idiocy is my guess. What do you want him to say? That stupid people aren&#8217;t infuriating? Because they are. At least he&#8217;s venting here on a blog instead of in a bell tower with a sniper rifle.</p>

		<p>At the risk of going off-topic here, I&#8217;m going to guess from Raymond&#8217;s posts that his Myers-Briggs personality type is INTJ. Just the dominance of logic and critical thinking that pervades his writing. Of course, this could also be borne out from being a developer.</p>

		<p>I do not see him &#8216;venting&#8217; here &#8211; I simply see him linking to a friends blog about a rather amusing story that follows in the general manner of stories that he often talks about (for example, the &quot;Email Tip: Nostalgia is not a question&quot; post).</p>
<p>After reading the story in the blog you can see how the people failed to &quot;engaging the part of the brain responsible for logic and reason&quot; &#8212; there&#8217;s a major lack of common sense here. &nbsp;Why would anyone call a library for Tax information?</p>
<p>&#8230; awe dang&#8230; I fell for the troll bait.</p>

		<p>THis reminds me of an anecdote I had read in Readers Digest. This old lady called the local police station and asked the officer the recipe of some chicken dish. The officer was taken aback, but gave her the recipe anyway.</p>
<p>After that, he asked her why she called the police station for something like this. Her response &quot;Well, you knew the answer, didn&#8217;t you?&quot;</p>
