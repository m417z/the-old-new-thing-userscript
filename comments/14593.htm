		<p>WM_REFRESHPARENT (or WM_RECACHEPARENT) would have been useful. </p>
<div class=post>[<i>The issue isn&#8217;t coming up with a message to refresh the parent window handle. (You could have done that yourself without having a system-defined message for it.) The issue is getting people to bother implementing it. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I&#8217;m slightly surprised that Windows doesn&#8217;t send the child a message to say that its parent has changed. &nbsp;The equivalent Xlib function XReparentWindow causes the server to emit a ReparentNotify event to the child to let it know that the world has changed.</p>
<p>Then again, reparenting windows is commonplace in X: the window manager adds its furniture (title bar, resize borders and so on) to new toplevel windows by reparenting them. &nbsp;I guess this is sufficiently rare in Windows that it wasn&#8217;t thought necessary.</p>
<p>(Also, there&#8217;s an obvious gap between the reparent operation and the event being received by the child during which the child&#8217;s cache is wrong. &nbsp;So this wouldn&#8217;t actually help. &nbsp;Good job widgets in X don&#8217;t work like this, then.)</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230; I&#8217;d guess that fancy tearoffable toolbars and suchlike work by playing with parent windows, so maybe it&#8217;s not that uncommon. &nbsp;So there must be some special form of communication to keep things working properly.</p>
