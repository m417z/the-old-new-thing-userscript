		<p>So I wasn&#39;t hallucinating, there really is a deferred deletion mechanism for objects selected into a device context! I&#39;ve been wondering about this for years as I&#39;ve seen production code that deletes objects that are still selected and yet don&#39;t leak GDI objects. In fact you can find an example of this in the MSDN library:</p>

		<p>Bonus chatter: Objects are now garbage collected in the case of left behind in the DC. This is topologically equivalent to deleting a file when a handle is open on Unix systems. Unfortunately the caveat &quot;sometimes&quot; makes this unsafe to depend on.</p>

		<p>Actually, checking the Application Compatibility Toolkit&#39;s Compatibility Administrator reveals there is a compatibility fix (shim) called &#39;EmulateDeleteObject&#39;, whose description is:</p>
<p>&quot;This compatibility fix causes the Windows XP version of DeleteObject to return success, which is the Windows 9x behavior. Applies to: Windows 95, Windows 98&quot;</p>
<p>To me that would indicate that &#39;sometimes&#39; means &#39;if this shim is enabled&#39;.</p>

		<p>Raymond wrote: &quot;For example, if you select a region into a DC, and somebody tries to destroy the region, the Delete&shy;Object call will fail, and you end up leaking a region.&quot;</p>
<p>I always thought regions were special cases. &nbsp;From MSDN: &nbsp;&quot;Only a copy of the selected region is used. The region itself can be selected for any number of other device contexts or it can be deleted.&quot; (SelectClipRgn). &nbsp;The documentation for SelectObject isn&#39;t quite as explicit, but it does seem to suggest that regions are special since the return value is not the handle of the previously selected region.</p>

		<p>Honestly, my perspective on software design is that this &quot;lying&quot; done by DeleteObject is how it should work in the first place &#8211; i.e., reference counting.</p>
<p>Of course, it still means that such programs aren&#39;t following the rules as documented.</p>

		<p>@Mike: All it means is that according to the description of the shim, on Win 9x, DeleteObject() always returned success whether it succeeded or not, and on Windows XP it does not. (No judgement on whether the description is accurate.) No reason to go off and assume things. Why couldn&#39;t DeleteObject() lie without this shim?</p>

		<p>For Windows CE users: on Windows CE, GDI does *not* garbage-collect objects. If an object is referenced when you try to delete it, DeleteObject returns FALSE. When the DC is deleted, the object is leaked.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure I recall reading that Windows NT-family reference-counts the objects. It&#39;s possible that this was changed some time after Windows XP to some form of garbage collection.</p>
<p>@Joshua: My reading of that statement is that &#39;sometimes&#39; refers to it lying about having deleted the object, not about subsequently cleaning up. But I could be wrong.</p>

		<p>I would have figured out it didn&#39;t stand for &quot;data center&quot; eventually.</p>

		<p>Euh&#8230; So the DC will &quot;not always&quot; delete a still-selected object, but when? We don&#39;t really want to know, nor think about that, not if we can help it, I guess. A nice &quot;structured&quot; approach to DC selection is to wrap SelectObject into RAII (the only reasonable, if you ask me).</p>
