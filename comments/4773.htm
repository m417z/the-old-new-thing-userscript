		<p>I once put an algorithm in the final report for a grad class research project that we called the &quot;blue algorithm&quot; because when we were trying to figure out what to do, we put a couple possibilities up on the whiteboard in different colors, and it happened to be blue.</p>

		<p>That story sounds all too familiar to me. One of the projects I work on one was code named &quot;Bobcat&quot; about 7 years ago, and is still known by that name today. &nbsp;There have been many hypotheses about how that name came about, but the truth is that there just happened to be a large piece of earth moving equipment produced by Bobcat (the earth moving equipment company) in a teammate&#39;s drive way near the beginning of the project, and he liked the name. The rest is a surprisingly accurate analogue of this story.</p>

		<p>While working at a major telecom company back in the 90s, I had to deal with a system named Route 7. It sounds like it should be meaningful since the primary function of a telecom company is to route calls (and bill for them), but it was simply named for the major state highway that passed near the original development team&#39;s building.</p>

		<p>&quot;Not Red Shark but RedShark, accent on the Red&quot;</p>
<p>Not being a native english speaker, what is the difference in accentuation between &quot;RedShark&quot; and &quot;Red Shark&quot;?</p>

		<p>@Nawak:</p>
<p>In American English at least, multi-syllable words tend to have one of the syllables stressed or accented. &nbsp;For example my name, Michael, has two syllables and most people would say the first syllable slightly more lightly than the second.</p>
<p>&quot;Red Shark&quot;, being two separate words, would not have either of them accented except as appropriate (e.g. rising tone at the end of a question like &quot;Oh you got bitten by a red shark?&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;RedShark&quot;, being a single word with two syllables would have one of them emphasized.</p>
<p>I have been told by my friends from India that this accenting or stressing does not occur so it&#39;s been something of a challenge to learn proper pronunciation of people&#39;s names since as a native speaker you hardly realize that you&#39;re doing it. &nbsp;I believe the American practice follows traditional English English practice but I can&#39;t say for sure.</p>

		<p>Nautilus was because we were developing a new IDE for dev tools, and the nautilus creature had a nifty-looking shell. Only slightly less random than RedShark&#8230;</p>

		<p>After being sick of all our projects called &quot;Grobber Manager&quot;, or &quot;Grobber Management System&quot;, I decided I wanted a project named &quot;Hyperion Pro&quot;.</p>
<p>Hyperion, one of Saturn&#39;s moons. And &quot;pro&quot; because it sounds cooler than &quot;Hyperion Standard&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t care what the project is; I&#39;ve just picked out the name.</p>

		<p>@Michael Grier,</p>
<p>Probably for the most part, though there are some well known exceptions. &nbsp;&quot;Bernard&quot; in American English is stressed on the second syllable; in British English, on the first syllable. &nbsp;In terms of ordinary words there is a big difference between American &quot;laboratory&quot; (first and third syllables stressed, second vowel tending to disappear) and British &quot;laboratory&quot; (second syllable stressed, fourth vowel tending to disappear).</p>

		<p>Reading the article, removing the space from &quot;RedShark&quot; also made me read it faster. Perhaps it was a performance optimization to remove the whitespace? ;)</p>

		<p>I once code-named a project &quot;Alice&quot; because (a) other projects had a tendency towards wow-look-at-me names that emphasized some big/fast/cool factor, and (b) I was reading Lewis Carroll at the time.</p>
<p>It was fun hearing management types have to say &quot;Alice&quot; in internal project meetings.</p>

		<p>@EvanED,</p>
<p>The free portion of Interstate 476 in Pennsylvania is called the &quot;blue route&quot; for that exact reason. There were multiple alternatives for where to build it and the eventual winner happened to be blue on the original map. (The toll section is much less interestingly called &quot;The Northeast Extension (of the Pennsylvania Turnpike)&quot;)</p>

		<p>@Michael Grier</p>
<p>I read that as more the *emphasis* was on the fact that it was red, not that it was a shark. I.e. Project RedShark might have absolutley nothing in common with Project BlueShark, despite the common word &quot;shark&quot;</p>
<div class="post">[<em>I mean it in the sense Michael gave. The word &quot;Red&quot; is spoken louder than &quot;Shark&quot;. In casual conversation, when you say &quot;I saw the red shark today&quot;, the emphasis is on the word &quot;shark&quot;. But if you&#39;re talking about the project, you would put emphasis on the word &quot;red&quot;. No explanation was ever given; that&#39;s just how it was. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>When we started my current company we decided we wanted our project names to have a theme. After casting around for a bit we decided on rock bands. We figured this had many advantages:</p>
<ol>
<li>A near-endless well of distinctive names, such that each major release could get its own band.</li>
<li>
<p>We could assign different sub-genres to different products. The mapping product would get classic rock, the mobile viewer gets blues-rock, the design product get metal bands (for reasons simply related to the tastes of the personnel involved).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For point releases we could use band member last names. Our 2.0 mapping product project was Zeppelin, 2.1 was Plant, 2.2 was Page, etc.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>The runner-up theme was &quot;battles the French lost&quot; but it only had the &quot;near-endless well of names&quot; factor going for it ;)</p>
