		<p>How does RDW_INTERNALPAINT interact with UpdateWindow? I hope MSDN just dropped the ball and internal paints are honored there too&#8230;</p>
<p>And is there a corresponding mechanism to Validate Rect for saying thanks, but I changed my mind? Could not find anything.</p>
<p>Thanks, and keep it up please.</p>

		<p>Sorry, withdrawing my 2nd question, just found a flag for RedrawWindow.</p>
<p>BTW: Could you enlighten me why Microsoft splintered the API reference, so there are separate and conflicting copies mostly focused for all those versions? That makes it quite easy to look at the wrong docs and not realizing that parts dont apply to you and which ones. It also burries the right docs under nefarious false friends.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Can you point me to examples of multiple conflicting copies? I know the Windows CE team created their own copy since their OS is a Windows subset, but their docs are clearly labeled &quot;Windows CE.&quot; -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Well, haven&#39;t found two conflicting pages claiming the exact same systems yet. But taking RedrawWindow as an example, there are at least 6 pages, one each for: desktop, ce5, ce6, ce6.5, ce7compact, ce.net. All ce pages seem to contain the same basic info with few differences (dropped min versions/different ratings/possibility to add community content (not found any actual ommunity content for the ce pages)/sometimes linking to _one_ of the other pages/&#8230;). The only significant difference seems to be to the desktop page, which lists two more flags than the rest and has community contributions.</p>
<p>Are you sure if one of those pages is corrected for something, all the others will be done too? And how about missing the vital clue (hidden in community content on one of the pages you are not looking at just then), even if all the other content is completely reproduced? What i personally find most irritating is 1: having to hunt down the differences, complicated by the difficulty of moving from any page to corresponding pages in different sets, especially if porting/developing not only for Windows Y. and 2: Having my search for information on SomeApiFunctionOrFlag spammed by nearly right pages which might be dead wrong. Both parts lead to serious frustrations.</p>
<p>PS: Thanks for the answers you already gave.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>When the desktop pages are updated, the Windows CE pages are not, because that would be wrong. For example, suppose a new flag is added to Windows 8. It would be wrong to add that flag to the Windows CE 5 documentation because the flag is not supported in Windows CE 5. If you are not targeting Windows CE, then don&#39;t read the Windows CE documentation. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>I found RDW_INTERNALPAINT useful when rendering content on demand in WM_PAINT: Whenever the underlying content changes, I post an RDW_INTERNALPAINT message. Then, in WM_PAINT, I compute the updated layout and invalidate the regions affected by the changes before calling BeginPaint.</p>
<p>One thing I remember is that apparently you couldn&#39;t combine RDW_INTERNALPAINT with some other flags in a single call to RedrawWindow (possibly RDW_UPDATENOW, but I don&#39;t remember).</p>

		<p>rs, I believe this is what Raymond is alluding to when he says &quot;It&#39;s not actually a flag, but you can think of it that way.&quot;</p>
<p>I can&#39;t be bothered to look it up in the header file, but perhaps it&#39;s a combination of flags which would conflict with yours, or it&#39;s a magic constant, or something.</p>

		<p>Often the first msdn online help page VS shows of API calls when selecting a WinApi function and pressing F1 is a 5-10 year old Windows CE page, even when developing straight win32 apps.</p>

		<p>&quot;I meant that the thing that says &quot;This window needs a WM_PAINT message&quot; is not a flag. RDW_INTERNAL&shy;PAINT is a flag. -Raymond&quot;</p>
<p>I am sure I am not the only one that was initially confused both by the original wording in the article and this &quot;clarification&quot;, which merely repeats the mistake of the article text. &nbsp;When reading: &quot;The thing that says &quot;&#8230;&quot; etc&quot;, the &quot;thing&quot; I seem to be reading about is RDW_INTERNALPAINT. &nbsp;This creates an apparent contradiction when on the one hand you said &quot;The thing &#8230; is not a flag.&quot; and then immediately after &quot;[The thing] IS a flag&quot;.</p>
<p>I took me a couple of reads, both of the original and the clarification, to realise that what you were trying to say was:</p>
<p>Whilst RDW_INTERNALPAINT is a flag, the effect it has on the window manager is to trigger a message to be sent, not set a flag.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Right. There are two flags in question here, the one you pass to <code>Redraw&shy;Window</code> and the one the window manager uses to remember that a paint message is needed. The second one is not actually a flag. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@msdn libb, yeah, it&#39;s a little annoying when you search Google or Bing and the first result is a CE hit, not a desktop hit. &nbsp;But they&#39;re getting better over time, and moving the desktop result up. &nbsp;I can&#39;t remember OTTOMH but there&#39;s slight differences in wordings in the summary you get on the search results page that lets you know whether it&#39;s desktop or CE versions of the function.</p>

		<p>In regard to searching: They start favoring the desktop pages over arbitrary ce pages? Good for &#39;desktop&#39; only developers, even though its not good enough until its reliable that you get the desktop page.</p>
<p>Still does not help anyone developing for ce-x.y or worse yet needing info from two or more split docs. In the last case you really want the differences highlighted.</p>
<p>@raymond: I intentionally said corrected not updated beecause updating could mean making things conform to an expanded new version of the api, while correcting only implies faulty docs (which might be duplicated inclusive any errors).</p>

		<p>Surely it&#39;s much easier and less confusing to just say &quot;There is only one flag. &nbsp;The mechanism it invokes doesn&#39;t involve a flag at all.&quot; ?</p>
<p>Unless you had tongue firmly inserted into cheek of course. &nbsp;:)</p>
<p>Not that is matters now. &nbsp;The ball has long since gone. &nbsp;:)</p>

		<p>Great! I always follow this blog. </p>
<p>I think it will be very helpful, If you can share the whole application code by an Zip file as an attachement. Investigate the runtime behavior will be very helpful to understanding the code.</p>
