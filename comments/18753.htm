		<p>&quot;No cell phones allowed in hospital rooms because they may interfere with the equipment.&quot;</p>
<p>Some potential threats are all to real. The women I am dating just had open heart surgery. All around the hospital were signs to turn your cell phone off in this area.</p>
<p>When her brother and his son walked into her room,,,, The heart/blood pressure monitor stopped recording. As soon as they shut there phones off, it start right back up.</p>
<p>People ignore potential threats until they bite them in the &#8230;..</p>

		<p>Actually, there is an even more important argument that is missed here.</p>
<p>You are defending against active attackers who have copies of your system to test their attacks against. &nbsp;Thus, even if an attack does not exist today, an attack will exist tomorrow if there is any possibility of a hole. &nbsp;This is the fundamental problem with defence. &nbsp;It costs way more to defend against all possible attacks than it costs the attacker to find the one opening in the defences and exploit it.</p>
<p>The only possibly good thing about this is that the defences get better over time through sheer Darwinian evolution, developing defences against all the attacks that have worked in the past.</p>

<p>Even if your brothers turned theirs off, the area is probably overrun with cell phones being carried by other people (including the staff).</p>

		<blockquote><p>

<p>This might be nitpicking, but air bags are actually more dangerous to your health if you are not wearing seat belts. They are supposed to be used together: one keeps your body fastened to the car, the other protects your head (which can&#8217;t be as conveniently secured).</p>

		<p>Raymond, Stephen Eilert</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in a crash, and not using a seat belt, here is what happens. First, you are thrown against the steering wheel. Then the airbag propane cylinder ignites and your head is thrown back; your face is burned with hot gasses. This assuming that the crash speed was not too high to just throw you out the window.</p>

		<p>Slightly off-topic:</p>
<p>Many gun&#8217;s safeties cannot be engaged UNLESS they&#8217;re loaded (a standard 1911 comes to mind). Many guns have no manual safety (Glock, Kahr). Most gun cases (the ones the gun comes in from the factory) do not have locks. It would have been better if you just presented the four rules of safe gun-handling for a gun-related analogy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Handle every gun as if it&#8217;s loaded.</li>
<li>
<p>Never point a gun at anything you don&#8217;t want to destroy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know your target and what&#8217;s beyond it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep your finger out of the trigger guard until you&#8217;ve made the conscious decision to fire.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To make a mistake that leads to injury, you must break at least two of those rules and they are a perfect example of layered security (safety).</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Defense in depth is about protecting against threats that are already being protected against, just in case the existing protection fails
</p></blockquote>
<p>Sure, extra layers of defense are a good thing, but there&#8217;s also such a thing as too much protection. Adding extra protection also adds extra complexity and thus an associated extra risk for security problems. There is a point at which adding extra protection actually decreases security.</p>

<p>Only about 100 kids shoot themselves accidentally in a given year (most of the others are suicides or gangbangers if you&#8217;re interested). Honestly, a loaded, uncased gun is perfectly okay, so long as it&#8217;s sitting in a safe somewhere. Dunno of the guy you responded does that or not.</p>

		<p>&quot;I wonder what crappy monitors were being used!!&quot;</p>
<p>Monitors are looking at very small signals &#8211; small enough that noise is a severe issue. Also, those small signals have to travel through some long wires.</p>
<p>Also, if you&#8217;re deep within the bowels of a hospital with lots of shielding, your phone is probably transmitting close to maximum power.</p>
<p>And adding shielding is an option, if you don&#8217;t mind paying an extra 10 grand or more because it has to go through certification. If you change the electronics, you have to prove that there are acceptable workarounds for failure. E.g., if you have an alarm, there had better be a way to check that the alarm went off &#8211; if it means adding a microphone and having the monitor listen, so be it. And yes, that was an option to verify the alarm worked.</p>

		<p>Most hospitals use pagers, and many are starting to use VOIP phones over WiFi, but in reality cellphones (Blackberries) are just too useful to get rid of.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually quite rare for cellphones to interfere with important equipment, and it&#8217;s impossible for everybody to turn theirs off (a patient brought in unconscious will not turn off the one in her purse) but the policy is there because it&#8217;s better to be safe than sorry. Odds are that a patient or visitor leaving their cellphone on will not prevent as many deaths as the interference will cause.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that sometimes interference will be caused from just being on, sometimes it will be from ringing (call initiation), and sometimes from being on a call.</p>

		<p>THe problem with cellphones in a hospital is that GSM phones emit strong short pulses, as opposed to CDMA phones, which use spread spectrum and frequency hopping.</p>
<p>Many people heard a result of GSM interference on their analog equipment. Often, certain VOIP phones start buzzing, immediately before someone nearby gets a call on a GSM phone.</p>

		<p>In this one true thing,</p>
<p>In any system that is inherently secure enough to be free from the effects of external attack; there will be a proportionate loss of utility and ease of use for any that desire to access them.</p>
<p>In any human engineered security system, another human being will eventually be capable of reverse engineered and thus overcoming its security&#8230;</p>
