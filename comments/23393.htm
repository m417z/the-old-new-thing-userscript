		<p>You can also get a whole lot more than $25, if you have the credit card statements that indicate a large value of such transactions. &nbsp;Also includes cash advances with debit cards and such. (I traveled to the UK a lot in that period.)</p>

		<p>Or, I can sit at work for a few minutes and read few blogs, while solution is being built&#8230; same money. :-)</p>

		<p>You don&#8217;t even need the credit card statements. Once you&#8217;ve exhausted your archives, online statements, and the six other monthly statements that the credit card company is required to fish out of their own backups at your request, you can put in a good faith estimate for the rest.</p>
<p>The terms of the suit have been changing; that &quot;good faith&quot; thing was added and the deadline was pushed back several months.</p>
<p>With all the trips my wife and I made in 2001 and 2002 (aging parents and other family stuff) I reckon I&#8217;m due about a grand.</p>

		<p>Kind of interested to see what will happen if I use option 2, number of days outside of the US.</p>
<p>I have been living in Europe since 2002 so I will have a huge number of days but I don&#8217;t use that card except for travel and hotels.</p>

		<p>I think that this will cost the Credit Card companies a lot of money. 30 million people received an official packet!</p>

		<p>You aren&#8217;t going to be refunded everything you spent outside the US. &nbsp;Probably about 1% is my guess. &nbsp;So to get a grand, you would have had to spend $100k or so. &nbsp;I&#8217;m sure some did, but I suspect the intersection between those and the readers of this blog is small.</p>
<p>I signed up for the $25. &nbsp;Considering all the class-action suits I&#8217;ve &quot;won&quot; where my award was less than the price of a postage stamp to claim it, that&#8217;s not bad.</p>

		<p>This article is missing an important piece of information: those who may be eligible are people who used credit cards to complete transactions in a foreign currency.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Um, that&#8217;s not correct. See the details as noted in the &#8220;and you meet the other criteria.&#8221; -Raymond</i>]</div>
