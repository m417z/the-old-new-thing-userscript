		<p>The only real complaint I have about this is the naked pointer usage.</p>
<p>When you new in a naked pointer like that, you kill exception safety.  Let&#8217;s say that widecvt decides to throw an exception (or someone else comes in to fix your code and adds something that can throw an exception in the middle).  Your &quot;new&quot; there just created a memory leak.</p>
<p>If you code in a way where you use vectors or auto_ptr&#8217;s instead of naked pointers, then you&#8217;re always exception safe without leaks.  Exception safe C++ coding has increased our code quality and decreased memory leaks a very, VERY significant amount.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m curious to know what it is that you used to profile you&#8217;re code?  The only profiler I&#8217;ve ever used is Shark for the Mac &#8212; did you use something similar to that?</p>

		<p>or check out boost&#8217;s scoped_ptr&lt;&gt; rather than auto_ptr&lt;&gt;.  (see <a href="http://www.boost.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.boost.org</a>)</p>
<p>Either way using an raii-style pointer would make the code more readable, since you wouldn&#8217;t need the delete[], which is quite irrelevant to the logic you are demonstrating.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m w/ Aaron &#8211; I&#8217;d love to hear a little more about how you did: &quot;Upon profiling our dictionary-loader, I discovered that 80% of the CPU time was spent in getline. Clearly this is where the focus needs to be. Everything else is just noise. </p>
<p>Digging a little deeper, it turns out that 29% of the CPU time was spent by getline doing character set conversion in codecvt::do_in. Some debugging revealed that codecvt::do_in was being called millions of times, each time converting just one or two characters. In fact, for each character in the file, codecvt::do_in was called once and sometimes twice!&quot;</p>

		<p>I wonder how can a reusable buffer be slower than calling new and delete every iteration. Especially if you hit your longest line soon in the beginning, or pad it enough so most of your iterations will simply execute a compare (to make sure the buffer is long enough) and go on with their lives. There&#8217;s no way a conditional jump is slower than allocating and freeing memory on the heap.</p>

		<p>Excellent point about exception safety. I don&#8217;t normally program with STL or exceptions &#8211; the fact that I&#8217;m using STL at all is a bit of a departure. </p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know why reusing the buffer made the program slowr but it did. Maybe there are cache effects?</p>

<p>vector&lt;T&gt;::begin() should not be treated as a pointer.  &amp;v[0] is, though.</p>
<p>In the original C++ standard (14882-1998) vector was not explicitly required to have contiguous memory, but the complexity requirements on it pretty much ensured it.  In the 2003 revision of the standard, they made that requirement explicit.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know of a single STL implementation that has a non-contiguous vector, so it&#8217;s pretty safe.</p>
<p>FYI, do you know if widecvt outputs UCS-2 or UTF-16?  If it&#8217;s UTF-16, then it&#8217;s entirely possible that you could have surrogate pairs (two wchar_ts that represent a single Unicode codepoint).</p>

		<p>Universalis, most Win32 APIs expect/use UTF-16 when they recieve or return WCHARs.  I have no doubt that there are many apps out there that do not anticipate this.</p>
<p>A problem that&#8217;s even more widespread are apps that expect every Unicode codepoint to be a single grapheme cluster, and thus don&#8217;t support combining characters.  A good example is IE6 &#8212; the Address box handles them correctly, since it is a standard system-wide text edit control.  The windowless controls used for form input in pages, however, do not handle combining characters properly.  (And Firefox is absolutely broken across the board on this.)</p>
<p>Michael Kaplan touched on this a while ago in his blog.</p>

		<p>To clarify, though, an app that is properly written other than expecting UCS-2 will simply have a broken UI, not a crash.</p>
<p>In UCS-2, the surrogate pair characters are simply two separate characters.  So, if you pass UCS-2 code a surrogate pair, it&#8217;ll expect a string that&#8217;s longer, and render two characters.  This could cause some display bugs, of course, but nothing should be fatal.</p>
<p>This is a good thing, because we didn&#8217;t really support UTF-16 in the UI until WinXP and its ClearType engine; Win2K, for all intents and purposes, acted as though wchar_t/WCHAR was UCS-2.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  You might think that we could avoid redundant allocations by caching the temporary conversion buffer between lines. I tried that, and surprisingly, it actually slowed the program down by 10ms. Such is the counter-intuitive world of optimization. </p>
<p>The fact is that CRT is not required to actually return the memory to the OS after a call to free/delete. It can do its own cashing.</p>
<p>As for the exception safety in the sample, the rule of thumb is: whenever you manually call delete out of a destructor, chances are your code is not exception-safe. Using std::vector or (if you believe it is too much overhead &#8211; talk about premature optimization) booost::scoped_array is the key for making the code exception-safe.

		<p>I usually profile my functions with the CPU cycle counter on the average of many repetitions, running at realtime priority class. That gives me about +/- 15 cycles accuracy. But that&#8217;s for individual, small functions, not something anywhere near 1120 ms (on my computer, monopolizing the single CPU for even half that long kills the computer).</p>

		<p>That is an excellent point that Ryan Myers has just made. For some reason people (at least, people in a hurry) seem to think that &quot;Unicode&quot; means &quot;16-bit&quot; whereas of course it doesn&#8217;t. I was facing just this problem in a database program that needed to do boil-to-an-indexable-form stuff the whole time, and I ended up making the [deeply] internal character representation 32-bit. I know that the supplementary characters are most of them pretty obscure, but the prospect of a program collapsing or producing unintended behaviour just because &#8211; years down the line &#8211; some non-technical user thinks innocently that &quot;a character is a character&quot; (without appreciating that some of them don&#8217;t fit into 16 bits) is really unacceptable. It&#8217;s a 20-year-old program I&#8217;m working with and it is entirely possible that it will still be in use in 20 years&#8217; time.<br />
<br />For the purpose of the example program whose evolution we&#8217;re watching this may be needless and quixotic, but I think it&#8217;s important for any seriously long-lived program to be able to handle the full Unicode character set even if this means a certain va-et-vient between UTF-8 (best on disk), UTF-16 (which I *think* the Windows API uses, but please correct me) and UCS-4 (which we know can accommodate everything).<br />
<br />If some algorithms are slowed unacceptably by the 32-bit character representation, then later, as an optimisation stage, you might produce 16-bit implementations that are rigorously hidden from the caller &#8211; the internal logic could then be &quot;call 16-bit version and if that fails then call 32-bit version&quot;&#8230; this optimisation being &quot;under the surface&quot; and not available to an inappropriately ingenious caller.</p>

		<p>Raymond, three things:</p>
<p>1. Your code is not exception-safe. Variable buf will leak if an exception is thrown inside the loop.</p>
<p>2. Re the temporary buffer allocation performance: A better solution may be to use a class that contains a default buffer which is then allocated on the stack when, but then allocates the buffer on the heap if the default buffer is not big enough.</p>
<p>3. An unfortunate result of the C++ standard rules concerning vectors is that all emements have to be in a contiguous piece of memory. Thus it&#8217;s valid to obtain pointers to various elements and pass them to codecvt::in. I don&#8217;t know if the same applies to basic_string; maybe Herb Sutter can sched some light.</p>
