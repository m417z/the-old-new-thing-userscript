		<p>&gt;&gt; And yes, I know that SATA didn&#39;t exist in 1995.</p>
<p>Yes, but Windows 95 didn&#39;t cease to exist when SATA came to life&#8230; We still have customers running Windows 98, and from time to time, we find the odd Windows 95&#8230; in 2013!</p>

		<p>Antonio,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got an old Win98 machine myself, one that I occasionally fire up for one specific use: To recover old floppy disks. It will soon be retired, but I (and a few of my friends) still have got a few (a few dozen/hundreds, that is) floppies that were bought &quot;preformatted&quot;, but without the proper format code written into the boot sector. Several of the major floppy manufacturers failed to do that.</p>
<p>When DOS/Win16 were fed a floppy without a format code, they didn&#39;t give up immediately, but made an honorable (?) attempt to read the floppy, in all the formats available. If it succeeded, the floppy was accepted (notably: Without writing the proper format code on the disk).</p>
<p>Win32 developers decided that this is nonsence: We cannot forever out of pure kindness handle badly formatted disks by trial and error this way. Badly formatted is badly formatted! So in Win32, lots of those old floppies report &quot;Not formatted&quot;. (Before you ask: No, it does not help using an external USB floppy drive to read the disks.)</p>
<p>Some of my friends used Win16 far into this millenium; the floppies are typically fire to ten years old. I am surprised by how well those old floppies keep up; usually they can be read without any problems. We have had most of them converted by now, but &quot;new&quot; ones pop up every now and then and need to be rescued. Besides, booting up a Win98 machine with a gang of kids around you is a nice way to shut their mouth when they complain about their new 6-core 4 GHz machine with 16 GByte of RAM being untolerably slow&#8230; (One of my friends converted an old Win98 a 700 MHz CPU with 256 MByte of RAM machine to run XP &nbsp;a printer server; he communicates with it through a USB wireless adapter (USB 1.1 only!). It &quot;sort of&quot; works, but it is so slow that Windows Update fails on a timeout.)</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve always thought it&#39;d be fun to have quirky elevator controls in a building full of technical types. &nbsp;For example, a row of toggle switches that you use to enter the floor number in binary with a GO button.</p>
<p>Well, fun for the first little bit and then a gimmick afterwards for visitors I suppose.</p>

		<p>@Jimbo: Are you trying to tell us that Raymond&#39;s dreams were different if he ate cheese *after* going to bed?</p>

		<p>I once worked in a commercial building that, when after 9pm, all people who want to use lift have to open a secret panel to reveal and Octopus(a type of non-contact payment card in Hong Kong) card reader. You tap the card and the elevator will go the the floor pre-registered (or go back to ground floor if already on that floor). If you forgot to bring your card or is a visitor that does not have card registered, you have to go to the counter and apply for a temporary card.</p>

		<p>@JB &#8211; My P2 350 MHz was retired this May from my kids hands &#8211; was used to watch Tom&amp;Jerry from youtube mainly. XP SP3 with 256 MB SDRAM on it / 8 GB HDD and 64 MB video card. It&#39;s from 2001. From gaming perspective last game I was able to play on it was Serious Sam &#8211; The Second Encounter. But was able to run Delphi 7 on it and used as performance test machine last years. If an app was running nice from user perspective on it, I knew there is no more improvement to be done. Eh, but it was Compaq with components made in Taiwan and assembled in Italy, not like today &quot;made in China&quot; that you get.</p>

		<p>How do you know they were hot-swap SATA drives and not some other hot-swap technology which would have been around at the time?</p>
<p>@Antonio But I doubt you&#39;ll be running it in SATA mode.</p>
<p>@Danny I still have a Pentium Pro although all I use it for these days is as a thin client (but not for watching videos, as it tends to run out of resources when I try).</p>

		<p>No, you&#39;re all wrong. SATA of course existed in 1995. It&#39;s all part of the industry&#39;s evil plan to drip feed us all the improvements over a longer period of time to maximize profits. EVERYONE knows that. Mwaahahahaa&#8230;</p>
