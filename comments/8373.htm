		<p>Yes, very interesting. &nbsp;Being a developer from the MS-DOS days, I love to hear pieces of history like this. &nbsp;While the platform may not be very relevant anymore, the lessons learned and techniques used are very relevant. &nbsp;Quite honestly, developers of today could learn a few things from these history lessons. &nbsp;Stories like this often spark a more granular level of thinking in the minds of modern developers who are used to having the details taken care of for them.</p>

		<p>Back in the old days, we used to speculate that the first person to figure out the purpose of this file would win a 20MHz 386 computer from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Of course, this anecdote dates me, because back then we really did want to win a 20MHz 386&#8230;</p>

		<p>I remember how the A20 line was a source of problems, but I never understood exactly what was going on. Now, over 20 years later, I can understand it thanks to Wikipedia!</p>
<p>Apparently when the 80286 was introduced they added additional address lines (previous CPUs had lines A0-A19), but didn&#39;t provide a backwards-compatibility mode to simulate the old behavior of wrapping around at 1MB. In order to avoid breaking software that relied on that wrap-around, IBM installed what was effectively a hardware AND gate between the CPU&#39;s A20 line and RAM. One input to that AND gate was A20 and the other one was controlled by the on-board Intel 8042 that was originally there to manage the keyboard interface, but had an otherwise unused I/O pin.</p>
<p>When internal caches got added to chips (Intel&#39;s i486 in 1989), the cache needed to know the state of the A20 enable line, so they had to add a pin to the CPU (called A20M#, or Address bit 20 Mask). This pin lasted 20 years before finally being retired in 2008 with the Core i7. Note that this is only required for running the bootloader, because nowadays virtual memory is used to create the wrap-around effect.</p>

<p>The lesson I take from it is &quot;trying to be compatible is not always the best thing&quot;.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t think of any good reason why code needs to explicitly require 1048575 + 1 == 0. &nbsp;So, treat that as a bug, fix the offensive code, don&#39;t hook a spare keyboard gate up to the address lines of the processor (!), don&#39;t waste time writing code to virtualize this foolishness, &#8230;</p>
<p>Yeah, yeah, it&#39;s attitudes like mine which explain why I&#39;m not a software billionaire&#8230;</p>

		<blockquote><p>

<p>Well, I&#39;d would probably be very sensible for both Bing and Google to give priority to Microsoft sites over spam-aggregators. That&#39;s the spirit of page rank.</p>

		<p>History, shmistory (line stolen from The Far Side).</p>
<p>And off-topic / for what it&#39;s worth: the first non-advert link when I entered &#39;printer help&#39; in Google (in Australia) went to a Microsoft support page, while the first non-advert link in Bing went to a generic help site for pc&#39;s &amp; macs.

		<p>@dave: Awesome work, you&#39;ve just made a processor that a whole lot existing code doesn&#39;t work on. Who are you going to sell it to? Are you going to pay developers so that you have software that actually works on the processor when you launch it? Are you going to advertise it as &quot;mostly-compatible&quot;? Are the extra outlays and lost revenue more or less costly than a cheap compatibility hack?</p>

		<p>I wonder who the guilty parties were for this. &nbsp;There must be an interesting back story at IBM&#8230; &nbsp;What widely-used piece(s) of software originally needed this A20 hack? &nbsp;Why did IBM originally have to do this for the 286?</p>
<p>I can see it now&#8230; an engineer testing an early 286 motherboard&#8230;</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Hmmm, software XYZ isn&#39;t running.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;&lt;extensive debug session; realizes that software XYZ expects wrap-around behavior&gt;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Stupid programmers, did they really think we&#39;d never have more than 1 MB RAM?</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Nobody will buy this computer if it won&#39;t run software XYZ, flagship killer app of the IBM PC platform!</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Hmmm&#8230;. original software assumed A20 was always 0, what if we use an AND gate to force A20 to 0 unless the user knows how to use &gt; 1 MB RAM?</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;&lt;gets razor knife, cuts A20 trace on the prototype PCB; also located an unused AND gate on the board&gt;</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;&lt;hooks up A20 line on RAM to output of AND gate with piece of wire&gt;</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;&lt;hooks up AND gate input to CPU A20 line with another piece of hookup wire&gt;</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;Uh oh, how will I control this gate? &nbsp;I need an unused I/O!</p>
<p>10. Hey, nobody seems to be using this output on the keyboard controller&#8230;.</p>
<p>I guess the rest is history&#8230; &nbsp;This thing has last-second hack written all over it.</p>

		<p>Another interesting piece of A20 lore: &nbsp;it helped original Xbox users &quot;jailbreak&quot; their device! &nbsp;That console was more or less a PC compatible machine, powered by an Intel Pentium III. &nbsp;It booted from a &quot;secret&quot; ROM at address FFFFFFF0. &nbsp;Hardware hackers pulled down the A20 pin on the CPU to force it to boot from FFEFFFF0 instead, a location in user-overwritable flash memory.</p>

<p>Huh? Why not? To do that you only need a enabled A20 line. Doesn&#39;t matter if it was on in the first place.</p>
<p>Now running the original IBM PC BIOS on an i7, that would be a problem (not least of all because it wouldn&#39;t support the chip in the first place).</p>

		<p>Boring. God, I&#39;m glad we got rid of all that real/protected mode switching and all the crap that comes out of &quot;use real mode&quot;/&quot;use protected mode to have more memory&quot; junk.</p>

		<p>Ditching all the legacy stuff in your CPU is nice and easy. Then you just have the task of persuading customers to buy your new architecture and software developers to develop it, like Intel did so effectively with the Itanium systems we all use now, wiping out those silly backwards-compatible 64-bit chips from AMD &#8230; whoops.</p>
<p>There is a market for nice clean efficient CPU designs: anywhere you don&#39;t need to worry about existing code bases, essentially. Does my current washing machine use the same control chip as the previous one? Who cares &#8211; if the manufacturer wanted to switch from, say, Z80 to 6502, that&#39;s up to them. If my new laptop couldn&#39;t run existing x86 code, though? It would be most of the way to paperweight status already. Ask anyone with an iPhone or Android phone to think about tablets: buy a different platform, re-purchase all their apps and start again, or keep using all the familiar apps they&#39;ve already got and paid for?</p>
<p>It can be a pain sometimes &#8211; but if you couldn&#39;t be sure that shiny new PC would run Windows XP happily, or that Windows 7 would run Office 2003, your favourite old shoot-em-up, that accounts package you rely on and the free PDF generator you&#39;ve got set up to do stuff just the way you like, you won&#39;t be at all happy. Sure, you could upgrade Office &#8211; but then some of those macros you use for client invoices break&#8230;</p>

		<p>&quot;What widely-used piece(s) of software originally needed this A20 hack?&quot;</p>
<p>As Yuhong Bao briefly mentioned above, MS-DOS &#8212; for the CALL 5 entry point. For CP/M-80 compatibility, the offset at PSP bytes 6 and 7 needs to be as high as possible (DOS seems to use 0xFEF0). But it&#39;s also treated as the offset of an entry point within MS-DOS. MS-DOS, certainly in the early versions, was less than 0xFEF0 bytes long, so the only way for 0xFEF0 to be the offset of an address in MS-DOS was to use the wrap. (In fact the entry point chosen was right at the start of memory, 0000:00C0, so the PSP gets set up with the address F01D:FEF0).</p>
<p>Incidentally, CP/M-86 didn&#39;t do this, because it didn&#39;t provide the CALL 5 entry point.</p>

		<p>I think my answer is that I found it interesting because I never had to deal with any of this, so to me it&#39;s an insight into a complex but long-abandoned world. If I had once needed to deal with it, I&#39;m sure it would just a reminder of hours wasted learning arcane details of what should&#39;ve been easy.</p>

		<p>@jas88: Ditching all the legacy stuff in your CPU is nice and easy. Then you just have the task of persuading customers to buy your new architecture and software developers to develop it, like Intel did so effectively with the Itanium systems we all use now, wiping out those silly backwards-compatible 64-bit chips from AMD &#8230; whoops.</p>
<p>You do realize that amd64 isn&#39;t fully backwards compatible with x86, right? amd64 is a completely different architecture to x86, with an ia32 compatibility mode.</p>
<p>It&#39;s best to treat the amd64 CPU as two different CPUs &#8211; a regular x86 with full real mode through protected and all the quirks in-between, with a 64-bit processor with 32-but x86 compatibliity mode on the side. Because once you&#39;re in 64-bit mode, your only option is to run 32-bit code or 64-bit code. If you have 16-bit code, it ain&#39;t gonna work in 64-bit mode. You&#39;ll have to run a 32-bit OS to still use it.</p>
<p>Actually run into this problem from time to time &#8211; and no, VMs will not work for obvious reasons. You have to use something like DOSbox to run your 16-bit app. Or if it&#39;s Windows, hope you have qemu working with Windows 95 or something.</p>

		<p>@dave: How would you expect to fix a bug in a bootloader written 20 years ago for which the source code has been long since lost?</p>
<p>Disassemble it.</p>
