		<p>Of course, this is only true if you have a &quot;binary&quot; spell check. An alternate algorithm could use a Bayesian algorithm to determine the likelihood of word misuse based upon the user&#8217;s habits. More:</p>

		<p>Using the OED as an example isn&#8217;t quite fair, though &#8212; it is by definition a historical dictionary, precisely not one that attempts to canonize the contemporary lexicon. As a bad analogy, it would be like having syntax checking in VB.NET that allowed any syntax since Dartmouth BASIC. :-)</p>

		<p>Huh? Sorry, the Oxford English Dictionary is a historical dictionary?  This is untrue, since it is still used heavily in England and contains many of our modern colloquialisms.</p>
<p>It is true that it does contain historical vocabulary, but I believe it to be incorrect to classify it as a historical dictionary.<br /></p>

		<p>Speaking of dictionaries, on my way home from work yesterday I was thinking about how lame many program&#8217;s spelling is (in particular, Photoshop).  Then I got to thinking: what if the OS provided a dictionary that programs could tie into?  Wouldn&#8217;t that be grand?  Then, as you add words to your dictionary, those are available to any applications that query the dictionary.  Of course, controlling the addition of words may get a bit hairy, but what does everyone think?</p>

		<p>Agreed with Richard about your implied argument of the antiquity of binary spell checks. However, I&#8217;m not certain a user would want to have to train their spell checker. But I&#8217;m not discounting your approach.</p>
<p>The article (but not the author of this blog entry) made mention of using multiple dictionaries. A medical researcher might wish to include a medical dictionary. From the user&#8217;s perspective, this would be the same as using one huge dictionary where each word has metadata (this word is a medical term, this word is a general-purpose term, etc.) and the user can choose which subset(s) of words to spell-check against (English, general-purpose, American spellings only).</p>
<p>Yet another possibility would be to categorize words and spellings by usage frequency and words below a certain threshold would be identified as misspelled, but this approach shouldn&#8217;t be used alone.</p>

		<p>Better still, lets all learn to spell properly.</p>
<p>Seriously, most of the time, I turn it off. It&#8217;s annoying and close to a third of my vocabulary is not in the database, not to mention the horror of having <em>all</em> proper nouns flagged.</p>

		<p>in another life, i worked on the spell checker for the last DOS version of microsoft works &#8212; ver 3.0, i think it was.  my favorite bug was, in the german version, if you ran the spellchecker on the compound word &quot;Feuer-Betriebsunterbrechungs-Versicherungsbedingungen&quot; it would crash.  now THAT&#8217;s a word. :-)<br /></p>

		<p>Well, I&#8217;ve always been a proponent of two dictionaries&#8230;  common vs. all.  Shreaking red lined words if they match neither, but a more gentle &quot;not common&quot; purple or something.</p>

		<p>I guess that&#8217;s a special problem of the English language. German doesn&#8217;t have so many obscure words that are similar to common words. I&#8217;m sure this has to do with the fact that German words are generally longer than English ones. Also, a recent edition of the German Duden contains only about 120,000 entries, which includes many compound words.</p>
<p>Speaking of compound words: I&#8217;m sure the way we form words by joining several existing ones (like &quot;Luftfahrtgesellschaft&quot;(*), meaning &quot;air line&quot;) drives authors of German spellchecking software insane.</p>
<p>(*) &quot;Fluggesellschaft&quot;, meaning the same thing, is much more common.</p>

		<p>A small dictionary doesn&#8217;t completely solve the problem, since you still have common words that are a few typos away from other common words: of vs. off, effect vs. affect, you vs. your vs. yours, etc.  Even humans have trouble spell checking some of these.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s how it is on Mac. If you type something in TextEdit (the equivalent of Notepad) you get the same spelling check as in Mail. There&#8217;s also a general Text To Speech that all applications can use.</p>
<p>Claw:<br />
<br />&#8230;and then wait for all your competitors to sue you for taking advantage of your monopoly position by bundling. </p>
<p>Only if Microsoft makes sure competing spell checkers can&#8217;t work properly.</p>
<p>But to get back to the original subject:<br />
<br />The real problem is that spelling checkers are dumb. They have no context. They don&#8217;t know when to use of and when to use off. As long as this is not solved spelling checkers will never work great, although they are still useful.<br />
<br />I wonder how spelling checkers handle languages like Turkish, where you construct sentences by adding suffixes to words&#8230;</p>

		<p>Here&#8217;s another example of something that doesn&#8217;t get flagged as an error, for the same reason: &quot;spell check&quot;. Everyone* I know, including every single person in this thread, uses this phrase instead of &quot;spelling check&quot;.</p>

<p>So yes, they would be sued by their competitors for bundling. Even if their competitors were working properly. Because that&#8217;s what just happened, and they got fined $500MM for the privilege.

<p>Word does support additional specialist add-in dictionaries for Medical, Legal use etc and has done so for many, many versions. Since Word 2002 it has been possible to change the squiggle colour (but not on a per-lexicon basis): <a target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/?scid=kb;es-es;E284845" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/?scid=kb;es-es;E284845</a> .</p>
<p>&quot;The real problem is that spelling checkers are dumb. They have no context.&quot; This is because Word does not give the spell-checker context, not because the spell-checker can&#8217;t handle it.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think MS would get sued for offering a common dictionary for others to use.  In fact, if they just opened up the Office dictionary, that&#8217;d be great.  Not very antitrust.</p>
<p>Now, if it was setup so that MS apps would access the dictionary faster&#8230; that&#8217;d be a problem.</p>
<p>Shared dictionaries make sense (notice: not necessarily the same spell checker, just the dictionary) as other OSes are implementing it.  There should be the common dictionary plus a custom one for each user.</p>

		<p>Go to any language transltion pages and or programs- For example- Type up a paper about 1 page with clear sentence structure and proper grammar- spell check&#8230;then take that page and have it translate it for example into French&#8230;then take that French page and have it translate back into English and run it through a Spell Checker and Grammar checker- I can tell you it does not look pretty.</p>

		<p>No, the &quot;lets&quot; in my post was not deliberate. I made a mistake. But the issue(s) remains. </p>
<p>1) The &quot;lets&quot; is not flagged &#8217;cause it is a valid word.</p>
<p>2) As mentioned above, homonyms can really **ss one OF (sic).</p>
<p>3) It is extremely annoying to see red line all over the document, when one works with fonts for other languages. Due to the really messy situation of a standardised Tamil Keyboard Layout, despite honourable efforts by the UNICODE team, almost 95% of us use a TrueType Font, to key in Tamil. Further 75% of all the correspondence is bi-lingual, i.e., English in Roman script interspersed with Tamil in Dravidian script. So turning the spelling off is generally not preferred.  I know this is not the fault of the Spelling Check feature, but the annoyance remains.</p>
<p>4) For the life of me, I cannot get MS Word to use British spelling. I know it is possible, but somehow I am an unable to achieve it. The &quot;S&quot;-s &amp; &quot;U&quot;-s are very important to be me.</p>
<p>5) I live in India, work in India for Indians. Cities, People, Organisations, all have un-Anglo-Saxon names, to coin a term. At least an option that skips checking for spelling mistakes, when one capitalises a word, within a sentence, will go a long way in reducing the discomfort (&quot;horror&quot; was an overstatement, I admit) of seeing red lines all over my documents.</p>

		<p>1) that&#8217;s where a gramamr checker comes in handy</p>
<p>2) yes, but you can force common homonyms to be flagged so that you can manually check for them</p>
<p>3-5) UK spelling is easy (as is Australian &amp; Canada). Make sure your computer is properly set up with UK English for your keyboard language. Unfortunately almost every OEM who sells in the English speaking world sets up<br />
<br />the computer with English US settings, and Windows, Office etc follow that. Word tags each word in a document according to the keyboard language.</p>
<p>You can also select any text range and mark it to skip spelling and grammar checking. Use the Set Language dialog. Or you could simply mark that text as Tamil etc so that the English proofing tools skip over them. Setting up multiple keyboard languages that can be toggled is useful for multilingual users. Note that you do not have to change the keyboard LAYOUT, only the keyboard LANGUAGE.</p>
<p>Once a document is &quot;finished&quot; I would recommend tagging it all to skip spell-checking. That means that you and subsequent readers will not have to endure red squiggle horrors.</p>
<p>***********<br />
<br />What I object to, is Word listing several dozen &quot;languages&quot; that it does not provide any support for, or does not actually differentiate from other &quot;languages&quot;. It actually confuses &quot;languages&quot; with &quot;locales&quot; in its UI as do other Microsoft products and many pages on <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com</a> . </p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Being a word processor, all emphases are added using by changing font display, bold, italics, etc. </p>
<p>You can use Word styles to create a text style that is (for example) italicised and which has the skip-spell-checking flag on, or which is tagged as a different language.</p>
<p>Word could implement options to ignore all capitalized words just as it has options to ignore words in CAPS etc. However people generally forget these are on and then they complain that Word doesn&#8217;t pick up their errors. Proofing tools are great for a quick check, but they are not the final word in document review.</p>
<p>&gt;I don&#8217;t think MS would get sued for offering a common dictionary for others to use. In fact, if they just opened up the Office dictionary, that&#8217;d be great. </p>
<p>Microsoft licenses most of its proofing tools from other companies, so it does not have the rights to open them up in many cases. There are literally hundreds of lexicons involved: spelling, grammar, thesaurus, speech, handwriting, hyphenation etc multiplied by over three dozen languages.</p>
<p>&gt;You can access the Office spell checker using COM. I&#8217;ve done it, so I know it&#8217;s possible. </p>
<p>Certainly, and you can do it as documented via VBA Word automation, but unless you have a special license you can&#8217;t use the API to access the contents directly (for the reason cited above).

		<p>A regular viewer suggests: &quot;Better still, lets all learn to spell properly.&quot;</p>
<p>Bravo!</p>
<p>Spell checkers didn&#8217;t really exist even just a few decades ago&#8230; yet many books were published with only a few spelling and grammar errors.</p>
<p>Today, with the prevalent dependence on the word processor to check both, I see many, many more errors.</p>
<p>I did not even spell check on my resume.  If there was a mistake, it was an honest one, and a reflection of my true writing style.  (and yes, I make mistakes)  I did, of course, ask people with good eyes to review it. ;-)</p>
<p>Besides, a good third (if not more) of my writing is technical: pseudocode or documentation.  I&#8217;m a programmer.  Even with the formal quoting mechanisms I use, there&#8217;s no way to tell a word processor &quot;these styles represent content in a separate language, don&#8217;t check them&quot;.</p>

<p>In MS Word, I create paragraph styles for pseudocode.  In the style definition dialog, I select &#8216;Language&#8217; and set the &#8216;Do not check spelling or grammar&#8217; option.   This really cuts down on the false positives in my documents.</p>

		<p>OK, have to vent about the EU crap.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t think of anything more competitive than media players.  No one has a majority market position, and most users need to install multiple players to use all of the content they run into.</p>
<p>And unless Real was the *only* player on the planet, I won&#8217;t install that trash.  RN really need to figure that out.</p>
<p>Yet here&#8217;s the EU, grabbing $617M so they can level the pitch.  And line their pockets.  At one time, this was called /extortion/.</p>
<p>I really wish MS would simply stop selling and/or supporting nations involved with the EU.  Can you imagine the grinding halt this would accomplish?  Get your $617M worth out of it, Mr. Gates!</p>
<p>Listen, I know MS hasn&#8217;t been perfect about this.  But last time I checked, it&#8217;s the US that&#8217;s leading the innovation here.  If the US gov&#8217;t is ok with how the media player sitch looks, why does the EU care?  </p>
<p>Oh ya &#8212; money.<br /></p>

		<p>Remaining off-topic, It makes no difference, MS will still win. At least, so says <a target="_new" href="http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20040401.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/pulpit20040401.html</a> </p>
<p>The conclusion</p>
<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>Justice is blind, slow, and unequal. What makes this possible is a legal system designed for the late 18th century and operated by a government that effectively believes that while antitrust matters to individuals and companies its effect on nations cancels out. Only it doesn&#8217;t if the companies involved are as big and powerful as Microsoft or Intel or Wal-Mart &#8212; companies of near-infinite resources and near-total fixation on executing a global strategy.</p>
<p>There are only two ways for a society to address such taking advantage of a legal system. One way is to drag that legal system into the 21st century, which isn&#8217;t going to happen in America. The other way is to dramatically simplify the legal system along the lines of nomadic justice where there are no prisons nor even capability for collecting damages, so all correction comes down to death or maiming. That isn&#8217;t going to happen, either, so Microsoft wins.</p>
<p>&lt;/quote&gt;</p>

		<p>&quot;Is there a keyboard shortcut for toggling the Word spellchecking or language quickly when writing&#8230;?&quot; Yes: use the afore-mentioned keyboard-layout switching mechanism. I.e. add a keyboard layout, and assign it a language that doesn&#8217;t have a spelling dictionary available. Assign your desired shortcut for switching keyboards (I use left Alt + Shift), and turn on the systray icon (so you know which language you&#8217;re using).</p>

<p>The Research Pane in Word 2003 allows something similar. The pane can be set to a thesaurus or encylopaedia or some other plug-in so that it displays relevant material for words in your document.

		<p>&gt;Is there a keyboard shortcut for toggling the Word spellchecking or language quickly when writing, without resorting to mouse at any point?</p>
<p>The answer depends on the effect you&#8217;re trying to achieve:<br />
<br />* to hide the squiggles: Create a macro that toggles Tools &gt; Options &gt; Spelling &amp; Grammar &gt; Check Spelling as you type (and the grammar option).<br />
<br />* to mark the upcoming text to skip spell-checking &#8211; either use Martha&#8217;s trick OR create a macro to set the language flag to skip spell-checking OR use a macro to switch to a different text style that has the skip spell-checking attribute OR use a variant one of these ideas</p>
