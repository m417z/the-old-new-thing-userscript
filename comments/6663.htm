		<p>The old Indexing Service (NT4 through XP) had a similar bug. &nbsp;If you quickly created and deleted a directory the Indexing Service would retain a handle to it, leaving a zombie directory that you couldn&#39;t do anything with. &nbsp;Killing the service killed the zombie.</p>

<p>Do you know the history of &#39;why&#39; the current model was chosen? &nbsp;It seems to be more complicated to use, and I assume more complicated to implement. So therefore I suppose it must have been chosen deliberately, but why?</p>

		<p>Well I know it about the interference being blamed on antivirus. We have had similar incidents for which we gave the same explanation by the same twists of reasoning, but when its our customers that hit it and they are unwilling to remove the antivirus to test it (merely disable doesn&#39;t actually work with most antivirus software when you&#39;re trying to probe for the problems it causes) so it never gets truly tested.</p>
<p>[¹Every so often, the NT file system folks dream of changing the deletion model to be more Unix-like, but then they wonder if that would end up breaking more things than it fixes.]</p>
<p>In my testing, 99% of programs that don&#39;t pass FILE_SHARE_DELETE to CreateFile are safe to do so, and 99% of these don&#39;t pass it because they create via fopen() which doesn&#39;t know. fopen() probably should pass FILE_SHARE_DELETE because it originated on UNIX where that was the behavior.</p>
<p>Do that little bit, that is, find a way to change the default behavior to FILE_SHARE_DELETE asserted, and I can test for the rest, as to whether or not such a program will actually break. A new flag to MoveFileEx and CreateFileEx to cross-assert FILE_SHARE_DELETE would work just as well.</p>

		<p>Interference from AntiVirus and other &quot;grabby&quot; software is the reason why I am paranoid about closing a file I am soon going to re-open nowadays. We&#39;ve seen cases where we close a temporary file we created and noone else should care about, almost immediately try to re-open it and get a sharing violation. Something &quot;grabbed&quot; it as soon as we let go of it. Not very nice. It was backup software, I think.</p>

		<p>Anti-Virus software might be the number one offender in such a situation, but the Shell&#39;s video file analyzer is certainly a close second. More often than not, I&#39;m not able to delete video files because Explorer does stuff like compute the duration of the file (which I&#39;m not interested at) or generate thumbnails (which I generally don&#39;t use). In Windows XP, there was a simple workaround for this (regsvr /u shmedia.dll), but in Windows 7, the only way to stop the madness is to remove HKCR.&lt;filetype&gt;ShellEx{3D1975AF-0FC3-463d-8965-4DC6B5A840F4} for every possible video file type. Even worse, these entries might reappear after updates :(</p>

		<p>We commonly see this while doing builds. &nbsp;The linker creates a new .dll or .exe and a corresponding .pdb, and it takes a while for the anti-malware (and other IT-mandated surveillance software) to do their scans of the new files, especially since the build is largely I/O bound anyway. &nbsp;Meanwhile, in a subsequent build step, the manifest tool tries to update the manifest information in newly-created binary, but it fails because the aforementioned software still has the files locked for the duration of their scans.</p>
<p>After upgrading the toolchain, we&#39;ve seen that the manifest tool now backs off and retries a couple times before giving up. &nbsp;Most of the time, that&#39;s enough to make the build successful, but not always.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve hit this a few times with various backup/sync tools &#8211; try building in a synced or backed up directory, you&#39;ll occasionally find you can&#39;t replace foo.exe because it&#39;s being synced at the time.</p>
<p>I am less irritated by this minor misdemeanor after finding one AV product which actually bugchecked (BSOD) the whole system any time a file was closed which had previously been opened by number. It seemed to create an internal record (the filename?) on open, then free that structure on close &#8230; no filename, no buffer, free junk, unhappytime.</p>

		<p>Previewers has been a bane of file/directory deletion, in XP. They behave better these days, though.</p>
<p>And nobody has mentioned yet the infamous &quot;disappearing source file&quot; problem in the VB6 IDE (or VB5?). Yep, that&#39;s because of some antivirus.</p>

		<p>&quot;[We have no way of contacting the customer. We don&#39;t even know who the customer is! Only the customer liaison knows. -Raymond]&quot;</p>
<p>My psychic powers tell me that we should now ask the question that Rick C was really trying to ask, which is the next obvious question: &nbsp;&quot;How often, if at all, does Microsoft ask the customer liaison to contact these people and determine if there was a resolution?&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that hard to answer Rick C&#39;s question! &nbsp;It&#39;s as if you, Raymond, answered the question &quot;Do you know what time it is?&quot; by saying &quot;Yes, I do.&quot; &nbsp;:-)</p>

		<p>How do you rule your Anti Virus software out if company policy does not allow (for good reasons) you to uninstall or even disable it? I had similar experiences with multi threaded file copying where during random times the copy operation did fail although no file was copied two times (see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9772970/privcopyfileexw-bug-in-windows" rel="nofollow">stackoverflow.com/&#8230;/privcopyfileexw-bug-in-windows</a>). MS support told me that it was (as always) the virus scanner. But not this time. It was a bug in Windows (even the first Beta of Windows 8 still had it) since Vista. I have not tried out the latest Windows 8 build if the issue is fixed there now.</p>

		<p>If you run into this kind of thing, a trace with call stacks from either sysinternals&#39; Process Monitor or xperf/wpa (capture call the filesystem operations with call stacks) can be very illuminating. &nbsp;Call stacks are necessary since so many things run as plus-ins/add-ins and some antivirus software runs in-process by shimming all calls through to the OS that do file manipulation.</p>

		<p>Not really related (only very tightly), but why oh why was the explorer/shell behaviour changed when pressing delete with a selection of files? In older Windows&#39; (even pre XP I think) the very first thing that would always pop up was the security message &quot;Do you really want to delete &#8230;&quot;. So my fingers learned for things to delete, press delete and enter very fast after each other (to directly confirm the message)</p>
<p>Now there is a bigger delay between the time delete was pressed and the confirmation message comes up. And Explorer actually reacts on things in between. This change really bit me hard.</p>
<p>Once I got a trojan (must&#39;ve been XP pre SP2), several Britney Spears Game.exe&#39;s appeared on a few folders. So I used search to find all instances. Selected them all, pressed delete followed by enter. Yay! Delete was passed of to the shell which did godknowswhat, and the enter press started all selected instances of the trojan. While my PC was going down I saw the shell delete confirmation box come up.</p>

		<p>Older versions of the Vembu backup open file agent did this. I know because in an ironic twist it prevented Sophos Anti-Virus from updating itself! I don&#39;t see the problem with a recent version of the software, I think they switched to using volume shadow copies or something.</p>

		<p>1 &#8211; Modern anti-viruses all have exceptions implemented. Exception to files, exceptions to folders, exceptions to protocols, exceptions to whatever you dream of. If you have a predefined work area tell the anti-virus to not touch it. It really helps.</p>
<p>2 &#8211; &quot;// assume &quot;a&quot; is a large file, say, 1MB.&quot;&lt;/quote&gt;. Heck I create such &quot;large&quot; files hundreds of them each day &#8211; actually I create hundreds of 10 MB files each day. 1 MB is hardly a large file with current hardware capabilities. (anti-nitpicker comment &#8211; &lt;you use Delphi which is a poor IDE and creates large files just for the sake of it&gt;)</p>

		<p>@neil: we still have one of these systems at work (till January or so). Really great, when it randomly decides &quot;this server has seen a lot of file changes recently, better lock them all at the same time and back them up&quot; with some extra-large (&gt;1GB) files mixed in the bunch. While some user is moving directories around&#8230;</p>
<p>We asked for VSS when they last announced to do a new version. Got the answer &quot;can things slow down in some circumstances, won&#39;t do it&quot;. Yeah, sure&#8230;.</p>

		<p>@Alois: &quot;How do you rule your Anti Virus software out if company policy does not allow (for good reasons) you to uninstall or even disable it?&quot;</p>
<p>You install &lt;insert favorite PC virtualization tool name here&gt; and create one or more virtual machines (of various flavors) to test your software on.</p>

		<p>The other fun one for my group was the anti-virus that bogged everything down, but only when it was disabled. Apparently the scanning engine wouldn&#39;t shut off the &quot;drivers&quot; when it stopped listening, and the drivers would sit and wait for&#8230; something?</p>
<p>The solution was to either uninstall the AV, or never *ever* disable it. (For reasons unknown, the client had deployed AV to _almost_ all the servers, and then intentionally configured it to be disabled on specific machines. Instead of including them in the &quot;don&#39;t install&quot; list.)</p>

		<p>Question:</p>
<p>Does Microsoft work with AV vendors, to encourage them to use Oplocks? &nbsp;I know of one current corporate AV product which does exactly what Raymond posts above. &nbsp;Plus, it prevents you from ejecting USB media &quot;as it&#39;s in use&quot;.</p>

		<p>That sounds like a problem we were having. Perhaps you &quot;had to (write) that because of me&quot;.</p>

		<p>Part of the configuration detection script used to build Firefox includes autoconf macros that quickly compile and delete executables. Every so often, this fails. In January they finally gave up and added in a 1 second delay to the script. Then in May they decided that this wasn&#39;t enough and bumped it up to 2 seconds&#8230;</p>
