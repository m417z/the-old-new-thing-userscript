		<p>My Linux box window manager crashed recently when I tried to copy a &gt;4GB file to WebDAV.</p>
<p>I fear that unless the Linux folks go back to the drawing board on this operating system, only light users will get anything out of it</p>

		<p>I&#39;m impressed that there were 400,000 testers in 1995. That&#39;s some serious coin. Thanks.</p>

		<p>I suppose the interesting part for me was to many people in 1995, it was a time when computers and operating systems and software was so new that the idea that it can be shipped with bugs and defects and issues and problems and unexpected behaviors and the like was not understood.</p>
<p>To the point where the Associated Press felt it was newsworthy and threw it on the wire.</p>
<p>That said, I think every media outlet in the world got into bashing the Windows 8 Start &quot;bug,&quot; so I suppose you can keep expecting more gems like this in the future.</p>

		<p>I remember another story that went around the national news that said Win95 was being released with something like 50k known bugs. IIRC: It was conflating incident issues in the tracker (doc misspellings, etc) with functional bugs, but it was still sensationally pushed.</p>

		<p>@ Jens, good find &#8211; thanks!</p>
<p>On that same page is an article about IBM licensing an app suite for OS/2. &nbsp;Of the two articles, one of the products became Very successful &#8212; the other, not so much.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d consider Win8&#39;s lack of a start menu to be a &quot;bug,&quot; but I&#39;d definitely argue that the person responsible should never again be allowed to do UX work without supervision.</p>

		<p>@Keith P:</p>
<p>I remember that incident, though I believe it was NT and not Windows 95. &nbsp;Somebody had leaked the entire DTS, which includes not only document bugs, but every thing ever logged: fixed bugs, duplicate bugs, issues that were by design, etc. &nbsp;The total still got reported as &quot;NT has NNNNN known bugs!&quot; &nbsp;I have learned not to expect too much from the press, but the Open Source crowd on Slashdot had several field days with it, and it seems to me some of them should have known better.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>I remember this incident. The number was taken right after a static code analysis run was made over the entire operating system, so most of the &quot;bugs&quot; were things like &quot;Static analysis thinks there may be a memory leak here. Please confirm.&quot; In other words, they weren&#39;t even defects. They were <span style="text-decoration:underline;">potential</span> defects. (Static analysis had a high false positive rate.) -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>How would it really be news even if a non-beta product with millions of lines of code has a bug? &nbsp;Only if it were of particular severity&#8211;security, particularly damaging, easily triggered, etc.&#8211;would it be newsworthy.</p>
<p>@Anon: More like, the supervisors should never be allowed to do supervision without supervision. &nbsp;Don&#39;t blame user experience designers when bad orders come from above.</p>

		<p>Well even if it *was* a serious bug in the shipped version, Microsoft would&#39;ve denied it anyway, refused a hotfix, called the customer afraid of change, called the bug &quot;By Design&quot; or some absurd insult and fixed it in vNext.</p>

		<p>@Anon I witnessed the hate for Microsoft adding the Start Menu in the first place when Program Manager was considered the height of UX design. The majority of hate comes from people who barely use the Start Menu as it had become unwieldy and instead have short cuts on their desktop, these people shouldn&#39;t be allowed near a computer without supervision. I love Windows 8 and I have no need for emotional crutches like installing Start Menu replacements (Although I am &quot;l337&quot; and use the command line a lot).</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d consider Win8&#39;s lack of a start menu to be a &quot;bug,&quot; but I&#39;d definitely argue that the person responsible should never again be allowed to do UX work without supervision.&quot;</p>
<p>You can argue whatever you want.</p>

		<p>[so I suppose you can keep expecting more gems like this in the future.]</p>
<p>No need to suppose, I remember seeing review on Win10 TP last week that it has so much &quot;flaw&quot; that makes it not a productive choice for consumers. (Basically lots of &quot;old users need to learn where the things are placed&quot; sort of things) Heck, it&#39;s not even a beta release.</p>

		<p>As usual, Raymond is conveniently leaving out incriminating information, but it is described in the linked InfoWorld article, it was an architectural design flaw. Not a fixable bug. The flaw was never fixed in windows 95, because windows 95 was never meant to have this kind of isolation between apps.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>As I noted in the article, I never found the original report, so I didn&#39;t know exactly what they&#39;re complaining about. But the article you refer to doesn&#39;t match the reports. The complaints weren&#39;t about memory safety; they were about apps locking up. Also, the reports were that there was already a fix for the bug. (Though in the article you refer to, I like how people are complaining that a bad driver can corrupt memory. That still hasn&#39;t bee fixed.) -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>OS/2 was running drivers in ring1, that&#39;s a real *fix* compared to NT. In NT (which was destined to become OS/2 3.0) drivers are running in ring0 and can corrupt memory all over. Please fix ASAP.</p>
