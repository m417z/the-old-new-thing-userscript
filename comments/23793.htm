		<p>I am convinced that everybody who appears as a guest on Jerry Springer is a paid actor. &nbsp;Maybe it was genuine at first, but after a while people must have caught on. &nbsp;Think about it; nobody appearing on Jerry Springer ever gets good news. &nbsp;It&#8217;s always a slutty housewife cheating on her husband with a drunk midget transvestite or a slutty teenage daughter introducing her ashamed parents to the train of 8 burly men she rides every night.</p>
<p>The type of people who watch Jerry Springer know two things: if Publishers Clearing House is knocking on your door, it&#8217;s good news; if Jerry Springer is knocking on your door, it&#8217;s bad news. &nbsp;I cannot imagine anyone would willingly appear on Jerry Springer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if these people are not actors I have a suggestion. &nbsp;Presumably Jerry Springer has a list of everyone who has ever appeared on his show. &nbsp;By sending these people (and all their offspring, just to be safe) directly into the sun the human condition should improve tremendously.</p>

		<p>Can I just chip in my tuppence and say I&#8217;m a huge fan of Jerry Springer: The Opera. I saw it during it&#8217;s UK tour and have rarely laughed so hard. I heartily recommend that anyone who&#8217;s able to go to see this does.</p>
<p>You might also not be aware of the controversy surrounding the broadcast of a live recording on BBC2 (see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://snipurl.com/1xk41" rel="nofollow">http://snipurl.com/1xk41</a>) and the protests over it&#8217;s national tour of the UK (see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://snipurl.com/1xk49" rel="nofollow">http://snipurl.com/1xk49</a>).</p>

		<p>THIS is one of the reasons I read your wonderful quips EVERY workday RIGHT when I come in in the morning. &nbsp;I need something to wake me up.</p>
<p>This entry most certainly has.</p>
<p>Not since when you wrote about &quot;that guy who drove his truck on the roof&quot; have I splattered my monitor with sooo much tea.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it. &nbsp;We come here for win32. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But we keep coming here for stuff like THIS :)</p>
<p>Thank you, SIR!</p>

		<p>Weird! I live in the UK and always assumed JS:TO was a US export like the show it was based on.</p>

		<p>Please, please have this go on to Seattle or get made into a movie so I can see it!</p>
<p>And if they can dumb it down a bit so I don&#8217;t have to learn what words like &quot;coloratura&quot; mean, I&#8217;d appreciate it.</p>

		<p>It sounds like an episode of &quot;South Park&quot;.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve seen this, I&#8217;d go back. It was worth the half-price. Hopefully it&#8217;ll stop by Seattle.</p>

		<p>@mikeb: It is available on Region 1 DVD (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://snipurl.com/1xlit" rel="nofollow">http://snipurl.com/1xlit</a>) if you have a compatible player. And it&#8217;s more an episode of Jerry Springer turned into an opera than an opera turned into an episode of Jerry Springer. Coloratura is never even mentioned ;)</p>

		<p>Towards the end of last year, a religious group tried to prosecute the Director General of the BBC (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Thompson" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Thompson</a>) for Blashpemy. They lost in the High Court in a judgement which gutted (the already gutless) blaphemy laws. As a result the British Government has effectively agreed to repeal them.</p>

		<p>@Mark: thanks for the pointer &#8211; I should have thought to do a search&#8230; &nbsp;Oh, why can&#8217;t Raymond do all this work for us ahead of time?</p>
<p>So lets see, with today&#8217;s exchange rate &#163;4 would cipher out to about as much as going to see it in person &#8211; guess I&#8217;m good then!</p>

		<p>&quot;I am not making this up.&quot;</p>
<p>No, someone else did. You know, it&#8217;s fiction.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe I had to write that.</p>
