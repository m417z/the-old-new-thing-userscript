		<p>I wonder why it is that my girlfriend&#8217;s mom has a &nbsp;house that&#8217;s about 3000 sq. feet with huge ceilings that&#8217;s been at 68 degrees all week while most of them have been away on vacation. &nbsp;It&#8217;s inhabited by three cats, my girlfriend (about 8 hours for sleep) and her little sister (slept there, I think, two nights over the last week, mostly at her dad&#8217;s otherwise).</p>
<p>The money she spends to cool that place could pay my rent.</p>

		<p>But wait! Big houses are more efficient to cool. Heat loss is a result of surface area which scales to the square, whereas living space is a function of volume, which scales to the cube.</p>
<p>So if people lived <em>together</em> in a big house, energy would be saved.</p>

		<p>I, on the other hand, turned off my AC when I went on vacation. &nbsp;While we were gone we had a HHH streak (thats hot, hazy, humid). &nbsp;When I got back the neighbours told me that my smoke alarms had been going off for 2 days straight. &nbsp;The firefighters and police had been by to check on the house. &nbsp;Their working theory was that the humidity in the house got too high and I should have left the AC on to keep it down. &nbsp;Though to their credit they did say to set it higher than normal 27-28 C (81-84 F).</p>

		<p>&#8212;&quot;Though to their credit they did say to set it higher than normal 27-28 C (81-84 F).&quot;&#8212;-</p>
<p>But that is more or less what the normal should be. Maybe a degree or two less if there is really high humidity.</p>
<p>There is nothing stupider than seeing people in Florida wearing jackets and ties because the air-conditioning inside the building is set so high.</p>
