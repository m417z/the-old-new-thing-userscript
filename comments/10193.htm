		<p>And every once in a while you get a post packed with little tidbits of information that may be useful one day (I have never had to play with localization myself, but I suspect I will one day).</p>
<p>I hope the next couple of blogs are more details about what had to be done (such as how you solved the HKEY_CLASSES_ROOTtxtfile problem).</p>

		<p>And who claims it&#39;s a new feature? :) The Windows geeks always knew about this. Maybe you should stop saying &quot;nobody&quot; and start saying &quot;Joe Average&quot;. And this feature is still out of reach because MS keeps it exclusive to Enterprise and Ultimate editions. MUI should be there in Home Premium and above.</p>

		<p>I would have loved them marketing it to end users right away. Well actually, I couldn&#39;t have cared less about marketing it properly. But just having the option of installing the English version only, without the German localization (or even better, remove the lanugage pack later, as the OS is mostly preloaded anyway) would have been great. One thing I always did in Linux was to never install German localization files. In Windows I never had this option, until I switched from XP to Windows 7 and found that even my pre-installed Windows 7 on my new laptop allowed me to choose English as my interface language. Finally! Bad to know I could have had this 10 years ago &#8230;</p>

		<p>Raymond described the right behavior for the Window XP, but not for window 7. In Window 7, when I installed the English and try to bring the other language, like Chinese. I found a great difficulty to display the characters for the OS interface, do not know why. Maybe window 7 was changed for the language support procudure?</p>

		<p>Well, if you had to have the English version installed in order to be able to change the language, the feature did not exist for all the people who had any non-English version installed, did it? So the ability to change the OS language is &quot;new&quot; for all of them.</p>

		<p>Yes, I did read it; however I believe the conclusion was that the US market would consider our British spellings wrong, and the UK market is more tolerant to US spellings. It is sad that our UK differences are going to be lost and I believe MS is helping to pave the road to oblivion. I should certainly be prepared to pay more for a British English version. I raise the point again because the post suggests that it is now relatively easy to add new languages thanks to the MUI.</p>

		<p>#trevor: evolution hurts. The British (and the rest of the world that avoided Webster&#39;s bastardisations) have nothing on the Portugese, though. They&#39;re now 3rd cousins to Brazil who drove most of the recent Portugese-language spelling reform.</p>

<p>&quot;And this feature is still out of reach because MS keeps it exclusive to Enterprise and Ultimate editions. MUI should be there in Home Premium and above.&quot;</p>
<p>One reason it isn&#39;t in Home editions is so that MS can price Windows differently in different locales, in an attempt to solve one of the biggest reasons of piracy. Often they even restrict activation to certain locales.</p>

		<p>Now we just need to remove the &quot;A&quot; versions of API calls from Win32 to force remaining application developers to support Unicode. &nbsp;I&#39;m tired of having programs blow up because I installed them in a directory whose name cannot be represented in the system code page.</p>

		<p>@Myria &#8211; removing the ANSI API wouldn&#39;t force app developers to &quot;support Unicode&quot; &#8211; it would force them to work in Unicode whether they know how to support it or not. &nbsp;Which isn&#39;t the same thing. &nbsp;Proper &quot;Unicode Support&quot; isn&#39;t just about using UTF16 everywhere.</p>

		<p>Trevor: one of the great things about English is its lack of standardisation. &nbsp;Kids learn that the spellings they see aren&#39;t authoritative or universal, and therefore are less worried about using a &quot;received&quot; orthography. &nbsp;Would you also want a MUI for the tens of dialects in the UK?</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Windows may have <em>supported</em> MUI for a long time, but it wasn&#39;t until Vista that regular users could get their hands on it
</p></blockquote>
<p>OEM versions of Windows XP usually came with either language packs preinstalled (and you could choose them in the Language applet in Control Panel), or included CDs with language packs (this makes me wonder: I have several of such CDs &#8211; some let you install a single language only, which once installed is automatically applied for all users, and you can&#39;t switched back to English, while other CDs allow installing multiple languages, which each user can then pick individually in Control Panel).</p>
<p>Also, I wish Windows localization would support proper plural forms &#8211; right now it seems to only support one/many distinction, which is not enough for languages such as Slovenian.</p>

		<p>Yeah, all my WinCE days of building just made me use wide strings, and the use of mbstowcs and wcstombs.</p>
<p>The fun part was when using different API sets &#8211; you got a skinny string but had to pass in a fat one, then you got a fat one and had to make it skinny again. Some calls had this happen several times as they traversed from application down to the kernel&#8230;</p>

		<p>&quot;From Windows Vista onwards, all versions of Windows consist of a base language-neutral version with a language pack installed on top.&quot;</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Very confusingly. From Vista onwards, the file and directory names are always in English, but Explorer shows localized names. Maybe it looks pretty, but just about everybody I know (me included) was confused by this at one time or another (especially since the file list shows localized name, but the input boxes only accept on-disk names, and there&#39;s no indication why typing what you see doesn&#39;t work).</p>

		<p>Oh and Office allows you to install language packs too. However, they cost money. I can&#39;t normally get an English version of office here in Germany. The English language pack costs an extra 27EUR. Are you crazy? English is the language the software is created in. I should not pay anything extra for downloading <em>the_source_language</em>, should I?</p>

		<p>@Alex: buy the German version of Office, then download the English trial version and activate it with the CD-key that you bought.</p>

		<p>Do realise that after changing the language pack, you can not install service packs or new Internet Explorers like you are used too. I succeeded in changing a dutch Windows 7 to the english version, than SP1 came out and the boot would hang on a language related error. This seemed to be common knowledge, just like the multiple UI thing?</p>

		<p>@Rick: you can only change the language on Enerprise and Ultimate SKUs (on Ultimate you can install them through Windows Update, then switch them per-user in the Control Panel, and this will not cause any problems).</p>
<p>On any other version of Windows, you&#39;re stuck with the language you installed with (and various hacks to change the language later are exactly that &#8211; hacks). If you want a different language version of Windows on non-Ultimate, get an install DVD in that language and do a clean install (though according to Microsoft this is not legal &#8211; you&#39;re supposed to install and use only the language you bought, unless you have Ultimate).</p>
