		<p>Somebody should put together a DVD set with all the videos and supplements. &nbsp;I downloaded about 20 of the high def WMV files and all told they&#8217;re over 6 GB in size. &nbsp;Those were only the ones with interesting titles / abstracts in my area of expertise; there were quite a few more outside my normal scope that sounded interesting.</p>

		<p>I snagged a sensor kit the second they brought in the bin. &nbsp;Mostly for the accelerometer and USB-programmable microcontroller. &nbsp;Lots of possibilities there&#8211;way more interesting than making text bigger in direct sunlight (did anyone else think that would be distracting on, say, a day with patchy clouds, when your text keeps jumping around as you&#8217;re trying to read it?)</p>

		<p>I hung around the C9 lounge to see what people would do with their beanbag chairs. A few people just carried them out as-is over their shoulders. The folks who had to fly home unzipped the bottom of the chairs and poured the filling material into trash cans.</p>

		<p>When my friends and I were in Japan, we left some of our baggage in Kyoto Station, only realizing it when we were about thirty minutes from arriving at Tokyo Station. &nbsp;I used those last thirty minutes to write down a quick description of our bags and an explanation of what happened while referencing my electronic dictionary, and when we went to the lost and found station I basically just handed the sheet of paper to the attendant. &nbsp;It was much better than trusting on my memory to deliver me the right words at the right time. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t have that luxury in the followup discussion, but I think it was the best start we could have had to the conversation.</p>

		<p>&gt; &#8220;iTunes format&#8221;</p>
<p>This expression offends me. You probably meant &#8220;in a format compatible with the iPod&#8221;, which is what they use over at Channel 9 and is a bit more correct.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no such thing as &#8220;iTunes format&#8221;. In fact, the only thing that something resembling iTunes (QuickTime) helped to define is the container format. The audio and video codecs come from elsewhere. Moreover, I think (but I&#8217;m not sure) these files were generated without the help of any Apple software at all.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>That inaccuracy was on purpose. &#8220;iTunes format&#8221; = 2 words. &#8220;In a format compatible with the iPod&#8221; = 7 words, and out of balance with the other items in the list. Okay, maybe &#8220;iPod format&#8221; would have been better. I assumed the readers would be able to translate &#8220;iTunes format&#8221; into the appropriate long form. I was apparently once again badly mistaken. -Raymond</i>]</div>

<p>Perhaps, or it&#8217;d be nice if the pack is included in MSDN / Technet subscription&#8230; :P</p>

		<p>I think iTunes format is perfectly descriptive. You import it into iTunes, after all. Then you can use iTunes to copy it to your iPod to view it on the go. Or watch it on your laptop using iTunes. Or use iTunes to sync it with your iPhone or AppleTV. It all revolves around iTunes.</p>
<p>Since it is a technical audience, &quot;QuickTime&quot; format would work, or, &quot;MPEG 4&quot; (though, people also call DivX/XviD (MPEG-4 ASP/SP, in AVI container) &quot;MPEG 4&quot;).</p>
<p>But &quot;iTunes format&quot; (QuickTime/Part 14/3GP containered h.264 / AAC) conveys it so much more succintly.</p>

<p>That are worse things to be offended by (such as the state of the economy)! &nbsp;This seems to be an exaggerated overreaction from someone whose life is obviously limited to computers.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

<p>Which somehow does not work for me. Did I have to install this new feature only to be able to see the black rectangle instead of &quot;Install Silverlight&quot; prompt?</p>
<p>Sometimes I think Microsoft introduces new things only to maintain incompatibility with something (flv, in this case) that has already existed for a long time.</p>
<p>Sorry for off-topic. Couldn&#8217;t help.</p>

		<p>I have downloaded it. Thanks :)</p>
<p>I have had to uninstall Silverlight. </p>
<p>On my low-end system (2GB RAM, 1.5Ghz Celeron, so now *that* low-end), I just can&#8217;t have IE/Firefox having a higher priority. </p>
<p>My system just crawls. Surley is every application considered itself important enough to do this, we&#8217;d be in a very bad position. </p>
<p>I did google it and found something about Multimedia Class Scheduler. Yes if it&#8217;s a full screen DVD or full screen game, then assume I am doing one thing. Otherwise don&#8217;t :) </p>

		<p>&gt;Would you pay $100 for a 10-DVD set of stuff you could download for free?</p>
<p>Given that some of us live in countries where downloading 10 DVDs worth would cost &gt; $100 anyway (if you could even manage it because of bandwidth caps as low as 1GB/month), I&#8217;d have to say &#8220;Yes&#8221;. Even ignoring the cost, the 10 DVDs would take nearly 8 years to download on a 1GB capped link.</p>
