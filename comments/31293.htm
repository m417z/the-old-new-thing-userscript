		<p>This seems like a plus point for &quot;everything is a file&quot; or something like AppleScript.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious, will there ever be any kind of standardization (whether by Microsoft or a third party) in terms of the way programs should respond to ShellExecute?</p>

		<p>Out of interest, I checked the MSDN page for ShellExecute to see if it was &#8216;obvious&#8217;, or &#8216;obvious if you&#8217;re Raymond&#8217; :-), and it fell firmly into the first camp, specifically saying that numbers above 32 are essentially meaningless and it&#8217;s not a proper instance. &nbsp;Which is nice.</p>
<p>On that subject, can you prod the DirectX team to have a similar level of rigourousness in their docs?</p>
<p>For example, one of the cases I came across in the past week or so, SetStreamSource():</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directx9_c/IDirect3DDevice9__SetStreamSource.asp" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directx9_c/IDirect3DDevice9__SetStreamSource.asp</a></p>
<p>Given you can have multiple streams, and that streams can be deleted and therefore their interface pointers are no longer valid, how would you tell the Direct3D device that, e.g. stream 1 should be detached now? &nbsp;Using that documentation, I mean. &nbsp;And following your own rules about not using undocumented parameter values, etc.</p>
<p>(If you care, the correct answer is to pass in a NULL pointer as the stream &#8211; nowhere is this definitively documented; it&#8217;s only mentioned in passing by being in some sample code elsewhere in the docs, and no reference is made in the accompanying text to the NULL value of the stream interface pointer. &nbsp;And knowing how reliable sample code can be in terms of correctness, this is the kind of thing that can drive you nuts when dealing with DirectX).</p>
<p>And I know you have no power whatsoever to control the DX team&#8217;s behaviour &#8211; I&#8217;m just making a point that sometimes people assume things about APIs because so many times in the past it&#8217;s the only way they&#8217;ve been able to accomplish anything, if you see what I mean.<br /></p>

		<p>Damit: OLE was proposed, but it didn&#8217;t catch on. OLE lets you, among many many other features, query globally all the opened documents in all running applications, and it&#8217;s how Explorer can tell you what application keeps a document open so that it cannot be moved/deleted/etc. (of course, since it mostly only works with Office, you&#8217;d be inclined to think it&#8217;s evil Microsoft and their evil hidden APIs)</p>

<p>There is a good regression test for ShellExecute here. It should catch most behavior changes in programs from one version of windows to another.</p>

		<p>KJK::Hyperion: &nbsp;Ah yes, the Running Object Table (ROT)! &nbsp;It would be nice if the Windows Shell documentation would remind people that putting their open files in the ROT will get them the &quot;nicer&quot; file-in-use handling.</p>
<p>It would also be nice if the SDK team would stop dropping valuable tools from the SDK, such as IROTVIEW which let you see all the objects currently registered in the ROT.</p>

		<p>Norman: just ditch ShellExecute and use ShellExecuteEx, then. Has nicer error handling and generally nicer everything. As for INT_PTR, I&#8217;ll just say beware, beware sign extension</p>

		<p>and, Norman, the result cannot &quot;happen&quot; to be larger than that. Rigorousness OK, but it doesn&#8217;t take a lot of psychic skills to understand what goes on behind the curtain. The return value is obviously born as a positive int and casted into an HINSTANCE with IntToPtr(). And int is always 32 bit, even on Win64, so there&#8217;s no kind of trickery that could make it overflow</p>

		<p>&gt; You can check if it greater than 32,<br />
<br />&gt; indicating that the call was successful. If<br />
<br />&gt; the value is less than 32, then it is an<br />
<br />&gt; error code.</p>
<p>Your employer disagrees with you, very firmly.</p>
<p>The MSDN page says to cast it to an int and then compare the resulting value to 32. &nbsp;So for example if the value of the HINSTANCE happens to equal 2**33 + 1 then you cast it to an int, look at the result of 1, and conclude that the HINSTANCE value represented an error.</p>
<p>Last month I posted in Microsoft&#8217;s public newsgroup on kernel issues, asking if maybe programs should cast the HINSTANCE to INT_PTR instead of int. &nbsp;Your colleagues kindly, politely, and firmly provided proof that no, MSDN is right, it should be cast to int.</p>
<p>&gt; [some defective programs] looking for a<br />
<br />&gt; window with a matching GWLP_HINSTANCE (or<br />
<br />&gt; GWL_HINSTANCE if you&#8217;re still living in the<br />
<br />&gt; unenlightened non-64-bit-compatible world).</p>
<p>Yup, well I tried to be enlightened and 64-bit aware, but I was wrong. &nbsp;INT_PTR is correct SOMETIMES. &nbsp;(Of course the primary defect that you described in those programs is somewhat worse.)</p>

		<p>Oh no, you said: DDE.<br />

		<p>It&#8217;s okay to cast to an int because, as both the linked article and the documentation for ShellExecute note, the error code is an integer, cast to HINSTANCE for compatibility. The return value will never be 2**33+1 since that doesn&#8217;t fit in an int.</p>
<p>When I wrote, &quot;You can check if it is greater than 32,&quot; I mean &quot;You can check if it is greater than 32 after casting it to an int&quot; &#8211; but I assumed that was obvious since I&#8217;m assuming people reading the entry are already familiar with ShellExecute. Do I have to spell out very last excruciating detail? Do you spell out every last excruciating detail when you talk with your friends?</p>
<p>&quot;When you get to the gas station, turn left.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Even if the traffic light is red?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Sigh. Turn left *when safe and legal*.&quot;<br /></p>

		<p>To go even more off topic.</p>
<p>bviksoe: Some programs that try to be compatible on the oldest Windows version possible such as Win9x still use DDE. I tracked down a bug in firefox recently that was causing a hang during DDE communication.<br /></p>

<p>In this case there was a reason. &nbsp;In the base note you also wrote this:</p>

		<p>Cast it to int, cast it to INT_PTR, it won&#8217;t make any difference. (I&#8217;m not sure what you&#8217;re referring to in that last sentence. What error codes are born as long longs?)</p>

		<p>&gt; Cast it to int, cast it to INT_PTR, it won&#8217;t<br />
<br />&gt; make any difference.</p>
<p>That is obvious only to someone who either knows or has reverse engineered the code. &nbsp;MSDN isn&#8217;t quite sure about that, your colleagues seem sure about the opposite, and even you didn&#8217;t quite seem so sure a few replies back.</p>
<p>&gt; What error codes are born as long longs?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know, but the responses of both you (prior to this one) and your colleagues made it obvious that there are some.</p>
<p>In a 64-bit program, HINSTANCE is 64 bits. &nbsp;Now consider a case where ShellExecute has set that field to the value 2**33 + 1. &nbsp;If the program casts this to type INT_PTR then the result of the cast will be greater than 32 and the program will think that it represents success. &nbsp;If the program obeys MSDN and your colleagues, casts this to type int, and sees the result of 1, then the program will observe that it represents failure. &nbsp;Since your company is so firm about the incorrecness of casting this to INT_PTR, it must be because some failure returns will be misinterpreted as successes unless they get cast down to int.</p>
