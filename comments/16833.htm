		<p>A friend of mine once observed that babies are functions. It takes food as input and provides noise and smell as output.</p>

		<p>Two-year olds are cute, so are people like Andrew who find a parallel to computing :D</p>

		<p>&quot;Markov model&quot; might be a more correct term, because it specifically precludes any memory other than the current state id. &nbsp;Although this instance is even more like purely combinational logic (no retained state at all).</p>
<p>In any case, watching the intelligence of young children unfold to slowly incorporate more and more knowledge and understanding of the world is definitely a win.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Babies are not special. But the difference is this is all they do, humans have more complex behavior: they aren&#8217;t simple functions, babies are. A least until they have completed bootstrapping and turn into people.</p>

		<p>I have used this behavior in the past to &#8216;reset&#8217; a baby. &nbsp;They have a stack of ~2 usually and you can overflow the stack easily. &nbsp;The usual reaction is to go back to a discovery state. &nbsp;So you can hand them two non related objects then point out something in the room. &nbsp;They will usually reset. &nbsp;Do not use to often as they will adapt :) &nbsp;Works pretty good with a fussy baby.</p>
<p>This usually works up until about age 3 and a half when they start forming more complex systems themselves. &nbsp;At which point the stack is MUCH larger.</p>
<p>Learned this from BOFH :)</p>

		<p>Discovered that behavior in my dog today as well.</p>
<p>One of the tricks I taught him was where I&#8217;d put some food on his snout, just behind the nose, and he&#8217;s to hold his position, until I command him to get it (but he&#8217;s got to get it before it hits the ground).</p>
<p>So lately I mix it up by giving him an intevening command (shake paw) with the food on his nose, then let him get it. He&#8217;s been doing the motion for awhile now, just I&#8217;ve been giving him explicit commands.</p>
<p>Today, food on nose, but he failed to respond at all. Like he&#8217;s crashed &#8211; didn&#8217;t respond at all. So I take the food off his nose, and gave him the command to eat, and he repeated the motions, followed by a quizzical look as he didn&#8217;t see what happened to the food nor had anything enter his mouth &#8211; he didn&#8217;t notice I took the food away.</p>
<p>Repeated again, worked flawlessly. Apparently found a bug :)</p>
