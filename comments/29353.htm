		<p>May I be the first to ask, what on Earth is a pledge drive? I<br />
understand it&#8217;s some kind of fundraising. Is this common in the US?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

		<p>&quot;Instead, it operated as a hunt group:&quot;</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s still a hunt group. &nbsp;They just got a system that supports a different hunt group algorithm (that one is sometimes called &quot;distributed&quot;) instead of a simple linear search.</p>

		<p>Public radio is supported completely bu contributions from corporations as well as private citizens. &nbsp;Advertising it not allowed. &nbsp;When a public radio station gets short on funds, they have a Pledge Drive, where people call in and pledge to donate a certain amount of money. &nbsp;Hopefully, they also send that money in. &nbsp;Once the pledged funds reach the required amount to keep operations going, the pledge drive is stopped and the station returns to regular programming.</p>

		<p>I haven&#8217;t listened to radio at all since my car radio broke, let<br />
alone public radio, but if it&#8217;s anything like public tv has become in<br />
the last few years, saying &#8220;advertising is not allowed&#8221; isn&#8217;t exactly<br />
correct&#8211;sponsors essentially get a free, short ad at the end of shows,<br />
and they are actually doing short commercials as such for the sponsors<br />
these days (last time I watched PBS, I remember seeing what I vaguely<br />
remember were Toyota ads after a home improvement show.) &nbsp;They&#8217;re<br />
not your typical broadcast tv ads, but they ARE, in fact, ads.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Not exactly. &nbsp;After all, it is &quot;public&quot; radio. &nbsp;On the other hand, KNON in Dallas is a funky little station is supported only by listener contributions. &nbsp;So the only interruptions I&#8217;ve heard during &quot;Texas Blues Radio&quot; (6pm &#8211; 8pm M-F) is when they are having a pledge drive. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve never voluteered for them, but it sounds like each show must hold its own pledge drive to pay for themselves and some portion of the general operating expenses. &nbsp;In their case, it really is important that you call in during the shows that you want to support.</p>

		<p>&quot;Special effects in radio are a lot cheaper than they are on television.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always struck by the fact that one of the most popular shows on radio in the late 1930&#8217;s through the 1940&#8217;s was a ventriloquist &#8211; Edgar Bergen! I guess it proves how good his jokes and delivery were.</p>

		<p>I was more than happy to pledge money to our local public radio, KPFT, a Pacifica station (listener-supported only). &nbsp;Note that this is not the same as &quot;Houston Public Radio,&quot; which is run out of the University of Houston, and is sponsored by members AND companies.</p>
<p>Their recent pledge drive was to upgrade their antenna that was the replacement for the one that had been damaged in multiple bombing attacks in the &#8217;70s. &nbsp;The voice of independence is a harsh mistress sometimes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a small price to pay to not have to listen to any of the other stations that are, with the exception of music format, clones of the same ClearChannel crap.</p>

		<p>Just out of curiosity, has anyone ever pulled a Homer Simpson and called in a $250 million pledge just to get the pledge drive off the air?</p>

		<p>KUOW used not to play the sounds from the pledge room. When my wife, a professional fundraiser and veteran of WBUR (Boston) drives, showed up, she pointed out the difference to the station management: WBUR fundraising is *frenetic*. I like to think we&#8217;re hearing the results of her involvement!</p>
