		<p>Ah, those marvelous cleanup tools which remove all the registry&#8217;s junk. There is &#8220;junk DNA&#8221;, which is DNA which we don&#8217;t understand the purpose of, and &#8220;junk registry&#8221;, which are Registry entries people don&#8217;t understand the purpose of. The difference is that scientists aren&#8217;t too bold to say that junk DNA is useless; but, of course, cleanup tool authors know more about Windows than Microsoft themselves, and are sure that its only use is to bloat the OS and make you upgrade the RAM. Because, you know, Microsoft has signed a secret pact (which somehow everybody is aware of) with memory makers.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t let those tools be anywhere near my computers&#8230;</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, it&#8217;s not that simple.  There is, in fact, a lot of &#8220;junk&#8221; in the registry.  For example, installing the Windows version of a certain fruit company program installs thousands of files for dozens of different languages.  Instead of asking the user what language files to install, it just dumps everything onto the hard drive, AND, creates corresponding registry keys.   If you don&#8217;t need 35 different languages on your computer you now have 14,000+ registry keys that can be safety deleted with no harm to the operation of the program. That is not a typo.  ** Fourteen Thousand** unnecessary registry keys.</p>

		<p>And what is the advantage of removing those fourteen thousand registry entries?</p>
<p>What performance benefits did the removal gain you? How much disk space or memory did you save?</p>
<p>If the answer to those questions is you didn&#8217;t measure it, why are you so worried about a few extra entries in a database?</p>

		<p>Well IIRC, it did matter back in the days when the registry was loaded all at once and RAM was sparse (Win2k times? Please correct me if I&#8217;m wrong, my memories are foggy). Nowadays it&#8217;s really useless. However, a very well known tool is doing its job here quite well and I never, ever experienced any problems with it. The only thing I experience is users randomly backfiring on such tools when reading about _people_ messing with their PC or when having a random problem they can&#8217;t explain and immediately blame it on a past run of such tools. Mostly because they didn&#8217;t even bother what this tool removed in detail.<br />
Nevertheless, I&#8217;m barely using it nowadays where disk space is no longer an issue with SSDs, the only reason it still had in my eyes.</p>

		<p>Seems there is a limit on Registry size. Don&#8217;t know if this key is still relevent in Win10.<br />

<p>IMO, these 14000 entries would be important to you when your PC is near the limit the machine can handle, and if you happen to be someone who find your machine near the limit, you really would need some sort of &#8220;cleanup tool&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I am one of apparently several people who have seen the effects of printer drivers going rogue and bloating your local system user profile to ~2GB&#8230; I didn&#8217;t bother to count how many registry keys that was though.</p>

		<p>If the registry entries are for installed libraries, they aren&#8217;t junk entries. They are perfectly legal. The junk are the files themselves (which take much more disk space than the registry entries themselves).</p>
<p>True, there can be orphaned registry entries when uninstallers delete the libraries but not the entries. But better wasting a few KBs in some unused entries than risking breaking an installed application (as is the case in Raymond&#8217;s article).</p>
<p>The bloat of many printer and display card drivers deserve an article in itself. Their questionable quality, along with overclocking, has given Windows a really bad reputation in the (very vocal) gaming community.</p>

		<p>A lot of times our bugs turn out to be in deep helper functions that yeah that seemingly unrelated description was related.</p>
<p>Funny old story. There was a hotfix to SQL 2005 that fixed something about plan generation involving NOT IN where it would sometimes generate a worse plan than SQL 2000. We installed the hotfix and set the traceflag. It actually fixed the case we were persuing involving a similar kind of bad plan generation involving LEFT JOIN LEFT JOIN JOIN (not a typo that&#8217;s two left joins followed by an inner join) where the inner join used a parameter from the second left join in an OR condition.</p>

		<p>Funny customer request, but our experience yesterday was even funnier. We received a call from Mr. John Doe who was developing a video game. He wanted to know in the event that a player bound Num Lock, Caps Lock, or Scroll Lock keys to evens like &#8220;toggle the lights&#8221;, how he can be sure that the keyboard lights corresponding those keys reflect the in-game status of the event. For example, if Num Lock is assigned to &#8220;toggle the lights&#8221;, the Num Lock LED should go off if a script turns the lights off in the game.</p>
<p>My colleague took his name, company name, address, phone number, and the name of the video game he was developing. Then, told him he got the wrong number.</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command, why is that funny? You can programmatically toggle these and have the keyboard reflect the new state (move the cursor in and out of a VM player&#8217;s window with different num lock settings, for the obvious example). I think its actually a pretty clever idea!</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s a fabulous idea. But when one has a fabulous idea and wants to talk about it to his or her favorite developer tool&#8217;s customer support, he or she&#8217;d better make sure the dialed number is correct. It would be shame to give that idea along with personal info to the local evil plumber.</p>
<p>Of course, I am neither a plumber nor evil. But I don&#8217;t work for Enterbrain or Degica either. And the United States Copyright Laws do not protect ideas that are not fixed in a tangible medium of expression.</p>
