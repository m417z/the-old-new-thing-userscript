		<p>You are giving me bad flashbacks of helping set up the internationalization machines in the QA lab.. Such a necessary task, but could be very painful at times.</p>

<p>Your appreciation of what? Enquiring minds want to know.</p>

		<p>Maybe in a few more years, solid-state drives will save us all from the dropped laptop corrupted disk demons.</p>

		<p>Nathan_works: My experience with testing various-languages machines is:</p>
<p>English &#8211; no problems</p>
<p>European languages &#8211; You can manage. And you get to read out words in a funny accent. I like Italian best.</p>
<p>Russian &#8211; You find someone who speaks it (lots of those around here)</p>
<p>East-Asian languages &#8211; Uh-oh&#8230;</p>
<p>And more to the point, my tech support for people who want to type Chinese often fails at the &quot;you&#8217;ll need the Windows XP CD&quot; point. That&#8217;s why everything from the CD is installed in Vista.</p>

		<p>Raymond: &quot;What, you don&#8217;t like your relatives?&quot;</p>
<p>I adore mine, but not enough to navigate dialogs saying things like &quot;Select a language to match the language version of the non-Unicode programs you want to use&quot;.</p>
<p>I think I would have been much more likely to install an OS from scratch when the boot drive became corrupted than to try to recover it; I admire your (and his) persistence&#8230;</p>

		<p>I had the same experience a couple years ago helping my relatives with her Chinese version of XP &#8211; I managed to stumble my way through the Control Panel (I could just recognised where the Region and Language option is, everything else was a blur). Luckily, I had a copy of the CD nearby. In the end, I scored myself a fancy lunch!</p>

		<p>@Peter:</p>
<p>The problem is that there is often more stored on the boot volume than just the operating system. This is essentially always true if you buy a PC from Dell/HP/Gateway/etc and usually true in any other case.</p>
<p>Recovering a system and files from a failed disk is one of my least favorite thing to do, but is becoming more and more common as computers bought 3-5 years ago begin to age. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been encouraging (with varying success) my family to buy an external drive and do simple Robocopy backups.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s surprising how many people don&#8217;t even realize hard drives can utterly fail and they can lose everything.</p>

		<p>&quot;East-Asian languages &#8211; Uh-oh&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>You should be able to find a Chinese, or Korean, or Japanese co-worker to help you on this, just as you find someone who speaks Russian.</p>

		<p>@Nick:</p>
<p>True, but often the easiest is to reformat and reinstall. Given how cheap drives are, you can toss in a new laptop drive, reinstall, and get a case for the old one.</p>
<p>Especially when it isn&#8217;t the hard drive that&#8217;s failed, but the filesystem that&#8217;s gotten horrendously corrupted somehow. Fixing the problem might only be temporary until the drive corrupts itself again. Reinstalling gives it a fresh start.</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t eat a whole one.</p>
<p>You made it sound (to me) like you were returning a favour she had done you, that was all.</p>

		<p>@Nick: In my experience, no software supplied with most PC&#8217;s by Dell/HP/whoever is worth saving anyway. If you mean some sort of weird &quot;restore partition&quot; thing, those are clearly useless since they obviously won&#8217;t work if your hard drive dies &#8211; having it on another medium is essential.</p>
<p>Obviously I&#8217;d save their personal data before nuking the drive (Knoppix or similar is excellent for this), but my experience of trying to rescue corrupted operating systems is that it&#8217;s easier to get on with reinstalling.</p>
