		<blockquote><p>
  Battlefield Earth (the worst picture of the decade)
</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#39;ve always wondered why it gets rated this way, it&#39;s just a generic schlocky SF like dozens of others made in the same decade, was it the fact that it was made by the scientologists that got it such a bad rating? &nbsp;I could easily nominate two dozen SF films from the same decade that were far, far worse than this.</p>

		<p>Interesting info about the American Idol highlights montage. I have wondered about those, however on Australian Idol, I never noticed any difference between the live performances and the highlights. Who knows, maybe we have better technicians in Australia? :-p</p>
<p>Pre-emptive snarky comment: It doesn&#39;t take much to be more competent than Americans.</p>

		<p>@Falcon,</p>
<p>Australia&#39;s Ten netwrok can also achieve it with the closing credits for the F1 broadcast; not all of those incidents are from &#39;rehearsels&#39;. &nbsp;Perhaps it&#39;s a mix &#8211; getting 90% done ahead of time and add in just enough from the actual performance (particularly the memorable bits, since they will connect better). :-)</p>
<p>Your pre-emptive snarky comment is below the belt, in my opinion, though. :-)</p>

		<p>Maybe it is. Of course, as suggested by the &quot;pre-emptive snarky&quot; part, the joke is at the expense of such comments themselves.</p>
<p>While it would be nice to be able to blame all of the world&#39;s problems on one particular group, idiocy knows no boundaries.</p>
