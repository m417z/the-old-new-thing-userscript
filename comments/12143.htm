		<p>I quite enjoyed Raymond&#39;s speaker profile from that site, translated courtesy of Chrome: &quot;Raymond Chen is a Microsoft programmer, involved in the development of multiple versions of Windows program fifteen years. His blog &quot;The Old New Thing&quot; focused on the development of Windows and the Win32 programming, programming community is respected. The website also published the book named &#39;The Old New Thing&#39; (Chinese title: Windows Programming Revelation) (Addison Wesley 2007). While Raymond is also a columnist for the Microsoft TechNet article. Raymond Chen Ruimeng Chinese name, although not speak Mandarin, but can understand the basic Taiwanese, and now are trying to learn Cantonese.&quot;</p>

		<p>If you speak Mandarin but don&#39;t read Chinese, copy-paste into Word and then add ruby (&quot;Phonetic Guide&quot; &#8212; appears next to &quot;Clear Formatting&quot; in Word 2010). &nbsp;It&#39;s actually &nbsp;pretty smart since it can distinguish between different pronunciations of the same character.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this won&#39;t help Raymond since he doesn&#39;t speak Mandarin.</p>
<p>The speaker bio uses somewhat more formal language than the Google translation conveys. &nbsp;I imagine this is a cultural practice?</p>

		<p>For what it&#39;s worth from some anonymous guy on the internet, some of us actually appreciate what you write, and in the event that we come across as &quot;snarky&quot; it&#39;s usually our own failure to communicate clearly, rather than a desire to offend. On the other hand, welcome to the internet &#8211; trolls moved here after being kicked out from under their bridges and we still haven&#39;t managed to do anything about that.</p>
<p>We would rather you delete the snarky comments instead of deleting the interesting posts.</p>
<p>Sure, people will grizzle that you&#39;re violating their constitutional rights, but you work for Microsoft &#8211; if you cured every form of cancer, they would still complain that you didn&#39;t cure every other disease as well.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  content that I&#39;ve deleted from the queue is to use them in talks
</p></blockquote>
<p>Or&#8230; or you could use them in a future book! Ok that&#39;s more work, not less :)</p>
<p>Maybe then post them as new bonus chapters for your book! Not in the &quot;Old new thing&quot;, no comments, no problems!</p>
<p>I still haven&#39;t managed to finish your book by the way. English not being my native language, I&#39;ve found that I must not be tired when I read it if I want to enjoy it. And I am always tired when I am home now&#8230; I have to wait for the storm to pass.</p>

<p>The issue with that is that Raymond&#39;s full-time job would turn into removing all the bad comments in an attempt to leave a post up.</p>

		<p>Perhaps you could just leave the snarky comments alone? &nbsp;That way we&#39;d at least get to read your posts (which are quite interesting) even if the comments would be of no value.</p>

		<p>[The problem is that the snarky comment leads to a flame fest and soon the comments end up overrun with arguments about something completely tangential to the article itself. -Raymond]</p>
<p>While I respect your choice as the author, this makes me wonder: Why do you feel that your articles take a back seat to the comments? &nbsp;Surely people come here primarily to read what <em>you</em> write and not to see the deranged ramblings of a bunch of anonymous half-wits (including yours truly, of course).</p>

		<p>&quot;I&#39;ve deleted from the queue (because the topic draws out flame comments)&quot;</p>
<p>That made me very sad. Now that i think about it, i&#39;ve not seen a flame war in this blog in a long while (perhaps the flamee have all grown up?)</p>
<p>Then again i don&#39;t often read the comments.</p>
<p>Raymond, i&#39;m interested in this queue, is there a way to see what is queued up ?</p>
<p>PS / BTW: Did you miss my question about your C++ scratch program a few posts ago ? Others have also asked questions about it. Will these questions ever get answered ?</p>

		<p>&quot;I think the fact that you have to be snarky in person removes the veil of anonymity and makes you more accountable for what you say&quot;</p>
<p>Just as much as it makes fanboys and developers-doing-evil-changes accountable for what they say or do in-person than doing it from their website&#39;s garage. :P</p>

		<p>&quot;will already be&quot; confused me. What you&#39;re trying to say is that your posting schedule is equivalent to 11:00 PM China time, so this is the last post before the event.</p>

		<p>@Sam:</p>
<p>So, first you express disappointment about Raymond deleting posts due to flame/off-topic comments, then you REPEAT an off-topic question? (I realise the two are not quite in the same category, but still&#8230;)</p>
<p>Anyone else dazzled by the irony here?</p>

		<p>@Falcon:</p>
<p>Read the blog post again, raymond doesn&#39;t say anything about off-topic comments.</p>
<p>He&#39;s only concerned about flame comments and comments that cause a flame war.</p>

<p>Not only that, but the U.S. government would start an antitrust investigation into Microsoft&#39;s monopolistic attempt to put doctors out of work.</p>
<p>Europe would sue them for bundling their lung cancer cure and colon cancer cure into the same product.</p>
<p>Random trolls would complain to Raymond that Microsoft should provide the cure for free.</p>

		<p>Oh, I read it, I assure you. Flame comments can certainly be off-topic. Recent example &#8211; post mentioned Windows Error Reporting and commenters complained about digital certificates, even after being explicitly warned about it. In fact, the warning may have fuelled the fire!</p>
<p>And note this response from Raymond:</p>
<p>&quot;[It&#39;s not the complaining that I object to. it&#39;s the off-topic complaining. -Raymond]&quot; (&quot;off-topic&quot; was underlined)</p>
<p>In any case, it seems to me that including an off-topic question doesn&#39;t really strengthen your argument about not removing posts from the queue. Just an observation&#8230;</p>

<p>Regading the talk description, I think &quot;经常应用程序也没有，有的只是stack traces和heap dumps&quot; should be &quot;需要调试的应用程序经常什么也没有，有的只是stack traces和heap dumps&quot; instead. I think they may break phrase/sentence in different place so the omission of key words is kind of awkward there. However, the sentence can be understood after some thought.</p>

<p>Different people are mad at MS for different reasons, and to lump them all up together as irrational is dishonest. I know MS gets some undeserved flack but there are TONS of things where it does deserve it. I&#39;m sure that more than a few MS employees secretly despise the product teams that routinely ship buggy bloated crap. The real annoying people are those who in face of criticism directed at MS turn around and say &#8211; but MS ships some nice stuff too..these people are just whiners and would whine about anything MS does.</p>
