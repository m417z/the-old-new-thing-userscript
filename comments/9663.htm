		<p>I would imagine it&#39;s common to tell new employees to report to building 7?</p>

		<p>I always enjoyed the code names for the new group of buildings. &nbsp;In the 90&#39;s it was golf courses. &nbsp;I recall &quot;(St.?) Andrews&quot;, &quot;Pebble Beach&quot;, and there were others.</p>
<p>I worked in 12 different buildings between 1994 and 2009. &nbsp;Some stays less than a month, with the longest around 18 months in building 17. &nbsp;I usually had one or more boxes that didn&#39;t get unpacked before the next move would occur.</p>

		<p>A BASIC programmer would have been more cautious in the numbering, starting with buildings 10, 20, 30 and 40! New buildings close to older ones could have used the units&#8230; but eventually it would have fallen apart and either a GOTO-pneumatic-tube should have been built or a big RENUM would have to be run!</p>

		<p>And let&#39;s not forget the first April edition of the Micronews after building 26 was built, in which it was announced that the numbers were going to be changed to the corresponding letters of the alphabet and that we were all going to be reassigned to buildings corresponding to the first letter of our last names. &#39;Course, the lack of a building 7 meant&#8230;</p>

		<p>My dream comes true and Raymond links to my site, but by the time the blog post goes live, my site is broken. :( Anyway, it&#39;s fixed now so the wasteaguid joke will make sense again.</p>

		<p>That demolition party sounds like great fun &#8212; especially if it&#39;s your old office. I fondly remember adding all kinds of decorations to the insides of walls when I was working construction. This would be a whole new level.</p>

		<p>If you want to ramp up the confusion, there&#39;s more than one business park also. When I was at Microsoft Games, I worked in Millennium-E. There&#39;s also RedWest, which its own numbering scheme.</p>

		<p>Pretty interesting. &nbsp;I can understand frustration at trying to navigate an &quot;unordered&quot; campus with buildings named after items that have an innate ordering.</p>
<p>For the curious, there&#39;s a bit more background in the first couple chapters of Mystic Microsoft (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.kraigbrockschmidt.com/mm/" rel="nofollow">http://www.kraigbrockschmidt.com/mm</a>) where he also talks some about building construction, numbering, and his bouncing around buildings.</p>

		<p>Just a thought, but maybe it would be a good idea to have some sort of diagrammatic representation of all the buildings in a grid with, &#8230; umm, let me think, &#8230; yes, letters down one side and numbers across the top? Then you could include some ordered list of the buildings (in an order useful to people looking for building 92 or RedWest-12, for example) which also gave the grid co-ordinates so you could navigate your way to the building.</p>
<p>Yes, I think that may work. I just need to contact our patent attorney.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Sorry, that took a while, it seems my brilliant invention has quite a bit of prior art. It appears that PEOPLE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR QUITE SOME TIME!!!</p>
<p>[end humour, such as it was].</p>

		<p>I thought Studios E-H got renamed back to numbers sometime in 2009. The reason I ask is because I attended a meeting at Studio E in 2008, but in 2009 it was Studio 1xx. But knowing Studios A-D were different buildings makes me understand why the Xbox team had such nice buildings. After all, Studio E was rather drab inside, other than being a maze or a Halo level or something.</p>
<p>(FYI &#8211; Entertainment and Devices used to be in those buildings. I think the Windows Phone team is there now. Microsoft Studios has moved out though&#8230; as has Windows Embedded)</p>

		<p>Why would Carrie assume that the building numbers would be in some kind of order? &nbsp;Did she think they were all built and numbered at once? &nbsp;That&#39;s a silly assumption for a large company that has been around a while&#8230;</p>

		<p>Yikes, a post from my ingnorant anti-Microsoft days! &nbsp;I&#39;ve wisened up folks. &nbsp;I&#39;d rather set a TCM on Google and all the data they&#39;ve mined from their unsuspecting users. &nbsp;Anyway, I now understand the numbering system is a result of Microsoft&#39;s growth.

		<p>I&#39;m not sure the STU-E/F/G/H rename was random. Like Studios A-D, they&#39;re named counter-clockwise anchored at the northeastern building.</p>
<p>Long-running meeting request series persisted the old building names, contributing to the confusion. Fun!</p>
