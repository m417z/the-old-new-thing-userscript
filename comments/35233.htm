		<p>I always thought it would be nice if the auto-complete filled on when the text box loses focus.  So when I type &quot;c:pro&quot; and hit Tab, it will become the highlighted entry, which is &quot;C:Program Files&quot;.</p>
<p>I guess if I wanted to override this and really keep my &quot;c:pro&quot; without changes, I would have to hit Esc first.</p>

		<p>Is autocorrection the same thing as autocomplete, i.e. when you start to type the current date in MS Word, it suggests whole string?</p>
<p>This kind of feature is useful, but has a potential to be terribly annoying if not done properly. My favourite example is Visual Studio 2003, where virtually any keypress is interpreted as a confirmation of the suggestion. But maybe I wanted stringb not StringBuilder, thank you very much.</p>
<p>This is not meant as a troll, so I want to mention Visual Web Developer 2005 (currently public beta) as a positive counter-example. (I write ASP stuff mostly.) I don&#8217;t know what it does differently; its suggestion go even farther than those of VS2003, but somehow it manages to be not so annoying, but indeed very helpful. It&#8217;s even better than Eclipse (IBM&#8217;s Java IDE), in my opinion.</p>
<p>My actual point is that programmers should exercise great care to make autocomplete suggestions easily overridable. Your user will thank you!</p>

		<p>I think Raymond is talking about, for example, when you enter C:Program Files and the system guesses you mean &quot;C:Program Files&quot; and not &quot;C:Program&quot; &quot;Files&quot;.</p>
