		<p>&gt; So there are two mistakes here. </p>
<p>&gt; First, the hook is installed from a thread pool task</p>
<p>&gt; The second mistake is that the hook is installed from a thread pool task.</p>
<p>That made me smile. &nbsp;&quot;What I tell you two times is true.&quot;</p>

		<p>I always enjoy these types of posts because its very relevant to our internal testing tool. I hope for the day we finally *completely* switch to a Windowing Library that supports UI Automation Natively/Completely. We have tons of legacy controls in our product that require these types of hacks to be testable. Thankfully this is an internal tool that is expected to break and should never be shipped outside the confines of our walled garden.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a Red Dwarf quote:</p>
<p>The Cat: &quot;Why don&#39;t we drop the defensive shields?&quot;</p>
<p>Kryten: &quot;A superlative suggestion, sir. With just two minor flaws. One, we don&#39;t have any defensive shields. And two, we don&#39;t have any defensive shields. Now I realise that technically speaking that&#39;s only one flaw but I thought that it was such a big one that it was worth mentioning twice.&quot;</p>

		<p>Allow me to add another quote, this being from The Producers (2005, Nathan Lane &amp; Matthew Broderick):</p>
<p>Max Bialystock: &quot;The two cardinal rules of producing are one: Never put your own money in the show&quot;</p>
<p>Leo Bloom: &quot;And two?&quot;</p>
<p>Max Bialystock: &quot;NEVER PUT YOUR OWN MONEY IN THE SHOW!&quot;</p>
