		<p>Of course, GetClipboardSequenceNumber() doesn&#39;t work if the clipboard provider is using delayed rendering &#8212; the clipboard has no way of knowing if and when the underlying data the provider uses to render the actual clipboard data changes</p>
<p>I suppose it could ask the provider to render the data on each call and do a memory comparison, but that would be rather ludicrous, since it completely defeats the purpose of delayed rendering (performance), and it turns a function that looks like it should just be a simple get of an integer stored in memory somewhere into a potentially complex and expensive operation.</p>

		<p>Too bad AddClipboardFormatListener only works on Windows Vista &amp; up&#8230; &nbsp;Not an option for the rest of us who still have to support XP&#8230; &nbsp;(Maybe in a few years time we can refactor to use this new API after the rest of the world moves on?)</p>

		<p>I wouldn&#39;t use GetClipboardSequenceNumber if I were you, it has a design flaw in that it will break if the user copies exactly 4,294,967,296 times before pasting!</p>

		<p>Raymond, it would have been polite to mention in the article that AddClipboardFormatListener isn&#39;t available in Windows XP, and hence cannot be used in most software.</p>

		<p>@TC:</p>
<p>There isn&#39;t really a race condition there. The user issued a paste command, and we&#39;re pasting on data based on the contents of the clipboard at the time the paste command was issued.</p>

		<p>Is there a timing issue there? Couldn&#39;t you get interrupted just before:</p>
<p>&nbsp; if (m_CachedClipboardData) Paste(m_CachedClipboardData);</p>
<p>by someone who changes the clipboard data &#8211; *after* you&#39;ve decided that it *hasn&#39;t* changed?</p>

		<p>@TC: Or, put another way, what happens? The user gets the old data. Which if it&#39;s changing so quickly that the interruption matters, the user probably won&#39;t notice.</p>
<p>Realistically, it will never happen since users are slow &#8211; they copy, switch, they paste. The only way otherwise is if some stupid thing (*cough* popular_cpu_hogging_browser_plugin *cough*) is spamming the clipboard with copy operations.</p>

		<p>@JamesJohnston: Where possible avoiding trouble by using new API? One less of collison between your programm and bad programm? (those bugs caused by externals can be quite problematic, so why not to avoid them on new systems and let those on old deal with that, if they don&#39;t want/can&#39;t upgrade)</p>

		<p>&quot;The old clipboard viewer is like DDE: please feel free to stop using it.&quot;</p>
<p>Seems that some people took that *too* seriously. </p>
<p>-Hey, we have this old app using the pre-Vista clipboard API</p>
<p>-We shouldn&#39;t use that anymore</p>
<p>clipbrd.exe is no longer available in Windows Vista</p>

		<p>@Klimax: what&#39;s the point? &nbsp;If I have to do it the old way on Win XP, then why would I bother to then code a different way on Vista if the code for XP still works on newer Windows?</p>
<p>@TC: &nbsp;you could always just check the sequence number *again* after pasting to see if it changed, if it makes you feel better. &nbsp;If it changed, then go back and read the clipboard again. &nbsp;But what if it changed *again* after you checked the sequence number a second time? &nbsp;Worf probably has the right idea; it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

		<p>For the sake of completeness, the Ole clipboard API&#39;s also have an alternative to GetClipboardSequenceNumber, for the limited case where you want to know if your own application is still the clipboard source. &nbsp;After your app calls OleSetClipboard to place a data object, OleIsCurrentClipboard on that same pointer will tell you if your object is still there.</p>

		<p>Unfortunatly, at least Windows 7 is not sending the WM_CLIPBOARDUPDATE message correctly.</p>
<p>I have updated my small application to use both the old or the new method to monitor the clipboard (depending on a switch), only to find out, that WM_CLIPBOARDUPDATE is not reliable.</p>
<p>My application has a debug window that displays the current Clipboard owner, the current Clipboard sequence number and all available Clipboard formats after each WM_CLIPBOARDUPDATE or WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD. When I start three instances of this program, and change the clipbaord by doing Ctrl+C in various application (especially in the Explorer), with the new method, all three programs see different states of the clipboard. Most notably, the list of available formats is different for all three instances, for example: 0, 2 and 7 formats. Even the sequence number can be different.</p>
<p>Conclusion: It need to be fixed.</p>

		<p>Further experimenting shows that one program using the new method is breaking all other programs in the same session that are also monitoring the clipbard, even if this other programs are using the old method. As soon as I terminate the new-method program, the others (still running) return to correct operation (once again, they are seeing the same state of the clipboard in terms of available formats and the sequence number).</p>
<p>Site note: The HWNDs returned by GetClipboardOwner are different in each process that processes WM_CLIPBOARDUPDATE or WM_DRAWCLIPBOARD. Strange.</p>
