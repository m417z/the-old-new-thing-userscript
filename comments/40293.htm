		<p>Considering Todd Bertuzzi breaking Steve Moore neck in a hockey fight, I wonder if Indianapolis is reconsidering guaranteeing a fight.  (I wonder if the player will be chewed out if they don&#8217;t start a fight&#8230;.)</p>

		<p>This is the same franchise that tried to get Manute Bol to skate a shift.  Sounds like the Ice are a Barnum &amp; Bailey production.</p>
<p>And as for guaranteed fight night, that&#8217;s pathetic.  They wouldn&#8217;t have much to worry about &#8211; there will be a fight &#8211; but still, that&#8217;s not a good message.</p>
<p>Todd Bertuzzi swung from behind.  He&#8217;s obviously sorry, but it&#8217;s not acceptable.  He should be out 10 more games than Moore is, up to a year.  The reason Moore got so hurt was because he was out cold on his way down to the ice.  Unfortunate.</p>
<p>BTW, the way to fix fighting isn&#8217;t with rules and such for fighting.  Just require full facemasks.  Watch the fighting drop drastically, along with facial injuries, broken jaws, sliced corneas, broken noses, lost teeth, etc. etc.</p>

		<p>No, the way to fix fighting is the way they do it in every other sport: you make it clear that fighting is unacceptable, unsporting, and punish the offenders accordingly. Hand out suspensions for every fighting incident and you&#8217;ll see it all but stop overnight.</p>
<p>Facemasks would probably just make fighting even more dangerous. If you can&#8217;t punch someone in the face, you slam them to the ice from behind and break their neck&#8230;</p>

		<p>It still baffles me that in hockey, fighting is codified in the rule book with a formal penalty schedule for instigator and retaliator.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s the NHL and North American minor league hockey, not ice hockey in general. International hockey is pretty clean, for example.</p>
<p>Actually, the NHL is pretty sensitive about this stuff too. I was the dev lead for NHL Rivals 2004, and I know that there were a whole bunch of guidelines we had to follow to be an approved NHL product, including guidelines for the portrayal and frequency of what they term &#8216;physicality&#8217;. (This is not unusual in sports video games, if you&#8217;re an official licenced product of a particular league, they always want approval over the way the league and the sport is portrayed.)</p>

		<p>Mat, I don&#8217;t know much about ice hockey but am familiar with football (probably soccer to you). If a player leaves his foot (stick, whatever) in a tackle longer than is necessary how do you prove the intent? It may be that he was off balance, did not have quick enough reflexes, whatever, or, yes, it may be that he intended to hurt the opponent. That&#8217;s why it would be impossible to impose bans of extreme lengths as a general rule, IMO &#8211; you just can&#8217;t read the mind of the person who did it.</p>

		<p>I think if you saw the video here, it would be pretty clear what Bertuzzi did. He skates up behind the guy, smashes him to the ice, lands on top of him, and then continues to punch him in the head. His victim ended up bleeding on the ice with a broken neck. That&#8217;s not an accident. That&#8217;s intentional brutality.</p>
<p>When we&#8217;re talking about fighting in hockey, we&#8217;re not talking about trips and shoves in the course of competing for the puck. We&#8217;re talking about someone swinging an actual punch at someone else. There isn&#8217;t really much room for doubt as to intent.</p>

		<p>I remember seeing an X-Play review of NHL Hitz where they where complaining that the game has lost some of the &quot;edge&quot; it once had.  It makes me wonder if the NHL licensing arm required them to tone down the game.</p>

		<p>There are similar types of incidents in football. Some of them end up in serious injuries and some of them not. <a target="_new" href="http://schoolsite.edex.net.uk/28/pages/staff/docsmith/gazza.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://schoolsite.edex.net.uk/28/pages/staff/docsmith/gazza.jpg</a> is probably one of the funniest, though maybe not to the recipient. It does give an entire new meaning to ball control. OTOH an ex player recently brought and won a legal case for damages against Wolverhampton Wanderers and one of their former players because of a tackle which was claimed to be a deliberate attempt to injure the opponent. The court, I think, refused to decide that the intent was there, but awarded damages anyway.</p>

		<p>If you punish for the result (other player injured) regardless of intent then players will try to avoid injuring others. If you get hung up on intent people will spend their brainpower devising ways to hurt others without giving the appearance of intent. </p>
<p>Just make it clear that the expected result is x number of healthy people get on the pitch and x number of equally healthy people get off it again. Let the players sort out the details themselves. </p>
