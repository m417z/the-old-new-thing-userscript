		<p>So? What happened then? Did the shirt mysteriously disappear in the dead of night? Was there a new anti-prize?</p>

		<p>We had a similar &quot;prize&quot; on the MSN Explorer team.  The dev manager bought a singin&#8217;-dancin&#8217; James Brown as a reward.  It was cool but incredibly annoying to have people stop in, press the button, and have to listen to &quot;I feel good.&quot;  After about the 20th listen the trophy instantly metamorphisized into something you got when you broke the build, etc; just like the Hawaiian shirt.</p>
<p>The team was re-org&#8217;d and James Brown came with us to the shell team where it continued its duties for awhile.  Eventually I ended up with it when the guy across the hall from me moved offices and left it in my office rather than pack it, the sneaky jerk.  So I found a nice home for it off campus where it can do no more harm.</p>

		<p>I worked at a startup where the anti-prize for breaking the build was a banana yellow hotjobs.com hat. The implied (joke) threat was that you&#8217;ll need to find a new job if you keep breaking the build. Plus the hat was butt ugly. :)</p>

		<p>I worked at a company where there were two prizes for breaking the build: First a box that said &quot;I broke the build&quot; hanging above your cubicle, Then second prize was a topless half of a plastic manaquien with a light in it.</p>

		<p>We had the pimp hat until one of the programmers liked it and would break the build to keep it.</p>
<p>:O</p>

		<p>The manager in question did lead the IE effort for the three versions, but the Hawaiian shirt incident took place on the next team he ran- the Microsoft Virtual Machine for Java.  He was on vacation when we spontaneously changed the meaning of the &quot;shirt award.&quot;</p>
<p>People who had previously won the shirt had already asked sarcastic questions like &quot;Does this mean I have to wear it?&quot;  There was also some concern about whether the shirt had been washed anytime recently.</p>
<p>When our group manager came back from vacation, he was more than a bit surprised at the new reward system we had instituted for the devs.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t recall who&#8217;s idea it was, but I&#8217;m pretty sure the turning point was someone&#8217;s build break.  It just seemed natural to stick the offender with the tacky shirt of shame.</p>

		<p>We&#8217;ve got a CD (probably an AOL CD) with &quot;You Screwed Me!&quot; written on it.  The lucky winner of a broken build, or a bug, gets to display the CD prominently, and can only get rid of it when someone else screws up.</p>
<p>I like the idea of the Hawaiian shirt though &#8211; much more noticible.</p>

		<p>At my last startup, we had a large Godzilla model tat we called it Brozilla (see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.brozilla.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.brozilla.com</a>). You got Brozilla when you screwed up the build. You passed it along when someone else screwed up.</p>

		<p>At one videogames company I worked at, we had a laminated dollar bill which would be placed on the desk of the last build-breaker&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;The buck stopped here.&quot;</p>
<p>Such a publicly visible indicator has several functions. One is to signal to the entire team who&#8217;s responsible for either fixing or chasing a fix. Another is to ensure that the person responsible is constantly aware that their major priority should be to get it fixed &#8211; no web-surfing for you, matey.</p>
