		<p>I&#8217;m with the customer here in that assuming a float from 0-1 seems more natural to me than 0-100. I usually keep all my ratios in 0-1 and only format to 0-100 directly before showing something to the user. I&#8217;m surprised that the API designers went for percentage instead.</p>

		<p>You have it backwards. The API gives you a number in the range 0..1, per the formula (N₁−N₀)/(D₁−D₀). It is the customer who is expecting to get a value in the range 0..100. They thought that PerfMon was showing the raw output of the API. In reality, it converts the fraction to a percentage before displaying it to the user.</p>

		<p>It reminds me of that poor Computer Science student that couldn&#8217;t tell multiplication from power. I was her data structures home teacher, and she wasn&#8217;t able to understand tree and graph transversing algorithms. &#8220;Do not teach me how it works,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Just give it to me so I can memorize it and spit it out in the exam&#8221; (that was 20 years ago, and programming examinations where made on paper). Sad.</p>

		<p>Although not useful for CPU idle time, it might make more sense to measure, say, the total per-process CPU time for a process.</p>

		<p>I remember similar question got asked in MSDN forum, except that they were asking for method to read network utilization through SNMP, and except that Cisco documentation site already have the necessary formulas spelt out, and yet they had to ask followup question on how to get the value of &#8230; _-_</p>

		<p>I had a similar experience with my dad the last time I visited him. I was going over an Excel spreadsheet with him, and when Excel calculated some formula for him, he said that I must have done it wrong because it was 100x too much. A few iterations, and they all were 100x too much. I wasn&#8217;t worried that I had done anything wrong, so when I had him actually look at the data, he remembered that the original data was in cents, and not dollars.</p>
