		<p>Sohail, I believe Raymond took German lessons some years ago, if you browse through the post archives he mentions it at some point.</p>
<p>Although they&#8217;re always an interesting read, the film suggestions are a lot more valuable than I initially thought they would &#8212; &nbsp;I notice a lot of redundant films between the Seattle FF and the one from my own city taking place later this summer. Thanks for sharing your reviews Raymond!</p>

		<p>Austrian is quite different from German, though Austrians and Bavarians can generally understand each other (probably as much as they pretend to dislike each other.)</p>
<p>When Falco said &quot;Dra di net um,&quot; it would have been &quot;Dreh dich nicht um&quot; in German. Literally translated, it means &quot;Don&#8217;t turn around,&quot; but the meaning is more like &quot;Don&#8217;t look now.&quot;</p>

		<p>Your ability to follow the movie was impeded because the accent belonged to a country other than Germany, and therefore &#8220;This movie failed even on the linguistic front&#8221;.</p>
<p>Remember that.</p>
<p>When some other computer programmer&#8217;s ability to follow a movie is impeded because the accent belongs to a country other than the U.K., it will prove that the movie fails even on the linguistic front. &nbsp;This will apply to 99% of the movies made in the U.S., will it not?</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a big difference between</p>
<p>. watching being a failure because of mistake by watcher</p>
<p>, the movie being a failure on the linguistic front</p>
<p>-&gt; That was my point.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>It was a failure on the linguistic front because <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/05/25/2854508.aspx" rel="nofollow">I chose the movie specifically to improve my (standard) German</a>. It failed at that goal. Of course, that was my goal and not the movie&#8217;s goal, but it was still a failure. -Raymond</i>]</div>
