		<p>Not to mention this requires the program to be re-built with the new compiler. &nbsp;This may never happen due to a number of factors, including &quot;our compiler works fine, we don&#39;t need to upgrade&quot; and &quot;we lost the source code years ago, no more changes to the app sorry&quot; and &quot;oh that company went under years ago, no new releases&quot;.</p>

		<p>I think the big mistake is the assumption that this is some big hack with exception handling. It sounds to me like it&#39;s just a single statement &#8212; &quot;if (!FlagSet(dlg)) SetFlag(dlg);&quot; &#8212; with the exception handling all happening in the kernel because the page is copy-on-write.</p>
<p>It could hardly be simpler, and having a single statement compiled into the OS that fixes the problem for everyone is much better than having some complicated post-build steps that everybody has to deal with individually.</p>

		<p>@Gabe &#8211; agreed, plus, looking back at Raymond&#39;s original article, I can&#39;t even get VS2010 to set those flags on my dialog resource anyway. &nbsp;And it&#39;s very useful, for example, to keep a caption in my dialog resource (even though it&#39;s meaningless at runtime) because it helps to clarify what page of the property sheet I&#39;m dealing with.</p>
<p>If it were important, VS2010 would make it straight-forward to specify a dialog as a property page, and then enforce the correct flags going forward (doesn&#39;t change what the OS needs to deal with). &nbsp;But even as of the current version of VS2010, it still doesn&#39;t enforce the correct rules (or even give you a good way to know what they are). &nbsp;Hence: it can&#39;t be very important.</p>

		<p>I have to admit if I were on the Windows team circa 1994 my response would have to been to grab the resource compiler&#39;s source and add support for the flag, along with whatever dialog box creation tool I was using.</p>

		<p>Joshua: Presumably, the resource compiler comes from the Developer Tools division, which is organizationally very far from Windows division, and also have their own release schedule. Yes, it&#39;s possible for one team to push for features in another team&#39;s product, but it&#39;s not trivial. And it&#39;s certainly not trivial to make them release a tool out-of-band!</p>
<p>And yes, the developer experience is often neglected with framework builders. In a former product, we had a small built-in web server, and the devs wanted some weird format for embedded images and scripts, degrading the web dev experience to running scripts to convert normal paths to that weird format. I managed to stop that.</p>

		<p>Seriously. &nbsp;Most of the &quot;ideas&quot; people post on how things should be done seem to always fail to consider that Microsoft&#39;s software is literally run by hundreds of millions of people worldwide all with different needs. &nbsp;They also fail to consider the many different languages that Windows must be translated to.</p>
<p>Indeed, it seems some (if not many) suggestions circle around just making things easier for the person who made the suggestion &#8211; screw Microsoft, other vendors, and all to often, screw the customer, too.</p>

<p>At least, they suffer the consequences of their way of thinking. Seems fair to me :)</p>

		<p>Not sure what&#39;s going on, but the blog appears to have eaten the comment I just wrote. &nbsp;Will try again in a minute if this one works&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Joshua &#8211; I take it you weren&#39;t a Windows developer in &#39;94. &nbsp;If you were, you should remember that things were very different then compared to now. &nbsp;MS&#39;s development tools were just one option, and not even the most popular one. &nbsp;Borland and Watcom&#39;s C++ compilers were both, IIRC, more popular than MS&#39;s. &nbsp;And each of them had their own resource generation workflow &#8212; I used to use Borland&#39;s Resource Workshop, which generated .res files directly rather than producing a .rc file and getting the resource compiler to compile it, so that would have needed updating too. &nbsp;I guess Watcom had something similar, too. &nbsp;So MS can&#39;t just unilaterally upgrade the format and expect other people to support the new format immediately, because they need to give the other compiler vendors time to update too. &nbsp;Producing 32-bit executables was enough of a big deal, and that had been available for over a year in the form of NT 3.1. &nbsp;They can&#39;t ask developers to switch development environments, because it was by no means clear that 32-bit Windows was going to be a big success (OS/2 could easily have become more popular), and some percentage of them just wouldn&#39;t have thought it was worth it.</p>

		<p>What I still don&#39;t understand, is why fixing these style bits must be done on the dialog template itself. Could it not be a feature of user32 to create the window with contextually-filtered styles (adding and removing bits as necessary).</p>
<div class="post">[<i>That would mean that a low-level component (user32) has special knowledge about a high-level component (property sheets). &quot;Why does the HeapAlloc function require me to pass the HEAP_ZERO_MEMORY flag? Could it not be a feature of the heap manager to infer contextually whether the memory needs to be zero-initialized?&quot; -Raymond</i>]</div>
