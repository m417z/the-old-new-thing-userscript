		<p>Why do you even care about that garbage? &nbsp;I&#8217;m not old enough to remember how things were 20 years ago, but politicians today are a disgrace to the human race, even more so than lawyers. &nbsp;Every once in a while a couple of them manage to get something right; this is the precious rare exception. &nbsp;The other 99.9% of the time you get genius ideas like &quot;Freedom Fries&quot; (I think I just rolled my eyes out of the back of my head). &nbsp;These people should be absolutely ashamed of their very existence.</p>
<p>This is why I like Japan. &nbsp;Sure, they have their own scandals over there, but at least they understand the concepts of honor and shame (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUST34716820070528" rel="nofollow">http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUST34716820070528</a>).</p>

		<p>As weird as it is, I have to respect Pope&#8217;s resourcefulness. &nbsp;If I were in a campaign, I would hire him. &nbsp;It seems like finding dirt is his specialty. &nbsp;Or I&#8217;m sure he could make some money setting up a blog to post his findings.</p>

		<p>I believe that there is an old Soviet saying about politicians. &nbsp;Something like, &quot;Politicians around the world are all the same. &nbsp;Mostly idiots.&quot;</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  &gt; at least they understand the concepts of honor and shame
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is something that US politics could certainly stand more of. &nbsp;It seems to me that there&#8217;s decidedly less honor (or shame) in today&#8217;s US political life, but then when I try to think back, I can&#8217;t really say there ever was very much (at least in my lifetime).</p>

<p>&quot;Politicians are the same all over. They promise to build a bridge even where there is no river.&quot;</p>

		<p>Politicians are much like whores, anything they say sounds good, the only difference is that the whores actually deliver. Legalize prostitution, forbid politics!</p>

		<p>How did that go&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;Anyone who can manage to get himself elected President should on no account be allowed to do the job.&quot;</p>
<p>I hate politics. Grumble.</p>
