		<p>Seems to me that a couple of iterations of rand() would have been equally effective while avoiding the ego problem entirely.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;ve found that validation in and out of a function has a flaw: it leads to false positives when multiple threads are involved, because the thread that caused the corruption might not exit its function before another thread detects the violation.</p>

		<p>In the Olden Days, we used to use the hex string 0xDEADBEEF. &nbsp;Very easy to spot in the hex dump. &nbsp;And if you fill unallocated memory with it, it also tends to make programs crash, when they might otherwise run happily if the stuff were filled with zeros instead.</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s plenty of common ones out there including the ever popular 0xDEADBEEF (mentioned above) and 0xCAFEBABE. I guess it depends on how much space you need to fill.</p>

		<p>0x0BA0BAB0 has the disadvantage of being even. Bad if you&#8217;re coding for a hard-alignment processor (Hitachi SH, ARM?)</p>

		<p>LOL! &nbsp;I like the CAFEBABE and BAADFOOD examples.</p>
<p>I personally use a something like ABCD1234 or 12345678 if it is easy to pick a signature out of a memory dump. &nbsp;If a bug is really annoying me though, I might encode a swearword as a string and print it out at the start and the end of the function.</p>

		<p>Those swear words. &nbsp;We had a developer who had one situation that he just couldn&#8217;t deal with, so for the time being he replaced it with a dialog that indicated in the most profane way that something was terribly wrong. &nbsp;Then, he went ahead and finished the rest of the component.</p>
<p>The problem was he forgot to check that corner condition and it made it out to a customer who happened apon that condition.</p>

<p>Eh, who&#8217;d be offended by DEADBEEF in their memory dump? It doesn&#8217;t make their computer smell or anything :)</p>

		<p>On pre OSX Macs the first IIRC 512 bytes of RAM were not used because too many people were writing to it with a null pointer. There was an extension called Even Better Bus Error that would write a signature to memory location 0 and check it on every video vertical retrace. If the signature changed EBBE would generate a bus error and halt the machine. You could catch the error in MacsBug and debug the problem. It was a great tool to check to see if you messed up and had code that wrote to a null pointer.</p>
<p>People saw that it was a popular extension so they would download and install it. Immediately their machine would start &quot;crashing&quot; with a bus error. The users had no idea what the extension was supposed to do this and sent the developer tons of nasty emails saying that his extension was buggy. Of course it wasn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>IIRC EBBE used DEADBEEF because not only was it easy to see it was also an invalid memory address.</p>

		<p>&quot;There was an extension called Even Better Bus Error&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>Huh, the &quot;Error&quot; part of the name wasn&#8217;t enough to disuade people from trying it?</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s the promise of something &quot;Even Better&quot; that won them over.</p>

		<p>One of the disadvantages of little-endianess is that sigs such as 0xDEADBEEF show up as EF BE AD DE in a byte dump. Or as shorts: BEEF DEAD</p>
<p>It&#8217;s ironic the practice of using 4-char tags makes it easy to see in a dump but harder to read in the source code: you write &#8216;edud&#8217; in order to find &#8216;dude&#8217; in a dump. See ExAllocPoolWithTag()</p>
<p>I sometimes use 0x11111111 because a bunch of skinny 1&#8217;s stands out among other fat chars &#8211; and obviously because it&#8217;s endian-agnostic.</p>
