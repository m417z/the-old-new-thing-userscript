		<p>Come to think of it, that absoute addressing to the bottom 32k is quite usable. On NT3.5 and NT4, you could reliably map the bottom 32k by requesting a memory mapping at address 1. It would be a lot more sane to place it at 4k though. I could see the compiler getting smart and placing all the small globals in the .exe (can&#8217;t do this for .dll for the obvious reason) starting at 32k and working its way down to lower addresses. This would make globals much faster as there&#8217;s no fixup for them and no need to load a register with the global pointer either.</p>

		<p>Mapping anything in the first few bytes of the virtual address space is asking for trouble. Straight up NULL isn&#8217;t the only common result of  dereferencing NULL pointers, e.g. foo-&gt;bar might as well access 0x12.</p>
<p>Of course there&#8217;s no clear &#8220;good&#8221; value for the zero region. The first page (e.g. 4k on many architectures) used to be common. That will cover almost all structs and small to moderate sized arrays, and is consistent with your later suggestion. In 64bit systems nowadays, it&#8217;s convenient to just leave the first 4GB unmapped, that at least covers dereferencing NULL pointers of anything whose size fits into a 32bit unsigned integer, with the added benefit of making any stray 32bit value (which ints still are in (L)LP64, including Windows) an invalid address.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t particularly useful in Windows NT, but I can see how it would be handy in an embedded system where there is no virtual memory. &#8221; Don&#8217;t forget low memory globals in classic Mac OS.</p>
