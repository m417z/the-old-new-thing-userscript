		<p>So the trick is to look and act in all important respects like the sidebar application? (Warning: This trick might not survive the next service pack and/or release).</p>

		<p>But the sidebar application is but a mere big blob of data. Unless its signature is checked, it should possible to create a program which successfully pretends to be the sidebar app while doing something else.</p>

		<p>Fidel: Yes, if you want to do bad things to the system then you can. Of course there&#39;s always going to be a way. The point here is that the customers didn&#39;t want to do bad things, they just didn&#39;t understand how to do the thing they wanted.</p>

		<p>Well, to be true the app writer could for example just be a writer of some other widget engine (like Konfabulator for example) which unfortunately has no way to emulate the sidebar behaviour. Or could be a developer for internal corporate software who just need that functionality &#8211; on some corporate PCs dedicated to some purposes, internal application are THAT awesome.</p>

		<p>Why is the user pressing &quot;show desktop&quot; on a corporate PC dedicated to a single app? &nbsp; &nbsp;How does that not fall under &quot;training issue&quot; rather than &quot;rewrite Windows&quot; issue? &nbsp;Seems to me that many (all?) of these schemes that try to do back flips to circumvent the user from having control have at their heart the idea that the user cannot be trusted to do the right thing. &nbsp;If you cannot trust your users, then why give them access? &nbsp;Or why not train them so that you can trust them? &nbsp;Seems like going around 3 sides of a block to navigate 1 (at the very least).</p>

		<p>Oh, there seems to be some confusion. By &quot;sidebar application&quot; I do not mean an application for the sidebar, but that one that hosts them (I think it was called sidebar.exe).</p>

		<p>Maybe I&#39;m missing something, but wouldn&#39;t setting HWND_TOPMOST be the solution if they really, really want their program to remain visible independent of circumstances?</p>
<p>Just tried with a small app I&#39;ve written for myself and it remains visible just fine when clicking Show Desktop as expected. Now if they didn&#39;t want their Window to stay visible at all times, then why would they even be worried about the show desktop command hiding it?</p>

		<p>Fidel: I got that, but nowhere did anyone mention replacing the existing sidebar. The customer wanted something that would always be visible on the desktop, and the solution was to write a gadget that integrates into the sidebar. Replacing the sidebar is rather a jump into the land of malware or system abuse &#8211; if you find yourself doing that, then you have the wrong solution or you don&#39;t correctly understand your problem.</p>

		<p>Well there&#39;s the way I did it as a prank years ago: The program set it&#39;s window TOPMOST and ran in a loop clearing TOPMOST on all other windows.</p>
<p>And then there&#39;s the way I did as a prank decades ago: The program scribbled on the desktop window.</p>

		<p>@Mason &#8211; that&#39;s a whole &#39;nuther can of worms. &nbsp;I certainly agree that the DMCA is a whorish piece of legislation, and I&#39;m no fan of DRM. &nbsp;Even so, one can see the difference between having control over reproduction of software, and control over it&#39;s installations and usages as separate from a given piece of software being a good citizen of the Windows desktop. &nbsp;I don&#39;t really think the one is connected to the other, excepting the general lack of respect for end-users that is shown / inherent to DMCA/DRM.</p>

		<p>@Mason: DRM is also one of those &quot;do not touch&quot; issues that often gets entire classes of topics scrubbed by our illustrious host!</p>
<p>I can&#39;t think of many classes of applications that must not under any circumstances become hidden. &nbsp;If you need to alert the user, that&#39;s the job of the notification area. &nbsp;Statuses? &nbsp;That&#39;s maybe a gadget. &nbsp;Anything else? &nbsp;It can probably wait, but you can FlashWindow() yourself to get noticed if necessary.</p>

<p>&gt;How can there be so many stupid software engineers out there? &nbsp;Maybe not stupid, per se, but with zero respect for conventions of Windows, and more importantly, no respect for the end-user&#39;s ability to control his/her own PC?</p>
<p>I thought not respecting the end-user&#39;s ability to control his/her own PC *is* the standard convention of Windows. Why else would Microsoft support the DMCA and the crimeware that it explicitly makes legal to use and illegal to circumvent, and participate in the Trusted Computing initiative? &nbsp;The message is very clear: As long as DRM is not only not regarded as the act of hacking that it is, but actually *protected* by law, you do not have the legal right to control your own computer, and Microsoft feels no obligation to protect that right.</p>

		<p>Well, I can think of several situations where someone might want to keep the window visible. If you have a toolbar on the side (like the taskbar), there is nothing important to see on the desktop below it, so most people actually want that behaviour.</p>
<p>I actually did write a gadget which creates a another window (in c) to simulate the vista-sidebar for win7 and many users complained that it gets hidden on Win+D. So I looked how sidebar.exe does it and copied the behaviour, and everyone was happy&#8230;</p>
<p>PS: Please stop talking about DRM</p>

		<p>@Mason:</p>
<p>The thing is that you *GET* to have that protected media path. Your argument pretends to be just about your machine but neglects the fact that its not your content and to enjoy that content you are subject to the terms defined by those selling that content. You don&#39;t have to buy that content, but if you do you have a machine with a commercial software stack that is capable of playing it precisely and only because it conforms. You *GET* to play it at full resolution, which is otherwise not something that you would get to do without breaking the contents license terms.</p>
<p>If you dont like it, then dont buy the content. The protected media path doesnt make windows worse.. on the contrary it allows you to make the choice for yourself, which is better. Without the protected path, you would have no choice.</p>
