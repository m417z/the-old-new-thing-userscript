		<p>BLiTZ / Joshua,</p>
<p>This reminds me of a computer company where I worked 30 years ago: One server was named &quot;and&quot;. The one to the left of it was named &quot;Rock&quot; and the one to the right was named &quot;Roll&quot;&#8230;</p>
<p>A related story from the same caompany and same age:</p>
<p>The OS certainly provided distinct file directories for each user, with password protection and access rights etc, but no subdirectories. Unix was slowly emerging, and the technical part of the customer base was demanding a hierarchical file system. So, an add-on was developed on top of the old FS. User surverys indicated that most non-technical users, accustomed to physical archives, didn&#39;t want arbitrary depth storage, and the FS add-on offered a model consisting of &quot;Cabinets&quot;, with &quot;Drawers&quot;, where &quot;Folders&quot; could hold &quot;Documents&quot;.</p>
<p>A while after the introduction of this system, we heard that the users at one of our prestige customers, a large publishing house, were complaining about the difficulties of remembering in which folder the docuement had been put, which drawer that folder was dropped into, and in which cabinet. They spent a siginficant amount of time searching for documents that had been misplaced in the archives.</p>
<p>At a local user group meetig (the customer was large enough to have its own UG), they discussed how to cope with this problem. One of the ladies stood up and told that she had created a cabinet named Cabinet, with a single drawer, named Drawer, with a single folder, named Folder. In that she put all the documents, so she never had to spend time searching for them. Everyone at the meeting rejoiced and praised the initiative, and after the meeting they all went back to their offices to create one cabinet with one drawer with one folder where everything could be stored. Problem solved.</p>

		<p>Two that I remember from the 80s:</p>
<p>Wang had a slogan, &quot;Wang Cares&quot;. Unfortunately in Britain this didn&#39;t go down quite as well as I assume it did in the USA. (Hint: say quickly)</p>
<p>Another example of US-UK confusion was a debugging tool sold by Tandy/Radio Shack for one of their computers. In the catalogue it was described as being useful to &quot;get rid of little buggers&quot;.</p>
<p>So the moral is, not only do you need a panel of 12 year old boys, but boys from every country you plan to sell in.</p>

		<p>&quot;My Documents&quot; has similar problems. &nbsp;Do you tell someone to go to &quot;my documents&quot;, &quot;your documents&quot;, or more accurately &quot;your my documents&quot;. &nbsp;Having a DOS command named &quot;type&quot; also makes it harder to tell someone to type it.</p>

<p>&quot;Which project are you working on?&quot; &nbsp;</p>

		<p>I worked for a company in the Seattle area that changed its logo shortly after I left. Had I been there still, I&#39;d have strongly objected. The logo is supposed to represent a person interacting with a kiosk, but instead it rather resembles a man interacting with a urinal.</p>

		<p>Then there was a story from a former manager of mine about a government IT project she was on that was related to sewage treatment plants. They named the project &quot;Sewage Handling Information Tracking System,&quot; but never initialized it in any of the documentation, just to see how far up the chain it would go. It got to a very senior review before it was kicked out.</p>

		<p>@BLiTZ: I can go one better than that. One of our customers had a single server on each of several hundred sites, all cloned from one master image. None of the software on the box cared what the server name was, they couldn&#39;t actually see each other &#8211; so they were *all* called SERVER!</p>
<p>This was actually convenient for part of the client software on the handhelds &#8211; it meant we could effectively hardcode the update URL to <a href="http://server/blah/blah" rel="nofollow">http://server/blah/blah</a>. Sadly, the new back-end system that they replaced it with *does* care what the computer name is, so we can&#39;t do that any more.</p>
