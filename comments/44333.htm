		<p>Sometimes when in the thick of debugging a problem it is easy to get so focused on one part of the problem that you become myopic to other possibilities. What I find strange is that they asked MS about this without (I&#39;m assuming here) asking another set of eyes within his own group to look at the code.</p>

		<p>At least the customer was courteous enough to respond. They usually just vanish when they&#39;ve overlooked the obvious solution.</p>

		<p>Once upon a time I filed a bug against .NET 2.0 after having this weird behavior in production we were failing to track down. Process Explorer would show a stack trace going straight from acquire semaphore from create thread, in a pattern that indicated livelock. Windbg kept on crashing the process trying to get good information out of it.</p>
<p>Turned out it was my own bug requiring a novel set of circumstances to create, and Process Explorer can&#39;t generate correct stacktraces of .NET process in all cases. Given the bug was a simple spinning thread repeatedly acquiring and releasing a semaphore in a loop, I never was able to learn why Windbg kept crashing the process being debugged.</p>
<p>The amusing thing is typing an incantation into Google that should mostly match that stack traces found a lot of others complaining about the exact same bug that I reported (which did not exist).</p>

		<p>If you have already payed MS (or another company) for doing time consuming debug work, don&#39;t spend time doing it yourself, learn to outsource the work. It would actually be irresponsible to do it yourself, then you spend resources twice.</p>

		<p>Firefox&#39;s windows are simply documents in an XML dialect, but the title setting code used to run at different times depending on whether you loaded the document as a new window or as a frame in the browser, causing no end of confusion.</p>
