		<p>So, all we have to do is build a bigger stadium and we will win the tournament? &nbsp;Sweet!</p>

		<p>This method can be a bit misled by schools that share NBA arenas but never fill them. &nbsp;Not sure how many of those there are. &nbsp;At least Seton Hall at Continental Arena, and St. Johns at MSG.</p>
<p>Average attendance could work better. &nbsp;But more work.</p>

		<p>My mom once submitted a bracket where she had teams making reappearances to her office pool after losing in the first or second round. I&#8217;m not sure how or why she did it, but I do remember that the team she picked (and won) the national championship that year she had getting upset in the first round, but they were among the team she gave &quot;second chances&quot; to. This was, of course, during the days of paper done entries and adding up the scores day by day.</p>
<p>So when it came time to add up the scores at her work, the guy running the bracket merely went down the rounds column by column adding up how many &quot;winning teams&quot; you got correct. And despite not doing well in the first two rounds, her teams that she gave reprieves to showed up strong in the elite eight and the final four. I think she ended up coming in second place in her bracket.</p>

		<p>This will be an interesting bracket to track. It would seem like there would be a lot of things that could derail it. For instance Gonzaga recently chose to build a smaller stadium than they knew the market could support to ensure it would always be 100% full and thus have a better &#8216;atmosphere&#8217; for the players, the intent being to win games rather than generate revenue.</p>
<p>(Currently reading your book and am really enjoying it &#8211; thanks for writing it!)</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t find the links, but a few weeks ago Washington Post had an article about home stadiums being &#8216;stacked&#8217;. Various things like architecture to funnel noise (more NFL), but for college basketball: seating the students in close-to-court areas (and giving cheap rates to rabid noisy students for front row seats), putting in specifically noisy bleachers (for stomping on), to making bleachers uncomfortable to sit on (to make fans stand). My google-foo failed to find the link..</p>

		<p>Sorry, but you are out of your gourd if you think that Albany isn&#8217;t going to kick Virginia&#8217;s ass =) &nbsp;Ok, so Im an Albany alum, but that&#8217;s not influencing my decision, honest.</p>

		<p>Additionally, I think it&#8217;s funny that the reason Tennessee is going to win the men&#8217;s tournament is that their women&#8217;s team has been ridiculously successful enough to merit the large arena.</p>
<p>But that could just be me. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t actually know anything about the Tennessee arena, that just seems the most likely scenario to me.</p>

		<p>Raymond, I thought I&#8217;d actually stop by the author&#8217;s blog of the book I reviewed earlier this year. Great work putting it together and getting it out the door! I really appreciated some of the insight you provided. &#8211;Eric S.</p>

		<p>I wonder how long the building/planning cycle for a college basketball arena is&#8230; It might be that the size of the arena correlates better with success 10-15 years ago (rather than this year). &nbsp;Looking forward to seeing how it works out!</p>

		<p>Illinois all the way! &nbsp;Although I have a moment of unease with your Illinois v. Southern Illinois (my hometown) game&#8230; &nbsp;I hope I don&#8217;t have to frankenstein shirts together &#8211; maroon and orange just aren&#8217;t the height of fashion color combos.</p>

		<p>If you use this as your sole resource for NCAA wagering than your a fool (Rob). I have a better idea, enter my pool or better yet, just send me your money and save yourself the time.</p>
