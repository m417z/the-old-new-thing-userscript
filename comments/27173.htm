		<p>I&#8217;ve recently started (at a ripe old age) to teach myself to play guitar. &nbsp;This term &quot;Shredding&quot; is a new one to me and I&#8217;d wondered what it meant. &nbsp;I managed to navigate past the 404 error in your link to the actual Wikipedia article. &nbsp;And I&#8217;m afraid after reading it I&#8217;m none the wiser. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>&quot;Social Hall&quot; looks like a scheduling nightmare, doesn&#8217;t it? &nbsp;Each student selects 14 other students as classmates, and each class is limited to 15 students. &nbsp;Anyone else see how this might be a problem?</p>

		<p>article on shredding says basically using technical proficiency to maximize speed, and then lists techniques. &nbsp;For example, alternate picking and economy picking appear to attempt to minimize hand movement, the idea being, presumably, that the less you move your hand in a span of time the more notes you can hit.</p>

		<p>Maybe the reason no-one can spell &quot;soldering&quot; is because no-one in the US can pronounce it correctly. &nbsp;The &quot;l&quot; is not silent!</p>

<p>Sure, but you&#8217;re going to have to deal with a class full of disgruntled 7th graders when they discover that they won&#8217;t be spending the semester watching Sponge Bob and The Simpsons, but instead will be watching old episodes of MASH and the news.</p>

		<p>How sure are you that &quot;Joner of Achievement&quot; isn&#8217;t supposed to be &quot;Honor of Achievement&quot;? Seems like an easy mistake to make for a Spanish-speaking person.</p>

		<p>I think &quot;gragwwhts&quot; is just the Welsh spelling of &quot;graduates&quot;.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m guessing that Raymond could tell from context that &quot;Joner of Achievement&quot; was really a reference to Junior Achievement (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.ja.org/near/near_local_info.asp?AreaID=109704" rel="nofollow">http://www.ja.org/near/near_local_info.asp?AreaID=109704</a>), as it is a program that I took when I was that age.</p>

		<p>Read the whole article before posting your guess for what each misspelled word. &nbsp;If you read the whole article you will notice that Raymond said &quot;Note: Hover over dotted words for explanations/answers.&quot;</p>
<p>The shred guitar article on Wikipedia indicated that there is technique to &nbsp;&quot;shredding&quot; beyond just playing the guitar really fast. &nbsp;This may be true, but the term is generally used to mean &quot;a fast, aggressive style of playing the guitar.&quot; &nbsp;</p>

		<p>&quot;Fire.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, a thousand times yes. &nbsp;Fire is awesome.</p>
<p>I have to say that this is both hilarious and terrifying. &nbsp;The fact that seventh graders write in such a manner is kind of depressing. &nbsp;Maybe I&#8217;m a grumpy old geezer (I&#8217;m only a 20-something!), but what are they teaching kids these days!?</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Exactly what I was thinking: &quot;$600 per class, yay.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve noticed that kids ideas of money are grossly out of sync with reality. Maybe we need Raymond&#8217;s &quot;money management class&quot; and let the kids know that even when you&#8217;re working minimum wage $20 is a paltry sum. (Here in CA, minimum wage is $7.50. For a fulltime employee, that&#8217;s $1,200 a month, or $14,400 a year. For kids that think $20 is expensive, getting $14,400 a year should blow their mind.)</p>
<p>Oh, and since comments are disabled on the original post regarding this: I agree with Raymond, we need a class for counting money. I&#8217;ve been a cashier before going into IT, and we learned pretty quickly how to count the money. It&#8217;s the customers that don&#8217;t, and it always annoyed me to get a group of coins and had to make other customers wait while I counted the coins in order to give back the dime, nickle, and couple pennies they gave me extra.</p>

<p>I would be disgruntled, too, if you made me watch MASH and the news. If you want to do television-as-literature, start with the Simpsons, Buffy, Battlestar Galactica, and other more contemporary, high-quality shows.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>It is not always the customers who do not know how to count money. &nbsp;When I was in high school I worked in the pizza station at Meijers ( a hypermarket (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermarket" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypermarket</a>) in the midwest equivalent to a Wal-Mart Supercenter). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I asked one of the other pizza makers to cover the register while I went to lunch. &nbsp; I went to the back room to punch out on my timecard and then I started to leave the building (which requires you to go in front of the pizza station). &nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;The pizza guy flagged me over and said he was having trouble completing an order. &nbsp;The bill came $4.01 and the woman gave him a $5. &nbsp;So I asked him what the issue was? &nbsp;I kid you not, this is what he said, &quot;How much money does she get back?&quot; &nbsp;I tried to stay composed while I told him that she was owed .99 cents, but then he asked me &quot;How do I give her that?&quot;. &nbsp;He had no idea how much each coin was worth or how to add them up. &nbsp;</p>

<p>You&#8217;re talking about someone who&#8217;s NOT the cashier. Non-cashiers and cashiers in learning I can expect to be similar to customers in their ineptitude toward counting coins. Althought that&#8217;s more inept than customers I&#8217;ve seen, although the customers that don&#8217;t know how to count three quarters, two dimes, and four pennies will probably just give whole dollars without even trying for exact change.</p>

		<p>I doubt that the essays were typed. If they had the chance to take the essays home, I would hope that they would have at least had Word proof read and not let the abomonation of grgwwhts get through.</p>
<p>J/H typo is unlikely when writing by hand.</p>
<p>Besides, if you hover over it, Raymond believes from context that &quot;Joner&quot; is not &quot;Honor&quot; but &quot;Junior&quot;</p>

		<p>paul,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m in the US and not only can spell soldering correctly, do pronounce it with a very subtle &#8216;l&#8217; sound. &nbsp;It&#8217;s very close to &quot;soddering&quot; and I wouldn&#8217;t fault anyone or anything for recognizing it incorrectly.</p>
<p>Listen carefully next time you hear a really articulate speaker. &nbsp;Most English words are actually spelled more phoenetically than one might initially believe. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>One question: were these kids writing the essays longhand, or were they using computers?</p>
<p>As someone who suffered through tons of timed longhand essay writing in high school honors and AP English classes* &#8212; usually 50 minutes for 2-3 page essays, without access to the book &#8212; I can sympathize with some of the basic mistakes that even intelligent 7th graders would make in such a situation. It&#8217;s even worse when you&#8217;re accustomed to being able to go back and edit what you&#8217;ve written/typed.</p>
<p>That said, good stuff. :)</p>
<p>* &#8211; I know; surprising, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

		<p>The student suggesting soccer on the basis of improving &quot;variety&quot; is correct from a certain angle. When you focus on only one thing, the course can be much more varied within the confines of the selected sport.</p>

		<p>+1 for teaching foreign languages in middle school. &nbsp;You can learn at any age but I feel it&#8217;s easier when you&#8217;re younger. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I got to go to a public school in Alabama where kids are taught French from kindergarten up. &nbsp;If anything I feel they could&#8217;ve been more aggressive: through 6th grade it still had the tone of an introductory class, focusing on vocab and memorizing songs more than on conversation or on reading/writing meaningful chunks of prose. &nbsp;It&#8217;s partly due to bigger problems of public schools: the student-teacher ratios were positively cruel, and kids were grouped by age, not by proficiency in the language.</p>

		<p>Fire is certainly the course that I would take&#8230;</p>
<p>Just imagine the topics:</p>
<p>-Starting a fire</p>
<p>-Putting out a fire</p>
<p>-Types of fuel</p>
<p>-Advanced topics: Accelerants and Explosives&#8230;</p>

		<p>wow, &nbsp;I&#8217;m making wild assumptions that the 7-year olds that suggested personal development topics like &quot;make-up and beauty&quot; and &quot;self image improvements&quot; were mainly girls.</p>
<p>Based on that assumption it is so so so so sad that girls that age are already expressing the need to learn how to be an effective girl in american society.</p>

		<p>So I asked him what the issue was? &nbsp;I kid you not, this is what he said, &quot;How much money does she get back?&quot; &nbsp;I tried to stay composed while I told him that she was owed .99 cents, but then he asked me . . .</p>
<p>gah!</p>
<p>.99 cents</p>
<p>.99 cents???? &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Why is it people don&#8217;t understand the difference between .99 cents and $.99 &nbsp; ?</p>

		<p>Re: Counting money.</p>
<p>Your bill comes to $4.26 &nbsp;So I give you $5.01 (to get back quarters). &nbsp;And then the cashier gives me my penny and says &quot;you don&#8217;t need that&quot;.</p>
<p>*sigh*</p>
<p>Anyhow, the topics were good for a laugh. &nbsp;But surprisingly sad at the same time.</p>

<p>Thanks for calling me out on that bramster. &nbsp;I made a mistake, I should have used $0.99, 99 cents or 99c.</p>

		<p>Thanks for sharing&#8230;</p>
<p>Interestingly, I&#8217;m try the Karting approach with my 12-year-old. It make her into a hellion when she starts driving, but at least she&#8217;ll be a somewhat-skilled hellion.</p>
<p>Actually, my theory is that the karting will put her in some intense situations and being exposed to them will make her less likely to freak out when she starts driving.</p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s the kind of sacrifice that I&#8217;m willing to make for her&#8230;</p>

		<p>&quot;You can learn more life lessons in an episode of Spong Bob than the average person can learn in his life. &#8230; Watching mindless television for a whole period for credit will be a great elective.&quot;</p>
<p>The tone is pretty sarcastic. &nbsp;If the rest of the paper was as sarcastic, i would think the kid was pretty smart.</p>
