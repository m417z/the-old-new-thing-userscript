		<p>Interesting, I&#8217;ll check that out, as I have a bit of an issue (heh) with hoarding. &nbsp;I really need to learn to throw more stuff out, or give it away to charity shops and the like.</p>

		<p>The Swedish word for hoarding is hamstring, which itself is sort of a funny word in English, but the meaning of Swedish word is even funnier, it means &quot;acting like a hamster&quot;, referring to the habit of stuffing one&#8217;s cheeks full of nuts for safe keeping.</p>

		<p>I am somewhat of a digital hoarder; in real life I can get rid of anything, but I never delete any files. &nbsp;I have crap that is 10 years old that I have never touched (and probably never will), yet I just can&#8217;t summon the strength to delete it. &nbsp;Besides, I have a total of 750 GB of storage, and these days storage is cheap. &nbsp;When you take external USB drives into account, you really don&#8217;t have to delete anything. &nbsp;I guess you might run into a problem when all your external drives are taking up too much space, though.</p>

		<p>Oh, man. &nbsp;I have a minor hoarding problem, too. &nbsp;Boxes, screws (I might be able to use that for something else, I say to myself as I drop it into the can of a thousand screws that never get used for anything), and books in particular (anyone want a copy of MS-DOS 2.1 for Dummies?).</p>
<p>Occasionally I come across some bit of plastic that I&#8217;ve stashed away &#8216;just in case I need it later&#8217; and I have no idea what the hell the thing is. &nbsp;Usually it goes in the garbage then. &nbsp;Usually.</p>

		<p>I used to be compelled to collect the magazines I subscribe to&#8230; it would be a waste to throw it away even after I read it because I could always come back to it.</p>
<p>One day I broke down and got a scanner and OCR software and tried to digitize my collection so I don&#8217;t have to keep a bunch of dusty old mags around.</p>
<p>Long story shortened: I have several gigs of imperfectly-OCRed pdfs, several more gigs of raw image files just in case the OCR gets better and I can run all the files through again, and still have all those dusty old mags in case it turns out my scans weren&#8217;t good enough.</p>

<p>So what you&#8217;re saying is that your hoarding worked.</p>

		<p>I went to a hoarder&#8217;s house once, and it blew my mind. &nbsp;When you stepped into her house, there were stacks of boxes, newspapers, magazines, knicknacks, and I&#8217;m presuming everything this person had ever touched. The smallest stack was probably 4 feet tall, and some went to the ceiling. &nbsp;There was a crooked narrow path that went through the junk to the kitchen and then through the hallway to the rest of the house. &nbsp;I&#8217;m pretty sure the rest of the house looked the same way.</p>

		<p>My mother is a hoarder, which is now considered to be a form of OCD. &nbsp;It was kept relatively in check by my father, but with his recent passing it has gotten completely out of control. &nbsp;Many rooms are so filled with &quot;stuff&quot; that you literally cannot step inside. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One particularity insightful thing I read was that psychiatrists believe that the major contributing factor in hoarding is the subjects trouble in making decisions, and that even minor decisions (&quot;should I throw out yesterday&#8217;s newspaper or save it to read later&quot;) are given undue importance and consideration. &nbsp; Hoarding is not just about the inability of &quot;letting go&quot; of things, but also about avoiding the mental anguish of making command decisions, no matter how small.</p>
<p>The most effective &quot;treatments&quot; for hoarding seem to acknowledge this: almost all of them involve a explicit set of steps for making decisions.</p>

		<p>The UK has a webservice called &#8216;free-cycle&#8217; which is a fabulous antidote to hording, &nbsp;you advertise stuff that could be useful but you don&#8217;t need/want paying for and people who want/need it come and take it away. &nbsp;It takes the notions of &#8216;this could be useful&#8217; that influence individuals to horde and turns it into a socially usable resource. &nbsp;Excellent.</p>

		<p>cardboard boxes&#8230;. recycle them. If you need more, go to the supermarket and ask &#8211; they have hundreds of new ones everyday. Or as you work in a tech company (?!) you could grab a few from your support groups &#8211; all those boxes PCs come in are great.</p>
<p>Or perhaps you could just order a few batteries from Dell&#8230;</p>

		<p>I believe that you can reuse cardboard boxes by giving them to your local neighborhood shipping store. They should also accept used packing peanuts and used bubble wrap.</p>
<p>Just because you can&#8217;t reuse something immediately doesn&#8217;t mean that you need to hold onto it forever. Keeping stuff around is often more bother than it is worth. Throwing it away requires energy, though. I&#8217;m a hoarder because it&#8217;s too much work to throw stuff away. :)</p>

		<p>&nbsp; I used to keep a lot of magazines and pages of newspapers around, but I found that with a 7 megapixel camera, I can take a picture of any article I might want to keep and it is readable on a computer, so I can throw away the magazine. &nbsp;I think 5 megapixels is enough for a magazine, 7 seems to be a good spot for a full page of a paper. &nbsp;My camera has a zoom function in playback mode, so I can even read it later from the camera. &nbsp;Oh, I currently have cameras with 7, 5, 3, 2, and 1 megapixels (can&#8217;t give up my mavica that can use floppys). &nbsp;I also have 3 standalone photo printers.</p>

		<p>Nobodyman, I helped a friend clear out his 3 bedroom/&lt;1200sq ft house when his grandmother went into the hospital. We filled 8 20-cubic-yard dumpsters and 1 10 cubic yard dumpster with her stuff. There was still enough &quot;crap&quot; left in the attic and 1 bedroom that we didn&#8217;t get to before his grandma came home. But the kitchen was usable, a car could be put in the garage, and he had a bedroom to use.</p>
<p>Stuff were telephone bills from the 70s, newspapers just as old, etc. Random crap.</p>

		<p>One aspect of hoarding is that once enough stuff is stored long enough to be a bother, you can&#8217;t just throw it away, because that makes the bother be all in vain. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, when I am forced to do something about my stuff, I will find something to do with it, which makes it somewhat worth having kept it all that time. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Telephone bills from the 70s? &nbsp;Spend some time looking at them&#8230; something positive may result, like recalling an old family friend. &nbsp;Old equipment? &nbsp;Take it apart before throwing it away. &nbsp;Something smashable? &nbsp;Smash it for fun!! &nbsp;</p>

		<p>I think hoarding is in our genes.</p>
<p>I believe we&#8217;ve been hoarding stuffs since the stone age.</p>
<p>Basically we’re just talking monkeys that know how to use tools.</p>
<p>Hence there&#8217;s a need to keep stuffs(tools) around because we might need it someday.</p>
