		<p>Argh. That sju/sjo sound is just impossible for me, and it pops up everywhere. I worked at Ellemtel in Alvsjo for a while and every day for the first couple of weeks (before I had a transit pass) I had to ask for a ticket to:<br />
<br />Alvshu<br />
<br />Alvsfu<br />
<br />Elvshu<br />
<br />Elvwhoo<br />
<br />Which usually took about a minute. According to friends, I finally got to the point where I sounded like an American trying to pronounce the word &#8211; so I considered that a small victory. Had the same experience try to pick up Swedish though &#8211; I&#8217;d usually get two words out of my mouth, and we&#8217;d be back in English ;)</p>

		<p>I came to my realization about the position of English when I went on two English-language guided tours and most of the people on the tours didn&#8217;t speak English as their native language. My friend Jonathan likes to say that English is the new lingua franca.</p>

		<p>Re the German and the Russian, if the German grew up in the DDR he/she should be able to speak Russian since that was the standard foreign language in DDR schools.</p>

		<p>Truss me, I lived almost 9 years in Sweden and I gotta say the most difficult word of all is that sju.</p>
<p>I remember having that same repeating session with one my friends&#8230; ohh yeah, it was painful.</p>

		<p>What sound does &quot;sj&quot; represent? Approximate IPA if you like :)<br />
<br />It is [s] followed by [j], or something else entirely?</p>

		<p>Sju is pronounced like shoe, except it&#8217;s not ;) </p>
<p>I think everyone learning a new language has such difficulties. The English &quot;th&quot; sound is a common problem for Swedish speakers, for instance. Apart from alien sounds, different spelling throws me off too&#8211;I&#8217;m always forgetting W and V are different in English.</p>

		<p>The Swedish &quot;sj&quot; sound can be badly described as &quot;a breathy /h/, somewhere between the two German /ch/ sounds (not quite frontal, not quite back), yet not really.&quot; Since I can&#8217;t do it, it&#8217;s kind of wrong of me to try to describe it&#8230;</p>
<p>And I wouldn&#8217;t get too excited about getting the English /th/ sound perfect. Native English speakers have no trouble figuring out that you&#8217;re &quot;trying&quot; to say /th/, and it makes for a pleasant foreign accent.</p>

		<p>Sounds like the IPA symbol ? (U+0267 if that didn&#8217;t paste properly). My <em>Phonetic Symbol Guide</em> says it&#8217;s used for a &quot;combination of [x] and [?] (U+0283), one variety of Swedish tj, kj, etc.&quot;<br />
<br />If that&#8217;s accurate, then you pretty much have to articulate at two places at once&#8230; yeah I could see how that would be tricky ;)</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know Sweeden much, but I did live one year in Denmark, and I can definitely understand what you mean: You know something is terribly wrong when you try to practice your knowledge of Danish at the bakery and they just automatically switch to English without giving it a second thought.</p>
<p>Really fiendish pronounciation, what with 12-odd distinct vowel sounds and all. I&#8217;m from Spain, and we have a grand total of five. :-)<br /></p>

		<p>Regarding your &quot;sj&quot; experience, I had a similar one with the Russian soft l.</p>
<p>On the Russian subject, I never met too many Russians that spoke English.  When renewing my visa in Finland, however, everyone spoke English.  It was a bit of a shock for me.</p>

		<p>Having lived in Israel since age 10, I speak both English (I&#8217;m from the US) and Hebrew fluently. Plus I have many many international friends here, from literally all over the world.</p>
<p>Usually the first experience I have with pronouncing something that would be considered &quot;foreign&quot; is with the name of a new aquaintance. However, probably due to my bi-lingual experience, I usually don&#8217;t have much trouble at all pronouncing &quot;foreign&quot; sounds &#8211; it&#8217;s actually remembering the names that I trip over.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have to have a Swedish friend say &quot;sju&quot; for me so I can try it. ;)</p>

		<p>Ditto Chinese tones.</p>
<p>Me: They sound the same!<br />
<br />My wife: No, one is &quot;ma&quot; the other is &quot;ma&quot;<br />

		<p>For those that have lived in Southern California, the news people on both radio and TV speak English and then also pronounce Hispanic words with a very Hispanic flair (at least to a Gringo).</p>

		<p>Gernot,</p>
<p>But there is &quot;be-chica&quot; and &quot;be-grande&quot; (&#8216;v&#8217; and &#8216;b&#8217; if I recall correctly) which sound more similar than you&#8217;d think. </p>
<p>To hear &quot;Spanish&quot; Spanish you need to watch the Mexican TV networks. To my ear, the news presenters often sound relatively European.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never ordered food in Spanish from a shop in Tijuana without the other speaker switching to English, yet in Canc&#250;n native speakers were happy to indulge Gringo efforts to practice Spanish.<br /></p>

		<p>ATZ, I believe that Spanish &quot;v&quot; and &quot;b&quot; are pronounced the exact same&#8211;even their names, sometimes.</p>
<p>I always learned that both were &quot;be&quot;/&quot;ve&quot; (pronounced roughly like Enlgish &quot;bay&quot; or the imaginary rhyming word &quot;vay&quot; or something in between the two or something that sounds something like any of the three&#8211;depending on regional accent and the position of the letter in the word). However, my Spanish teacher, a native speaker from Spain, calles B &quot;be&quot; and V &quot;uve&quot;. I suppose that could still be confusing though, as &quot;u&quot; is U and &quot;v&quot; is V (or B&#8230;), so when asking for &quot;uve&quot; I suppose someone might mistake it for UB or UV instead of V.</p>
<p>::faints::</p>
<p>::recovers::</p>
<p>Anyway &#8230; I&#8217;m definitely not a native and I&#8217;m not quite fluent, so don&#8217;t trust me too much. :)</p>
<p>But, like you, I&#8217;ve heard the &quot;chica&quot; and &quot;grande&quot; things for differentiating between them&#8211;and also &quot;v como vaca&quot; and &quot;b como&#8230;&quot; &#8230; err, I forgot what that one goes with.  Anyway, for those who don&#8217;t know Spanish, the last two are kinda like Enlgish &quot;c as in cat&quot; or something.</p>
<p>And while we&#8217;re on V/B, I&#8217;ve heard some natives getting &quot;A ver si&quot; (rough translation: Let&#8217;s see if) mixed up with the incorrect &quot;haber si&quot;, since they&#8217;re pronounced the same. (Again, for those that don&#8217;t know Spanish, the &quot;h&quot; is silent in modern Spanish. And this expression would mean &quot;to have if&quot;&#8211;and, at that, this &quot;to have&quot; would be not like &quot;to have/possess something&quot; but &quot;to have (done something)&quot;&#8211;i.e., the form used with participles.)</p>
<p>Wheew, sorry a little lengthy, and I got carried off on some tangents. Hope y&#8217;all can still understand me. :-)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m trying to learn Polish, and I&#8217;m having similar problems with some of their &quot;unusual&quot; (for me) sounds. For example:</p>
<p>&quot;sz&quot; sounds something like &quot;shh&quot;<br />
<br />&quot;si&quot; sounds something like &quot;shh&quot;<br />
<br />&quot;s&quot; (s with diacritic mark) sounds something like &quot;shh&quot;</p>
<p>Except, of course, they&#8217;re all slightly different. They sound *exactly* the same to my uneducated ear.</p>
<p>&quot;cz&quot;, &quot;ci&quot;, &quot;c&quot; (c with diacritic mark) also sound almost like English &quot;ch&quot;. Sometimes. Except when they don&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>Great thread! I simply love this stuff. For anyone who may be interested, I&#8217;d like to nominate Irish Gaelic for the honor of ultimate linguistic nightmare. It&#8217;s a quadruple whammy of spelling, pronunciation, grammar, and reliance on idiom. Check it out and you&#8217;ll swear it came from another planet.</p>
<p>Some reactions I&#8217;ve had while learning:<br />
<br />1. &quot;Kevin&quot; is actually spelled &quot;Caoimhin&quot;?!<br />
<br />2. &quot;Gheobhaidh&quot; is pronounced HOW?!<br />
<br />3. How the hell can a word have that many consecutive silent letters?<br />
<br />4. Aaarrrggghhh!!!</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve heard the Czech combination of &quot;rz&quot; (except w/ a circle above the r) is just about as hard they come.  Roll the R once, then a sharp, yet soft &quot;zh&quot; sound right after that.  Side note; Bjarne Stroustrop (sp) instructions on how to pronounce his name still cracks me (just google his name for his site).</p>

		<p>Your &quot;sju&quot; episode reminds me very much of my attempt to memorize and be able to pronounce the numbers one to ten in Mandarin. One major problem was that I, as a westerner, would go up with the voice at the end of a sentence indicating a question but in Mandarin that will, of course, completely change the meaning of a word. It went like this:</p>
<p>Him: &quot;gao&quot;<br />
<br />Me: &quot;gao?&quot;</p>
<p>Him: &quot;no, gao&quot;<br />
<br />Me &quot;gao?&quot;</p>
<p>Him: &quot;No, gao&quot;<br />
<br />Me: &quot;gao?!&quot;</p>
<p>It took me a while until I realized my error and stopped repeating the word while at the same time asking for confirmation. Which resulted in an unexpected turn in my lesson:</p>
<p>Him: &quot;gao&quot;<br />
<br />Me: &quot;gao&quot;<br />
<br />Him: &quot;Oh god, no, don&#8217;t say that!&quot;<br />
<br />Me: &quot;why, what&#8217;s wrong now?&quot;<br />
<br />Him: &quot;Uhm, I can&#8217;t tell you, it&#8217;s, uhm, just don&#8217;t say that&quot;.</p>
<p>The girls around us starting giggling told me I must have said something pretty dirty, so I tried to avoid saying that again, only that I had no idea how since it sounded all the same to me. So we continued until I was able to do it right three times in a row at which point I gave up. </p>

		<p>To Keith :</p>
<p>Wow. Thats awesome :). I&#8217;m Polish, so you know, it&#8217;s kinda personal :)<br />
<br />so i&#8217;ll help you out here :<br />
<br />&gt;&quot;sz&quot; sounds something like &quot;shh&quot; </p>
<p>yes. thats right.</p>
<p>&gt;&quot;si&quot; sounds something like &quot;shh&quot; </p>
<p>nope, sorry :)<br />
<br />its long softened</p>
<p>&gt;&quot;s&quot; (s with diacritic mark) sounds something &gt;like &quot;shh&quot; </p>
<p>s (s diacritic )is short softened.<br />
<br />i cant describe it, but it soo different :)</p>
<p>&gt;They sound *exactly* the same to my &gt;uneducated ear. </p>
<p>just practice them more :)</p>
<p>whats more funny, the ni and n (n diacritic) have the same story. but the word female elephants in polish is &quot;slonice&quot; while &quot;slonce&quot; is sun :)</p>
<p>theres even more<br />
<br />the ch and h were spoken differently , but nowadays only some old people are able to pronouce it with difference. its just a historical backwards compatibility we have to deal while writing words which contain sound &#8216;h&#8217; :)<br /></p>
