		<p>&gt;The CURSOR_SUPPRESSED flag tells tells you that the cursor is not visible because the user touched the screen with a finger or pen.</p>
<p>Unreliable. I tried touching my 19&quot; Dell monitors with both my fingers and pens, but the cursor remained visible. (Walking myself over to nit-picker&#39;s corner&#8230;..)</p>

		<p>@Brian_EE, doubling down on the nit-picking&#8230; Raymond didn&#39;t say that the cursor will always become hidden when you touch the screen, or that CURSOR_SUPPRESSED will always be set if the cursor is hidden (though both those things might still be true)&#8230; he just said that if CURSOR_SUPPRESSED is set, then the cursor is hidden because the user touched the screen. Your counter-example doesn&#39;t disprove that statement. See also the Wason selection task (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wason_selection_task">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Wason_selection_task</a>).</p>

		<p>@Chris Long &#8211; I guess these days everyone is so used to devices having touchscreens that one doesn&#39;t think to differentiate that and instead uses the generic &quot;screen&quot; term. Related to that, my college professor fianc√© has been lamenting that you can&#39;t find a decent new laptop without a touchscreen. Although I haven&#39;t done any analysis of my own, she claims the touchscreens aren&#39;t as bright as the regular LCD screens.</p>

		<p>Ah, I see I missed the sarcasm in your comment&#8230; oops. You got me :-)</p>
<p>I can confirm that touching my 21&quot; Sony screen from circa 2004 doesn&#39;t hide the cursor either.</p>

		<p>When I touch my HP w1907 screen at the cursor position, the cursor becomes occluded by the thumb and thus invisible. How did you manage to touch the screen but not occlude the cursor?</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if there was a CURSOR_SUPPRESSED message when I touched the screen but it may very well be.</p>

		<p>@Sven2 &#8211; Were you running the hook program at the time ?</p>
<p>Reading Raymond&#39;s explanation I would expect the CURSOR_SUPPRESSED flag to be set if you occluded the cursor with your finger or a pen. &nbsp;Perhaps you didn&#39;t completely occlude the cursor.</p>
<p>However, I notice that you mention you were testing with your thumb, which being neither a finger nor a pen you would not reasonably expect to result in the flag being set, whether or not you have occluded the cursor.</p>
