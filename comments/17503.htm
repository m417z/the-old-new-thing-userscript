		<p>Editoral Note: There seems to be a word or two missing from the following sentence fragment: &#8220;For example, the bitmap is not one that under your control&#8221;. &nbsp;Perhaps it should read &#8220;For example, the bitmap is not one that is under your control.&#8221;</p>
<p>This seems like the start of another series. &nbsp;I&#8217;m excited!</p>

		<p>Tom: do you really think these posts are published here for proofreading? &nbsp;If the code doesn&#8217;t compile, maybe that&#8217;s worth highlighting, but the three typos in the text are somewhat inconsequent.</p>

		<p>Maybe he inserted the typos on purpose just to piss you off:</p>

		<p>It would be difficult to get me angry over a post in this blog, for I am not one of those so frequently taunted by the Nit-picker&#8217;s Corner. &nbsp;Raymond has provided excellent information on this blog for more than five years; I am simply seeking to marginally improve the quality of his posts for posterity. &nbsp;Besides, Raymond should be used to this type of constructive criticism &#8212; he had an editor for the book he wrote, did he not?</p>
<p>And I stand by my later comment: I&#8217;m excited by the prospect of another series!</p>

		<p>Last time I had to do this programatically, I just did an RGB-&gt;YUV conversion and used the Y values. Happened again recently, and I said the simple solution was to use the RGB-&gt;YUV hardware in planar mode&#8230;</p>

		<p>I used to do this kind of thing a lot.</p>
<p>I noticed using the NTSC color coefficients (.30 Red, .56 Green, .11 Blue) (nitpick&#8211;these are approximate values) results in the blue parts of an image becoming very dark (that darned .11 coefficient).</p>
<p>I found I got better results with </p>
<p> (2*Red+4*Green+Blue)/7</p>
<p>or</p>
<p> (Red + 2*Green + Blue)/4</p>
<p>If you dig into the NTSC standard of 1953, there really isn&#8217;t much motivation for using .30,.59,.11</p>
<p>It&#8217;s popular because it is a clear answer to &#8216;what coefficients should be used&#8217;, not because it&#8217;s valid in domains far removed from its original application.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve always wondered why Red gets a higher coefficient than Blue &#8211; always seemed the oppsite to me. Maybe it&#8217;s just my red-green color blindness.</p>

		<p>Jonathan, that is probably the case. I&#8217;ve once run a lot of ‘perceived brightness’ tests where I juxtaposed solid colours and greys and I must say that on my LCD the coefficients are approximately correct. Of course not all people are identical, and so on and so forth, but I think the coefficients given are close enough and I can see the benefit of always getting the same result when you someone for a greyscale version of something. [Note: the coefficients as I read them are .299, .587 and .114 B, but after the second decimal place no one gives a damn.]</p>

		<p>@hexatron: this is quite a big can of worms. For starters, adding scaled components is by no means the only method of doing grayscale conversion, though it is the most convenient.</p>
<p>The values Raymond uses are the &quot;popular&quot; values, indeed based on NTSC, and thus technically wrong as the sRGB color space isn&#8217;t the NTSC color space. But because most computer screens are woefully miscalibrated (based on what people think are &quot;nice&quot; colors rather than accurate ones) and the result doesn&#8217;t need to appear on paper, getting the values &quot;right&quot; is usually not that important. Using known coefficients is a better idea than just tweaking for whatever looks good on your screen, though, for the simple reason that people can at least see why you picked those values and what they&#8217;re supposed to accomplish, and because your screen is in all likelihood not representative of others.</p>
<p>Color is a bit like floating-point in that most people that have to deal with it are not experts on the subject and would prefer to pretend that everything can be managed with magic formulas and assumptions. Thankfully, color is not as critical as floating-point for most people, so this usually holds.</p>
<p>See also <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/687261/converting-rgb-to-grayscale-intensity" rel="nofollow">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/687261/converting-rgb-to-grayscale-intensity</a></p>
<p>And of course, none of this touches on Raymond&#8217;s central point, but then again there are far worse things to go off-topic about. :-)</p>

		<p>alexx: &#8220;return TRUE&#8221; quite obviously shouldn&#8217;t be there.</p>
<p>* Waits for somebody to get stuck at &#8220;8bbp&#8221; *</p>
