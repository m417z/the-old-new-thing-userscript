		<p>I recently learned all about this for the first time. So i was quite tickles when I already understood all the terminology.</p>
<p>A caveat for anyone using direct annotation. It&#8217;s not a piece of accessible metadata that you can set and then not have to worry about. You have to be sure to destroy it when the window is destroyed. This also gets hairy when the visual control framework happens to need to destroy and recreate the window handle out from underneath you. You&#8217;re going you have to be sure to hook every time every underlying window handle is destroyed and recreated: and destroy and recreate your direct annotation.</p>
<p>Which is why in many ways it&#8217;s paradoxically easier to be responsible for every last accessible detail in your application by implementing IAccessible.</p>

		<p>Followed the link for Dynamic Annotation, and had trouble not parsing IAccIdentity as IAccidentIty.</p>
