		<p>This is really such a great series of articles. Much better than the tutorials or books which show trivial solutions to trivial problems. I really enjoy them. Thanks a lot for sharing your knowledge with us.</p>
<p>I discovered your site just recently, but I&#8217;m preparing myself to really compile the programs from all the steps up to now. Actually, I started from your first scratch program (in C) and I&#8217;m trying to follow the whole evolution. I&#8217;m slowly progressing because I&#8217;m also trying to check for meaningful comments.</p>
<p>And please ignore the low count of comments for the last few articles. I&#8217;m sure there are more people learning from all of them, even when they don&#8217;t comment.</p>

		<p>I agree, great series.</p>
<p>One thing that came to mind though &#8211; Won&#8217;t the application become quite unresponsive if the dictionary is large? What happens if the user types while the application is in refiltering?</p>

		<p>Try running the program &#8211; it&#8217;s quite responsive. It was this instant filtering that first impressed my colleague Ben, and it was his enthusiasm for the program that prompted me to turn it into a series.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s why, after doing several rounds of comparisons of desktop search software, i always come back to X1 / yahoo search: instant filtering of the listbox which contains the list of ALL the files on my drive, more than &gt;500k, for every typed characters! it has many rough edges, but the instantenous response is impressive (not to mention that it has also instanenous *preview*, on the right-side half of the window). it seems they&#8217;ve implement owner-drawned controls &#8211; and probably haven&#8217;t read your blog &#8211; they don&#8217;t behave very well with minimize / maximize / show-desktop etc.</p>
