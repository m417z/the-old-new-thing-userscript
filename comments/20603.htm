		<p>There is a legitimate use for this: some system don&#8217;t differentiate between lower-case and upper-case for passwords, mainly as a usability gesture for exactly this same reason.</p>
<p>(And, the system has to work on all Windows revisions or on all OS, so they couldn&#8217;t rely on the balloon to help users.)</p>

		<p>Only do this if you definitely want to suppress all balloons. &nbsp;Otherwise Windows 7 might add an extra IME balloon, which you&#8217;ll swallow against the will of the user. &nbsp;And then we&#8217;ll have *another* workaround to deal with.</p>

		<p>Pierre: Those systems are broken, and should be fixed. If they don&#8217;t allow lowercase/uppercase characters in password, they probably also don&#8217;t allow punctuation and most likely also have a really short maximum password length (like 8 chars.)</p>
<p>I hate those programs, because, gasp, I actually *want* to use strong passwords. They should let me.</p>

		<p>The balloon I *really* want to suppress is the &quot;You can continue to work while I download your update&quot; one. I know that, I don&#8217;t need to be reminder for every update. Now, can I have a checkbox that says &quot;don&#8217;t show this dialog again?&quot;</p>

		<p>I think that the control should convert all characters to uppercase when the balloon gets swallowed. The only good reason to disable the balloon is because your passwords are case insensitive. If you don&#8217;t remove the case information when the balloon is swallowed, some programmer somewhere will create a case-sensitive password box without warning balloon, yielding frustrated users whose passwords don&#8217;t work because they didn&#8217;t get warned about their capslock as expected.</p>

		<p>Even if it could tell it was subclassed, I wouldn&#8217;t want it. &nbsp;What if the password itself you&#8217;re entering is lowercase or mixed-case? &nbsp;Generally I don&#8217;t like when changing one little thing changes a bunch of seemingly unrelated styles (see also: &nbsp;the way that the button style on tab controls changes the way that keyboard focus works &#8212; I would have thought it was just a visual change). &nbsp;And anyway, that&#8217;s got poor localization. &nbsp;Some languages have multiple lowercase letters that map to a single uppercase letter. &nbsp;Making them unconditionally uppercase would reduce the security of such passwords (lowercase-only has similar difficulties).</p>
<p>Maybe the programmer has some other affordance for caps lock &#8212; a status bar or something else. &nbsp;Maybe even their own custom balloon tip that&#8217;s themed to fit their app (having decided that, for whatever reason, the standard Windows style guidelines do not apply to them &#8212; maybe they want to add a &quot;do not show me again&quot; checkbox to the tooltip like mentioned above). &nbsp;Maybe it&#8217;s just part of one of those strange shareware minigames (in which case it probably falls under Raymond&#8217;s &quot;perhaps you want to confuse your user&quot;). &nbsp;Maybe the shift key is broken and you don&#8217;t want to clue anybody looking over the shoulder into what characters are capitals because you can afford programmer time but not a new keyboard. &nbsp;Hmm&#8230;I&#8217;m having trouble stretching further than that.</p>

		<p>I could quite see myself omitting the balloon tip for the word &quot;CAPS&quot; next to the text box being shown, as the balloon tip is quite distracting, and too long-winded for what it needs to communicate.</p>

		<p>Steve D: On Vista, go to Control Panel -&gt; Regional and Language Options, then on the Keyboards and Languages tab, click the &quot;Change keyboards&#8230;&quot; button. Then, on the Advanced Key Settings tab, under &quot;To turn off Caps Lock&quot; check &quot;Press the SHIFT key&quot;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty buried and non-intuitive, but the option is there. I&#8217;m pretty sure it was always off by default, as well&#8230;</p>

		<p>But what if I have a password where I WANT everything to be in caps? For a time I did, and hitting caps lock as the first and last key strokes was effectively part of my password. It would disguise what I was typing from anyone watching, but the giant balloon gave away the secret, besides being utterly annoying.</p>

		<p>@Wound-Most keyboards I&#8217;ve seen have a LED indicator that lights up when you press CAPS. How did you get around that? If someone really wanted your password that wouldn&#8217;t be too difficult to notice. I guess there is always tape. :-)</p>

		<p>I answered this question once in the same way, but I added that you probably don&#8217;t want to do this even if your system uses case-insensitive passwords. It&#8217;s just a good idea to drill it into users that passwords are case-sensitive, and just because you&#8217;ve got one of those 70s holodover systems where they&#8217;re not doesn&#8217;t mean that suppressing the message is a good idea. Just pretend passwords *are* case-sensitive; if enough people believe it and act like it you&#8217;ve got a better chance of making it a reality some day.</p>
