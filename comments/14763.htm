		<p>Congratulations on making the ride, even if it kicked your butt. It&#8217;s a little early for organized rides up here in the Northeast; the earliest one I&#8217;ve ever participated in was a Five Borough Ride around NYC a couple of years ago &#8212; this year&#8217;s version is May 2nd, two months away. I generally look to the end of March as the starting point of my riding season. I&#8217;ve done some riding in Oregon, and hope some day to do some in Washington as well.</p>

		<p>That brings up the question: Just how do you get to work? Bike, car, public transport, helicopter, compatibility shim?</p>

		<p>How chilly was Chilly?</p>
<p>Also, a small typo: &#8220;where they were nearly read to resume the ride&#8221;</p>

		<p>This was my first time in a group ride, but I have been riding to work by bicycle 2-3 times a week for the past couple years.</p>
<p>Like you, I was slower than my friends, generally speaking, but not too far behind them as to be annoying to them. &nbsp;We&#8217;re trying to get prepped to do the STP this year, and this was a good &quot;quiz&quot; to see our strengths and weaknesses and where to train harder.</p>
<p>I missed the wine tasting too &#8211; I&#8217;ll put that in the log book for next year!</p>
<p>Nate</p>

<p>I now have a vision of Raymond riding to work on a compatability shim. &nbsp;Cheers :D</p>

		<p>Hi:</p>
<p>You say you lost precious time because of a flat. Why was time so precious? If you do it at your own pace, take breaks, make new friends, enjoy the scenery and food, you will have much more fun. Sounds like you sacrificed that and knocked yourself out to catch up with your group. If it&#8217;s no fun, you will not want to ride long-term. Glad you were on the ride on the most beautiful day!</p>

		<p>I also made the ride this year. It was my first time and I really enjoyed it. The nice temps didn&#8217;t hurt. Great people and a great event.</p>
