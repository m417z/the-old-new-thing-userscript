		<p>Nice anecdote :)</p>
<p>A few years ago my wife and I binge watched all of the Seinfeld episodes. &nbsp;It&#39;s amazing how many of the story lines couldn&#39;t hold up today simply because mobile phones are now ubiquitous. &nbsp;I guess the (almost literally) &quot;brick&quot; phones were available at the time.</p>

		<p>I can sympathize. &nbsp;I have been in conversations with people who keep looking at their cell phone. &nbsp;Once, I finally told a friend &quot;I will come back when you have time to give me your attention&quot;.</p>
<p>I am one of those rare programmers who keeps up with cutting-edge technology, but thankfully, my job doesn&#39;t require me to carry a cell phone. &nbsp;And I don&#39;t WANT to carry a cell phone, so I don&#39;t own one. &nbsp;If people want to talk to me, they can call me at home or at work. &nbsp;If I&#39;m not there, leave a message. &nbsp;If I&#39;m elsewhere, nothing is urgent enough to bug me about.</p>
<p>(An almost-joke: &nbsp;Someone once said &quot;What if someone you love is rushed to the hospital?&quot; &nbsp;I was tempted to answer &quot;Well, I&#39;m not a doctor, so I can&#39;t help.&quot; &nbsp;As I said, it was almost a joke. &nbsp;We got along for centuries without being tethered to cell phones.)</p>

		<p>I&#39;m sure it was on this blog that I saw this tip that if someone is overrunning in a meeting room that you&#39;ve booked for your meeting: &nbsp;Rush in sit down and say &quot;sorry I&#39;m late&quot;, which may give them a gentle hint that they shouldn&#39;t be there any more. &nbsp; </p>

		<p>It&#39;s a wonder that, after writing this blog *daily* for *twelve* years, Raymond has only repeated stories and topics *twice*. *Twice* in over 3000 articles. Wow. I know I wouldn&#39;t be able to do that.</p>

		<p>Unrelated, but I saw Tomorrowland yesterday. &nbsp;Halfway through the movie, an audience member&#39;s phone rang several times, although softly as it was in her purse.</p>
<p>About two minutes later, the phone rang *again*. &nbsp;The entire audience (which was pretty small), swiveled to look at the woman who was starting to paw though her purse again.</p>
<p>And then a character in the movie answered his mobile phone.</p>
<p>The entire audience broke out laughing. &nbsp;The danger of using default phone rings&#8230;</p>

		<p>That&#39;s why sometimes I think having conference room in area that has poor phone signal strength is nice idea.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been in a company that has conference room at location that the signal strength is barely enough to allow that phone ring, but you&#39;ll neither be able to listen or answer the call clear enough. So you&#39;ll either ignore the call or excuse yourself out the meeting to take it.</p>

		<p>Some rude executives/managers will even motion you to sit back down and continue waiting if you try to leave their office. &nbsp;On the plus side of rude behavior &#8212; &nbsp;it can sometimes be very informative to listen to their one-sided conversations.</p>
<p>And when I was in a service industry where clients were billed for our time on an hourly basis I never hesitated to charge my unproductive sit and wait time to the client of the partners who got their jollies by taking phone calls while subordinates were in their office. &nbsp;That way I didn&#39;t have to report idle hours on my timesheet and it was the rude partner&#39;s problem to try to collect the time.</p>

		<p>@DWalker: we also got along centuries without being tethered to landlines, telegraph, snailmail. If you don&#39;t want to be available for calls (and I can fully understand that &#8211; I always prefer text and email), it&#39;s easy enough to block them. Settings/Do Not Disturb. Why would anyone go back to reading only one book, only one magazine or only one newspaper during a commute? Or not being able to call a taxi from anywhere? Or not being able to visit a random city, pick a direction and walk wherever, without later having to pull out a paper map, figure out what street you&#39;re in and the best direction back to the hotel?</p>

		<p>@Boris:</p>
<p>While text and email have their uses I find they are poor substitutes for face to face conversation or a phone call. &nbsp;What could be resolved in a quick chat often takes multiple messages back and forth and the context of communication between two human beings is lost. &nbsp;Just my 2 cents.</p>

		<p>@Eric: on the other hand, face-to-face conversations and phone calls don&#39;t result in an automatic transcript. In terms of software design, I find them useful in case of emergencies or particularily thorny issues, where a number of questions need to be answered in short order.</p>

		<p>@Boris: &nbsp;If I have a cell phone and set it to Do Not Disturb, then why have it? &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;I almost never need to call a taxi from anywhere. &nbsp;I have a car. &nbsp;I drive during my 10-minute daily commute, and it&#39;s not fun to read and drive at the same time. &nbsp;YMMV.</p>
<p>Tethered to landlines? &nbsp;I want to be free, not tethered to anything. &nbsp;(That sounds new age-y.)</p>
<p>I do bring an e-book reader on trips, and that is a nice thing to have. &nbsp;I wouldn&#39;t want to read a book on a cell-phone-sized screen. &nbsp;Yes, many of the technological advances are nice, but I prefer not to be tethered to a cell phone, its contracts, and I don&#39;t have to worry about its charging state, etc.</p>

		<p>@DWalker: Ok, the public transportation where I live is so good that I don&#39;t need a car and the associated maintenance, and I don&#39;t really mind my commute of an hour there and back mainly because I have an iPhone 6 Plus (even the smaller ones are large enough to read books, since Kindle reformats the text to fit regardless of font size; screen size is a problem only with things like pictures).</p>
<p>Why have it? For me, primarily, so I can access the internet from most places without carrying a tablet-sized device. So I don&#39;t need to carry a separate GPS device in order to figure out where I need to walk or which combination of public transport to use. Perhaps I&#39;d want to take a photo of something unimportant instead of writing it down, or a photo and/or a video of a sight I run into. So I can access my bank account from most places and make payments by scanning QR codes. There are tons of use cases aside from mere phone calls, many of which I wasn&#39;t aware before switching from my Nokia 6230 in 2010.</p>

		<p>@Boris: &nbsp;(Sorry for the digression from the main subject.) &nbsp;Swiping a credit card, especially when you don&#39;t need to sign, is likely faster than turning on your phone, entering your phone password, starting the QR app, entering a password if necessary, and letting the store scan your QR code. &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;If you are smart, though, you&#39;ll be ready and the &quot;prep&quot; steps are already done. &nbsp;Pulling a plastic card out of my wallet probably takes less time (2 seconds total) than the prep to get a QR code showing on your phone. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t want to live in a place with an hour commute. &nbsp;I have done that and I&#39;m over it. &nbsp;But I know there are advantages to living in larger cities, as long as they have good public transportation like you say.</p>

		<p>@DWalker: what I meant was that I get my electronic bills (phone, TV, internet) with QR codes printed on them, which can be phone-camera-scanned order to input payment data into the mobile banking app. In absence of Apple Pay where I live, I do swipe/insert/use in contactless mode a separate credit card for other kinds of payments.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&#39;s not really off-topic if you consider that these days at least, in Raymond&#39;s situation, I would&#39;ve probably pulled out my iPhone while the other guy was talking. Back then, I might&#39;ve brought in my laptop if I had one.</p>
