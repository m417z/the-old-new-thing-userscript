		<p>Telstra, not Telestra. Also, naming a company without people guessing it beforehand? Is this a ONT first? :O</p>

		<p>Its name at the time was also &#8220;Telecom Australia&#8221;, hence Telstra (The name makes much more sense in that context).</p>
<p>If Telstra managed to amass so many votes, I wonder what another Australian government department, who we were told used to proclaim they had the largest WAN in the southern hemisphere for a while (May still be true; it&#8217;s huge), what they managed to get changed.</p>

		<p>I was actually there at the dawn of the third age of mankind, but I merely used Eudora with the email account supplied by my ISP, not MSN or similar services. Later I switched to Outlook Express.</p>
<p>(I also remember installing Windows 95 on my 386 just in time to catch GoldenEye in a movie theater.)</p>

		<p>I also used Eudora with my ISP&#8217;s mail account.<br />
After I helped the ISP debug the problem they were having with the Win95 sockets layer. All of their other users were using Trumpet Winsock, because Win95 was still in beta and I was the only subscriber they had who was crazy enough to use it.<br />
But even I wasn&#8217;t crazy enough to use it on a 386. I had a 486SX.</p>

		<p>Sure, but that was before I used a computer for anything serious, so it wasn&#8217;t like I had to make a cost-benefit analysis. I only had a 386, and it was Windows 95 of all things, with the fancy new desktop and whatnot, so&#8230; But yes, I do remember it being slowish.</p>
<p>(A couple of years earlier, I&#8217;d also upgraded from MS-DOS 3.3 to 5.0 on my IBM PC XT clone running at 4.77 MHz with 512 KB of RAM; was also advised that such an upgrade didn&#8217;t make much sense, but it was DOS 5.0 and it did work without any issues that I can recall.)</p>

		<p>The joke here is that the 486SX was the downmarket, pin-compatible version of the 486, with almost no redeeming qualities whatsoever. And because it was pin-compatible, it only had a 24-bit address bus, so system memory maxed out at 16 MB. It may as well have been a 386.</p>

		<p>And I screwed up the punchline. The machine I first used Win95 on was a Cyrix 486SLC, not a 486SX. The SX was actually more or less usable.</p>

		<p>If we&#8217;re talking about the same thing, Windows 95 actually came with something called &#8220;Exchange&#8221; (I think named InfoCenter in Beta) which was a combined Email, fax, and CompuServe client. IE 4 (I think) introduced Internet Mail (and News) which evolved into Outlook Express, Windows Mail, and Windows Live Mail. I don&#8217;t remember whether Exchange and MSIMN ever coexisted.</p>

		<p>&#8220;And psychologically, one user complaining 10,000 times is actually worth less than one user complaining once, because one user who complains 10,000 times starts to sound like a crackpot&#8221;<br />
I call this the xpclient effect.</p>

		<p>And by the time I was able to run that messenger app it was crashware (yes literally it destabilized the machine it was running on). Putting back the version from the Install CD would fix the machine but break messenger (protocol change?). We finally ended up with this procedure that would block the component from reinstalling itself (*not* like the Windows 10 allegations &#8212; we&#8217;re pretty sure it was merely the artifact of updates set to auto-approve simply not comprehending we&#8217;re repeatedly uninstalling this one).</p>

		<p>&gt;In a similar way, one user complaining 10,000 times is worth far less than 10,000 users complaining once each</p>
<p>It can depend on who the user is. Some special snowflakes have the ear of important people and you can get sucked into working round what ever the problem is on their windows install (which can&#8217;t be rebuilt or blamed) just so that they disappear.</p>
<p>A lot of problems only appear when you reach a critical mass of users. I&#8217;ve seen it happen so many times and you can usually predict the carnage when someone goes from a really small test rollout to instantly rolling out to all users.</p>

		<p>It was Telecom Australia. My first employer and I and a hundred other people were employed by them when they were 5 days old (5th July 1976). The Post Master General department was broken up and made companies &#8211; the Australian Telecommunications Commission trading as Telecom Australian and a sister organisation trading as Australia Post.</p>

		<p>Telstra got in bed with Sun fairly soon after this, so I guess it didn&#8217;t matter so much in the medium term.</p>
