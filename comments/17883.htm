		<p>My nextdoor neighbor is in the symphony and I ran into her while she was bringing home take-out. Does that count?</p>
<p>Incidentally, this same neighbor was in the same class as Josh Roman in music school.</p>

		<p>Thanks Raymond.</p>
<p>I finally understand exactly what my wife is feeling/thinking when I tell her work stories about programming. =)</p>

		<p>If I&#8217;m chuffed when Raymond Chen stops by my blog (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://tinyurl.com/nynt5y" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/nynt5y</a>), and Raymond is thrilled when he sits by some famous musician, who does the famous musician write home about? Obama? And who does Obama dream of meeting?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve had a subscription to the symphony off and on for the past decade (off for five years or so when I wasn&#8217;t living in Seattle) and although I&#8217;d recognize many of the players, I couldn&#8217;t name any of them on sight. &nbsp;Well done, sir.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s interesting, actually, because of course I&#8217;d recognize the Assads, or Paul Galbraith, or Ravi Shankar, and then we drop off the cliff into symphonic/progressive metal musicians.</p>
<p>A real question, though: &nbsp;did anyone else attend the symphony last weekend? &nbsp;While it was billed as Stravinsky&#8217;s Firebird and Mussorgsky&#8217;s A Night on Bald Mountain, I found that the contemporary piece (&quot;Concentric Paths&quot;, Thomas Ades) between them was amazing. &nbsp;The audience didn&#8217;t seem to care much for it, but if anyone else here was there I&#8217;d be interested to hear about it.</p>

		<p>I talk to my wife about programming all the time. Whenever she has trouble falling asleep, she asks me to tell her how something works.</p>

		<p>@Gabe</p>
<p>My wife once asked me to teach her programming in the evening. I did it for a week and every night she fell asleep in 5 minutes&#8230;!</p>

		<p>&quot;I was tempted to title this entry When out on the stage there arose such a clatter, but the dropped bow was such a small part of the article, and the clatter was relatively insigificant, so it would have been a bit of a misrepresentation.&quot;</p>
<p>Good thing you wrote the title after the message, because it is a summary (for later perusal) not an eye catcher.</p>
<p>Raymond, nice blog. Especially all the self-linking. Good stuff.</p>

		<p>Hey Raymond, great post.</p>
<p>@Brian: I was at the sunday concert, the Ade&#8217;s piece was technically brilliant but not my cup of tea</p>

		<p>The question is, does Elisa Barston&#8217;s blog say &quot;After the symphony we went to the Union as usual, and we happened to find ourselves sat next to Raymond Chen, the world famous computer programmer&quot;?</p>
<p>It ought because you win a Google fight 75,500 to 747, and a Bing fight 15.3 million to 671.</p>

		<p>You should say hello, and tell them that you really enjoyed the concert. If you&#8217;re polite, I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d be happy to chat. I&#8217;m always happy for people to come up to me after a gig&#8230; &nbsp;but often they don&#8217;t want to in case they think they&#8217;re being a pain.</p>

		<p>@SamualJack: Obama dreams of meeting himself of course. Have you seen the ego on that guy?</p>
<p>&quot;We are the ones we have been waiting for.&quot;</p>

		<h1>&quot;The rehearsal ends promptly at 12:30. Right in the middle of a phrase, boom, everything stops. Union rules.&quot;</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m a supernumerary[1] for the Indianapolis Opera, and it can be a bit disorienting when, as the drama reaches its peak, the music goes from full orchestra to rehearsal piano.</p>
<p>On a similar note, it&#8217;s not unusual for principal cast members to sing quietly during early rehearsals to save their voices. It&#8217;s odd to watch an opera singer, trained to fill a concert hall with her voice, all but whisper a great aria.</p>
<p>[1] Latin for &quot;extra.&quot; No, really.</p>
