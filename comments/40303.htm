		<p>Interesting, but the part about hard disks can&#8217;t be true.  I don&#8217;t think anybody ran Windows from floppy disk; installed from floppy, yes, but run?  I don&#8217;t think so.  I know I had a hard disk then, and I wasn&#8217;t rich. I had a whopping 30 meg at that time.<br /></p>

		<p>&quot;To save valuable seconds, dialog boxes are created initially hidden and all typeahead is processed while the dialog stays hidden.&quot;</p>
<p>What happens if a second, nested dialog box is displayed as a result of a certain typed-ahead key? Does the first dialog box stay hidden while the second dialog box is displayed?</p>

		<p>This article (<a target="_new" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/printerFriendly/articles/Platforms.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/printerFriendly/articles/Platforms.html</a>) says that Windows used to have a runtime you could bundle with your app, so the user did not need to have Windows installed. I could easily see someone in 1986 running an app like that directly from a floppy.</p>

		<p>What I want to know is how did dialog boxes work in a window manager that didn&#8217;t allow overlapping windows?</p>

		<p>Windows 1.0 did support overlapping windows, as long as they were dialog boxes. You couldn&#8217;t overlap your frame window. (Not for any technical reason; was just the way they wanted to &quot;look&quot;.)</p>

		<p>The &quot;killer app&quot; for Windows 1.0 was Adobe PageMaker. Excel came shortly thereafter.</p>

		<p>Actually Pagemaker and Excel were the killer app for the MacIntosh.  They were later ported to Windows.</p>
<p>IIRC, there really was no &quot;killer app&quot; for Windows.  Windows 1.0 and 1.1 sold a modest couple of thousand units a month.  Windows 386 (Windows 2.0) helped sales because they added the ability to run multiple DOS applications simultaneously (the functionality to run multiple old applications was there but it only worked well enough to run multiple GWBasic applications simultaneously), but it wasn&#8217;t enough to make a dent.</p>
<p>But the world changed when Windows 3.0 shipped.</p>
<p>Windows 3.0 added two major features:<br />
<br />    1) Support for 286 protected mode.  This meant that applications suddenly were able to take advantage of more than 640K of memory (ok, with LIM Expanded memory they could limp using more but protected mode busted things wide open).<br />
<br />    2) Support for more than 16 color displays.</p>
<p>I remember wandering over to ask Aaron Reynolds some questions about Windows 2.0 for some Lan Manager 2.0 stuff I was working on and he, David Weise and Ralph Lipe gave me a quick demo of the stuff they were working on for Windows 3.0.  My only comment to them after seeing this was &quot;Steve&#8217;s going to kill you guys, you know that, right?&quot;.</p>
<p>Remember, at the time Microsoft and IBM were focused like laser&#8217;s on OS/2.  ALL of our operating systems efforts were going into OS/2 (there was another side project called NT OS/2 in the works but it wasn&#8217;t significant at the time).  Windows (and DOS) were complete and total afterthoughts.</p>
<p>And here were these guys working on a version of Windows that was going to totally blow everyone away.  Steve was going to have a total cow when he heard that they had an OS/2 killer in the works.  And pretty much, that&#8217;s exactly what happened once they shipped (I don&#8217;t know about the Steve having a cow, but I do know about the OS/2 killer).</p>
<p>All of a sudden, Windows stopped being a toy and became an honest-to-goodness viable system.  Without any new applications for it, sales suddenly spiked into the millions of units per month (for some reason the number ten million units a month sticks in my mind).</p>
<p>&quot;And the rest was history&quot;&#8230;.</p>
<p></p>

		<p>PageMaker was actually called Aldus PageMaker in those days, because it was developed by a company named Aldus.</p>
<p>When Adobe acquired Aldus in 1994 (near the end of the Windows 3.x era), they rebranded the current version (5.0) as Adobe PageMaker. The first version of PageMaker released exclusively under the Adobe name was 6.0.</p>

		<p>I used to run Word 1.x which came bundled with a runtime version of Windows. Windows 3.1 rocked because it had TrueType support and you could run DOS boxes in a window!</p>

		<p>Yeah, I can remember Pagemaker seemingly including a runtime of Windows/286.  IIRC it took up 1-2 floppy disks, and was required for Pagemaker to run.</p>
