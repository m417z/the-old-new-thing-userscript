		<p>Hehe, I&#8217;m Swedish and I&#8217;ve been around the world and eaten things most people are disgusted by, but the most disgusting thing I&#8217;ve ever eaten is the rancid herring. Still I even gave it a second chance&#8230;but no, it&#8217;s not for me.<br />
And what do you mean we would succumb under the Danes? We haven&#8217;t lost a war against the Danes since 1613. ;)</p>

		<p>The swedish military service is not compulsory, but the draft tests (m&#246;nstring) are. Some are not accepted due to their physical or mental health, others get a placement but no training (such as me, my reason to skip it was the university), others get a training ranging from 230 days and upwards depending on rank and type of service.</p>
<p>Just to bring up the part about the Danes, large part of southern Sweden used to belong to Denmark, so we won the last time&#8230; :o)</p>

		<p>Surstr&#246;mming tastes ok, but the smell is awful.</p>

		<p>I thought eating the surstr&#246;mming was just an excuse to drink beer and aquavit ;)</p>

		<p>Well, that was the consensus military assessment of Sweden vs. Denmark when I talked to some students who had just completed their military service. They did neglect to offer me any herring, so maybe they were just Danes in disguise.</p>

		<p>Hey! Denmark could kick Sweden&#8217;s a** anyday! Darn herring-eating freaks.. ;-)</p>
<p>The closest thing Denmark and Sweden has been to a war in the last 400 years or so is the soccer-matches we used to have every year or so.</p>
<p>The Swedes may think they won the last one.. The truth is we let them win so we wouldn&#8217;t have to pay maintenance for our vacation-resort.. ;-)</p>

		<p>One of my Swedish collegues (let&#8217;s call him Jonas) told me a funny story about his military service days. Here&#8217;s how the story goes:</p>
<p>The Swedish military decided to have a &quot;War game&quot; in, of all places, Djurgarden in Stockholm. Jonas was in charge of a light unit consisting of one or two armored vehicles. The outcome of the war game was already pre-decided but Jonas and the other soldiers decided that it would be fun to not play by the rules. They proceeded to &quot;capture&quot; the Gamla Stan and refused to play by the rules. Evidently the brass was not amused.</p>
<p>I think I remember Jonas mentioning a comment from one of his commanders who said that Sweden wouldn&#8217;t last 5 minutes if an invasion occurred.</p>

		<p>Slightly less than 200, actually.  That&#8217;s how Norway became Swedish (more or less) for about a 100 years.</p>
