		<p>What does &quot;lost&quot; mean here exactly ?</p>
<p>I guess It can&#8217;t be &quot;lost all source codes including backups&quot;, since the window class for the displays (AND some frames) is &quot;DavesFrameClass&quot;&#8230;</p>

		<p>To be honest, while the old one is &quot;kinda cool retro&quot; the new one looks better.</p>
<p>And I&#8217;m assuming &quot;lost&quot; means that it was removed from the source for future versions.</p>

		<p>@Medinoc: probably that it&#8217;s no longer called that in Windows Vista.</p>
<p>Task Manager thankfully got quite a big overhaul so some of the stats are no longer (quite so) misleading.</p>

<p>Nope, it&#8217;s an 8-segment LED. &nbsp;Notice that the middle horizontal bar on the 3 doesn&#8217;t go all the way across. &nbsp;That requires 2 segments in the middle bar, not just 1.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m more surprised it has a windows class. I&#8217;d expect TaskManager to bypass quite a few OS layers, because it&#8217;s the OS component you need when things start to misbehave. I.e. when an app starts using 100% CPU or starts trashing the disk, or starts creating thousands of windows, Ctrl-Alt-Del should not try to start another app. Instead, I&#8217;d expect a component that&#8217;s already loaded to tell the graphics layer it needs a few pixels, the scheduler it needs a CPU core, and to draw directly. That suggests to me an implementation as part of CSRSS</p>

		<p>The trouble with 25-VII-2007 is that it doesn&#8217;t confuse anyone because it&#8217;s unambiguous. That is boring. 11/9/2001, on the other hand, confuses the hell out of dim colonials who think it means 9 November.</p>
<p>[Note that the bombers who blew up London ostensibly on Islamist grounds the day after Paris lost out to London on staging the 2012 Olympics chose the date 7/7 to promote international harmony and understanding].</p>

		<p>Thanks for this insightful post Raymond, since the first day I installed XP back in 2002, I always wondered why the LED-digits had disappeared from the Task Manager.</p>
<p>I originally thought it was because there was not enough space to display all the digits on a computer that would have a lot of RAM (pre-XP shows the commit charge in kilobytes, XP and later shows them in megabytes).</p>

		<p>@Raymond &#8216;Somewhat paradoxically, many Arabic-speaking countries don&#8217;t use Arabic numerals! They use Indic numerals.&#8217;</p>
<p>And to add to the confusion they don&#8217;t use Indic numerals in India. They use Devanagari numerals. At least when they&#8217;re using Hindi and not English.</p>

		<p>There was a method behind the madness, actually.</p>
<p>If I remember correctly (and it was 10+ years ago, so its a little hazy), someone on the Win3 or User teams thought it would be clever and efficient for the Group box to paint itself during WM_ERASEBACKGROUND instead of during WM_PAINT. &nbsp;This meant that regardless of where you had clip children turned on, the only way to get a group box to paint was to let it obliterate the controls within it first.</p>
<p>I hate flicker. &nbsp;I had three criteria for taskmgr, which is that it should never, ever crash, it should never flicker during resize, and it should stay under 100K total. &nbsp;Hence, I wound up subclassing the group box to make it do what I thought was correct, and you get a taskmgr without resize flicker. &nbsp;Putting my name in the window class was not particularly creative, but this was before profanity was discouraged in the source code even, so it wasn&#8217;t that outrageous.</p>
<p>Now, if you look at the pages that were added after I left MSFT, such as the Networking page, you can grab an airsickness bag, size the thing, and watch those pages flicker like its 1999. &nbsp;It&#8217;s also 163K now, but I digress.</p>
<p>If you notice the only other flicker you&#8217;ll see is in the property pages themselves (such as the tabs), but I wasn&#8217;t about to subclass the entire property page rendering.</p>
<p>While I&#8217;m waxing poetic about taskmgr, some other trivia:</p>
<p>The ASSERT that included my (old) home phone number was a bit of hubris and a genuine attempt to find a bug that was really hard to repro. &nbsp;About once every trillion cpu cycles the sum of the CPU times would exceed 100. &nbsp;The kernel team said it was my bug, and I of course was certain that it wasn&#8217;t. &nbsp;So I put my home phone number in there so that no matter the time or place, I could debug it if it ever occurred. &nbsp;As a result I was able to prove it was a kernel book keeping bug, not a taskmgr bug, they fixed it, and the assert should have come out. &nbsp;But it didn&#8217;t. &nbsp;In the next eight years, though, no one ever called after that.</p>
<p>Taskmgr was actually written as a piece of shareware, but at the last minute I asked &quot;The Other Dave and Mark&quot; if I could put it in the build, and given the task list thingy we had inherited from the Win95 shell was less than useful, they gladly agreed.</p>
<p>The LED numbers were cool in their day, but of course we all outgrew them. &nbsp;At that time NT was not particularly localizeable anyway. &nbsp;We had a whole team, such as the NT-J team, to port it to another language (like Japanese in that case, which you can see in some old Arnold movie). &nbsp;So there was the presumption that for other languages they&#8217;re just replace it with text.</p>
<p>Taskmgr was written in C++, but that required picking up the CRT. &nbsp;That would have hurt the size, so instead I figured out how to simulate the linker&#8217;s init code (that calls static contructors and so forth), thus keeping the size down instead of linking in the CRT.</p>
<p>In aid of the &quot;never crash or hang&quot; mantra, any time taskmgr calls an external DLL of questionable quality it dynamically loads it, and if I recall, calls out inside a try/except, sometimes from a separate thread so that taskmgr keeps on chugging. &nbsp;You might munge the state of shell32.dll, for example, and might even munge your own process, but it does avoid the vast majority of problems. &nbsp;If you&#8217;ve ever waited for the Start/Run dialog in Win95, it avoids that.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s all I have to say about that.</p>

		<p>Actually, when I wrote it, I forced taskmgr up to &quot;High&quot; priority (I wanted realtime, but there are various reasons not to do that).</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s not doing that in Vista, it might be because its not run with escalated rights and hence can&#8217;t bump its own priority. &nbsp;That&#8217;s just a guess.</p>

		<p>I guess because of #11 (not zero indexed) his name was really Dave. I understood that when you are mocking, names are not replaced whereas when you are teaching a lesson, names are anonymized. In what category does this posting fall and does this category always imply that names are not anonymized?</p>
<p>And who is so stupid and uses his name for such a feature?</p>

		<p>I haven&#8217;t seen taskmgr crash on Vista yet, but they&#8217;ve partied on it for years since I left.</p>
<p>To Steve: &nbsp;as for who was so stupid to use their name in a feature (actually, a Window class), I guess that&#8217;s me.</p>

		<p>Since we&#8217;re all sharing fond memories of task manager&#8230;</p>
<p>One of the devs who worked on taskmgr after Dave left sat accross the hall from me. &nbsp;One day he got a 64-proc computer because he had a bug that task manager could only display up to 32 processors (64 being way-beyond belief when the code was written, I suppose). &nbsp;That was cool, seeing 64 CPU meters all chugging along. &nbsp;Of course, once he had fixed the bug, they took the machine away&#8230;</p>

		<p>64 processors? wow, most I&#8217;ve ever seen is 16, and even that made me giddy (it&#8217;s a dual quad core with hyper threading)</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  One of the devs who worked on taskmgr after Dave left sat accross the hall from me. &nbsp;One day he got a 64-proc computer because he had a bug that task manager could only display up to 32 processors (64 being way-beyond belief when the code was written, I suppose). &nbsp;That was cool, seeing 64 CPU meters all chugging along. &nbsp;Of course, once he had fixed the bug, they took the machine away&#8230;
</p></blockquote>
<p>How big was that thing, anyway (and how loud)? I have this image of a half rack of computer in my head.</p>
<p>Further off topic, with the 4&#215;4 stuff being available at a reasonable pricepoint, we&#8217;re getting closer to an affordable 64 way box.</p>

		<p>The most I ever had access to was a 4-proc back then. &nbsp;I actually thought the limitation on NT was 32 procs (a DWORD bitmask in a few of the relevant APIs).</p>
<p>Though only tested by simulation, even the earliest taskmgr should support an &quot;infinite&quot; number of procs. &nbsp;After some number (probably 16) it starts grouping CPUs into the same little graph (ie: pane 0 would be CPU0 and CPU16, etc).</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d just like to thank Davepl for that hard work: taskmgr has come to my rescue many times in the past when Explorer has been %@$&#163;ed too hard to respond to anything at all for a long period of time.</p>
<p>(Sadly, on my current XP installation at work it no longer updates: the process list is jammed on whatever was there when it opened. Somewhat bizarre, and no doubt not remotely Davepl&#8217;s fault, since it sounds as if he went to great pains to avoid exactly that problem!)</p>

		<p>&quot;How do you render characters U+0660 through U+0669 (٠.١.٢.٣.٤.٥.٦.٧.٨.٩) in an LED font?&quot;</p>
<p>You* could try emulating a 16-segment LED instead. Zero looks awkward, but 1-9 shouldn&#8217;t be a problem. 7 Would look more like Y than V, and 8 would be similarly odd upside-down, but it&#8217;s not like 4 ever looked entirely right in a 7-segment display.</p>
<p>Adding dots at each intersection (we don&#8217;t have to stick 100% to the classic display, it&#8217;s more about getting the look &#8211; as GregM pointed out, my nitpick was incorrect as the original splits the middle bar to make the 3 look better, which almost never happens with real LED displays) would allow indic 0 and a few more roman letters (e.g. lowercase i and j become possible)</p>
<p>And it would still be retro cool!</p>
<p>*Not actually you. This is idle speculation, and even if it weren&#8217;t, it would aimed at MS in general.</p>

		<p>I used to have access to a Unisys 32-way server in a previous life. It was about as big as a full rack, but it had redundent everything (just one of the power supplies was about as big as your average desktop PC).</p>
<p>I guess nowadays, though, with quad-core CPUs available, you could squeeze 32 &quot;CPU&quot;s into a much smaller space :-)</p>

		<p>Slightly off topic maybe but&#8230;</p>
<p>Mr. Chen, do you have any idea why Taskmanager (Windows XP) seems to not have a higher task priority than other running software?</p>
<p>End result being that if a application hogs the system it is very hard to get taskmanager up.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been curious why this behavior has not been improved/tweaked since XP was launched!</p>

		<p>Good article. &nbsp;For those interested, here is a very cool shot of taskmgr in action: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://cache.gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/6800.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://cache.gizmodo.com/assets/resources/2006/08/6800.jpg</a> :)</p>
<p>I do notice that even though the networking tab&#8217;s graph does flicker pretty badly, according to Spy++ it *is* using DavesFrameClass. What would be different that would cause it to flicker so badly?</p>

		<p>Definitely cool to hear from Dave himself. Might I suggest, Raymond, that when doing history posts such as these in future, you try contact the original author(s) so they can add their commentary as well? Assuming that that&#8217;s not what happened in this case. ;)</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  &gt; Taskmgr was actually written as a piece of shareware, but at the last minute I asked &quot;The Other Dave and Mark&quot; if I could put it in the build, and given the task list thingy we had inherited from the Win95 shell was less than useful, they gladly agreed.

<p>I am amazed how many the best things in software grew out of pieces of passion, that would never have made it through the &quot;accounting firewall&quot;.</p>

		<p>Nitpicking dave about &quot;subclassing&quot; the group box : This looks more like superclassing, doesn&#8217;t it ?</p>
<p>About the priority, for Roger H&#229;gensen : The task manager IS on high priority, but the shell is not. So, the task manager is slow to come up because Explorer is launching it in a separate process.</p>
<p>For Michiel : The problem with the window limit was explained some time ago: A process can only create 10000 windows out of 30000. Of course, if you start multiple instances of the GIMP, you *might* reach the limit&#8230;</p>

		<p>Davepl: Refresh speed is &#8216;normal&#8217;, hitting F5 *does* force an update &#8211; it&#8217;s just the periodic updates which aren&#8217;t firing. Stranger still, changing the frequency seems to have fixed it (even &#8216;normal&#8217; works properly now, when it didn&#8217;t before) &#8211; yet rebooting didn&#8217;t. Perhaps it was stuck on &#8216;Paused&#8217; internally, but not reflecting this in the menu, so changing the setting synced the two up again?</p>
<p>Medinoc: when launched from the SAK window or via shift-ctrl-esc, it&#8217;s winlogon.exe not explorer.exe which launches taskmgr.exe, and winlogon.exe has priority 13 on my system, against explorer.exe&#8217;s 8.</p>
<p>On multiple CPUs: thanks to HyperTransport, you don&#8217;t even need to cram them all into one box; a company demonstrated a system recently using external HyperTransport links between a couple of multiple-Opteron machines which made Windows see them as a single system, despite being in different cases.</p>
<p>Of course, if someone had been feeling cruel, they could have given the developer a copy of QEMU instead &#8211; IIRC it can emulate multiple CPUs without needing SMP hardware underneath. The performance would be terrible, but good enough to fix a Task Manager 64-CPU issue with!</p>

<p>Is this a complete virtualization package, or would you have to run it inside a virtual PC? Decent virt makes fixing all sorts of problems easy that were once painful and slow.</p>

		<p>Qemu is virtualization software, if that&#8217;s what you&#8217;re asking. &nbsp;This is the list of CPUs that it&#8217;s able to emulate (both to run a user-mode process that was compiled for that CPU on a Linux or OSX system that runs on a different CPU, and to host an entire OS, which is in an alpha state when run on Windows):</p>

		<p>I hate flicker too. &nbsp;But wouldn&#8217;t a flicker-free app be more likely to slog or fail in a stressed system due to the additional graphics back-buffering compared to the flicker-free version that blats to the screen as soon as it has something to blat.</p>

		<p>Yeah, the double-click to hide the frame elements was a bad idea. &nbsp;I actually did it because the other applets we had in the NT build at the time, such as the clock, had that &quot;feature&quot;, so I added it as well to be orthogonal with them. &nbsp;This was like 1995 though, so your Mom wasn&#8217;t using NT :-)</p>
<p>Before desktop widgets, it was also a way to make a little CPU graph and stick it in the corner of your window (if I recall, the minimum size resitriction is removed when in the frameless mode).</p>
<p>As to the person who asked about flicker-free being slower, not really. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not double or triple buffering anything, its just painting only what it needs to and in the right order. &nbsp;I guess it could actually work out faster, since by definition flicker happens (as opposed to tearing) when you paint the same area twice.</p>
<p>And for the person that said the shell runs at regular priority and hence on a crippled system can be slow to bring up task mgr, that only applies to the tray menu. &nbsp;I put the CTRL_SHIFT_ESC handling in winlogon itself so you weren&#8217;t dependent on the shell being alive to start taskmgr. &nbsp;You can have all the priority you like, but if its paged out to disk its not coming back in any faster just because its a higher priority (or at least not to my knowledge, maybe the vm system does&#8230;)</p>
