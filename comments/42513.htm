		<p>I looked it up in my state at some point, because it does sound neat to have that ability.  Easy, except that I&#8217;ve got plenty of other things to put $10,000 towards. ;)</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s much easier in Tx&#8230; when I got my notary certificate 2 years ago, all I needed to do was pay $75 to the state and send in a form that was notarized by someone else where I swore that I was not a criminal. No bond is required either&#8230; though, it is surely a good idea to have one backing you up. You don&#8217;t want to end up getting sued for doing something wrong! I&#8217;d say go for it&#8230; people give you a lot of respect when they find out you&#8217;re a notary.</p>

		<p>$10,000?  It&#8217;s much easier in NY.  I looked it up recently, having had the epiphany that it would be fun to be a notary public &#8211; just knowing that I had the power to notarize documents would be cool.  I like your friend.</p>
<p>In any case, it&#8217;s easy in NY.  You pass an exam, pay a $60 fee, and voila!  For $60, it&#8217;s probably worth it, though I wouldn&#8217;t put down $10,000 for it.</p>

		<p>I think there might be easier ways, too.  When I worked at a credit union, I don&#8217;t think the notories needed the $10,000 bond &#8211; I think the credit union covered it.  But that *would* explain why they regulated the number of them pretty closely.  </p>
<p>I wanted to be a notary, but :: sniff :: they would only let me be a lowly teller (well, they let me train employees and be the computer specialist, but no notary for me).</p>
<p>Which is probably why I defected&#8230;  :: cough ::  </p>
