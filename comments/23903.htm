		<p>Not to go off-topic, but I am somewhat annoyed by how NPR&#8217;s website serves data. &nbsp;Is it really cheaper to serve relatively high-bandwidth audio than it is to pay somebody to transcribe it and serve the low-bandwidth text files? &nbsp;They want $3.95 for a single transcript or $12.95 for a month (with a maximum of 10 transcripts per month). &nbsp;I guess NPR&#8217;s audience is used to listening to the programs, but I can read so much faster than they can talk.</p>

		<p>Oh, Oh, Oh! I have it, I know the answer</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.npr.org/transcripts/help_whycharge.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.npr.org/transcripts/help_whycharge.html</a></p>
<p>Well, not quite. &nbsp;That&#8217;s why they charge, which is fine. &nbsp;But still, Reader&#8217;s original question was why they produce audio at all and host it on the site rather than just transcribing it themselves and hosting low-cost text. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Probably has something to do with it being radio, I used a textbox for that one too.</p>

		<p>But transcription is a one-time cost. &nbsp;I guess it would depend on how much it costs them to get a show transcribed and how many people are downloading that show. &nbsp;At some point you would think that the cost of hosting audio for X number of people would be greater than the cost of transcription + hosting text for X number of people. &nbsp;But bandwidth is probably much cheaper than professional transcription, and I would guess that NPR is not popular enough to reach that threshold.</p>

		<p>I like the CBC for this reason, they usually offer both a text version (not just a transcription) and an audio version. &nbsp;Much more web friendly in my mind. &nbsp;Like at work where I get my news, no sound card/speakers. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Most programming is not &quot;off-the-cuff&quot;, so a script exists for it (even if only for the questions). As well, I am pretty sure it is much more labour intensive to edit and script the segment together than it is to transcribe it. I am also sure people spend time listening to the show to ensure it is legible and nothing untoward gets on the air (more hours spent).</p>

		<p>Or you could go to the source instead of trying to deal with NPR&#8217;s crappy second-hand version.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/06/Tampabay/You_order_grouper_wha.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.sptimes.com/2006/08/06/Tampabay/You_order_grouper_wha.shtml</a></p>
<p>Maybe one of these days a couple of guys from Stanford might write a program that keeps track of website content and can search for things like this.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think they&#8217;ll make money at it though.</p>
<p>Back to Raymond&#8217;s original subject: Here in Orlando there&#8217;s an &quot;Ale House&quot; restaurant that serves totally different fish for the fish&#8217;n&#8217;chips lunch special on Fridays.</p>
<p>You order it Monday-Thursday and it tastes like crap. Friday, it&#8217;s delicious. It&#8217;s different fish and a different batter.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve asked management and the waitstaff and they all insist it&#8217;s the same stuff. And I&#8217;m not the only one that&#8217;s noticed it&#8217;s different, either.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve not figured that one out.</p>

		<p>This is a strange quote:</p>
<p>&quot;Stea said the frozen fish cost $6.14 a pound and was labeled &quot;Gulf grouper&quot; on the invoice. The box had a bar code. Whoever phonied it up, &quot;fooled us good,&quot; he said.&quot;</p>
<p>So it has a bar code on it, and that somehow means it&#8217;s grouper? Am I missing an obvious connection here?</p>

		<p>If only there were a tool for automatically converting from speech to text that Reader could use to do his or her own conversion&#8230;</p>
<p>(yeah, yeah, existing e.g. closed captioning tools aren&#8217;t nearly as good as a professional transcriber&#8230; as if you really care)</p>

<p>They may also get their fish fresh on Fridays to prepare for the weekend rush. They may have a problem keeping their food fresh for a whole week.</p>

		<p>I guess this fits your blog&#8217;s title well since it is &quot;old&quot; news; I heard this on npr when it aired in 2006. New news about old things would be more interesting.</p>

		<p>The reason the restaurant is confused is that the box and the barcode are accurate&#8230; if the fish was grouper.</p>
<p>Since it wasn&#8217;t, the restaurant thought they bought grouper (the box said so, and the barcode matches those for grouper from the supplier).</p>
<p>So it isn&#8217;t that the restaurant sold cheaper fish intentionally, they paid full price &#8211; someone earlier in the supply chain did the swap. The supplier might not know, since they import and inventory based on the code (customers tend to frown upon opening packages to verify authenticity prior to sale).</p>

		<p>I was confused by this quote:</p>
<p>&quot;We buy our fish in 10-pound boxes and its says right on it &#8216;fresh frozen grouper&#8217; right on the box&quot;</p>
<p>What is &quot;fresh frozen grouper&quot;? Would not the very ACT of freezing it make it no longer &quot;fresh&quot;? By definition, something that is frozen is not fresh&#8230;</p>

		<p>It means &quot;was frozen immediately after capture&quot; as opposed to left out at room temperature.</p>
<p>The thing is, &quot;fresh&quot; can mean &quot;not undergone any spoiling&quot;, or can mean &quot;not been stored in non-amgbient conditions (which implies it is not suitable for long-term storage)&quot; &#8211; which is better depends on the food in question.</p>
<p>Bread never seems the same to me, if it&#8217;s been frozen. &nbsp;Conversely, fish which is frozen as soon as possible will spoil less and taste nicer, imo</p>

		<p>When bait and switch is literally applied to fish, you offer a juicy worm but give them a pointy hook.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s amusing that a page about bait and switch turned out to be a discussion of financial and ethical obligations of government-funded media.</p>

		<p>By coincidence, there was a cartoon on this subject in the New Yorker this week. A man in a shack with the sign &quot;Bait and Switch Shop&quot; is saying to a customer: &quot;I&#8217;m fresh out of night crawlers, but I can let you have this combination VCR/DVD player.&quot;</p>

		<p>Bait and Switch:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait_and_switch" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bait_and_switch</a></p>
<p>&quot;In retail sales, a bait and switch is a form of fraud in which the fraudsters lure in customers by advertising a product or service at an unprofitably low price, then reveals to potential customers that the advertised good is not available but that a substitute is.&quot;</p>
<p>So, this isn&#8217;t exactly Bait and Switch because customers never find out they&#8217;ve been &quot;switched&quot;.</p>
