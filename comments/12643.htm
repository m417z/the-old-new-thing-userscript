		<p>Actually Cocoa interfaces on Mac OS X, and Quartz as well, use the lower-left coordinate as the origin, which is an unbelievable pain. Perhaps one or two mathematicians were helped by this decision, but it&#39;s so incredibly counterintuitive to anyone else. Especially because we think from top to bottom, lay out controls, text etc from top to bottom. Worst decision they ever made.</p>

		<p>More History.</p>
<p>This &quot;origin&quot; issue was the formal pre-text for the great IBM/Microsoft divorce way back when OS/2 was just getting started. &nbsp;But what I remember most about the divorce was Bill Gates comments in PC Week about being done forever with IBM process development overhead.</p>
<p>Then there was the story about some famous DEC guy being hired to write MS&#39;s new operating system&#8230;</p>

		<p>It all depends on what you&#39;ve become accustomed to really. &nbsp;My first programming steps were on the BBC Micro, which used the bottom left as 0,0. &nbsp;So when I moved on to a PC later, I had to get used to the way QBASIC did it &#39;the wrong way&#39; at the top left.</p>
<p>If you start at the bottom left the GRAPHics work the same as a graph, which makes sense.</p>
<p>If you start at the top left the graphics work the same as we read, which also makes sense.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ll hazard the guess that our coordinate system was invented by physicists, as mathematicians usually don&#39;t care where the positive direction is. (And really, two dimensions? How boring!)</p>
<p>Much more annoying is the fact that CreateWindow (and many other functions) want their coordinates as two separate parameters instead of a POINT, so you can&#39;t just squeeze in a translation function.</p>
<p>Farnsworth you say? I can just imagine: “Good news, everyone! I&#39;ve just invented a device that let&#39;s you look at &lt;insert the Internet&#39;s major purpose here&gt; all day!”</p>
<p>Bonus question: Had they developed Windows in Fortran, would the screen be addressed in column-major order?</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t think there is much controversy about matrices. They are always top to bottom, left to right. Now vectors are a different story. If you come from computer graphics, you usually think of vectors as rows: (X, Y, Z). If you come from linear algebra, it is most often columns:</p>
<p>X</p>
<p>Y</p>
<p>Z</p>
<p>Neither is better than the other, you just can&#39;t mix the two. I once had to work on a code where the matrix system was assuming vectors as rows, and the quaternion system was assuming vectors as columns. Hilarity ensued! It wasn&#39;t long before I went berserk on the code and made it consistent.</p>

		<p>Unnecessary math background information: Vectors, as such, are neither rows nor columns. They are a set over a field which is closed under addition and scaling. As such, matrices, real numbers, as well as row and column vectors are <em>specific types</em> of vectors in different spaces, and the union of two vector spaces is, in general, not a vector space.</p>
<p>Let&#39;s not get into the difference between points in affine space and vectors.</p>
<p>And then there are those blasphemous numerical analysts who dare to multiply row and column vectors as if they are matrices to produce the standard scalar product or a symmetrical matrix. Heretics!</p>

		<p>The top-down habit may also inherit from the earliest scanners: fax machines, where it seems to be natural to insert the document top-first. The first faxes were so slow that it was useful to be able to start reading the document as it was being generated.</p>

		<p>When you display the contents of computer memory (using the console-mode debugging tools, for example), the values are displayed from top to bottom (and left to right in US English at least). &nbsp;I suppose that is an artifact of the console mode itself.</p>
<p>I had trouble when one computer science prof always drew a block of memory with address 0 at the lower left, because it seemed upside-down to me. &nbsp;It seems that half of the printed diagrams of memory blocks (in books, for exmaple) show address 0 at the lower left and half show 0 at the upper left.</p>
<p>Yes, an X-Y coordinate system in math (or book lernin&#39;) has (0,0) at the lower left, but for historical reasons, we (at least I) think of memory from the &quot;top down&quot;. &nbsp;I have no idea how computer memory, or graphics memory, actually maps onto the chips in the computer or the chips on the graphics card. &nbsp;Maybe we should map the coordinates of a computer display in the same way that the graphics memory chips hold the memory, if that&#39;s even possible. &nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>Interestingly, various disk defragmenting tools, which usually show the graphical map of disk blocks as a rectangle, show the &quot;start&quot; of the disk map in either the lower left or upper left corner. &nbsp;(There is at least one such tool that shows the map of disk blocks arranged in concentric circles just like a physical spinning disk is made&#8230;. of course, you have to ignore remapped blocks and the new-fangled solid-state disks.)</p>
<p>The moral, I suppose, is that there is no consistency; you just have to learn the conventions.</p>

		<p>I learned to program on a Timex/Sinclair 2068 (the US version of the ZX Spectrum), which had top-down coordinates for text and bottom-up coordinates for graphics. To make it even more fun, not only did it have 64:1 interleaving for the bits that said whether any particular pixel was foreground or background, it had a separate block of memory to say what the foreground and background were for each 8&#215;8 pixel block. There was also a generous overscan area to which you could assign one particular color.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.worldofspectrum.org/faq/reference/formats.htm#SCR" rel="nofollow">http://www.worldofspectrum.org/&#8230;/formats.htm</a> gives a better description, and <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/spectrum/loadingscreen.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.zx81stuff.org.uk/&#8230;/loadingscreen.html</a> has a Java applet that shows what it looks like to fill in the display file (frame buffer in today&#39;s parlance) in byte order (row 0, 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48, 56, 1, 9, &#8230;, 64, 72, &#8230; then all the colors).</p>

		<p>Why do Descartes-ian coordinate systems get plotted with y ascending up the page rather than down the page?</p>
<p>Probably so that &quot;z&quot; can ascend toward the viewer and obey the right-hand rule.</p>

		<p>Thank god the coordinates are 0 at top left. Imagine a display with 0,0 at lower left corner. Now show a document that doesn&#39;t fit on the display. Now the origin of your document depends on the display resolution! &nbsp;Now implement scrollbars. Good luck trying to make something logical/intuitive :)</p>

		<p>[But why does the cathode ray tube scan from top to bottom? Why not from bottom to top? -Raymond]</p>
<p>Could be because that&#39;s how you paint a wall using a paintbrush? If you start at the bottom you have to go back and correct runners, if you start at the top the problem takes care of itself. Lots of metaphors in design come from ancient habits. Just take the boosters for the space shuttle, fer&#39;instance&#8230; :-)</p>

		<p>There is another obvious alternative. Have the origin in the center.</p>
<p>That is, in a 640&#215;480 screen, coords go from -320,-240 to +320,+240.</p>

		<p>Of course, the “obvious alternative” combines the disadvantages of the top-down design with the disadvantages of the bottom-up design.</p>

		<p>Given a piece of lined paper, where would most people consider &quot;the first line on the page&quot; to be?</p>
<p>Now generalize to pixels.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>That would be a 641&#215;481 screen&#8230; using two&#39;s complement integer as a precedent I would suggest -320,-240 to +319,+239</p>

		<p>I once worked for a boss who had a strict rule that screens should be updated from top-left to bottom-right.</p>
<p>This is A Good Thing™ since [in my culture] this is the natural and expected Way Of Things™. &nbsp;This was not the reason for his rule however&#8230;.</p>
<p>Rather, he thought this meant the screen was being updated in the most efficient manner possible as it meant that the screen updates &quot;followed&quot; the path of the CRT gun updating the display.</p>

		<p>re Anon:</p>
<p>I once wrote a block-mode terminal emulator that output to a VT100 character-mode terminal. A major goal was to reduce the number of bytes of output (lines were slow back then), so my &#39;update&#39; algorithm started wherever the cursor happened to be, wrote to end of screen, then wrote the top half, ending up with the cursor back where it started. &nbsp;I think I saved a dozen or so bytes of output that way. I was very proud.</p>
<p>I had so many complaints about the &#39;weird&#39; update that I eventually gave in and did top-to-bottom writes.</p>

		<p>@dave: &nbsp;Reminds me&#8230; &nbsp;One old-world multi-user time-sliced system that ran on a mainframe used a swap disk to entirely swap in and out the memory space of the various users. &nbsp;Half the time, when it switched users, it would bring in the user whose turn was next, and half the time it would bring in whichever runnable user&#39;s swapped-out data was closest to where the swap disk&#39;s read-write head happened to be at that very instant. &nbsp;To minimize disk seeking. &nbsp;The algorithm worked pretty well. &nbsp;I thought it was an interesting algorithm.</p>
