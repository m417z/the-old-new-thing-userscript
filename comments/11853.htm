		<p>In your discussion of &quot;Up One Level&quot;, you mentioned &quot;[..]&quot; as if it was a fake entry introduced by the UI. &nbsp;But filesystems actually have an entry named &quot;..&quot; in each subdirectory, which links back to the parent directory, don&#39;t they? &nbsp;At least file enumeration functions pretend so. &nbsp;So since those old-style browsers displayed brackets around all directory names (note to readers: there weren&#39;t any icons in the list back then, so some method of distinguishing directories from files was really helpful).</p>
<p>In which case the special part is the feature that causes &quot;[..]&quot; to remove the trailing element of the path, instead of appending &quot;/..&quot;, which would have had the same result but look weird to the reader.</p>
<p>Of course, the fake entries for &quot;[-a-]&quot; and &quot;[-c-]&quot; to change to a different drive really were special.</p>

		<p>@yuhong2:</p>
<p>Raymond already noted the issue; also, you probably want to link to the Wingdings page ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.alanwood.net/demos/wingdings.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.alanwood.net/&#8230;/wingdings.html</a> ) rather than the Symbol page.</p>
<p>I would imagine the most correct (that is, compatible) solution would be to include a little folder icon as an image, rather than messing around with Wingdings or hoping that Firefox or Opera users have fonts that include a glyph for U+1F4C2 OPEN FILE FOLDER (which is very unlikely, because that symbol was added in Unicode 6 which only came out in October).</p>
<p>@Jeffrey Bosboom, Tergiver:</p>
<p>There used to be a print version of Technet Magazine, but not anymore: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc296584.aspx" rel="nofollow">technet.microsoft.com/&#8230;/cc296584.aspx</a></p>

		<p>Please Raymond, would you mind cleanly separating technology &amp; Microsoft-related links from other stuff when doing these link clearances?</p>
<p>Why did Windows 98 not launch task manager any more after double clicking in an empty area? Any way to make it do so like Windows 95?</p>
<p>Why is SysNative not available on XP x64? How to bypass file system redirection without doing it programmatically on XP x64?</p>
<p>While I personally like the decision to make Explorer window size a global setting, removing features is plain evil without going a checkbox option. Please stop removing features from Explorer. Windows 7 SP1 again changes the behavior of &quot;Restore previous folder windows&#8230;&quot;, doesn&#39;t it?</p>
<p>Will the Access-based Enumeration UI work on XP Professional x64 edition?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>It&#39;s a link clearance, not a research library. Windows 95 didn&#39;t launch Task Manager when you double-clicked a blank space either. There is no file system redirection on native x64 so the question &quot;How do I bypass file system direction&quot; is meaningless. Can the people who complain any time a feature is removed get in a room who say Windows is bloated with too many features? Then we can just see which group is left standing at the end of the day. Access Based Enumeration is a server feature. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>It seems that Backspace was changed to &quot;Back&quot; in the main Explorer listview pane, but is still &quot;Up&quot; in the tree view and common dialogs. I can understand why the tree view has the &quot;Up&quot; behavior, but why the inconsistency with the listview? Since a common file dialog looks mostly like an Explorer window, I would expect them to act the same.</p>

		<p>&quot;Backspace&quot;: More than one time I was fooled by this when I typed Backspace to delete a character in a text field in a web page, but didn&#39;t notice that this text field has not the focus for some reason.</p>
<p>For me, the Backspace key is bound to &quot;text editing&quot;, not to navigation.</p>

		<p>The Story of Restore:</p>
<p>This is a confusing read. I don&#39;t get it why someone at Microsoft thinks so complicated about such an easy thing like saving size and position of open windows on program exit. For the purpose of restoring the open windows and their size and position at the next login, it is sufficient to store the number of open windows, and then for each window (not folder!) the path, the size and the position.</p>
<p>There is no need to mangle this save+restore functionality with other scenarios. When a new Explorer window is opened by the user &quot;out of the blue&quot;, Explorer can use complete different information to position the new window. There is really no connection to the saving and restoration of the Explorer state at logout and login.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>In other words, you&#39;re saying that it&#39;s perfectly natural for Explorer to have two persistence models, one used for auto-restored windows and one for everything else. Some would argue that this is perfectly artificial. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Looks like there is a hotfix to add SysNative alias on XP x64.</p>
<p>&quot;Can the people who complain any time a feature is removed get in a room who say Windows is bloated with too many features? Then we can just see which group is left standing at the end of the day&quot;</p>
<p>That seems like a flawed approach to me. MS should be skilled enough to balance adding features yet make the OS run on current gen hardware (hint: Windows 7 is a step in the right direction but Vista wasn&#39;t). Then again neither of the two is because of dumbed down choices and loss of functionality.</p>

<p>The reasoning described in the article did not lead to a good solution, and your response also don&#39;t solve the problem.</p>
<p>In the first place, I as a user of the program Explorer want that the functionality under discussion really works. I (as a user) don&#39;t really care how many persistence models it needs to make it work as it should.</p>

		<p>(continued)</p>
<p>Also, a persistence model &quot;per folder&quot; as discussed in the article cannot support what is needed to restore the state of all the open windows on re-logon. If I have two Explorer windows open, both showing the same folder, not only with different size and position, but also maybe with different columns, sort order, detail view level etc, then both windows should be restored in this exact size, position and with all the other settings.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t see how this can be supported by a &quot;per folder&quot; persistence model.</p>

<p>The issue is only an &quot;easy&quot; one to you because you have only one point of view to worry about; yours. Microsoft have to think about a lot of people&#39;s perspective and find a mix that works well for most, and upsets other people as little as possible.</p>
<p>I&#39;m in the &quot;perfectly artificial&quot; camp with your proposed solution &#8211; &quot;Why does Windows remember all my folder settings on restart, but not if I close a folder then re-open it?&quot;. For users to feel comfortable they have to have a consistent experience. I would find it frustrating and arbitary if Windows chose to remember folder locations in one circumstance and not another.</p>
<p>Remember also that development and testing time is finite, and every feature starts out at -100 points. Even if your solution of remembering all folder settings was superior it isn&#39;t neccesssarily worth coding. This setting has been off by default for a long time. I would expect the number of people that turn this feature on to be less than 1%. It&#39;s hard to justify a lot of coding and testing on a feature that is hardly used.</p>

		<p>Removing the default option from the shutdown flyout menu bugs me. There is one know way to show the user what the default option is: Putting the text in bold&#8230;</p>

		<p>I liked the Poul-Henning Kamp &quot;You&#39;re doing it wrong&quot; article, but his &quot;I&#39;m smarter than Knuth and certainly smarter than you&#39;ll ever hope to be&quot; attitude is kind of grating.</p>

		<p>Also, whoever *unconditionally* removed the &quot;up one level&quot; button forgot that there is one thing that the button has that the breadcrumbs bar can&#39;t reproduce: muscle memory.</p>
<p>As in, a *consistent* place to click go up one level.</p>

		<p>The up button doesn&#39;t appear for me when I view a folder on the desktop. Or, in other words, listen to your users instead of being so snarky.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  So for those of you looking for your Up One Level button, it&#39;s right there on the Address Bar. I&#39;ve drawn a box around it so it&#39;s easier to see.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Can you make it so that the &quot;new&quot; Up One Level button:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>always stays in the same place relative to the address bar</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>goes up 2 levels when you double-click it (side button on my mouse sends a double-click, and years of using dialogs with the Up button trained me to side-click it when I need to go 2 levels up)</p>
</li>
</ul>
