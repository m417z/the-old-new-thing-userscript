		<p>A number of years back I had been playing Diablo II on a regular basis, even well after it came out. &nbsp;While out driving in the late evening I pulled up behind a small SUV stopped at a light. &nbsp;There must have been a crack in the bottom of the 3rd brake light, as it caused a red X-like light to be shown on the ground just behind the SUV. &nbsp;My immediate reaction was that the car or its driver was aura enchanted!</p>

		<p>@SMW</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t the driver nor the SUV. He held Rakanishu captive in his trunk.</p>
<p>On topic:</p>
<p>That really is pretty cool.</p>

		<p>Perhaps out there, that is a religious symbol? ;)</p>
<p>Reflections are odd, I remember when my school built a basically parabolic building with a solid wall of (mostly reflective) windows. &nbsp;They were surprised when people complained about the &quot;hot spot&quot; that moved about on the patio behind the building. &nbsp;Whoops, the team of architects forgot to consider that (it was a eastward facing wall, so it got sun straight on.) &nbsp;It was fun to confuse freshman though. &nbsp;&quot;Stand here, hold this, I&#39;ll be right back. &nbsp;What do you mean it&#39;s hot, you&#39;ll be fine.&quot;</p>

		<p>Obviously the aura is from an Xbox with the dreaded Ring of Death &#8211; 3 flashing red lights signalling major repair is needed.</p>

		<p>Now, you really should tell your neighbor to buy and put aside a replacement roof, so to use it when he&#39;ll have to send the current one in repair for the RROD.</p>

		<p>That&#39;s so funny, my brother has a video of his 5 year old son seeing a reflection that looks exactly like this, from a door window, and his son mentions that it&#39;s from the Xbox. Ha ha, it was cute. :)</p>

		<p>I recall a very old post mentioning that it was comparatively hard to include images on the blog posts (as opposed to, say, the ingenious tables that cropped up recently). Given there&#39;s normally a very long queue of posts, I am wondering which blog upgrade allowed this post to be created.</p>

		<p>In former East Berlin the socialist government built a large tower for television etc. Shortly after it was built the &quot;Pope&#39;s Revenge&quot; could be seen on a spheric part at the top: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:PopeRevengeBerlin.jpg" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/File:PopeRevengeBerlin.jpg</a></p>
