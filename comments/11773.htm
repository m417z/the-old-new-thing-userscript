		<p>Interesting fact: the common x86 NOP, 90h, is actually an alias for XCHG AX, AX or XCHG EAX, EAX (depending on the CS default operand and address size).</p>

		<p>I live in perpetual fear (paranoia) of processor erata. The whole idea just makes ice run down my spine. I&#39;m glad to see that MS was on the case even in the early 1990s.</p>

		<p>So after B1 support was pulled, why weren&#39;t the binaries recompiled to remove the now-unnecessary NOPs?</p>

		<p>&quot;Maybe the testers were finding too many bugs where other subtle B1 stepping bugs were being triggered. &quot;</p>
<p>Well, for one thing, some of these CPUs also had a 32-bit multiply bug, with no way to workaround it. There was a double sigma stamped on CPUs that did not have it, and a &quot;For 16-bit operations only&quot; stamped on CPUs that did.</p>

		<p>Loved the idea of a 32-bit NOP, especially the idea that a 16-bit NOP wouldn&#39;t have not done enough.</p>
<p>Whilst we&#39;re collecting, Intel have played this trick too. The PAUSE instruction is encoded as &quot;REP: NOP&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Joel Franklin: Just in case you didn&#39;t know, he has compiled (and occasionally expanded) many of the posts from here into a book, and it&#39;s awesome. It&#39;s got a bunch of anecdotes, but it&#39;s not just that; substantial portions of the book are spent on the more &quot;how-to&quot; coding entries. There&#39;s a link to the right (or search in-page for &quot;holy cow&quot;). I like the &quot;anecdotes&quot; parts more, and I think they are awesome enough to get the book. Especially if you haven&#39;t read back into the archives; there are some real gems. (See the bonus chapters and sample chapters at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.informit.com/store/product.aspx?isbn=0321440307" rel="nofollow">http://www.informit.com/&#8230;/product.aspx</a>)</p>

		<p>How would you even know if you had a B1 stepping? Could you read the ceramic package (assuming there&#39;s no heatsink), or did you have to run a bunch of regular instructions to see which ones failed?</p>

<p>Yes, the stepping is marked on the package for all processors.</p>

<p>No, there is a CPUID instruction that provides that information.</p>

<p>Not on 386s. &nbsp;cpuid didn&#39;t happen until some later 486s if I recall correctly.</p>
<p>A quick google search will turn up code that will let you differentiate B1 386s from others. &nbsp;I&#39;m guessing that code depends on the very errata that make you <em>want</em> to be able to tell.</p>

<p>Yep, the 386 and later did put a family-model-stepping value in EDX on reset but not all BIOSes even stored the values. One trick BTW was to determine the existence of the IBTS/XBTS instructions. Unfortunately, Intel reused the opcodes for these instructions for the CMPXCHG instruction in the early steppings of the 486, which broke this trick. Ultimately, Intel was forced to change it to a different opcode.</p>

		<p>I once got a crash report from our tech support department that hundreds of customers were running into. &nbsp;The crash report made no sense to most of our developers, so they sent it to me, since I&#39;m known for assembly language prowess. &nbsp;The thing that struck me as odd was that the crash was an illegal opcode exception, yet the log had the bytes at EIP and the opcodes there were definitely legal (a &quot;mov edi, edi&quot; used as a &quot;nop&quot; in fact).</p>
<p>The crash reports all named the same processor model: Pentium 4. &nbsp;My spidey-sense was tingling, and I brought up the errata sheet. &nbsp;Sure enough, there was an errata where under certain conditions, opcodes whose memory address is divisible by 128 would get decoded incorrectly, potentially causing an illegal opcode exception. &nbsp;The address of the crash was 0 mod 128 all right.</p>
<p>The next build of our product, the problem &quot;mysteriously&quot; disappeared. &nbsp;I ran it through IDA again, and that opcode was no longer at an address divisible by 128.</p>

		<p>Wow, this article is very educational.</p>
<p>I remember that one magazine apparently noticed these NOP instructions in system code, and went on explaining it&#39;s written like this to support some advanced form of CPU cooling machanism.</p>
<p>The &quot;no man&#39;s land&quot; of 0x80000xxx address has puzzled me for a long time too. Books describing memory layout often leaves the hole there, and I could see the hole myself using MSD.exe too, but no books I read actually said anything about it.</p>

		<p>Some of these must have been fun bugs to track down if you found your code triggering it &#8230; &quot;OK, I stored the values 16 and 256 in the structure at 0x800000F8, then branched to my division code &#8230; so why on earth am I getting division by zero? It&#39;s not zero, it&#39;s 16! @$%!&quot; I lost enough hair debugging a BugCheck (BSOD) which happened every time I called ZwClose before eventually deducing the anti-virus software&#39;s filter driver was breaking because it hadn&#39;t done something important during that particular ZwCreateFile path; when you have the processor itself *sometimes* decoding individual instructions wrongly or loading the wrong address &#8230; scary.</p>
<p>With at least one of the B1 bugs being triggered across a branch boundary, scanning all the generated code for instances must have been virtually impossible, even without the linker inlining Win95 introduced (for example, if you had a call to a function which just returned a value from a known location, in Win95 the call would actually be replaced with an equivalent load instruction).</p>
<p>I do love these anecdotes. Mark Jonson: Just because these NOPs *were* needed on B1 stepping cores does not mean they were *only* needed there &#8230; no doubt some of these errata, or related ones close enough to be fixed by the same workaround, persisted in C1 steppings as well. Trying to strip out all these workarounds after the final beta would have been a huge risk, all to shave off literally individual clock cycles. I imagine the surplus NOPs disappeared over time as later releases (OSR1 and OSR2 in particular) re-built and re-did QA fully, without considering B1 stepping errata.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve always wondered how Intel a) gets these errata, b) finds the instruction sequence that triggers it, and c) fixes them.</p>
<p>Are they bugs that occur due to the chip layout? Actual transistor-level bugs? Microcode issues?</p>

		<p>I seem to recall when Win95 came out that it seemed to take up &quot;a lot of space&quot; (not much really, just more than we were used to with Win3.x). It all makes sense now I know that the code included bonus NOPs :)</p>
<p>@ Bonus Chapter: The bonus chapters are at the bottom of the &quot;Sample Content&quot; tab on that page.</p>
<p>Incidentally, regarding the book, will there be a second edition with the bonus chapters/errata, and maybe more? &nbsp;A lot has happened in the last four years.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>There can&#39;t be a second edition until the first edition sells out. Odds of that are awfully slim. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>@Worf: &nbsp;I&#39;m not an Intel person, but I do chip design[1]. We pull out tens-of-thousands of errata during our design process. Most are prior to fabrication. Chip functional design is superficially similar to software design. (but with single-assignment &amp; very hard real-time constraints on every code path) &nbsp;The major benefit we have is a golden model that perfectly predicts the (range of) correct behavior for every case. So, we do lots of targeted random code generation &amp; comparison.</p>
<p>On fabricated chips, the same is possible. Run code designed to punish specific parts of the architecture which checks the results. Once a mistake is found, you can re-run in your software model to find the exact problem.</p>
<p>Bugs are primarily logic design errors. Mask layout &amp; transistor level design can be formally proved to match the logic design. This leaves you with hard-to-model physics effects, which generally fix themselves by slowing the clock speed. In the lab, slowly increasing clock speed can help locate the problem by looking for the first fail.</p>
<p>[1] My credits include for what is probably the non-x86 CPU that gets the most SW support from Microsoft. It has its own custom OS and large teams of Microsoft programmers (and Microsoft subsidiaries) who release dozens of end-user SW titles yearly.</p>

		<p>The KB article indicates intel actually sold 386s with a sticker that read &quot;for 16-bit use only&quot;. Anyone have a picture of those 386&#39;s or it&#39;s label? I think it would make a great picture to put up on my wall. :)</p>

		<p>&quot;Where are the bonus chapters? I registered (the book is great, but for my money more war stories/less Windows programming advice would be better) and see nothing.&quot;</p>
<p>They&#39;re not the easiest things to find, admittedly. And no need to register.</p>
<p>Just click on the &quot;sample content&quot; tab and scroll to the very bottom. There are two sample chapters from the book and the two bonus chapters linked as PDFs.</p>

		<p>@Bob: Ah, cool. Too bad Windows CE doesn&#39;t get as much love. IIRC, your would be working in one of the Studio buildings&#8230; B or C was it&#8230;</p>
<p>My IC design was limited to VLSI courses in university 10 years ago&#8230; ah yes, layout and all that FPGA goodness. Good to know how it&#39;s done &#8211; I&#39;ve read many an errata sheet in my work (I work with embedded hardware. Errata sheets are the first thing I look at when things behave oddly). But reading through some errata always made me wonder since the oddest ones were so utterly specific I couldn&#39;t help but wonder how they were discovered and the real causes.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ll bet those 80386&#39;s aren&#39;t as large or heavy as the 80521 Pentium Pro (200 MHz) that I have sitting on my desk. &nbsp;It seems to weigh a pound (actually, it&#39;s just over 3 oounces).</p>
<p>According to CPU-world.com, the 80386 marked with &quot;double sigma&quot; is a &quot;bug-free version&quot;. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>&quot;They&#39;re so cute when they&#39;re young&quot; &#8211; My mind&#39;s now stuck on the image of a puppy developer with huge brown eyes making chirpy noises meaning &quot;let&#39;s play &#39;recompile&#39;&quot;.</p>
