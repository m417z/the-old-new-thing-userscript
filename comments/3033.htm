		<p>If they&#39;re identical, shouldn&#39;t one function simply be an export redirect to the other? After all, Shell32.DLL already references User32.DLL&#8230;</p>

		<p>Developer: &quot;I tried creating a function named CopyIcon&quot;, but the compiler is telling me there is a name collision in user32.dll.&quot;</p>
<p>Manager: &quot;Just name it &#39;DuplicateIcon&#39; instead.&quot;</p>
<p>Developer: &quot;OK. Thanks, boss.&quot;</p>

		<p>It can&#39;t be a redirect because DuplicateIcon takes an extra first argument. I checked the Wine sources. The code is identical. hInstance is listed as not used in the MSDN docs.</p>

		<p>This is hardly the first time someone has reinvented the wheel because they didn&#39;t know something already existed. It&#39;s a whole lot better to do it out of ignorance instead of due to not-invented-here syndrome.</p>
<p>It would be interesting if both functions had the same results, but achieved them via very different approaches.</p>
<p>Now that the damage is done, I&#39;d probably re-implement DuplicateIcon() by calling CreateIcon() and deprecate DuplicateIcon() while maintaining for compatibility.</p>

		<p>&quot;My guess is that they didn&#39;t realize that such a function already existed, so they inadvertently reinvented the wheel.&quot;</p>
<p>Or, perhaps they thought they would need some additional functionality that CreateIcon() didn&#39;t provide, but by the end didn&#39;t need it, and then it was too late in the schedule to go back and change all the source code and re-test.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Actually, now it makes sense. The shell version takes an extra instance handle parameter because it copied the icon and transferred ownership to another module.

		<p>It&#39;s a bad design that shell32 export any functionality at all, because ideally, the shell should replaceable without any apps knowing. I guess it&#39;s because of a war between user and shell team, where user team refused to add functionality required by shell team, and as revenge, shell team implemented and exported those functions. Too bad I wasn&#39;t there to prevent it.</p>

		<p>&quot;Re-invented the wheel&quot; is one of if not _the_ most over and inappropriately used idiom imho. &nbsp;As much as &quot;Not Invented Here&quot; is an excuse for doing [potentially] unnecessary work, &quot;Not re-inventing the wheel&quot; is all too often simply an excuse for not doing proper design.</p>
<p>Nobody *ever* re-invents a wheel (although they may end up duplicating an existing design of one).</p>
<p>What we do do &#8211; all the time &#8211; is design a wheel best suited to the particular wheel-demanding job at hand. &nbsp;You can&#39;t even simply take a wheel from a family sedan and just bolt it to an F1 car even though both are just &quot;wheels on a car&quot;.</p>

		<p>No, but if you&#39;re trapped in a post-apocalyptic wasteland, struggling to put together a crude cart from scraps of wreckage, you&#39;re not going to care if one of your wheels comes from a sedan and another from an F1 car, as long as they&#39;re roughly similar in size.</p>
<p>That may be a bit of a stretch as an analogy, but here&#39;s one that&#39;s closer. You know you have to have a wheel of a certain minimum size and strength. You could build your own out of available materials, or you could buy one. There are a bunch of wheel salesmen around, most of whom advertise highly adaptable wheels that can magically grow or shrink to fit anything from a child&#39;s tricycle to an 18-wheel truck and can each support the weight of an entire building. You&#39;re a bit dubious about some of these claims, especially when all the salesmen gloss over the actual process of getting the wheel to be the way you want it, but you know it&#39;ll probably take you quite a while to build one yourself. Now what&#39;s your best course of action? What do you do if your manager gets all excited about the chrome finish advertised by one supplier and wants you to use their product, even if on closer reading the wheel they&#39;re selling doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;ll fit on your car very well?</p>

		<p>&gt; What if shell32 were called &quot;explorerhelper.dll&quot;? Would that clear up the confusion</p>
<p>Wouldn&#39;t it have to have been called something like &quot;exphel32.dll&quot; for 8.3 compatibility and naming consistency?</p>
