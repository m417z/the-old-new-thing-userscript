		<p>Presumably icons are cached by the shell in the same way, which explains a lot.</p>
<p>The shell doesn&#39;t need to load the DLL to check if the cached strings are still likely to be valid. Checking the DLL&#39;s date would solve the problem in most cases (and it&#39;d be forgiveable for caching to go wrong in cases where two DLL versions had identical datestamps).</p>
<p>Of course, checking the date every time the string was used would be too expensive, but the shell could at least check it occasionally. Caches that never verify their validity are rather non-brilliant.</p>

		<p>InvalidateIndirectStringCache(LPCTSTR lpModule) or even InvalidateShellCaches(LPCTSTR lpModule) would cause unacceptable missing of Doctor Who episodes for the MS developers, I take it? :-)</p>
<p>I&#39;m just teasing here, but the knife cuts both ways. If this is such a common scenario that it requires &quot;careful attention&quot; from the application developers, MS could choose to make it slightly less painful for end users as well by making it easy. I don&#39;t know where it would end up on the -100 points scale, mind you. In any case, it shouldn&#39;t take &quot;several minutes&quot; for a single module. It would be included in the installation/upgrade time, which to end users (sad to say) is an acceptable time to be unresponsive and slow anyway, if my personal experiences are any indication.</p>

		<p>But when Raymond queued this post Dr. Who was airing new episodes in the spring (if he had queued this for the end of April or May and Dr. Who hadn&#39;t moved to a fall schedule, he might well have gotten a lot of folks excited)</p>

		<p>@Raymond: The docs don&#39;t say anything about indirect strings, only a user comment but that does not list the minimum OS. All the protocol specification ([MS-SHLLINK].pdf) says is: &quot;NAME_STRING: An optional structure that specifies a description of the shortcut that is displayed to end users to identify the purpose of the shell link. This structure MUST be present if the HasName flag is set.&quot;</p>
<p>It does work on WinXP, did not test on 2000&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Raymond: if the user is upgrading the application for other users, they should also be able to invalidate shell caches for other users. If the user is not upgrading the application for other users, then those users&#39; caches don&#39;t need invalidating.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t actually develop multi-user apps, so I&#39;m probably missing something?</p>

		<p>Of course, if you put a gun to my head I can work around that issue too: defer the cache update by keeping a local list of updates-to-process. Implementing this so it gets tracked across profiles properly is of course not trivial.</p>
<p>&quot;And what if the application is stored on a network so it&#39;s not updated locally, and someone logs in from across the world to use the upgraded version of the application?&quot;</p>
<p>Then push the update to the domain controllers.</p>
<p>&quot;This feature started off at -100 points, care to guess how far it&#39;s come along since then?&quot;</p>
<p>Shut up, imaginary version of Raymond.</p>

		<p>What about using the modified date on the shortcut as a key for the cache? When the binary is updated, the shortcut can also be refreshed by changing only its last modified date. Then, the cache would beinvalidated for this shortcut only. What am I missing?</p>

		<p>This very rarely causes any issues&#8230;.for explorer please always take the highest performing design! I would think even date check to validate cache would be too slow, some people have hundreds of shortcuts on their desktop/startmenu.</p>

		<p>This is shortsighted design for a cache. Thankfully (and partly because of me) there&#39;s a way in Win7 to do reliable MUI cache invalidation. I haven&#39;t tested it in a while and assume this is the subject of a future post, so I won&#39;t reveal the secret.</p>
<p>Not that long ago I had to write code to enumerate user profiles in the registry, load the hive for that user, and clear the cached value (which is in different places on XP vs. Vista). We punted on the issue of roaming profiles. Look for the source in IECleanup.exe.</p>

		<p>@Raymond: that&#39;s what I meant by &quot;missing something&quot;.</p>
<p>Of course, what you describe is pretty awful &#8212; with a design like that you can *never* invalidate any cache stored in a roaming profile, except on an ad-hoc basis (and you might as well not bother with that, viz. the &quot;Explorer stops working for several minutes&quot; issue). Someone clever once said that &quot;a cache with a bad policy is another name for a memory leak&quot;. I suppose a cache that can&#39;t update is indistinguishable from a pain in the neck for developers. :-)</p>

		<p>Why not have a second cache with DLL update times, common to all users? When indirect string gets cached, the DLL is registered there. The system monitors FS for changes to those DLLs. Then, when indirect string is taken from the cache, it&#39;s time of caching is compared to the corresponding DLL update time, and if it&#39;s different, the string&#39;s invalidated.</p>
<p>In this common cache instead of DLL names you might store hashes. I wonder if this still qualifies as a privacy leak.</p>

		<p>Emmm&#8230; I think if there&#39;s a setting in the Windows installer service to force cache update, it should be okay.</p>
<p>Something like &quot;if the user&#39;s last logon time to this computer is later than (the last update time of software that requires cache refresh), refresh the user&#39;s cache after logon&quot;.</p>

<p>Somehow I think if roaming profile users don&#39;t get their cache update, their I.T. should understand, and most probably the users as well (known as common glitches&#8230; it&#39;s quite common for applications that not designed for roaming profile behave in some &quot;funny&quot; way, and the users have grown accustomed to that, AmIRight?). *Put troll cap on*</p>

		<p>[There are so many things wrong with this I don&#39;t know where to begin. At least two security flaws, possibly three depending on how you count. -Raymond]</p>
<p>I&#39;d like to hear the explanation, if possible. The only flaws I can think of can be fixed with some more or less trivial workarounds.</p>

		<p>&gt; What if the target DLL is written to while you are logged off? And wouldn&#39;t this require the shell to monitor all DLLs which appear in the cache?</p>
<p>So make that a requirement of the cache. &nbsp;&quot;The indirect string cache needs to be invalidated when the target .dll is written to, even if no user is logged on.&quot; &nbsp;This just implies that the shell is a bad place to keep the cache.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>This means that the cache must be system-wide, which is a problem because different users can be running different languages. (I guess you could monitor all satellite DLLs, but that quickly explodes into thousands of DLLs being monitored by the system.) Also, what if the file is modified while the operating system isn&#39;t even running? (E.g., you boot into another partition and then modify the file, or the file is on a removable drive and is modified while inserted into some other machine.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Hmmm&#8230; let&#39;s recap.</p>
<p>Definition: a &quot;perfect&quot; caching system is one that creates a performance boost leaving no other evidence that it exists (no possibility of stale data being returned; no cache poisoning; no authorization bypasses, etc.)</p>
<p>This blog post is a special case of the truism &quot;some caching systems are imperfect.&quot;</p>
<p>In this case, it looks like rubbing out the &quot;OMG there&#39;s a cache here&quot; evidence would either require reaching out to the .dll (to do a timestamp or hash comparison, losing a lot of the performance gain of the existing implementation) or pushing the problem down to the file system level (in which case it would only work on the new file system.)</p>

		<p>.lnk-files are broken by design.</p>
<p>The fix is, as usual, to reinstall windows.</p>

		<p>&gt; which is a problem because different users can be running different languages</p>
<p>Why is that a problem? &nbsp;Because when different users log in you get cache collisions?</p>
<p>Overcomeable; include the language information in the cache key (or equivalently, have a cache for each language.)</p>
<div class="post">[<i>I&#39;m still surprised you haven&#39;t freaked out over Windows having to register a change notification on every single DLL that has evern been seen (and then at every boot, reverifying the cache in case the file was modified while offline). It seems that you&#39;re over-engineering the problem. -Raymond</i>]</div>
