		<p>SHBrowseForFolder is a horrible interface though; Explorer is convenient. The context menu suggestion is much better.</p>

		<p>Merely seeing the title was enough to make me think &quot;Here comes another story of a program that does something in an unnecessarily strange and overcomplicated way&quot;.</p>
<p>I can easily imagine that the logic for using Explorer as a directory picker is that the user only has to navigate to the directory once in total, rather than once in the application&#39;s directory picker and again in Explorer to do something with the files. From that perspective, it makes a weird kind of sense, but not as much as, yes, adding a context menu entry.</p>
<p>And I have to say, configurator is right: SHBrowseForFolder is kinda annoying. If it has the same scrolling glitch in Win7 that Explorer&#39;s folder list does, that would make it even more annoying.</p>

		<p>[configurator &#8211; SHBrowseForFolder is a horrible interface though]</p>
<p>Fully agree. If you are targeting Vista+, please please please use IFileOpenDialog with FOS_PICKFOLDERS.</p>
<p>On older OSes there are ways to use GetOpenFileName to pick a folder (I&#39;ve seen 3DS MAX do it more than 10 years ago). It is not very easy, but definitely possible.</p>

		<p>Any sane program doesn&#39;t use SHBrowseForFolder because the dialog is evil. Choosing folders with GetOpenFileName is better, then the user have access to the left pane with desktop/computer/documents/&#8230;</p>

		<p>I know this is impossible but each time I read one of your customer stories I think you should just tell them to get lost.</p>
<p>Seriously, simulating keypresses in another process is far worse than most of the stuff on TDWTF. These people should just stop developing software.</p>

		<p>I admit, the SendKeys call was surprising (and not in a good way). &nbsp;If there is some common computer with a staging directory for file transfers, why not just use CopyFile/MoveFile or something fancier but along the same lines.</p>
<p>I realize the main question was getting the current Explorer view, but once you have it, why not use the path in a more sane way?</p>

		<p>@Me after only a short time working in this wonderful industry of ours, I&#39;ve learnt to accept that there are MANY horrible developers. I include myself in that category every now and then. There are three major reasons horrible programs are written (that I can fathom on a whim):</p>
<ol>
<li>&quot;Get Dave from accounting some training in Visual Basic so he can make his own accounting application. We aren&#39;t paying $200/h to outsource something so easy!&quot;</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Ahh! I can&#39;t find documentation on how to achieve the outcome I&#39;m after. Let me browse the source and find a way to do it&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Meh whatever, lunch is in 10 let&#39;s go!&quot;</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I used to hate Dave. Now I hate companies that force Dave into doing something he doesn&#39;t have the skills to do, to save a few thousand dollars in CapEx to sacrifice a much larger amount in maintenance in the long term.</p>
<p>I&#39;m guilty of 2, though sites like stackoverflow are significantly reducing my need to jump into source unless I&#39;m interested in the code.</p>
<p>All 3&#39;s should be identified and shot on site.</p>
<p>Raymond, I really appreciate how you provide answers to Customer&#39;s questions AND answers to the actual problem they are having. I don&#39;t know many people like that unfortunately. The Easy Way leads to the dark-side!</p>

		<p>Clarification:</p>
<ol>
<li>Was supposed to be a reference to using undocumented APIs and internal data structures. I realise that reading the source can be a very good way to program in some cases.</li>

		<p>Raymond, after reading these stories from time to time, I just want to know &#8211; How do you ask Microsoft a question like this?</p>

		<p>Is it me, or does this just scream &quot;drag and drop&quot;? That&#39;s what I would have told them to do. Then a user could simply drag something from their custom app to wherever they want it to go (most likely the currently open Explorer window).</p>
<p>I do sympathize with them not wanting to use the ridiculously bad folder browsing dialog. One of my pet peeves is that you cannot drag something from an already-open Explorer window into a common file dialog.</p>

		<p>Heck, why drag and drop? Shell extensions!</p>
<p>This guy&#39;s app isn&#39;t, and it can simulate a virtual folder of the third PC&#39;s dropbox. User does everything in Explorer. To move files, you just drag/drop, copy/paste, etc. the file to the virtual folder, which copies the file to the third PC. The destination browses the virtual folder, and copy/pastes.</p>
<p>Of course, no one tell this company that Microsoft did it as &quot;File Sharing&quot;&#8230;</p>

		<p>You can ask questions like these all day long simply by calling Microsoft Developer Support. I have seen much crazier things come through there than this, which is why it&#39;s always important to ask &quot;What are you trying to accomplish?&quot; rather than simply answering the question as presented.</p>

		<p>My collegues have recently delivered an application that does exactly this: it can copy a remote file to a folder that is opened in Explorer. Or to a context related to an open window of another application. The catch is that the remote file resides on a cameraphone, therefore the user only points to the desired destination with her camera. And yes, under the hood we use drag&#39;n&#39;drop, not Ctrl-V.</p>

		<p>A very simple rule for developers to internalise: if you&#39;re using SendKeys (or its moral equivalents), then you&#39;re doing it wrong. &nbsp;(With *maybe* a possible exception for user-initiated keyboard macro programs.)</p>

		<p>I guess those who think anyone using SendKeys should retire from programming are not fans of Mark Russinovich and Process Monitor, or have never noticed what Process Monitor does when you ask it to jump to a registry key? :)</p>
<p>Not that it excuses using SendKeys when there is a better alternative, like in Raymond&#39;s example, but it seems sometimes it&#39;s the only way to get certain things done when trying to get another program to do what you want.</p>
