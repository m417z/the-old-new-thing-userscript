		<p>C&#8217;mon, Ray, it&#8217;s the internet. We all know there are legions, legions I say, of no-life techies just sitting out there, desperate to answer your questions at all hours of the day.</p>
<p>I mean, MSFT has their own news groups, therefore they must be safety patrolled regularly.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve seen people wait less than five minutes before&#8230; &nbsp;Not only do they not even give you enough time to read their email, sometimes they&#8217;ll call your office demanding help before you&#8217;ve had a chance to interpret half of the fragmented email they just wrote&#8230;</p>

		<p>There may be a benign explanation for some of these&#8211;the person may be having mail troubles, and may not have seen their original message echoed on the list before they send their second one. And when they send the second try, they might decide to edit the message slightly. I know that I&#8217;ve sent inadvertent duplicates this way.</p>
<p>Of course, if the second one is a response to the first, or specifically asks why no one responded, then you know that they&#8217;re just impatient.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s worse if they work nearby, I&#8217;ve had people show up at my desk before I&#8217;ve finished reading their e-mail asking if I can help</p>

		<p>Gosh</p>
<p>I thought email was a natural in-extension of Instant Messaging </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know the support system Raymond is refering to, &nbsp;but my experience of company IT support is that they often use Instant messaging&#8230; </p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing that as a person in need of support using the system above I have to work-out how the support service is staffed, &nbsp;I even have to guess what time zone it is based in (to work-out the 9-5 likelihood of being staffed), &nbsp;I need to check whether there is a service agreement and what it is. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Gosh. &nbsp;That&#8217;s tough on the person with a problem that needs solving&#8230; &nbsp;</p>
<div class=post>[<i>The question was not asked to an IT department (which presumably has a service level agreement somewhere you can refer to) but to a peer-to-peer discussion group, which does not have a service level agreement. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Wendy,</p>
<p>There is no easy answer to this problem. &nbsp;My clients call me at 9:30 at night and leave smart-assed voice messages if I don&#8217;t answer. &nbsp;The next day, I call them back and ignore them for the first 10 minutes of the phone call as they complain about my not answering their call the previous night before they even get to the problem they were having.</p>
<p>In the world of tech-support, end users will continue to think of us support folk not as human beings but as robots who are supposed to know the answer in 5 minutes or less. &nbsp;Whereas we, the support folk, will continue to think of users as mindless idiots who violate Darwin&#8217;s theory every day and get away with it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see this situation getting any better.</p>
<p>JamesNT</p>

		<p>Your first link is dead and also, I think you&#8217;ve actually written your second paragraph here before somewhere. I&#8217;ve definitely read it before.</p>

		<p>&quot;Resend due to no response&quot;.</p>
<p>18 hours is understandable &#8211; remember MS is a global company, and not everyone works in US working hours.</p>
<p>What is truly annoying is the lack of understanding about the SLA thing, or the increasingly shrill tone you find on some DLs.</p>
<p>&quot;ANYONE?&quot; bold, italic, resent 2x&#8230; I mean, come on.</p>

		<p>I make it a point not to respond (or not respond as kindly) to people who repeat their questions. Even on IRC, which is a lot closer to real-time than e-mail.</p>

		<p>&quot;18 hours is understandable &#8211; remember MS is a global company, and not everyone works in US working hours.&quot;</p>
<p>&#8230;which is exactly why when I correspond with people more than a few time zones away, I provide 24-36 hours for a response. &nbsp;I *could* look up exactly how many hours they are from me and calculate when 10AM is for them, but that&#8217;s an awful lot of trouble considering that e-mail is a &quot;respond when you can&quot; medium. &nbsp;Some mornings I am so swamped with &quot;urgent&quot; and &quot;response needed&quot; emails that it&#8217;s past lunch before I can wade through all of them. &nbsp;Sending a second one doesn&#8217;t help things.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s important that you get a response immediately, use a phone. &nbsp;If you can wait a few days, use e-mail and then wait a few days.</p>
