		<p>Sounds as if the William fellow was well trained for support (I mean, no worse than an experienced support staff). Was that real?</p>

		<p>One trait of a good leader is someone who would never ask somebody to do something they are not prepared to do themselves.</p>

		<p>@DWalker: He&#8217;s just come from Slashdot as hasn&#8217;t wiped the rabid foam from his lips yet, is my guess.</p>
<p>@Meng: Assuming the customer isn&#8217;t difficult (and it sounds like this one wasn&#8217;t), product support isn&#8217;t really hard. You just be polite, respectful, and honest with the customer. I&#8217;ve done plenty of support calls for products and issues I have absolutely zero knowledge of, and I always seem to do ok. Plus in 1989, BillG probably had pretty intimate knowledge of all of Microsoft&#8217;s products&#8211; they were huge, but not mega-huge, then.</p>

		<p>Great story, makes my eyes wet. I wonder how many other managers/executives/top-level-high-income people (who most likely have not gone all the long way that billg went) would be able (and dare to demonstrate) to do the work of their employees. And apparently he did it for fun.</p>

		<p>@Daniel,</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think it was just for fun, I think it was as porter said that a good leader never asks anyone to do anything they wouldn&#8217;t do themselves. &nbsp;The somewhat indirect corallary to that is &quot;do everything your subordinates do at least once&quot;</p>

		<p>This is consistent with Joel Spolsky&#8217;s anecdote about the Excel date issue in his first meeting with Bill Gates. &nbsp;It&#8217;s impressive and telling that Bill Gates had the confidence in the knowledge base business process that he could sit down and be prepared to handle any blind question from the customer. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>@James Schend</p>
<p>&#8230;by the same token, is it credible that billg&#8217;s name had such an effect on the customer? I thought back then he was &quot;co-founder of Microsoft&quot;, not &quot;The Richest Guy On The Planet (founded Microsoft)&quot;.</p>
<p>I guess maybe the customer worked in IT him/herself.</p>

		<p>This story is mostly true, although it&#8217;s not quite how I remember it. &nbsp;In 1989 I was a product support services intern working at Microsoft&#8217;s Lincoln Plaza campus. &nbsp;I worked for the &#8216;System Languages&#8217; team, or SysLang as we called ourselves. &nbsp;We supported Micorosft C 5.x, QuickC, and their Pascal product and thier associated tools. &nbsp;One day (I don&#8217;t remember if it was November or not) Bill came through on a tour of PSS. &nbsp;I mentioned to another intern, Nadine, that it would be cool if Bill took a call from a customer. &nbsp;When he came by our area with the group of other management types she bounded up to him with a huge smile on her face and asked if he&#8217;d like to see how things worked for himself, and take a call from a customer. &nbsp;The people he was with tried to dissuade him of this idea, saying something about schedules and the like, but Bill liked the idea and wanted to do it. &nbsp;At the time, i was a real clean freak, and my cube was very clean and devoid of clutter, so I suggested he sit down at my desk. &nbsp;I explained to him how the Aspect phone system worked and how to look up things in our STARS knowledge base using an OS/2 terminal program connected to a DEC minicomputer. &nbsp;He got settled in, and eventually took a call, greeting the customer like:</p>
<p>&quot;Hello, Product Support Services, this is William, how can I help you?&quot;</p>
<p>Just about everyone who wasn&#8217;t currently on a call with a customer was gathered around my cube listening. &nbsp;I seem to remember the customer having a problem with the linker. &nbsp;Bill queried the knowledge base, which was normally painfully slow, but this time it was snappy and responsive. &nbsp;The first result looked like it might have addressed the customer&#8217;s problem, and Bill went with it. &nbsp;I of course only heard one side of the conversation, but it sounded like the customer wasn&#8217;t satisfied with the answer. Bill was firm yet polite, reassuring the customer that we had seen this problem before and that his solution was correct, and the customer eventually agreed to try the solution mentioned in the STARS article. &nbsp;An hour or so later, my friend Tad got that customer again, and he mentioned that William had helped him with his problem earlier but his solution didn&#8217;t work. &nbsp;Tad let the customer know that he had in fact talked to Bill Gates, and helped him with his problem. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t remember how/if it got solved though.</p>
<p>That was quite a big day for me. &nbsp;For years I had saved the yellow pad that had Bill&#8217;s notes from the call.</p>

		<p>True* story: the caller&#8217;s name was Bob. William enjoyed his time in support so much he decided to name a product after his favourite customer.</p>
<p>Can you imagine if it were Steve Ballmer: HELLO! THANK YOU FOR CALLING MICROSOFT! HOW CAN I HELP YOU?</p>

		<p>@iain, Re: is it credible that billg&#8217;s name had such an effect on the customer?</p>
<p>As I recall Gates was a big name back then among anyone involved with PCs, including ordinary users (who weren&#8217;t quite as &quot;ordinary&quot; as users are today). I recall in the late 1980s the computer consumer magazine PCWorld had a centerfold picture of Gates. Fortunately, he was fully clothed.</p>

		<p>Why did the PSE find it necessary to inform the customer that his previous call had been handled by billg? &nbsp;Now no matter what you tell him, it will never have the authority it should, because it comes from a mere minion.</p>
<p>He should have said, &quot;William no longer works in product support. &nbsp;He was overqualified for the position&#8230;&quot;</p>

		<p>Thanks for the added perspective, Mike. &nbsp;I think it&#8217;s safe to assume that anyone calling for support on the QuickC linker would recognize BillG&#8217;s name.</p>
