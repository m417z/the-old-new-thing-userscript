		<p>The title of this post is a question I asked a few months ago of Anna Tholse, one of the very cool developers&#8230;</p>

		<p>I think it is reassuring to know that something we take for granted is actually backed by raw scientific data? :-)</p>

		<p>I get miffed by studies like these. I mean, we know the effect of light on our mood (versus darkness), we also know the effect of sun on our well being (Vitamin D production, etc), we know the benefits of walking, so did they really need to spend time and money to conclude that the three combined would improve our mood? I just hope this study wasn&#8217;t tax-payer funded&#8230; :)</p>

		<p>To a scientist, common sense isn&#8217;t so until proven by an eight year study.</p>

		<p>Although probably you are all just being sarcastic, Kent Boogart is actually right. If we accepted &#8216;common sense&#8217; as scientifical facts, we would still believe the earth was flat and washing your car is a great way to make it rain.</p>
<p>It is a good thing that common wisdoms like these are evaluated scientifically because often enough they are plain wrong.</p>
<p>That said, I doubt the results and conclusion of the study were so simple as the title suggests. Slaven dismisses the study as obvious, but he hasn&#8217;t even bothered to read the article; if he had, he would have known that the effect of exercise was factored out in the study (the subject of the study being the weather, not the walking).</p>

		<p>&quot;Slaven dismisses the study as obvious, but he hasn&#8217;t even bothered to read the article; if he had, he would have known that the effect of exercise was factored out in the study (the subject of the study being the weather, not the walking).&quot;</p>
<p>I just listed all the reasons this study would be a foregone conclusion, granted I did not spend near enough time to really analyze the findings (after all, I do think enough time was wasted on it already!). I think the obvious part of the study is actually exposure to sun, since there have been many studies that proved it long ago, and effect it has on mood of people living if far north like Norway and Sweden. I just think there are a lot more urgent areas of study available to them.</p>
<p>What would be a worthwhile study would be telling us if the benefits of walking in the sun outweigh potential risks of skin cancer. :)</p>

		<p>The thing I hate most about this is how judgmental it is about weather.</p>
<p>Their study shows that (most) people are happier after being in &quot;sunny&quot; weather.  That is not what I call &quot;nice&quot; weather at all.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happiest after walking to work when it&#8217;s about 65F, with a light breeze, and either cloudy or misty.  That&#8217;s what I call &quot;nice&quot; weather.</p>
<p>When the local weatherperson says it will be &quot;nice&quot; outside, I know it will be dreadful: &gt;90F and blindingly bright.  Walking in such weather just makes you hot and sweaty, not something I fully appreciate being.</p>

		<p>I have just read Richard Feynman&#8217;s The Pleasure of Finding Things Out, so I cannot resist to say that he was right about those pseudosciences and the cargo-cult science&#8230; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cargo_cult_science</a>)</p>

		<p>And it today&#8217;s news, scientists discover that eating healthy is good for you, and that double helping of chili cheese fries isn&#8217;t.</p>
