		<p>The zone identifier is stored in an alternate data stream (ADS) that is not part of the ACL. &nbsp;The ADS is copied along with the $DATA stream (provided that the destination volume supports ADS).</p>

		<p>@Marquess &amp; @Bukesros</p>
<p>While you both are right, it&#39;s named &quot;FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;ATTRIBS&quot;, which implies application to all &quot;security attributes&quot; not just the ACL. &nbsp;Certainly internet zone info is stored in an alternate data stream, but this could be considered a security &quot;attribute&quot; as well. &nbsp;The suggested name that Marquess provides is a good one, but since it&#39;s already in the wild, it&#39;s too late.</p>

		<p>&quot;Users, however, found this behavior confusing.&quot;</p>
<p>It is. IMO it is not intuitve that the folder structure is hierarchical but security attributes aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>That&#39;s something I would not have guessed. Count me as one of those who would fail to realize that the 1st 2 sentences are normative and the last interpretive. &nbsp;However, I also wouldn&#39;t necessarily consider things broken if a new flag were added to override the 3rd sentence, but I guess you&#39;d have no shortage of people who would (and maybe applications that needed compatibility shims).</p>

		<p>This seems like a good example of how end users (&quot;normal people&quot;) and developers (&quot;technical people&quot;) can think so completely different about something relatively simple. &nbsp;I would never view the little zone marker agreement between IE and the Shell (and now most other browsers) as a security attribute. &nbsp;It&#39;s just metadata that&#39;s been somewhat arbitrarily tied to a file. &nbsp;However, when I stop and think about it, I suppose I could almost see it as related to file security&#8230; almost.</p>
<p>As far as FOF_NO­COPY­SECURITY­ATTRIBS entry on MSDN, you might just link to your blog entry. &nbsp;Sure, sure, I know this isn&#39;t official information of any kind, but from this point forward, if you Google (or Bing, if you lean that way) FOF_NO­COPY­SECURITY­ATTRIBS, your blog post will be the first result. Honestly, this is probably a good thing :)</p>

		<p>It *seems* like the Internet Zone marking should be a security attribute, but &#8230; oh well.</p>

		<p>SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES (<a target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa379560%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/aa379560%28VS.85%29.aspx</a>) is clearly defined, and has been an integral part of the Windows API for two decades. &nbsp;Of issue is the fact that the SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES type includes the security descriptor and a BOOL indicating if the HANDLE is inheritable. &nbsp;The latter is not at all applicable to FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;ATTRIBS.</p>
<p>That leaves us the PSECURITY_DESCRIPTOR. &nbsp;So, as FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;ATTRIBS might be better named FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;DESCRIPTOR. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is a bit besides the point. &nbsp;If one&#39;s ignorance of the Windows API leads one to believe that the Internet Zone marking is part included as part of the Security Attributes, one might also believe that it is included as part of the Security Descriptor.</p>

		<p>I agree with Phil that FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;DESCRIPTOR is a better name. The term &quot;security descriptor&quot; is very well-defined and should be understood unambiguously by any experienced Windows developer in any context (it even has a Wikipedia entry).</p>
<p>The term &quot;security attributes&quot; is more generic. In regular Win32 programming it applies to a handle (not a file or folder). In the context of the shell one could easily assume that security attributes include the zone information. After all, the properties page (a shell UI) for a file downloaded from the Internet will have, right under &quot;Attributes&quot;, the word &quot;Security&quot; is used to refer to the Internet zone.</p>
<p>Of course you could argue that Internet Explorer isn&#39;t part of the Shell, or that the property page didn&#39;t work like that 10-12 years ago when they were creating this option. Regardless, MSDN can be changed at any time, and should use the unambiguous term &quot;security descriptor&quot;.</p>

		<p>Does FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;ATTRIBS take care of the case where the destination folder has no inheritable ACL entries? (Copying a file to such a folder gives it a default ACL giving you and SYSTEM full control.)</p>

		<p>Win32&#39;s use of .h-files suck. For example, h-files should be used to mitigate transitions and to help where the compiler&#39;s type system is insufficient. But win32 doesn&#39;t use h-files this way. Win32&#39;s h-files are useless. As a developer you can hard code everything anyway, because ms are afraid of changing h-files because some noob developers didn&#39;t use them back in the 90&#39;s. Why are current developers punished becuase some noob developers hard coded stuff in the 90&#39;s?</p>

		<p>.h-files are there to stay for Win32 development, because everyone relies on them (and for good reason). If you don&#39;t like .h-files, you can use what Microsoft provided when they decided to start over:</p>
<p>.Net</p>

		<p>What&#39;s the deal with .h files? What bugs me more is the *lack* of them when people distribute COM components; one has to jump through hoops to get a .h file from the type library, which makes using said COM components from C (or C++ under IDEs that don&#39;t support #import) a pain in the rear.</p>
