		<p>I&#8217;m going to guess that the person who worked on the wireless networking dialog was someone who was used to working with cryptographic modules that go up for FIPS 140-2 certification, which states that manually entered keying material needs verification. &nbsp;One method of verification is requiring that the user enter the data twice.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s not necessary, I don&#8217;t know. &nbsp;But they probably figured that providing keying material for the underlying crypto library fell under the standard.</p>

		<p>JJJ: The reason you have to type your passphrase twice is presumably because you can&#8217;t see it. The actual problem is that this passphrase is treated as secret like a password when it usually isn&#8217;t. They should just have a checkbox that lets you hide it if necessary, and only make you enter it twice if it&#8217;s hidden.</p>
<p>While we&#8217;re hijacking discussions, I have this cellular modem which requires a little app to connect to the network. At some point my cellular carrier decided that their app should also handle WiFi connections too, which I didn&#8217;t want, so I disabled it. Unfortunately in their eagerness to provide this functionality they stop the wireless zero configuration service even when you have the WiFi part of the app disabled. I&#8217;m sure the app&#8217;s authors were thinking &quot;Why would they ever need to use Windows&#8217; built-in WiFi applet? They have ours which is much better!&quot; (and nobody ever got promoted for not including a feature).</p>
<p>So anyway, I&#8217;ve been wanting to write an app that detected that my WiFi wasn&#8217;t connected and wzcsvc wasn&#8217;t running, but I didn&#8217;t know how. Thank you for one of the most useful code samples you&#8217;ve posted.</p>

		<p>@Gabe:</p>

<p>I see that you&#8217;ve never set up wireless in Vista+7?</p>
<p>@Nerf:</p>
<p>GetIpAddrTable doesn&#8217;t require LocalAlloc. In fact, the msdn example for it uses plain HeapAlloc.</p>
<p>@Raymond:</p>
<p>Using reinterpret_cast for PVOID casts is not required. static_cast works. Generally, you should be using least forceful cast when possible, to let the compiler warn you of possible errors. reinterpret_cast is a hammer too big for that purpose.</p>

		<p>This would be a great app for netbooks if it also detected when the wifi card was disabled and stopped the service then too. But I suspect that detecting the power state of the card would be 1) hard 2) different from model to model</p>

		<p>Recently I was forced to fall back on a wireless connection (via USB dongle) and was plagued by it dropping the connection (and refusing to reconnect due to an unspecified error) every once in a while.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure which component was at fault (though I suspect the drivers), but disabling and then re-enabling the connection from Network Connections invariably fixed it. &nbsp;(Nothing else seemed to.)</p>
<p>If I were forced to use wireless more often then I&#8217;d probably be tempted to write a similar app to this myself. &nbsp;(Or to find an alternate wireless adaptor.)</p>

		<p>The answer to the original question is: Someone copied someone else&#8217;s bad design without thinking it through. It&#8217;s like when a web signup form asks you to enter your email address twice. The email edit boxes don&#8217;t have the password style set, so copy &amp; paste works, thus defeating the supposed error-checking of making you type it twice. But enough people have seen it designed that way that they think it&#8217;s the right thing to do.</p>

		<p>So, why does StopService care about whether the service was already started?</p>
<p>@Gabe: There are, or at least were, several wireless drivers which thought that stopping the wireless zero configuration service was the right thing to do when they wanted to use their own UI. (Yes I have multiple wireless NICs.)</p>

		<p>RE: reinterpret_cast/static_cast &#8211; the result of both is unspecified, but in reality they both have the correct effect.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a language lawyer type and can&#8217;t stand to use an unspecified result, there is a way to do the conversion in an entirely above board way &#8211; given a suitably aligned void* use &#8216;PMIB_IPADDRTABLE piat = new(voidPtr) MIB_IPADDRTABLE;&#8217;.</p>

		<p>Casts up from void* are dangerous because the void* could have originally been anything. Using reinterpret_cast is an accepted idiom for saying &quot;watch out&quot; in this case, even though the language tolerates the alternative idiom of &quot;assuming you are simply casting back to the type it came from&quot;.</p>

		<p>Since you bring up the subject of wireless adapters, here is a question for you. How do you identify which network adapters are wireless and which are fixed? We had this problem a while ago. Essentially we wanted a machine fingerprint which we planned to use, amongst other things, the MAC of the network adapter. However, on a laptop computer, you can never quite be sure which network adapter is first. Sometimes it is the wireless, sometimes the wired one depending on if there is an access point, if wireless is on etc. So our goal was to always use the wired connection.</p>
<p>We discussed with MSDN support, and they basically didn&#8217;t have an answer, so we ended up with an undocumented hack &#8212; ugly. Do you know the &quot;correct&quot; way to do this?</p>

		<p>@Fred:</p>
<p>There are wireless-specific NDIS OIDs, which only wireless NICs support. Just query the OID list.</p>
<p>@James:</p>
<p>Unlike most other devices, I&#8217;m not really sure if an application can really register for sound device removal notification, with RegisterDeviceNotification. Only the applications that use the new core audio APIs can use OnDeviceRemoved callback.</p>

		<p>Alexandre: I do web dev, so I don&#8217;t know all of the details of the Windows API. All I know is that:</p>
<p>1) It&#8217;s certainly possible for apps to compensate for me pulling the USB headset at any random time. World of Warcraft, for example, handles this correctly, although it causes a few dropped frames and a little disk thrashing. (Most other games don&#8217;t.)</p>
<p>2) Despite it being demonstrably possible, most applications screw it up. My &quot;favorite&quot; is a particular media playing application from Microsoft that not only stops playing its media when the USB headset is yanked, but then lies to me in the error message. &quot;No speakers are plugged-in&quot;&#8211; liar!</p>
<p>I have to close and re-open that app every time I either plug, or unplug, the USB headset. If a video game can get it right, you&#8217;d think an application that does nothing but play media could too.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not trying to pick on any particular app, because the problem is so widespread.</p>
<p>Just&#8230; look, if you write a Windows app that uses audio in any capacity, please go down to OfficeMax or Staples, get a cheap $20 USB headset from Logitech, and see what happens to your app when someone hot-swaps it. Make it part of your QA process. Thank you.</p>

		<p>@Ken Hagan,</p>
<p>reinterpret_cast doesn&#8217;t say &quot;watch out&quot;. It says to the compiler: don&#8217;t pay attention, nothing to watch here, I don&#8217;t care if I give you an arbitrary crap (even a &#8216;float&#8217;), just take its bits and put them to the pointer, and shut up. If you use reinterpret_cast to cast between float and int, you will get the result you don&#8217;t really want.</p>
<p>static_cast will give a compile error if you try to cast between incompatible types. This is why you should use it.</p>
<p>@Joe:</p>
<p>Placement &#8216;new&#8217; is not implicitly defined by the compiler. When one defines it explicitly, it mostly just returns the argument, being thus no better than a static cast.</p>
<p>I would not say the result of void* to type* cast is unspecified. Otherwise all malloc invocations in all C code in the world would rely on unspecified behavior.</p>

		<p>Fred, that&#8217;s a bad idea for so many reasons. My desktop has 3 network interfaces, one wired, one wireless (built-in) and one wireless (USB). Which MAC do you use?</p>
<p>Of course, you said you were going to always prefer the wired one&#8230; what if my USB interface was wired? Yes they exist, and yes they&#8217;re cheap and plentiful. Now what do you do? I could remove it at any second, and your &quot;machine fingerprint&quot; goes out the window.</p>
<p>Maybe I get a newer USB network interface and swap it in, or maybe I only have one that I shuttle between 4 computers. (Even worse, now I have 4 computers with the same &quot;fingerprint.&quot;)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what the &quot;correct&quot; way to do this is, but I imagine it&#8217;s along the lines of, &quot;don&#8217;t do it.&quot;</p>
<p>Whatever you do, though, please, *please* make it cope with hot-swappable USB hardware! I still can&#8217;t even count the number of applications that fail in retarded ways when I unplug my USB headset. (Yes, that&#8217;s right application writers: SOUND CARDS CAN BE USB! Get the memo, PLEASE!)</p>

		<p>[I would not say the result of void* to type* cast is unspecified.]</p>
<p>You would not say that, but the C++ standard does.</p>
<p>[Otherwise all malloc invocations in all C code in the world would rely on unspecified behavior.]</p>
<p>How are you using static_cast in C?</p>
<p>[When one defines it explicitly, it mostly just returns the argument, being thus no better than a static cast.]</p>
<p>One doesn&#8217;t define it explicitly. One&#8217;s compiler vendor supplies a header which takes advantage of known implementation defined behaviour to implement it.</p>

		<p>I suppose the simple way of dealing with hotplug audio is treating it as if it can fail.</p>
<p>Oh, audio playback failed? Close audio device. Reopen, maybe that reset it (does happen). If you don&#8217;t talk to a specific audio device but let Windows choose, reopening it should go to the next device.</p>
<p>If the open fails &#8211; oh so sorry, no audio for you.</p>

		<p>@James: I have one of those USB headphones&#8230; Never have any problems with it. You know why? I don&#8217;t yank it out while I&#8217;m using it&#8230; Just a thought :P</p>

		<p>The reason for asking for a wireless password twice is that windows isn&#8217;t able to verify it: connecting to a WEP network (at least) there&#8217;s no readily-spotted difference between what happens when you get your password wrong and what happens when there&#8217;s nothing on the network that responds to your packets.</p>
<p>Fred: How would you cope with a machine with multiple wired networks? &nbsp;Or none? &nbsp;You can&#8217;t just assume that &quot;the&quot; wired card is somehow magically constant. &nbsp;My machine, for instance, has several virtual network drivers installed that appear to be wired networks. &nbsp;One of the driver options, although I don&#8217;t use it, is to randomly select the MAC at boot time. Some machines have multiple real wired network cards. &nbsp;I have a webcam that when plugged in enumerates as a network device. &nbsp;One of my machines around here doesn&#8217;t have a wired network interface, it only has wireless. How would you stop all these things changing your machine fingerprint?</p>

		<p>&quot;reinterpret_cast doesn&#8217;t say &quot;watch out&quot;.&quot;</p>
<p>It does to me, but then again&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;It says to the compiler: don&#8217;t pay attention, nothing to watch here, &quot;</p>
<p>&#8230;I&#8217;m not a compiler. Sorry if the target of the &quot;watch out&quot; wasn&#8217;t clear. :)</p>

		<p>Joe: &quot;[I would not say the result of void* to type* cast is unspecified.]</p>
<p>You would not say that, but the C++ standard does.&quot;</p>
<p>No, it doesn&#8217;t. &nbsp;It&#8217;s much more complicated than that. &nbsp;Specifically, it gives two instances where the results are specified:</p>
<p>&quot;The null pointer value is converted to the null pointer value of the destination type.&quot;</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&quot;A value of type pointer to object converted to pointer to cv void and back, possibly with different cv-qualification, shall have its original value.&quot;</p>
<p>It gives an example of the latter:</p>
<p>T* p1 = new T;</p>
<p>const T* p2 = static_cast&lt;const T*&gt;(static_cast&lt;void*&gt;(p1));</p>
<p>bool b = p1 == p2; // b will have the value true.</p>

		<p>&#8230; and actually to give some more historical facts on the actual title of the blog (&quot;Why does the wireless connection dialog ask for your password twice?&quot;), remember the context in which this annoying little &quot;feature&quot; came to be?</p>
<p>In Windows XP it was not there. You could merely enter the WEP key in clear. It was introduced around the XP SP2 time frame.</p>
<p>Remember what was special about XP SP2? Big emphasis on security. Well, with this bias, we were pretty acceptant to much of the users complaints touching or seeming to come from a security / privacy side. Believe it or not, there were actually user complaints indicating that entering the WEP key should not be in clear.</p>
<p>So..</p>
<p>@JJJ (Apr 19 12:30p): No, this was not driven by stubborn stickines to dry specs but a case in which pulling the blanket on one end you uncover the other &#8211; all good intentions throughout :-). However we live in a changing world and you saw this corrected in the next releases..</p>
<p>@Gabe (Apr 19 1:09p): When considering that &quot;feature&quot; actually the scenario was considered to be a password configuration one. Remember, you are expected to enter the WEP key only once, when you connect the first time to the network and not each and every time you get in range.</p>
<p>@Random832 (Apr 20 4:20a): I am not sure I agree. Entering the WEP key is not similar to when you login. It is similar to when you configure say your email account in your client of choice and you enter the account&#8217;s password for the very first time (see above).</p>

		<p>As one privy to the (XP) Wireless Zero Configuration service (WZC), I can answer some of the questions and hopefully demistify some of the unknowns:</p>
<p>Re: &quot;(Theory: The wireless zero configuration service saw another access point and said, &quot;Hey, that access point over there looks much nicer than then one I&#8217;m currently connected to. I&#8217;m going to drop my current connection and see if maybe that other access point will go out with me.&quot; And then it went up to that other access point and asked it out on a date. When the other access point said no, it came crawling back to the original access point. Repeat.)&quot;</p>
<p>Actually: WZC was never that dumb. According to the initial requirements, WZC had to cover a case that in the early days of wireless connections was deemed to be common and important to solve: seamless connectivity switch betweeen overlapping networks (think different SSIDs, not Access Points). More specifically: you have a subscription to network A you want to use, but happen to be in the coverage of the paid network B. Your configuration includes both network A and B, in this priority order and you are merely connected to B. As you move into an area where A becomes available, while still under the coverage of network B, as per WZC requirements, connection was expected to switch automatically to network A.This is where the &quot;Z&quot; in WZC came from (*zero* configuration).</p>
<p>Now in order to cover this functionality, first WZC configured the wireless NIC with all the settings needed for connecting and holding the connection to network B. Then, every once in a while (1min) two commands were issued to the NIC driver:</p>
<p>1) &#8211; &quot;scan the environment for new wireless beacons&quot;</p>
<p>2) &#8211; &quot;give me the list of beacons detected&quot;.</p>
<p>With these two answered, WZC can make the decision to switch if any better network is available, but if not, no further action was taken and the wireless driver was left untouched with the same settings that were expected to hold the connection to network B active and well.</p>
<p>The ability to scan the environment while retaining the connection to some network was a requirement on the driver implementer, specified in the IEEE 802.11 spec, and WZC was making use of it.</p>
<p>Reallity is that in those early days implementing correctly such behavior at NIC driver level was challenging. The driver had to put shortly on hold the current connection while using the radio to scan all channels. Depending on the NIC manufacturer and driver developer, having the connection dropped in this process was fairly common. When such thing happened, once scan completed, the NIC automatically reattached to the network for which it was configured. Everything happened under the hood, WZC didn&#8217;t have any action to take and this is the reason why the &quot;constant dropping connection&quot; was only happening for some and not for others &#8211; all depending on the kind of wireless NIC and driver you had.</p>
<p>With the facts right, now you can see why the approach described in this blog solves the problem: once you have the connection set, as you stop WZC there is no software component asking for a periodic rescan, hence the driver is not asked to do what it should do and doesn&#8217;t do well, so the connection is retained. However, along with that you loose the functionality described above (seamless switch to the more preferred network) for which the scan was intended. But of course, time proved that&#8217;s a feature not as common as thought..</p>
