		<p>It&#8217;s interesting to consider that as much as Americans claim to dislike lawyers and court, it&#8217;s still the case that the legal system is an important tool for Americans in the overall course of their lives, and that in two indigenous sports (baseball and NFL football), the act of contesting a call engages a very formalized shadow-puppet version of the US legal system, with precedents, appeals, statutes of limitations, in football &quot;loser pays&quot; court costs with a timeout and so forth. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Is it just me, or does Raymond seem to be describing some of the duties of an Engineering Architect (what I do) during the development phase of a project&#8230; The design phase makes the rules, the development phase has the developers (players) making the product (release) according to those rules and we, the architects, oversee that creation according to the rules we made during the design phase (or adjusting them as necessary). Programmers often attempt to cheat&#8230; each other, themselves, whatever, by taking shortcuts or interpreting the &#8220;rules&#8221; (designs) as they see fit. </p>
<p>Is it me or am I over-engineering Raymond&#8217;s post?</p>

		<p>I do have to ask, what does this have to do with the lymphatic system ?</p>
<p>It feels like there is more to the analogy than just the fact that the umpires enforce the game rules ?</p>

		<p>I was the umpire at the game Raymond saw, which was a rather routine game.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been yelled at, but it&#8217;s quite rare and gets rarer with more experience. The more games you work, the better you get at controlling the overall flow of the game and doing subtle things that reinforce the umpire&#8217;s authority instead of undermining it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also seen other umpires handle situations poorly, lose respect and control, and get verbally abused to the point that they refuse to do it any more.</p>
<p>Certainly some games are less fun than others, but overall I enjoy it or I wouldn&#8217;t keep doing it.</p>

		<p>Forgive me for my lack of knowledge &#8211; I grew up with cricket instead of baseball. But in reading about the Pine Tar incident, I see that the illegal bat was used to make a 3-4 deficit into a 5-4 lead; then when the bat was ruled illegal, the 3-4 deficit was reinstated.</p>
<p>That being the case, why did the game resume at 5-4? Surely the bat was illegal; shouldn&#8217;t the game have stood at 3-4, and someone should have needed to score a run?</p>
<div class=post>[<i>The decision of the umpire on the field was overturned, and the home run was permitted to stand, restoring the score to 5-4. It was a very confusing game. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Is there really an appeals process? I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen a play changed because a player or manager disagreed with an umpire. </p>
<div class=post>[<i>You cannot appeal a decision that is based on the umpire&#8217;s judgement; you can only appeal decisions based on misapplication of the rules. For example, if the umpire awards a runner the wrong number of bases after the ball leaves the field of play.

		<p>Gabe,</p>
<p>The appeals process is typically about asking related questions rather than changing the actual call. &nbsp;For example, the classic appeal that happens constantly in MLB games is about whether or not a batter successfully checked his swing. &nbsp;The home plate umpire has the initial call but the player can ask for a ruling from a different umpire. &nbsp;Similar appeals are involved with situations like when a runner skips a base.</p>

<p>David, I think the decision was that the umpire was incorrect in ruling that the illegal bat caused the play itself to become illegal. &nbsp;I believe that as soon as the play happens, the fact that the bat is illegal is irrelevant. &nbsp;The manager would have had to challenge the bat before it was used, which would have resulted in the bat being removed from the game.</p>

		<p>The book &quot;As They See &#8216;Em&quot; is a fascinating book. &nbsp;After reading it, now, while watching a game, I often notice umpires moving around so they can get in position to make a call. &nbsp;Before reading the book, I didn&#8217;t pay attention to that. &nbsp;Knowing why the umpires are moving the way they are makes the game more interesting.</p>
<p>One thing I didn&#8217;t know before reading the book is how thankless, poorly paid, and grueling minor-league umpiring is (driving your own car 400 miles between games, and sleeping in cheap motels, for example).</p>
<p>One interesting thing mentioned in the book featured a reporter interviewing the (I think) third base umpire about some call or other during a game.</p>
<p>The umpire informed the reporter that he wasn&#8217;t actually at third base for the call in question, since he and all of the other umpires had &quot;rotated&quot; during the play, as the play unfolded, to be in the best positions to see what might happen. &nbsp;They were all in the right place, just not in their original positions, where the reporter thought they would be.</p>

		<p>GregM is correct. The penalty for using illegal equipment is to remove the illegal equipment at when it is discovered. The umpire cannot nullify any play that occurred using the illegal equipment prior to it&#8217;s being discovered &#8212; even if on an adjacent play. </p>
<p>This is covered under Rule 1.10. See particularly 1.10(c)-Note.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Note that Rule 1.10(c) was added&nbsp;as a result of the Pine Tar incident. At the time the incident occurred, the penalty for hitting the ball with an illegal bat was that the batter be declared out. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>&quot;You cannot appeal a decision that is based on the umpire&#8217;s judgement.&quot; &nbsp;Very rarely, though, an umpire will huddle with the other umpires to talk, and they&#8217;ll figure out who had the best view. &nbsp;They sometimes reverse one umpire&#8217;s initial decision after this kind of conference.</p>
<p>In order to instill their authority, however, they almost never reverse their own rulings just because a player or manager yells at them or questions them&#8230; &nbsp;Which makes it hard to understand why players and managers yell at the umpires so often. &nbsp;One Atlanta Braves player came from Cuba, where, apparently, the players can intimidate the umpires. &nbsp;He liked to argue with them, presumably expecting them to reverse a ball and strike call. &nbsp;That never happens.</p>

		<p>To me, the most amazing part of that Pine Tar incident was that a sports game somehow involved the *Supreme Court*, and not because of a murder or anything, but in the course of the sport itself.</p>
<p>Then again I&#8217;m not an American. </p>

		<p>I saw a successful reversal based on a manager yelling for the first time this summer in an MLB game.</p>
<p>Joe Mauer of the Twins was hit by a pitch and the umpire made a call that the pitch didn&#8217;t hit him as the batter was trotting to first base. &nbsp;The manager came out screaming about it, and eventually got the umpire to notice the giant swollen red lump on the batters hand where he had just been hit. &nbsp;I was pretty amused.</p>

		<p>@Mike K</p>
<p>That reminds me of a famous incident that occurred during the 1969 World Series. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve forgotten who the batter was, but he claimed that a pitch had struck him in the foot, which the umpire denied. The umpire reversed his decision after being shown the ball itself, which was now adorned with a large smudge of shoe polish.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Ah, the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uuv1MUlXEmA" rel="nofollow">Shoe Polish Play</a> in 1969, which echoes <a href="http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history.do?action=Article&amp;id=57368" rel="nofollow">a similar incident from 1957</a>. When you watch the clip, notice that the manager who prevails is the one who remains calm, not the one who comes out yelling. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Well, Raymond, you may not have intended it as allegory, but, upon further thought, I see it as more and more accurately recognizing the actions of a line architect&#8230; I&#8217;m constantly correcting &quot;players&quot; regarding the &quot;rules&quot; and they regularly yell at me for it, but cannot win&#8230; I have to predict where the &quot;play&quot; will be and ensure that I am there long before the &quot;players&quot; arrive to make sure that things happen correctly and legitimately. I am, more or less, outside the engineering management circle, subject to a different set of management.</p>
<p>Hehe, without intending it, I think you pulled it off&#8230;</p>
