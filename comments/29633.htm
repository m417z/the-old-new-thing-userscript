		<p>Irrational behaviour fascinatates and annoys me. </p>
<p>It is fascinating because I wonder, &quot;Why are they doing that?&quot;</p>
<p>It annoys me because &#8230; erm &#8230; it is not rational and so what is the point?</p>
<p>I wonder what sort of survival benefit this type of behaviour conferred.</p>

		<p>I hope your wrong this year, Raymond, but we&#8217;ll soon see. One year our division was given small cowbells&#8230; [hangs head in shame]</p>

		<p>I associate that sort of mindless ra-ra-ism with Microsoft!</p>
<p>There&#8217;s any number of videos on the web showing Steve Ballmer screaming in some sort of our-team-is-the-best kind of way. He&#8217;s an intelligent guy, so I guess that sort of behaviour works for whatever it is he hopes to achieve.</p>
<p>In my own limited experience, I once attended a Microsoft presentation about some product-or-other. The presenter, allegedly a techie of some kind, nevertheless managed to whip the crowd into a frenzy by hurling free T-shirts at them. &nbsp;(I was sort of hoping one would come my way so I could drop it disdainfully on the floor &#8211; I don&#8217;t wear adverts).</p>
<p>All in all, an awful lot of corporate Kool Aid seemed to get drunk at Microsoft in the &#8217;90s.</p>

		<p>The same thing happens every May at every high school graduation in the country. &nbsp;Want to hear your daughter&#8217;s name announced? &nbsp;Better hope she doesn&#8217;t fall behind a really popular person or someone with a large family present.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s time for a little Fisking&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;I associate that sort of mindless ra-ra-ism with Microsoft!&quot;</p>
<p>Because you believe Microsoft is comprised of mindless cheerleader types? Have you not read Mini-Msft, we don&#8217;t all cheer mindlessly but fromt his poitn forward I&#8217;ll associate mindless generalizations with you.</p>
<p>&quot;There&#8217;s any number of videos on the web showing Steve Ballmer screaming in some sort of our-team-is-the-best kind of way.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeah, it would be better if he got up in front of the whole company and screamed how much we suck. While most agree he goes a bit over the top that is kind of the purpose of the company meeting.</p>
<p>&quot;He&#8217;s an intelligent guy, so I guess that sort of behavior works for whatever it is he hopes to achieve.&quot;</p>
<p>You really can&#8217;t figure out what he is trying to achieve?</p>
<p>&quot;In my own limited experience, I once attended a Microsoft presentation about some product-or-other. The presenter, allegedly a techie of some kind, nevertheless managed to whip the crowd into a frenzy by hurling free T-shirts at them.&quot;</p>
<p>Allegedly a techie? Did the hurling of t-shirts and trying to to get the audience excited about the product void their techie credentials ro something?</p>
<p>&quot;(I was sort of hoping one would come my way so I could drop it disdainfully on the floor &#8211; I don&#8217;t wear adverts).&quot;</p>
<p>This is really the most revealing sentence in your little note. Clearly you are a pompous ass who believes that all of that rah-rah is beneath him and loosk for opportunities to insult those who don&#8217;t agree. Do me a favor, never come to any presentaion where I am possibly present&#8230;make that never go to a presentation because you are clearly there for the wrong reasons.</p>
<p>&quot;All in all, an awful lot of corporate Kool Aid seemed to get drunk at Microsoft in the &#8217;90s.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, clearly there was no cause for celebration at MS in the 90s&#8230;</p>

		<p>Speaking as a complete and total Microsoft outsider: Yes, &quot;Fisk&quot;, tell &lt;i&gt;Raymond freakin&#8217; Chen&lt;/i&gt; that his Microsoft purity is low. </p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t make you look like an idiot, no, not at all.</p>
<p>I can see why you chose to attempt to purify the ranks anonymously.</p>

		<p>Wow, this seems to be a touchy topic. Sometimes groups of people get a little insular, within themselves they develop behaviour that is annoying. It passes. Probably what would be good is a pre-meeting cheer session &#8211; get it out of them &#8211; have a competition to see which group can cheer the loudest, then get on with it. If people cheer themselves hoarse it tends to make them quiet later on.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m still laughing at the corporate kool-aid debate. People should be allowed to get enthusiastic about their job, afterall it takes up a good part of their life. I guess we could all hide away in a down trodden environment, but I know what sort of company I would rather work for.</p>

		<p>I suppose this is the place for a complete stranger to walk in and state the obvious: Jeremy Bowser &#8211; please take the time to read the whole discussion before bashing others.</p>
<p>Now back off topic, I went to the introduction conference for SQL Server; and my God &#8211; was that a bloated piece of cheering for nothing. I suppose it worked for the non-techies, however I felt a bit out side. I mean &quot;Yay, we have a new GUI&quot; is not my favorite addiction.</p>
<p>And I have to say, I disagree with Raymon. Cheering your</p>

		<p>Everyone should chill. &nbsp;It&#8217;s all really just a reason to get exited. &nbsp;Some people enjoy getting exited, especially in a group. &nbsp;Some even consider it fun!</p>

		<p>So did your fears come true, Raymond? &nbsp;If so, who was the guilty group and did they obscure any important parts of the meeting?</p>

		<p>re:</p>
<p>&gt; I&#8217;m still laughing at the corporate kool-aid<br />
<br />&gt; debate. People should be allowed to get<br />
<br />&gt; enthusiastic about their job, afterall it takes<br />
<br />&gt; up a good part of their life. I guess we could<br />
<br />&gt; all hide away in a down trodden environment, but<br />
<br />&gt; I know what sort of company I would rather work<br />
<br />&gt; for.</p>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m pretty enthusiastic about my job. I can&#8217;t think of much worse than going to a job I didn&#8217;t enjoy, or working with a team that didn&#8217;t think they were doing something worthwhile.</p>
<p>But there&#8217;s honest enthusiasm and then there&#8217;s the whip-the-crowd-into-a-frenzy showmanship. It&#8217;s the latter that I don&#8217;t like.<br /></p>

		<p>Reminds me of the cheering from the SpotWatch team a few years back. &nbsp;I believe the rest of the company groaned at the same time. &nbsp;</p>
