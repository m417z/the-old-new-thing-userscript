		<p>I totally agree. This sounds a lot like a Joel Spolsky article on a similar topic. If you want a false sense of productivity, just provide a well-defined set of metrics to judge by. The developers will quickly learn to maximize the metrics, even at the cost of actual productive work. The way to get what you really want is to build a team of reliable people and instill a common ideal of workmanship, quality, and teamwork among them.</p>

		<p>In the example given, part of the problem is that programmers are expected to work together as a team, but are judged individually. Perhaps one should count the total number of bugs at each severity level &amp; show a bar graph over time of those counts. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>I think it describes some people I&#39;ve worked with. &nbsp;I do a lot of installation work, and one particular developer would bounce most bugs my way because &quot;it could be the install!&quot; &nbsp;Of course, many of them turned out to be application bugs.</p>

		<p>If I caught him at that, my response would be to code an autojob that sent bugs assigned to me after 4:30PM back to the previous owner (use snapshot if necessary). It would run at 4:30PM to snapshot, then 3AM to assign.</p>

<p>It just wasn&#39;t designed with cheating programmers in mind. You don&#39;t want to have cheaters in your team.</p>
<p>But even without cheaters the metric is stupid.</p>

		<p>Analagous gameable metrics for the QA types are count of bugs filed or fixed (the former is merely a nuisance for the developer, the latter will have QA in your face all the time) and number of test cases written.</p>

		<p>I used to work in retail non commission and management would measure the &quot;Attachment Rates&quot; of accessories and warranties. so if you sold $10,000 in product and $1,000 of it was from warranties you would have an attachment rate of 10%. Guess what happened when someone wanted to buy a $2,000 TV with no warranty or accessories. I would try to either internally lose the sale or pass it off to someone else. and good luck if they needed to apply for credit to make the purchase.</p>

		<p>Seems like a pretty foolish strategy, not to mention futile. &nbsp;The bug recipients would pick up on the pattern quickly and there&#39;s a perfect paper trail in the defect tracking system documenting the developer&#39;s bad behavior. &nbsp;In any case, the bugs would eventually boomerang if they were genuinely in the code owned by the bad developer.</p>

		<p>You don&#39;t need to be particularly malicious to be perversely motivated by bug counting. A couple of years ago the Dev Manager of the team I was in challenged everybody to fix more bugs than him in a given week as an attempt to drive numbers down. The Dev Lead accepted the bet and raised it for his own team. Nobody (that I was aware of) tried to cheat the system, yet I noticed a small increase in the sloppiness of the work done that week, developers were not as through in their work and rushed to get fixes in. Until then my feature team had been following the practice of writing new unit-tests to expose some of the bugs found at higher levels by hand. We used these tests to exercise fixes and prevent regressions in that area. Well, this practice was the first thing to fly out of the window under the pressure to fix more bugs quicker. It wasn&#39;t cheating, and it wasn&#39;t malicious, for the unit-tests were not a requirement to claim a bug fix, just part of that team&#39;s own philosophy, yet they contributed to better code in the longer run. As a result, the quality of the code went a little down, and the rate of regressions went at little up, but by the time these problems showed up everybody was happy with how quick we were fixing bugs, and god knows we had to fix them quick as they were turning in pretty fast. By then nobody would remember that these problems were partially a consequence of a culture that rewards corrective repair over preventive action &#8212; you don&#39;t get to claim the bugs you never had to fix in your code.</p>

		<p>&quot;In any case, the bugs would eventually boomerang if they were genuinely in the code owned by the bad developer.&quot;</p>
<p>So long as it boomerange&#39;s away when your manager is looking and boomerang&#39;s back when he is not this is not a problem. Most managers relying on metrics are less then attentive to their staffs daily work and check the numbers a given number of times a week/day/month. So if you know your manager runs his status report at 4 P.M. on Friday, you ship it to somoneone else and when it comes back to you on monday you&#39;ve got all week to fix it.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m reminded of a few similar stories &#8211; the company which rewarded testers for finding bugs (so the testers befriended developers, who would then insert trivial &#39;bugs&#39; to be found) and developers (who then got rewarded for &#39;fixing&#39; the trivial &#39;bugs&#39; they had inserted for their tester friends to find) &#8230; and the tale of the developer who re-wrote a large and complex graphics routine to be much more straightforward, shaving two thousand lines of code off the total source size. Then comes time to record the company&#39;s chosen metric: &quot;lines of code contributed&quot;. After a little thought, he put in &quot;-2000&quot;. I wonder what kind of bonus that cost him&#8230;</p>

<p>Maybe the developer can claim the negative LOC like carbon credits and use them towards any particularly sloppy code that he generates in the next year :)</p>

		<p>At work we have a little list of open, waiting for info, next sp statistics for bugs and incidents. We all try our best to keep the numbers low, as they are just totals. So shifting bugs around won&#39;t help anyone (and also, once you are done with your own bugs, you are expected to help others fix theirs, so shifting won&#39;t help you much).</p>
<p>ps @Gabe: I think he put it in the queue before Dilbert even existed :P</p>
