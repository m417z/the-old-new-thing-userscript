		<p>I know this is a Little Program (or is it?) but the cleanup semantics for GetBrowserInfo are a little confusing&#8230; it seems like in some code paths, it can return a successful HRESULT, but still hand a chunk of memory back to its caller which it expects its caller to deallocate.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m curious about your parenthetical remark that Shell&shy;Windows could be a place for other web browsers to register themselves, and thus somehow become integrated into the shell. Was this something that was a design goal and just never caught on? What advantages would there be for the user if other browsers did that?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>I don&#39;t know whether that was the intent, but it&#39;s there if they want it. It would allow the user to be able to control browser windows via script, which is something people seem really keen on doing to IE windows, so I assume they&#39;re keen on doing it with other browser windows too. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>While we all appreciate your detailed and helpful articles about Windows programming, we could also do without being told to suck your dick. I’m not sure what you’re trying to accomplish by making such statements, but I hope you can find a less offensive way to do it in the future.</p>

		<p>@Andrew:</p>
<p>Wasn&#39;t he actually saying to suck his website?</p>
<p>All he said was to suck it, which is more likely short for suck it up, a USA informal way of saying put up with something difficult. It was you who managed to put two and two together and ended up so far away from four.</p>

		<p>I assume he&#39;s no native speaker and misread &quot;suck it&quot; as being offensive. But maybe he&#39;d better be quiet about things instead of running on assumptions.</p>
<p>(Ok, I&#39;m no native speaker myself. But I&#39;m pretty sure it doesn&#39;t fit Raymond&#39;s style of writing to say what Andrew accused him of)</p>

		<p>So, which is more efficient, PWSTR or BSTR?</p>
<p>Also, other browsers probably only implement MSAA.</p>

		<p>More efficient in what respect? While they both encode strings as UTF-16 character sequences and are NUL-terminated they differ in the following aspects:</p>
<p>BSTR&#39;s have an explicit length field, PWSTR&#39;s do not.</p>
<p>BSTR&#39;s can have embedded NUL characters, PWSTR&#39;s cannot.</p>

		<p>Actually, &quot;suck it&quot; isn&#39;t without a really, really bad connotation. No matter what &quot;it&quot; is.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/suck_it">en.wiktionary.org/&#8230;/suck_it</a></p>
<p>&quot;Suck it up&quot; would be much, much more appropriate.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/suck_it_up">en.wiktionary.org/&#8230;/suck_it_up</a></p>
<p>Better yet, don&#39;t use &quot;suck&quot; in it.</p>
<p>@Neil, whatever you want, really. If you have to translate from/to one of them, that&#39;s the least efficient one. Pick the one you&#39;ll need to translate the least.</p>
<p>Or, put up some code that actually tests e.g. the allocation and freeing functions, although I think you won&#39;t find out anything spectacular there.</p>

		<p>Obviously it was meant tongue in cheek here, but the phrase &quot;suck it&quot; has a pretty well understood meaning. &nbsp;Some developer was fired over a stupid joke about dongles (and the ensuing attention it received) so it&#39;s always good advice to watch what you say.</p>

		<p>@voo: &nbsp;Sorry, but offense is in the eye of the beholder. &nbsp;That it doesn&#39;t offend you or me doesn&#39;t mean it doesn&#39;t offend someone else. &nbsp;Yes, this brings the threshold down to the lowest common denominator, but that&#39;s just the PC world we live in.</p>

		<p>Wow some people really have a thin hide.. and interpret way too much into rather informal sayings.</p>
<p>And the &quot;not a native speaker&quot; excuse is rather weak, because I bet several people here aren&#39;t either (wait, I *know* that for a fact, because English certainly isn&#39;t my first language) and didn&#39;t get offended without doing at least a bit of research over a phrase they&#39;re apparently unfamiliar with. Although I assume getting offended by things one doesn&#39;t understand is pretty basic human nature.</p>
