		<p>It was pretty obvious that someone would use Lidar to solve this problem sooner or later. What&#8217;s a wonder is that casinos didn&#8217;t change their practices to disallow any bets placed after the ball was in motion.</p>

		<p>If they disallow bets after the ball is moving ththen it becomes more clearly a game of chance and so less attractive. By allowing late bets they have allowed people to fool themselves into thinking they&#8217;re making a skilled judgement of where the ball will go, while actually doing no better than random choice. Apparently some people really are now able to make such a judgement, though whether it seems unclear whether that involves using technology or skill. Ideally the casinos would like to ban the second group while keeping the first group playing.</p>

		<p>There was a book called something like &quot;The Eudaemonic Pie&quot; about some hippy-hacker-types who built computers in their shoes to beat roulette.  I think it was late 70&#8217;s.  I&#8217;d recommend it &#8211; it&#8217;s an amusing read.</p>

		<p>I thought the computers in the heel were for card-counting in order to win at Blackjack?</p>

		<p>The usefulness of computers in your shoes is limited only by your imagination.  But in the book I cited, they were for cheating at roulette.  (But I read it about 10 years ago, so there is a chance I&#8217;m wrong)</p>

		<p>Well, only in England, if you did this in Vegas you would be in jail using any device that can calculate the odds for you is illegal. Either by aiding you to count cards, or predicting which quadrant of the wheel the ball will land in.</p>
<p>Of course if you can do it in your head it&#8217;s fine, just don&#8217;t go overboard.</p>
<p>As an aside they did the shoe computer to beat roulette in an episode of CSI last year.</p>

<p>I always thought that it was retarded that casinos exist to rip people off, yet you can get ejected for winning too much.</p>

		<p>Well, the more objective way of stating it is they allow you to play games (that are stacked against you), but you&#8217;re not allowed to cheat.</p>
<p>I was in Vegas a few weeks ago.  My gf bought one of those blackjack strategy cards (on the suggestion of a dealer).  You&#8217;re allowed to use them at the table, but at 2 different casinos the bosses asked to see the card &quot;to make sure it was right.&quot;  It was a little odd &#8211; I&#8217;m not sure what they were looking for.</p>
<p>/still lost<br /></p>

		<p>Hi there Folks</p>
<p>If using Roulette Computers is illegal because you say it is cheating, then the Casinos are the biggest villans out there!</p>
<p>They are paying odds less  than the true odds to staret with, so they in fact cheating!</p>
<p>Using Roulette Computers is legal in most parts of the world, not illegal!</p>
<p>Only a few states in the US prohibit it.</p>
<p>I sell Roulette Computer hardware and software to beat roulette and give personal demonstrations, obtaining around 1 in 18 on the exact number!</p>
<p>I can have most people using this successfully in about 1 hour.</p>
<p>If you wish to come and view for yourself, even out of interest, come and see me in the UK!</p>
<p>Its not for everyone, it does require a bit of nerve and cheek, but the rewards are fantastic!</p>
<p>Check out my site&gt;</p>

<p>PS THe Serbian Team with the Hungarian Lady have just taken $266,000 out of St.Maatens in the Carribean, the casinos stoped the wheels going for several hours and the lady was stopped leaving the casino, but later somehow got away!</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t find the info regarding this anywhere else :-)</p>
