		<p>Magic Soap is going to kill us all. (just kidding). I&#39;m not a doctor, but it&#39;s my understanding that the &quot;rinsing&quot; is the most important part of washing, not the &quot;killing bacteria&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Chad,</p>
<p>That depends on what your goals are though. &nbsp;Studies have shown that &quot;Magic Soap&quot; is better than hand washing for non-visible dirt (i.e. germs). &nbsp;So if your about to hit up a buffet, shake someone&#39;s hand, or the like, that stuff is where to go.</p>
<p>Rising is good for &quot;visable dirt&quot; (i.e. the Chocolate muffin.&quot; &nbsp;So if your about to play the piano, rinising become good.</p>

		<p>A children&#39;s piano recital is a pretty effective way of spreading germs. &nbsp;My son performed at one, going up after a little girl with a very runny nose. &nbsp;He was sick the next day&#8230;</p>

		<p>probably need more context, but the hand sanitizer would work well in many cases, right?</p>

		<p>Humans (most humans) have immune systems. &nbsp;The over-use of hand sanitizer has been criticized by some doctors for contributing to the spread of sanitizer-resistant bacteria. &nbsp;The survival of the fittest, etc. when you don&#39;t kill every last germ.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not in a position to know whether that&#39;s true or not, but I don&#39;t carry hand sanitizer around with me to use every waking moment.</p>
<p>If you or your niece ARE concerned about germs, then your niece should hope that the previous piano players had washed or sanitized THEIR hands. &nbsp;She shouldn&#39;t care whether her hands were sanitary!</p>
<p>On the other hand (so to speak) washing hands is a great way to keep chocolate off of a piano.</p>

		<p>The purpose is not so the piano doesn&#39;t get sick, but it does help for the next person to tickle the ivories. A piano with sticky keys can make for some interesting improvisations to well-known pieces.</p>

		<p>Before reading this post I had never heard of hand sanitizer. Must be a cultural thing.</p>

		<p>I worked as a programmer in an IT department that often sent techs out to work on people&#39;s computers within the building. On occasion I went along. These were computers of professional, white-collar personnel. There is nothing so gross as the keyboards of many of those folks. Dirt, grime, cookie crumbs, spilled fluids, beard hair (I hope it was <em>beard</em> hair), lint, and whatever was smeared and pressed into the keyboards. Needless to say, the techs did as much remote assistance as possible.</p>
<p>Check your keyboard now. Shame on you.</p>

		<p>@Jondr why don&#39;t you bring your keyboard along? Virtually all machines have USB ports right now.</p>
<p>(It this is re-post, sorry. The first try did not go through).</p>

		<p>I would assume you wash your hands before playing the piano, so the piano doesn&#39;t get sick (that is, the piano keys stay nice and healthy and don&#39;t get all sticky or get stuff between the keys)</p>

		<p>The kids don&#39;t think their hands are dirty because they themselves would be willing to lick their fingers. &nbsp;&quot;Dirty&quot; is when you&#39;ve got mud or something on there, right? &nbsp;Food isn&#39;t dirt!</p>
<p>I suspect many programmers have a similar attitude to code. &nbsp;&quot;I don&#39;t need to test this routine. &nbsp;I wrote it myself. &nbsp;I don&#39;t see any scope for bugs in that.&quot;</p>

		<p>@J. Peterson: Then this illness was not caused by playing the &#39;infected&#39; piano. The incubation time of a common cold is longer.</p>

<p>Futher &#39;Magic Soap&#39; only kill bacterias, AFAIK, and most diseases which you could get from a piano are caused by a virus. So washing with soap and a lot of water is a better idea. (And it also removes chocolate).</p>

		<p>Yes, @Mijzelf, viruses are generally harder to kill than bacteria. &nbsp;I wish it were not so.</p>
