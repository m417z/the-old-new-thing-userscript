		<p>But in order to exploit it, the attacker needs to convince you, the administrator, to run an executable from a shortcut they control.</p>
<p>After all, if they didn&#8217;t control the shortcut, they wouldn&#8217;t be able to set the &quot;start in&quot; directory to one with their evil DLL.</p>
<p>But if the attacker convinces you to &quot;run as administrator&quot; a shortcut they control, haven&#8217;t they already got to the other side of the airtight hatchway? Can&#8217;t they just set the shortcut to point to an evil EXE instead of using a known EXE with an evil DLL?</p>
<p>Or am I missing something?</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m also intrigued to know what criteria is used to separate &quot;Windows binaries&quot; from the rest.)</p>

		<p>Not really, they&#8217;d only have to convince you to drop a named DLL into a given, unprotected folder where you are likely to load something with adminstrative rights.</p>
<p>Think, maybe, your Documents folder. I imagine a good many people have command prompts or other applications that open with that as the current directory. I can&#8217;t imagine it&#8217;s that hard to use social engineering to get people to download a dll there and wait for the time bomb to go off.</p>
<p>Same could be said of the system drive root, the desktop, or for us developers our build or tools directory.</p>

		<p>Does Vista have a &quot;sudo&quot; equivalent?</p>
<p>All too often, I type a command and get a snarky &quot;This requires elevation&quot; message. &nbsp;That means I have to find a cmd.exe shortcut, right-click it, select &quot;Run as administrator&quot;, wait five seconds for the UAC prompt to appear, click &quot;Continue&quot;, navigate to the directory I was in, and retry the command. &nbsp;Enough of a hassle that I just might disable UAC (and then disable all tray warnings to make Vista stop complaining that UAC is disabled).</p>

		<p>&quot;An attacker can drop a DLL into a directory and trick you into running a program with that directory as its current directory. When that program tries to load a library that normally doesn&#8217;t exist, the one the attacker created will be found and loaded.&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I buy the reasoning behind this. &nbsp;If the attacker can get you to modify a shortcut to change the current directory in order to load his dll, why wouldn&#8217;t he be able to trick you into just copying his dll to the system directory? &nbsp;I guess it&#8217;s good to close off an attack vector, but I think the same people who would modify their shortcut would also probably just copy the dll to the system directory.</p>
<p>UAC does nothing to address the underlying problem of ignorant users. &nbsp;People just see a dialog and click Yes/Allow without even reading it, much less understanding the implications of it. &nbsp;I guess it gives the rest of us one last chance before our machines get owned, so it&#8217;s not completely useless.</p>

		<p>Is it just me, or does this sound like another case of &quot;make programs jump through unnecessary hoops just to operate safely with Windows&quot;? (Shatter attack, anyone?) I know it&#8217;s too late to change this behaviour, but it seems awfully alot like that.</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t understand this reasoning. Natural curiosity has been a part of the human race since its inception, why try to change the way people think instead of designing something to work with how they think ?</p>

		<p>John: Replacing a file in the system directory isn&#8217;t that easy to do anymore. It involves taking ownership of the file in question and then changing permissions on the file.</p>
<p>As for the utility of the UAC prompt, I think it&#8217;s pretty useless if you run as an administrator all the time, but running with elevated privileges for day-to-day use is silly ,anyway. I run as a non-administrative user (and non-pretty-much-everything-else), so when I get a UAC prompt I have to stop and type the Administrator&#8217;s password to confirm the action. That definitely makes me pay a little more attention.</p>

		<p>Why even fiddling with a shortcut to an evil binary? Just make the shortcut itself a binary. Due to the stupidities of ShellExecuteEx(), a binary renamed to .pif or .lnk will execute as well.</p>
<p>But I have another question: Is there a way to change the search order arbitrarily, not just the two variants offered by the SafeDllSearch configuration entry? I&#8217;d like to have the %PATH% before the system directory, so I can have a user&#8217;s program loading updated DLLs without replacing the system&#8217;s DLL.</p>

		<p>I think changing the search order arbitrarily would count as &quot;one of those things that developers would abuse&quot;. &nbsp;I might be wrong but I thought LoadLibrary looked in the program&#8217;s directory first anyway.</p>

		<p>Triangle: &nbsp;Because no matter how good your system is, at some point the decision will ultimately fall on the user. &nbsp;Normal people (and I don&#8217;t mean this in a condescending way) don&#8217;t think about computers the same way we do. &nbsp;As long as those people are kept in the decision making process, they are prone to making bad decisions. &nbsp;Unfortunately, computers are complicated and most people are unwilling to learn.</p>

		<p>This is definitely not the airtight hatchway situation due to the &quot;My Documents&quot; scenario above. &nbsp;Or consider a Virus Scanner &#8211; many virus scanners run as a service of some form or fashion. &nbsp;Imagine if they managed to slip a DLL into C:ProgramDataRandomProduct or some such and then you, to work around an issue, need to launch the Live Updater through an elevated cmd.exe</p>
<p>RandomProduct has a file called securfile.dll and so they throw a file called securfile.dll in there without so much as requiring any admin privileges and now you&#8217;ve installed a trojan that has now been given full administrative privileges and there was no way you could have ever worked around it.</p>
<p>Or similarly from a shortcut &#8211; install the same file and say the Magic Update shortcut has a start in that points to C:ProgramDataRandomProduct. &nbsp;It auto-elevates as necessary and again &#8211; you&#8217;ve installed a trojan without so much as being able to prevent it or know about it beforehand.</p>

		<p>But still, in order for this to be a problem it requires three things:</p>
<p> &nbsp;1. A user-modifiable folder.</p>
<p> &nbsp;2. A user-modifiable shortcut with Start In set to #1.</p>
<p> &nbsp;3. An admin who will accept elevation using #2, and then run a program that uses a DLL included in #1.</p>
<p>So any folders/shortcuts set with permissions that prevent non-admins from modifying them are automatically safe, and could have been left alone.</p>
<p>And any user-modifiable elevating shortcuts are automatically dangerous, no matter what the Start In is &#8212; since the rogue user/program can just change the Target to whatever evil app they want. &nbsp;(Although the elevation prompt may show the difference in that case, so hopefully the real app is signed and the admin is paying attention.)</p>

		<p>From John:</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>If the attacker can get you to modify a shortcut to change the current directory in order to load his dll, why wouldn&#8217;t he be able to trick you into just copying his dll to the system directory?</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>The system directory is usually very protected on a normal Windows configuration. It&#8217;s not write-able by non-admin users.</p>
<p>However, the temporary download directory of a Web browser will typically be in a directory write-able by the user.</p>
<p>Assume a user running a browser with a non-admin user account.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to imagine that an average security flaw of a browser may let a DLL be downloaded to the temp download directory without user consent (or maybe, he accidentally downloaded a file he didn&#8217;t want to, with a &quot;quick download&quot; shortcut key).</p>
<p>Then, the user may download a trusted signed installer from another site and carefully execute it with admin rights from the temporary download directory.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>UAC does nothing to address the underlying problem of ignorant users. &nbsp;People just see a dialog and click Yes/Allow without even reading it, much less understanding the implications of it.</p>
<p>&quot;</p>
<p>It protects users that aren&#8217;t totally ignorant.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Not quite. If a user got a virus, that virus could still do anything that user could do, such as delete all their files or exhaust their quotas. So more accurately it protects the <em>system</em>, not the user.</p>

		<p>This would be why Unix and Unix-based systems don&#8217;t include the current directory in the search path for libraries or executables. It just opens up too many security holes on multi-user systems. (This isn&#8217;t even a particularly nasty example.)</p>
<p>The reason Windows doesn&#8217;t run into issues is that it&#8217;s a GUI OS and programs are generally launched with the directory the executable is in as the current directory. Anyone doing admin work on directories accessible to other users from the Windows command line is probably asking for trouble.</p>
