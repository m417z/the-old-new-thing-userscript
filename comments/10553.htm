		<p>File metadata sounds like such a nice feature in theory. In practice, however, it is simply not practical. Many protocols and software products are simply not designed to keep this data intact when moving files from place to place.</p>

		<p>Property handlers were introduced in Windows Vista, not XP. You have to install WDS 4 on XP to get property handlers and still Explorer doesn&#39;t really benefit from them. Just replace &quot;XP&quot; with Vista and the article won&#39;t be full of inaccuracies. Also, the approach Vista/7 take is better (storing metadata within the file) but Microsoft does a very poor job of supporting others&#39; formats. They should ship property handlers for as many formats as possible. Because no one writes property handlers for some formats which actually support storing XMP or other metadata tags, the user is left without the ability to tag any of his non-text based formats in Vista/7. Hopefully, Windows 8 will correct this abomination. It&#39;s been 5 years since Vista arrived but there are only a few property handlers for some obscure formats like FLAC. We need property handlers *AT LEAST* for AVI (store them in RIFF chunks), MP4, MKV/MKA, MOV, PNG, PDF, GIF, JPEG 2000. Out of the box, Windows currently only supports JPG, TIFF, MP3, HDP/WDP, WMA and WMV.</p>

		<p>When I heard about ADS doesn&#39;t work on other filesystems, I always think that would it be a good idea that: When Windows has to copy a file that have ADS attached to other places which doesn&#39;t have the support, Windows can copy the ADS as hidden file in names like filename.stream1.ADS if the target supports long filename. Sure the file view can become obscure to some users if &quot;view hidden file&quot; is enabled, it could help in some case&#8230; possibly even in email (which would require email client support to make attachment&#39;s ID follows certain rule for easy discovery)</p>

		<p>The Property System APIs may have been introduced in Vista, but the underlying functionality was present in XP. &nbsp;Well before the release of Vista, I remember right-clicking on a JPEG, adding a caption, then trying to figure out how it was stored. &nbsp;Naturally, I did what Raymond Chen hates and wrote my own EXIF header parser, which displayed and edited the tags created by XP.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a Mac OS user these days, but credit where it&#39;s due: Preview.app will display a load of information about exposure times, DPI and suchlike, but won&#39;t show &#8211; let alone edit &#8211; any of the standard JPEG caption tags. &nbsp;iPhoto is even worse, storing captions in its own files where no other application can see them. &nbsp;So, Mac OS / iLife still haven&#39;t caught up with XP when it comes to JPEG captions. &nbsp;They&#39;re ahead on PDF management, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s Microsoft&#39;s fault. &nbsp;Given the legal trouble you had with PDF export from Office 2007, I assume making a Windows native PDF viewer would be treated with hostility.</p>
<p>On the JPEG side, it would have helped if other photo albums had made use of these tags (and the Property System APIs, when they became available), instead of kludging up proprietary caption storage. &nbsp;When the Microsoft Research time machine comes back from the shop, someone needs to send copies of this blog post to every digital camera manufacturer in 2002. &nbsp;It&#39;s doubly annoying when the music player world did this properly: Windows Media Player, iTunes and a plethora of other applications use the same MP3 header tags, to everyone&#39;s benefit.</p>

		<p>@Stefan Kanthak, wrong again I&#39;m afraid. WIC is available for XPSP2 as a backported downloadable component but built-in only beginning with XPSP3.</p>
<p>@10 HGR 2, Yes somewhat. Microsoft called them &quot;metadata handlers&quot;. The ability to edit metadata of some file types is there in XP such as JPEG (only EXIF metadata). Office also installs its metadata handler for formats which are not OLE compound documents (DOCX, XLSX). But that&#39;s about it. WMP may have it this ability via Advanced Tag Editor but not the shell. Other document formats require property system APIs introduced with Vista and later and it can store metadata in XMP format.</p>
<p>Also XP still has the Summary tab on NTFS volumes for any file type whereas the article says it doesn&#39;t give access to that metadata. The Summary tab was removed in Vista with no consideration for backward compatibility with existing tagged files using ADS, especially when developers aren&#39;t writing ANY property handlers at all for Vista/7. Another issue is MS have made the property system very difficult to debug.</p>
