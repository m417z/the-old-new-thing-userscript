		<p>So why was the Details property page dumbed down in general? &nbsp;/xpclient</p>
<p>On a totally separate note, I read your latest Windows Confidential column. &nbsp;That &quot;prank&quot; is borderline malicious. &nbsp;If it happened to me I would have been pissed.</p>

		<p>This story suggests to me that alternate data streams are too fragile for most uses, despite having been supported by the OS for years. Is there a part of the system or a mass-market app using alternate data streams in a way that&#39;s widely viewed as successful? If not, what are they good for in the real world? These are not rhetorical questionsâ€¦</p>

		<p>All attempts of getting mainstream adoption of alternate data streams have failed. There seems to be no way that the Unix concept of a file as a bag of bytes can be changed anymore.</p>

		<p>@integerpoet: They are used successfully for some things, the File Blocking in Explorer when a file is downloaded from the web, for example. It doesn&#39;t really matter as much in that case that the information is lost on transferring to another location, since the concept of having come &quot;from the web&quot; is kind of vague once you start transferring files between PCs anyway.</p>

		<p>@AndyCadley: &nbsp;I suppose it is &quot;successful&quot; in terms of accomplishing its set goal, but I don&#39;t find it particularly useful. &nbsp;I mean really, what is the point of that functionality? &nbsp;It seems to me the most common scenario is downloading a file and using it immediately, in which case the prompt seems kind of redundant. &nbsp;Just another prompt people learn to blindly click through. &nbsp;In fact, the first thing I do after downloading a file is get rid of that tag. &nbsp;There is probably a way to disable it in the security settings, but I am too lazy to search for it.</p>

		<p>@Jolyon Smith:</p>
<p>I believe homophonic misspellings tend toward the more familiar form for the individual, though it is probably true that the simpler form is generally the more familiar form. &nbsp;However, in the case of a computer scientist, &quot;queue&quot; is probably far more commonly used than &quot;cue&quot;.</p>

		<p>No I don&#39;t blindly think every dropped feature is bad, and do believe some features need to make the cut to improve the product. I also don&#39;t blindly complain just for sake of it. Seriously some people think that and what not I&#39;m hurt :(. I voted against the return of this feature here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.windows7taskforce.com/view/3399" rel="nofollow">http://www.windows7taskforce.com/&#8230;/3399</a> The design goal here is good but the compatibility efforts taken by Microsoft to offset the loss of this tab for end users are poor. They should have:</p>
<p>1. Shipped Windows with as many property handlers out of the box as possible for maximum file formats so all those popular file formats in use for documents, images, music, videos can be tagged. Windows doesn&#39;t even have property handlers for PDF! They just support their own WMA/WMV and JPG, MP3, DOC etc. Because no one writes property handlers for some formats which actually support storing XMP or other metadata tags, the user is left without the ability to tag any of his non-text based formats in Vista/7.</p>
<p>2. Prevent storing new info via the Summary tab but retained the &#39;Summary&#39; tab as a greyed out dialog, read-only way to display info to not cause people have already stored tags using ADS for years.</p>
<p>3. The Details view columns should have been reworked to display this info. Not make stupid decisions like removing column handlers. The property system, unlike column handlers has no method to display columns *for all file types*.</p>
<p>4. Make the Windows property system easier to debug so it&#39;s not a nightmare to write a new property handler.</p>
<p>5. Some file formats just don&#39;t support storing metadata inside the file. For those storing it in ADS isn&#39;t so bad.</p>

		<p>[&quot;Download and use immediately&quot; is not the scenario the warning is protected you against. Think about the drive-by download or the download-and-forget-about-it-and-hey-whats-this? -Raymond]</p>
<p>I agree &quot;use immediately&quot; is not the scenario this is supposed to help with, but I imagine it has got to be the most common one. &nbsp;The result is that you end up annoying people 80% (made up number) of the time for no reason, and they end up learning to ignore the warning anyway.</p>
<p>Drive-by downloading is an interesting scenario, but it seems like a pretty weak use case considering the real problem is drive-by downloads. &nbsp;I guess if you&#39;ve got a gaping wound in your arm a band-aid is better than nothing.</p>
<p>As for download-and-forget-about-it, that&#39;s just an extension of download-and-use-immediately in that in both cases they are downloading the file intentionally. &nbsp;So if you forget about the file and come back to it sometime later, you now know you downloaded it from the Internet. &nbsp;Ok, now what? &nbsp;What is it? &nbsp;Why did I download it? &nbsp;Where did I download it from? &nbsp;Now that I know I downloaded this file I should be careful with it? &nbsp;As opposed to other files I come across that I don&#39;t remember where they came from?</p>
<p>Are files without this tag safe? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;Do unsafe files have this tag? &nbsp;No. &nbsp;So the presence or absence of this tag doesn&#39;t really tell me anything other than this file might or might not have been downloaded from the Internet. &nbsp;But I already knew that without the tag.</p>
<p>Honestly the drive-by download scenario seems like the most useful, which is somewhat sad since it is essentially a last-ditch effort to protect you from vulnerabilities in other programs (*cough* Internet Explorer *cough*).</p>

		<p>And that&#39;s why when you get zip files from other operating systems there are sometimes files with weird names in it. Because the designers of those operating systems don&#39;t think it&#39;s acceptable to accidentally delete stuff like that, so if a file system doesn&#39;t support it, they make it support it.</p>

		<p>&gt;Ugh &#8211; I *hate* that! &nbsp;I always show hidden files on my Windows computers, and</p>
<p>&gt;the OCD part of me goes nuts upon plugging in some flash drive that a Mac has</p>
<p>&gt;seen fit to dump all over. &nbsp;I always end up going and deleting/cleaning up.</p>
<p>&gt;How annoying. </p>
<p>They&#39;re not just annoying, they&#39;re potentially lethal. &nbsp;With older versions of OS X, if you inserted a flash-based storage device, it&#39;d immediately try and s**t all over it for no known reason. &nbsp;Since the OS X SD drivers were somewhat buggy, this meant it&#39;d trash the SD card on insertion (you&#39;d have to reformat it to make it usable again, losing the contents in the process). &nbsp;If you write-protected the media, it&#39;d refuse to mount it with an incomprehensible error message.</p>
<p>Thanks Steve.</p>

		<p>In-band data is the *only* reliable place on heterogeneous carriers. &nbsp;Corollary: the success of Unix&#39;s bag-of-bytes model is that it *is* the lowest grade, sort of the 8.3 filename of data storage.</p>
<p>In some applications, metadata is considered important enough to wedge into a system designed without it, such as Joliet and Rock Ridge, or MIME; or out-of-band signaling is important enough to build an entire network with end-to-end support for the OOB data&#8211;the obvious example here being telephone companies.</p>

		<p>If the Summary information can come from data *within* the file, and not from an alternate data stream, that would be great. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Different data types might require a different format inside the file to hold the information that is displayed in the summary information, but that shouldn&#39;t be too hard. &nbsp;The Sumamry screen would then be displaying a formatted view of some of the data from inside the file. &nbsp;And that data would get copied with the file, since it&#39;s part of the file. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The definition for this structure could be added to existing files, starting now. &nbsp;But, whether there is a compelling reason to do this, or not, I don&#39;t know.</p>

<p>Well, Vista (and probably Win7?) will siht, too. It will try to create a file to test RadyBust readyness for the drive. If you have a misfortune of having Windows Media Player playing some file, it will immediately stop and drop a file on the flash (what moron came with this misfeature?).</p>

		<p>Are alternative data streams subject to file tunnelling? If not then simply editing the file could cause them to be lost, which definitely makes them pretty fragile.</p>
