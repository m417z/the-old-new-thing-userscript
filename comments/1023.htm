		<p>I like how his mother told him that when she was going to ask for Castro&#39;s autograph she would let him know beforehand.</p>

		<p>And Rose Kennedy replied &quot;I understand very well your letter, although I had not thought of it before. &#8230;When I ask for Castro&#39;s autograph, I will let you know in advance!&quot; Now, this is a bit hilarious.</p>
<p>Anyway, I fail to see what&#39;s embarrassing about that. Maybe catastrophic, but embarrassing? No way.</p>

		<p>&quot;President Kennedy burying his hand in his face&quot;</p>
<p>Was this supposed to be &quot;burying his face in his hand&quot;? &nbsp;The current phrasing, however, has a much more interesting visual.</p>

		<p>@GregM,</p>
<p>I think both are acceptable but suggest different meanings. &quot;Burying his face in his hand&quot; suggests that his head tilts downward into his face. However, &quot;burying his hand in his face&quot; suggests that his hand presses into his face.</p>

		<p>&quot;However, &quot;burying his hand in his face&quot; suggests that his hand presses into his face.&quot;</p>
<p>Exactly. &nbsp;It made me think of him punching himself in the face.</p>
