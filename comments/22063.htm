		<p>A friend of mine used to &quot;teach&quot; for such an organization in the Washington, D.C., area. That outfit was bought by another, possibly the Learning Annex, about twenty-five years ago. She was kind enough to invite me to an event at her house, gratis. As I recall it was men (with social skills unimpressive even as compared to mine) hoping to meet women, and women hoping to meet men, probably men of the sort that didn&#8217;t show at such get-togethers.</p>
<p>On the other hand, they could have dropped whatever today&#8217;s $20 would have been then at a bar, there also met nobody appropriate, and gone home with the makings of a hangover and tobacco smoke all over their clothes.</p>

		<p>I attended The Learning Annex Wealth Show in Toronto last year. It was tremendous. At least 20,000 people. Great speakers like Donald Trump, Tony Robbins, Richard Branson, George Foreman&#8230;No losers on that list, and I made great contacts. I suggest you try it.</p>
