		<p>I love these STP posts &#8211; it&#8217;s great to read Raymond&#8217;s unique writing style in a longer medium that the average blog post. &nbsp;Guess I should buy the book.</p>

		<p>&quot;Who eats candy at nine in the morning?&quot;</p>
<p>Kids do &#8211; you never know when you&#8217;re going to get candy, so you get it when you can.</p>
<p>This is something I think you grow out of soon after it occurs to you, once you&#8217;ve moved out, that you can buy candy whenever you want.</p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussey%27s" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hussey%27s</a></p>
<p>For those that don&#8217;t want to click through, &quot;Hussey&#8217;s General Store &nbsp;Guns, Wedding Gowns, Cold Beer&quot;.</p>
<p>They also have 2 mannequins in the window to show off the wedding gowns. &nbsp;They&#8217;re set up as a bride and groom, and as of a few weeks ago the bride is wearing one of their wedding gowns and the groom is wearing a flannel shirt and overalls.</p>
<p>I love rural Maine!</p>

<p>Sorry, it&#8217;s hard to get any feel for what&#8217;s going on when you refer to people as M,A,S,C,J. &nbsp;You might as well have given them numbers.</p>

		<p>By the time I was in high school in the early 90&#8217;s, some of the rooms still had chalkboards, some whiteboards &nbsp;But many of my teachers preferred to do their lessons by drawing on transparancies on an overhead projector.</p>

		<p>Not sure why that is an odd sign, unless you&#8217;re not aware of firearms lingo. &nbsp;I&#8217;m pretty sure the optics doesn&#8217;t mean glasses, rather optical sights for your firearm. In which case, the three go together quite fittingly. Duh to the flickr doofus&#8217; caption.</p>

		<p>Wendy: &nbsp;what&#8217;s this?</p>
<p>Dad: &nbsp;it&#8217;s a slide rule</p>
<p>Wendy: &nbsp;What is it for?</p>
<p>Dad: &nbsp;calculations and convesions and looking good, &nbsp;this one is made out of ivory and mahogany</p>
<p>Wendy: Can I try it out</p>
<p>Dad: &nbsp;you&#8217;ll have to get your own, when you need one, this one&#8217;s mine.</p>
<p>Wendy. &nbsp;sneaked into dad&#8217;s office and played with it when he wasn&#8217;t looking&#8230;.</p>
<p>Then dad bought me an electronit calculator and I never did get myself a slide rule&#8230;</p>

		<p>&quot;Sorry, it&#8217;s hard to get any feel for what&#8217;s going on when you refer to people as M,A,S,C,J. &nbsp;You might as well have given them numbers.&quot;</p>
<p>So let me get this straight. You&#8217;ve now just read part 3 of a 4 part series that doesn&#8217;t interest you, and you feel the need to complain about Raymond&#8217;s decision to tell his story his way about an event that he is probably pretty proud he participated in.</p>
<p>&quot;I guess it&#8217;s a nice read for people who were in the event.&quot;</p>
<p>So let me get this straight. You weren&#8217;t in the event. You have no interest in the story. Here&#8217;s an idea: DON&#8217;T READ IT! I know, my idea is crazy, wacky and wild even. Not read something you have no interest in rather than read it then take the time to complain that you didn&#8217;t like it! Madness!</p>
<p>My goodness people are rude on the Internet. When you&#8217;re out with friends and someone is telling a story about something that happened to them, do you yawn and say loudly &quot;YOUR STORY IS SO BORING!&quot; and comment on how it must have only been of interest to someone who was there?</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t your mother ever tell you &quot;if you can&#8217;t say something nice, don&#8217;t say anything at all&quot;? *</p>
<p>Unfortunately it seems that more and more people lack the ability to apply any sort of filter to feeling the need to communicate their every thought.</p>
<p>Nitpickers corner</p>
<p>* &#8211; Obviously there are times when that rule does not apply, but that rule (and some common sense) definitely applies here.</p>

		<p>Hi there</p>
<p>You must be the guy who can give the definite answer: Why does a windows installation always last about 6 months?</p>
<p>What is the cause for the famous &#8220;Windows Rot&#8221; where a Windows machine keep degrading in performance with time?</p>
<p>What is the recommended course of action?</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

<p>He can&#8217;t give you that answer you moron. Your windows lasts 6 months because you don&#8217;t know how to use it and maintain it properly.</p>

<p>Fragmentation and registry bloat. Fixes are known:</p>

<p>See above. In that order.</p>
<p>The best way to fix is though is not to install every crappy application you stumble upon.</p>
