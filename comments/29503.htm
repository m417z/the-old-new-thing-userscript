		<p>You mentioned the tattoos of Chinese characters and that reminded me of a time when I saw someone that apparently thought they were getting the ever-trendy character for &quot;strength/power&quot; tattooed on the back of their neck, but one of the strokes was twisted and it actually said &quot;nine.&quot;</p>

		<p>Perhaps somebody at Microsoft could set a trend for the heavy-metal diaresis, rescuing it from mockery. &quot;The Bo&#246;kke&#235;pers&quot; or &quot;Lo&#252;d and Obnoxio&#252;s&quot; would be possibilities. Of course, then how would we distinguish them from the heavy-metal umlaut?</p>
<p>If the generation of language students is learning about umlauts from Motley Crue, then I must agree, it&#8217;s doomed. Let&#8217;s hope the students really aren&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>Why single out the umlaut?</p>
<p>The world is full of idiots who abuse punctuation for effect. There&#8217;s &quot;accenture&quot; with a greater-than sign over the &quot;t&quot;. &nbsp;There was the DEC x86-to-alpha translation engine called &quot;fx!32&quot;. &nbsp;AMD with &quot;3DNow!&quot;. &nbsp;And on and on.</p>

		<p>More than the heavy metal umlauts, what annoys me is when otherwise literate english-speakers get too clever and believe that they can use a diaresis over an o, as in the &#8216;word&#8217; co&#246;peration.</p>

<p>I believe the use of the diaresis in that case is intended to echo its use in French, in words like na&#239;ve, where it indicates that the two vowels are to be pronounced separately. &nbsp;These days it does come across as something of a smarmy &quot;look at how educated and high-brow we are&quot; affectation, though.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;It troubles me to see the umlaut being treated as a decorative element, for it dooms another generation of language students to treating umlauted and non-umlauted vowels as just typographical variations of each other rather than being distinct vowels with different pronunciations.</p>
<p>If we are talking about students of English, well, [*shrug*].</p>
<p>If we are talking about students of German (or other Germanic languages that use the umlaut) then hopefully they are learning the difference in pronounciation between &quot;o&quot; and &quot;&#246;&quot;. &nbsp;They should also be learning the difference between &quot;o&quot; and &quot;oe&quot; (a perfectly acceptable alternative to the umlaut in situations where the umlaut is not available).</p>

<p>Actually they are more &quot;literate&quot; than you can imagine. The use of the diaresis to indicate a separate pronunciation of consecutive vowels has a long tradition in English typesetting that was only recently abandoned.</p>

<p>I know that. It is just that they should be literate enough to know that two dots over an o turns it into a completely different letter.</p>
<p>Regarding heavy metal umlauts, the first was in Blue &#214;yster Cult, where the umlaut over the O is not too much in the way (unless you read it as a diaresis). Maybe they knew what they were doing, but M&#248;tley Crye didn&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>&quot;An &quot;&#246;&quot; is not an &quot;o&quot; with dots over it any more than a &quot;Q&quot; is an &quot;O&quot; with a squiggly tail.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, I wish I had thought of that explanation when I was trying to convince French learners of German that umlauts matter &#8211; French accents (&#233;&#232;&#234;&#249;&#224;&#226;&#238;) are almost decoration and didn&#8217;t offer a very convincing analogy.</p>

<p>In German? &nbsp;In o mit umlaut it considerably more like an o than a Q is like an O with a squiggly tail. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a modified &#8216;o&#8217;. &nbsp;It&#8217;s moved in the mouth, that&#8217;s all, and further, it&#8217;s moved in the same way all the mit-umlaut vowels are.</p>
<p>btw headz&#8211; coooperation is spelled with a diaresis commonly. &nbsp;IN THE NEW YORKER!!! Oh, New Yorker, where would we get our laffs without you? &nbsp;Nice online archives btw. &nbsp;Psyche.</p>

<p>Enlgish isn&#8217;t German, so if Moben is an english word then they are decoration &#8211; if not they are part of the spelling.</p>

		<p>This is something that you just have to be aware of when considering internationalization. In Swedish &#246; and o are completely different characters &#8211; in the sort order, &#246; is last while o is right between n and p. In German, &#246; is different, but is sorted as an o (kinda). In Swedish, w and v are considered almost equal in sort order. V is, of course, pronounced F in German. Their neighbors the Dutch pronounce ij as y, and that&#8217;s *before* they smoke grass. For French the pronunciation and the spelling parted ways long ago and are no longer on speaking terms. Further south, the spanish pronounce LL as J and J as H.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the relevance of all this, then? Well, I&#8217;ve noticed that when searching for words with these characters on Google, the engine will helpfully treat &#246; and o the same, which messes up the results, as sometimes the &#246; is the single distinctive character that separates the extremely uncommon word I&#8217;m searching for from some extremely common word.</p>
<p>So &#8211; when trying to decipher intent from what the user types in, be careful about what assumptions you put in, because those assumptions are far less universal than you think (even if they work in close to 100% of the cases in your normal life). If you&#8217;re from the US, your program will probably end up inferring what a native English speaker would infer from the user&#8217;s typing. Which may or may not be right.</p>
