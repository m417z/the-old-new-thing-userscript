		<p>If DoJ launches an investigation, that&#8217;s an active response. &nbsp;The hospital&#8217;s case is more passive, and could it be that if a third-party inquirer even mentions the word &quot;suicide&quot; that invokes a business rule at the hospital to clamp down for the remainder of the inquiry? &nbsp;</p>
<p>I can imagine an intelligence agency counting on or encouraging a DoJ investigation to make a deliberate misinformation release appear to other spies to be true&#8230;</p>

		<p>I think I agree with keith. &nbsp;The wording kind of makes it sound like an admission, but it really seems to be more of a blanket statement; i.e. &quot;We can neither confirm nor deny that it was a suicide attempt&quot;.</p>

		<p>If that hospital spokesperson was really trying not to confirm anything, they would have stopped at &quot;Our privacy policy forbids us from revealing any further information.&quot;</p>
<p>The person might as well have said: &quot;The policy prohibits releasing information on patients who attempt suicide, which obviously applies in this case, so I can&#8217;t tell you anything.&quot;</p>

		<p>These people need to be prepared to give complete non-committal answers. &nbsp;Like when I get my wife&#8217;s Christmas gifts. &nbsp;She tries to get &quot;clues&quot; from me. &nbsp;I have to be prepared to answer questions like, &quot;Is it something that I wear?&quot;</p>
<p>I have to prepare myself to tell her that I won&#8217;t answer any questions about that topic ever. &nbsp;If I don&#8217;t then she&#8217;ll see my face and be able to infer if she is right (she knows me way too well.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, when I walk in the door from my shopping, I am full on prepared to say, &quot;Maybe. &nbsp;I will never ever say anything to any of your questions except &#8216;maybe&#8217;.&quot;</p>

		<p>Scientology is notorious for suing people who publish their &quot;secret&quot; information by invoking copyright law.</p>
<p>Which pretty much confirms that the &quot;secret&quot; information is authentic.</p>

		<p>Before the first version of the .NET BCL shipped there actually was an exception that said something like &quot;you don&#8217;t have permission to determine the name of file: FOO.TXT&quot;. &nbsp;Fortunately that one was caught before we shipped.</p>

		<p>google for Erin Andrews, who was filmed naked in a hotel room. Nobody could recognize her on the video but to quote another forum:</p>
<p>&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>Saw this quote from Erin Andrews from the AP (you know when the AP is reporting on it, it&#8217;s gone big time).</p>
<p>She said she decided to confirm it &quot;To put an end to rumor and speculation and to put the perpetrator and those complicit on notice that they act at their own peril&quot;</p>
<p>&#8212; Now why you&#8217;d want to &quot;put an end to rumor and speculation&quot; and confirm it, I don&#8217;t know. There&#8217;s enough rumor and speculation on the internet that I think most people ignore it (honestly I think most of us hadn&#8217;t even heard of this alleged video until it was confirmed).</p>
<p>But you gotta give her credit for being brave and coming foward. Plus coming foward is a big F-ck You to the guy who filmed it.</p>
<p>Also I guess it would be pretty hard to persue any legal action against the guy who filmed it without coming foward (that&#8217;s probably her real motivation for admitting it). We&#8217;ve all heard the news stories about the guys being busted for setting up video cameras in bathrooms or locker rooms. I don&#8217;t know how stiff the legal penalties are, I don&#8217;t remember what they get charged with, but I would think she could really nail him with a civil case. She could claim &quot;irreperable harm to her career&quot;, which I don&#8217;t think is true, but I&#8217;m sure a jury would buy it. Plus the burden of proof is much lower for a civil case versus a criminal case (remember the Robert Blake trial&#8211; acquiited of murder in the criminal case but nailed in the civil suit).</p>

		<p>Happens with a certain secretive Fruit company as well. When new product rumors abound, we see the photos and wait a few days. If the photos are still up, it&#8217;s a dud rumor. If there&#8217;s a legal request to take them down, bingo!</p>
<p>Though, I think they&#8217;ve stopped doing that for precisely that reason&#8230;</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s at least one option that the Justice Department has to prevent this kind of confirmation, called a &quot;Glomar Response&quot;</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomar_response" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glomar_response</a></p>
<p>But they have to go through a legal process before they can choose to not respond&#8230;</p>

		<p>The prerequisites are like the sign in liquor stores that say “We card everyone under 30.” &nbsp;Whenever I get carded I point to their sign and tell them I’m not under 30 so you don’t need to card me. &nbsp;For some reason they don’t follow their own rules and check my Id anyway.</p>

		<p>@Joe Sixpack:</p>
<p>The logic you presented in the liquor store argument is a specific type of logical fallacy. &nbsp;Wikipedia refers to it as Affirming the Consequent: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affirming_the_consequent</a></p>
<p>Wikipedia has this example:</p>
<p>A: All Republicans are pro-life.</p>
<p>B: That&#8217;s not true. My uncle&#8217;s pro-life and he&#8217;s not a Republican.</p>
<p>To put it the way you did:</p>
<p>A: They card everyone under 30.</p>
<p>B: That&#8217;s not true. &nbsp;You&#8217;re over 30 and they carded you.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the catch? &nbsp;The sign says nothing about carding people over 30.</p>

		<p>@R. Bemrose:</p>
<p>Not quite. &nbsp;The point is they need to check my Id to determine if they need to check my Id.</p>
<p>The sign implies some people are carded others are not. Unless they card everybody they can&#8217;t (reliably) know if they carded everybody under 30. &nbsp;The sign should read &quot;We card everybody&quot; because it is the only way they can ensure they carded everybody under 30.</p>
<p>Because of this the sign is silly just like it silly for me to suggest that they don&#8217;t need to card me because of what the sign says.</p>
