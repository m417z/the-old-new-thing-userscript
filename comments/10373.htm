		<p>I&#39;ve spent several frustrating minutes trying to stop a video on just the right frame (to settle an argument, no doubt). I had no idea that this feature existed. I must admit, this is one of the least intuitive interfaces I&#39;ve seen.</p>

		<p>In Vista Home Basic, the controls are largely dead to right-click, except Play/Pause has slower/normal/faster options. &nbsp;I have to right-click <code>Now Playing</code> to get Enhancements, and then the frame controls are with the play speed settings.</p>
<p>&quot;Previous frame&quot; seems to go to the previous I-frame, but that&#39;s understandable for performance. #nitpicking</p>

		<p>It does of course depend on the video, but in my case the video is the biggest target. Actually the only place the right-click doesn&#39;t show &quot;Enhancements&quot; is if I click on the Play/Pause/Next/Previous buttons.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m amused that you post this in the blog for your personal reference. &nbsp;Even more amusing is the fact that you&#39;re posting a reminder for yourself on how to access a pretty useful feature in a very popular program because the interface is complicated enough to warrant a reminder (with the bonus that it&#39;s a bit of a PSA too).</p>
<p>Don&#39;t forget, if you want to use a keyboard shortcut for play/pause, it&#39;s Ctrl+P. &nbsp;Smacking the spacebar does nothing, no matter how hard you hit it.</p>

<p>No, clearly what you do if you don&#39;t know about Windows Media Player&#39;s single-step functionality is you repeatedly play the clip over and over again while trying to hit the PrintScreen button at exactly the right time.</p>

		<p>First of all, MPC requires no installation.</p>

		<p>Not wishing to sound like a troll (what with my obvious user name) but WMP GUI has been made totally unusable and dumbed down after versions 11 and 12 came out (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Player#Removed_features" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Windows_Media_Player</a>) except for remote and internet media streaming which is a very nice feature.

		<p>What, nobody ever looked for the equalizer and found the other windows to play with? WMP might not be the best player ever built, but it&#39;s perfectly serviceable and the interface is not at all undiscoverable. It&#39;s a simple right-click. Anywhere (Almost).</p>

		<p>BTW, this isn&#39;t the only such really undiscoverable feature. Under older versions of Excel (pre-2007), you could *shift-click the edit menu* and get some extra options, including &quot;copy picture&quot; which you could use to copy a graph to the clipboard. I think I&#39;ve seen a couple other of those shift-click features but I don&#39;t remember anything else being that useful.</p>

		<p>@glurps: to control WMP using the keyboard while it is playing a video press the Tab key four times. The controls will appear with a focus outline around one of the controls. You can navigate to the other controls by pressing tab or shift/tab. To access the context menu (and the Enhancements menu that Raymond mentioned) you can press the menu key on the keyboard (just below the right side shift key).</p>

		<p>I&#39;ll add my thanks for this post as well.</p>
<p>Trying to find a single frame(or even controlling playback speed) is a common task users come up against. I had never been able to find the setting in WMP and had assumed it simply didn&#39;t exist. Mostly because the interface for accessing that setting is very easy to find under VLC(and other MP).</p>
<p>So thanks, I&#39;ll defiantly be making good use of this tip.</p>

		<p>Raymond, please do not stop posting entries like this one. Instead, just turn off comments for &quot;sensitive&quot; posts entirely. It&#39;s just not worth it. The low percentage of comments that actually contribute something worthwhile does not justify keeping them turned on.</p>
<p>I only found this feature once before; years ago and totally by accident. Now I finally know how I did it &#8212; thanks to you.</p>

		<p>@Raymond&#8211;actually I&#39;m grateful for this post as well. In my search for Enhancements on my WMP11 install, I discovered that *each tab has a menu on it,* full of things just begging to be clicked.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve stumbled across those frame step controls before but seem to have a recollection that they would be disabled for some videos but not others. &nbsp;Is their function (or lack thereof) determined by the codec ? &nbsp;i.e. some codecs simply can&#39;t be frame-stepped ?</p>
<p>I could never get my head around how/why any codec might not be, but just wondered.</p>
<p>Also, FYI: some additional wrinkles in the WMP GUI:</p>
<p>Right click the &quot;Play/Pause&quot;, &quot;Rewind&quot; or &quot;Fast Forward&quot; buttons and you get a different context menu, one with just 3 items: slow playback, normal playback and fast playback.</p>
<p>Now right click the volume slider, stop button etc, to see the full context menu. &nbsp;NOW if you right click the Play/Rew/FF buttons, you ALSO get the full context menu. &nbsp;I only get the shorter context menu back if I pause (or restart) the video then right click the Play/Rew/FF buttons. &nbsp;But right click the vol slider etc and the full context menu trumps it again.</p>
<p>This had me scratching my head for a while because when I first right clicked the play button I got this shorter menu without the &quot;enhancements&quot; option, then I found it by clicking elsewhere then when I went back to the play button I got the full menu again and thought I was going crazy&#8230;. did I see a different, shorter context menu or not? &nbsp;what&#39;s going on!?!?</p>

		<p>@Troll: WMP&#39;s a lot more usable (at least as a media library) than Zune player. Personally, I find WMP just fine, although building auto playlists is too simplistic (although honestly I&#39;d like to be able to write SQL-like queries against the WMP database). Sure it&#39;s outshined by MPC and a few other media players in terms of features and UI cleanliness, but for the average person, WMP is just fine.</p>

		<p>I have no idea what you are talking about. When playing a video in Windows Media Payer (Windows 7), which &#8212; by the way &#8212; is an application I am very fond of, you can right-click *anywhere* in the window, enter the &#39;Enhancements&#39; submenu and click any of the items there to open the small window that contains all the &#39;advanced&#39; controls, including the frame-step controls. And, by &#39;anywhere&#39;, I really do mean *anywhere* &#8212; you can click on the video, on any control, or even on the titlebar of the window. However, if you are playing the video in full-screen mode, then you cannot access the &#39;advanced&#39; controls at all &#8212; the context menu doesn&#39;t contain the &#39;Enhancements&#39; submenu. And it doesn&#39;t help to right-click any control (such as the volume slider), for the controls have no popup menu at all.</p>

		<p>I don’t know why anyone would use WMP in the first place. VideoLan has been my video player of choice since WMP8 was forcibly dropped in XP SP2. VLC does everything you need a video player to do and then some.</p>
<p>I particularly like the adjustable playback speed (in as little as ±0.1x, ie ±10%, increments). Once they changed it so that the playback speed only affects the tempo of the audio and not the pitch, VLC became invaluable. I don’t remember the last time that I watched anything, be it TV shows or movies, whether I liked it or not at 1x. Now, I always watch everything between 1.3x-1.7x, allowing me to get through everything in less time (it’s not as weird as you might think; in fact slowing it to 1x seems abnormally slow). This is especially helpful for all the crappy shows and movies I don’t like, since I can waste less time on them by watching them at up to 200%; and no, the DVD drive doesn’t have trouble keeping up until I hit at least 8x.</p>
