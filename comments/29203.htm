		<p>Not to be nitpicky, but just knowing how you like your English to be spot-on, I thought I&#8217;d point out this typo:</p>
<p>And by a stroke of synchronicity, they first article of mine &#8230;</p>
<p>I think you mean &#8216;the first article&#8217; rather than &#8216;they first article&#8217;.</p>

		<p>The German translation of your article shows pretty well why good translations are really really hard to do (and pretty much impossible for a machine).</p>
<p>Grammatically and typographically there is not much wrong with it, but to me almost every sentence reeks of its English origin. I can&#8217;t quite put my finger on it, but I suppose it&#8217;s the flow of the sentences and word creations like &quot;Lokalisierungsbelastung&quot;.</p>
<p>Nonetheless a tremendous and applaudable (and probably huge!) effort. Well done.</p>

		<p>&lt;i&gt;&quot;There have been companies who complained to Congress that Microsoft was maliciously targeting and disabling their software.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;</p>
<p>Why would anyone suspect such a thing?</p>

		<p>@Marcel:</p>
<p>absolutely &#8211; and it&#8217;s very painful to read, it feels like the mental equivalent to enjoying a beer while throwing up :)</p>
<p>I understand the amount of work that goes into these translations, and by no means I want to belittle the effort or skills of the translators. It&#8217;s just my language sense tingling like mad.</p>
<p>(I just hope my english doesn&#8217;t have the same effect on native speakers!)</p>
<p>What really annoys me: MSDN doesn&#8217;t remember the language combo box selection &#8211; and insists on german (even though OS and IE are english &#8211; weird)</p>

		<p>The beer metaphor is probably a bit harsh ;-)</p>
<p>But yeah, I personally know how hard it is. Even when I have to translate my own manuals and articles into German (I&#8217;m German but usually write everything in English) the result reads like sh*t. Usually I then rewrite most paragraphs from scratch as they&#8217;re really beyound repair due to the English influences. Easy there because I&#8217;m the original author anyway but translating somebody else&#8217;s technical text (prose can be translated much more freely) is a real pain. Especially when there&#8217;s such a huge pile of it.</p>

		<p>&gt; &nbsp;usually write everything in English</p>
<p>&gt; &nbsp;then rewrite most paragraphs from scratch as they&#8217;re really beyound repair </p>
<p>same here :-)</p>
<p>I see some reasons:</p>
<p>(a) Even when communicating in German, we use the english word as<br />
technical terms with a well defined meaning. The correct german<br />
equivalent is either context dependent, or not nearly as well defined<br />
as the english counterpart.</p>
<p>(b) German technical articles are usually written in passive (&#8220;man&#8221;<br />
as in &#8220;one does&#8221;) instead of using the direct &#8220;Du&#8221; or &#8220;Sie&#8221;. The<br />
english &#8220;you&#8221; cannot be translated easily without sounding either<br />
stiff, inappropriate, or trying-tobe-cool-but-failing. </p>
<p>(c) Many direct translations with a general use in english (e.g. &#8220;do&#8221;) are considered &#8220;idiot-speak&#8221; in german (&#8220;tun&#8221;)</p>
<p>I wonder how well these translations work for other languages</p>
<p>&#8212; </p>
<p>We had a schooled &#8220;technical writer/translator&#8221; translate our<br />
(english) manual to german. Though we had to double check all technical<br />
terms, the outcome is quite good. However, the amount of work is<br />
immense.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Yeah, I noticed that the translator used &#8220;Sie&#8221;<br />
instead of &#8220;man&#8221;. It struck me as strange, but I wasn&#8217;t sure whether it<br />
was some new fashion. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Why do they have to provide localized version of these texts? Can&#8217;t an author assume that if somebody wants to do advanced stuff like articles in this blog) he should know some english? When you want to become a doctor you must learn latin, don&#8217;t you?</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong. I.e. its OK to translate user manuals for microwaves since the targeted audience is &quot;everyone&quot;. But when somebody talks about messageloops, threads and virtual memory I think its OK not to provide translations.</p>
<p>Translated text (especially technical text) is always hard to understand. Usually you have translate the text back to english while reading to understand it.</p>
<p>Back in the days when using my C64 nobody ever complained about some software because it was in english :-)</p>

		<p>Oh, by the way, I don&#8217;t understand more German than, like &quot;achtung&quot; (2nd WW movies&#8230;), but I could have sworn I saw something in there about writing a book titled &quot;The Old New Thing&quot; coming in 2007, published by AW, authored by you, Raymond.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve totally missed that before &#8211; is it true?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d second the notion that programming should be done in English, and therefore any text on programming should be as well. Before you know, people start using German comments.</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;m still scarred by the German Excel being incompatible with the Dutch. It&#8217;s VBA, but still programming.</p>

		<p>If you think one level of translation is bad, what about two? &nbsp;Some of my stuff is first translated into German for publication in Europe and then back-translated into English for the US market, because it&#8217;s easier to back-translate the final, edited German version than to try and reconstruct an edited version from the English original. &nbsp;The translations are technically excellent, but unfortunately all of the subtle humour and in-jokes have completely vanished by the time the text falls out the other side.</p>

		<p>Doctors in North America don&#8217;t have to learn Latin.</p>
<p>Regarding the C64, there was (and I believe still is) a vibrant German C64 user community, so I would suspect that of the C64 software written in the last five years (and there are still diehards doing so), a good deal of it would be for a German audience.</p>

<p>Here it&#8217;s pretty much random. &nbsp;Some words are really written in Japanese (using Kanji). &nbsp;Some words are written in katakana as transliterations from English (usually). &nbsp;Some aren&#8217;t consistent and can change from one sentence to the next while speaking, or vary depending on which version of Windows or which vendor&#8217;s drivers or whatever.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  (b) German technical articles are usually</p>
<p>  written in passive (&quot;man&quot; as in &quot;one does&quot;)
</p></blockquote>
<p>If the grammar is &quot;one does&quot; then it&#8217;s active not passive, it just ambiguizes who the actor is. &nbsp;&quot;Is done&quot; and &quot;would be done&quot; are passive. &nbsp;In Japanese there&#8217;s a lot of &quot;do&quot;, active tense but not imperative, without specifying who the actor is.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  (c) Many direct translations with a general</p>
<p>  use in english (e.g. &quot;do&quot;) are</p>
<p>  considered &quot;idiot-speak&quot; in german (&quot;tun&quot;)
</p></blockquote>
<p>Um, I don&#8217;t know German, so is &quot;man&quot; an example of that? &nbsp;Anyway in Japanese, especially in this kind of situation, maybe &quot;do&quot; is the most common verb.</p>

<p>&quot;Have to&quot; is a tough question but &quot;want to&quot; has an easy answer. &nbsp;&quot;Have to&quot; might be more suitable for MSDN where, in addition to the need for accurate information, there sure is a need for it in the customer&#8217;s language.</p>

<p>Advanced stuff like reading this blog? &nbsp;Sure, you need English to read it. &nbsp;Advanced stuff like Win32 programming etc.? &nbsp;No way. &nbsp;Programming skills and human language skills are not identical talents.</p>
<p>Some of the stuff in &quot;Win32 Programming that even a Cat can Understand&quot; is both technically accurate and hilariously funny. &nbsp;Does this mean that every Windows programmer has to know some Japanese? &nbsp;Or can some programmers wait for a translation? &nbsp;(Yeah I translated the title.)</p>
