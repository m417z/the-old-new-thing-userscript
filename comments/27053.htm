		<p>I know the problem &#8211; I&#8217;m a pianist too (as well as a programmer); the last time I visited my family in Seattle I had to scramble to find practice pianos, since I had a concert a couple of weeks after my vacation. I was able to use the piano at a Seattle golf club a few times, and at a Bremerton piano dealer. The piano dealer was very nice (but the piano was a lousy upright).</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve not had much luck at finding good pianos around the Eastside, so I ended up getting a keyboard for myself&#8230; but being a house pianist sounds interesting.</p>

		<p>My parents have a nice quality baby grand in their 40&#215;40 foot living room. &nbsp;She can use that! &nbsp;It&#8217;s in New Mexico.</p>

		<p>I too am a pianist and software engineer. I bought a Yamaha CP300 stage piano for home and production use. Close your eyes and it&#8217;s pretty much the same as playing on a Borsendorfer grand piano. Somewhat more portable too :)</p>

		<p>You are so right. Recordings are no where close. My sister played piano professionally for many years and her practice piano was right outside my room. I haven&#8217;t heard some one play piano in my house since my sister moved to Turku and I moved to the US. I miss it a lot. There is nothing like having Mozart or Beethoven played right in your own home.</p>

		<p>The same can be said for most instruments. &nbsp;My wife plays the flute&#8230; it&#8217;s nice to hear her practice&#8230; she is not concert level (yet&#8230; could be if she wanted to). &nbsp;But listening to the live music is just&#8230; relaxing.</p>

		<p>I used to have a housemate who played sitar and tabla. Hearing classical Indian music drifting up from the living room in the morning would really set me up for the day.</p>

		<p>My wife&#8217;s mother bought us a new piano when we moved back to Massachusetts. My favorite days are twice a year when the tuner pays a visit. Besides plunking around, he also plays some nice pieces, as a kind of advanced check on his progress.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t play, but one of my daughters is very musical, and has taught herself to play very well. My office is directly above the music room, so I am often treated to private recitals. I don&#8217;t know whether she spends more time on the piano or on the internet. She also plays viola with various groups, and this spring played the fiddler in the high school&#8217;s outstanding performance of Fiddler on the Roof. (I&#8217;m so proud, it makes me wish I had developed some musical talent.)</p>

		<p>In Berkeley, several years ago, I saw the film Koyaanisqatsi, with the soundtrack performed live by Philip glass and his orchestra. &nbsp;It was incredible.</p>

		<p>You people are lucky. My upstairs neighbor has a piano that gets played all hours of the day and night. And when I say &quot;played&quot;, I really mean &quot;mashed&quot;. Sometimes I can hear the pounding of the keys against their stops through the horrible noise.</p>

		<p>Nice. My daughter&#8217;s learning the piano; she&#8217;s still at the stage where she&#8217;s just starting to use two hands to play, but eventually I will have Beethoven sonatas in my house, and there will be much rejoicing.</p>

		<p>I bought a piano* last week&#8230; it&#8217;s fun &#8212; I&#8217;m a self-taught hack, I&#8217;m never going to be a &quot;pianist&quot; but it&#8217;s a great way to while away a few hours. And relaxing.</p>
<p>*A keyboard, really. Yamaha P70, fullsize, weighted keys and headphone sockets for that 2am Bohemian Rhapsody.</p>

		<p>If you can&#8217;t get Live, get some /excellent/ recordings, and a pair of Audio-Technica ATH-A900 headphones.</p>
<p>The sense of presence is very pronounced, even if the sound is not the most accurate you&#8217;ll hear. The BBC recordings you get free with the BBC Music magazine are particularly fine for this.</p>

		<p>Or, learn to play an instrument. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not hard. &nbsp;Playing an instrument is similar to, but far easier than, learning a language. &nbsp;You have a soundmaking component and a literacy component.</p>
<p>(This is not directed at Raymond, it&#8217;s just a coincidence that he picks up languages for fun, something I would find impossibly hard.)</p>
<p>You already know the difference between experiencing live music versus a recording, which is a whole new level. &nbsp;The same difference applies to performing it, over listening to it. &nbsp;The music fills your body even more when you&#8217;re making it.</p>
<p>Somewhere in-between is performing with a recording.</p>
<p>When I have a really bad day, I can go down into my basement, put on a recording of something really fun like Gordon Goodwin&#8217;s &#8220;Phat Pack&#8221; and play along with some of the finest musicians in the world.</p>

		<p>Maybe a nice set of speakers like the Bose might interest you?</p>

		<p>My daughter, a skilled amateur pianist, often practices while my wife and I are eating breakfast. &nbsp;I find the unpredictability, even within a piece, makes the experience much better than any recorded music. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a fantastic way to start the day!</p>
