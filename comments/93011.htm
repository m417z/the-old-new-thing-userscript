		<p>&#8220;Are you guaranteed that the deleted file will be removed from the enumeration&#8230;.&#8221;</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t this violate causality? A file that has already been returned by a call could be deleted before the enumeration is complete!</p>

		<p>Find­Next­File/FindClose cannot fail with a timeout, you could retrieve one file per day if you wanted to. Just having enumerate rights would allow people to prevent deletion of files if there was some kind of guarantee that the returned file was valid until the next call to FindNext/Close.</p>

		<p>And what if the ACL on the directory you are enumerating changes and no longer allows you to list the files? I&#8217;m guessing it will finish the enumeration every time because it probably has a open handle to the directory&#8230;</p>

		<p>Now, the answer to that question *was* predictable :-) .</p>
<p>@skSdnW: my guess is you are right: in Windows, permissions are usually checked at the handle opening or the operation start. It&#8217;s a good balance between security and performance.</p>

		<p>I was under the impression that most modern Unix filesystems cheat seekdir() anyway, often just returning to the beginning. Since your code has to assume that a file may show up more than one time anyway&#8230;</p>

		<p>Another way of looking at it AIUI: there is no point guaranteeing that directory enumeration is atomic unless your API provides other, greater, atomic facilities. Even if there were a guarantee that enumerating directory contents was atomic, files could still be added/deleted before you used the results. You could use an atomicity guarantee when e.g. checking that XML files and JSON files come in matched pairs, but if something is changing the directory under you then the property you are checking will be changing between true and false continually anyway.</p>
<p>(And if you want to check whether you have had a consistent view while enumerating, Windows provides mechanisms monitor a directory to see if it has changed during some period of time.)</p>

		<p>That is a lot of overhead in the user code setting a monitor, changing all file access to use shadow copy would be interesting (but probably impractical).</p>

		<p>Question:<br />
Is it safe to use DeleteFile() for an enumerated file within enumeration loop?<br />
Or maybe first, the list of enumerated files is to be created and then,<br />
after FindClose() was called &#8211; call DeleteFile() for each file name?</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t say for me but it&#8217;s worked for me for ages and ages. I think MS would find the backwards compatibility rather bad to try to change it.</p>

		<p>My experience is that you can delete a file. But don&#8217;t rename one else funny things may happen.</p>

		<p>I guess one who worried about consistency of dir enum may execute enumeration twice and use intersection of their results (taking into account file IDs too). I think this will give set of files that are known at least once coesisted all together. But still no guarantee that things will not change until moment you will use this information for whatever else purpose.</p>

		<p>&#8220;What you can say is that files which were neither created nor deleted during the enumeration will be enumerated&#8221;? Is this 100% true. When the iteration is &#8220;batching&#8221; how does it keep track of the current position? This could be critical. For example</p>
<p>Directory contains 30 files.</p>
<p>1) Get first 10 files<br />
2) Get second 10 files<br />
3 ) Get final 10 files</p>
<p>Now if a file in the first group of 10 is deleted, that could &#8220;move&#8221; all of the files down one position. Thus file #11 would move from the second group (which has not been processed) into the first group (which has alreadyhbeen processed)&#8230;.and thus &#8220;missed&#8221;&#8230;.</p>

		<p>It would only be missed if the batching worked by numerical indices, which it almost certainly does not.  That is just not workable for a number of reasons.  Instead the system probably maintains a stable pointer to the last entry seen so that the next batch can start after that.  By stable pointer I mean something that doesn&#8217;t change when other entries are added or removed, such as a unique ID, or some other means known internally by the filesystem.</p>

		<p>Once an enumeration returns a file object, you don&#8217;t know that the file is still there when you try to use it.   Enumerations are helpful, of course, but they are not a guarantee that the object will be there forever. </p>
<p>Which makes me wonder why anyone would worry about whether the results of the enumeration would contain a file that appeared or disappeared DURING the enum.</p>
