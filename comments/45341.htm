		<p>These must be the same kind of people who shell out to utilities like &quot;ifconfig&quot; when there&#39;s a perfectly good API to do it directly, with much less chance of problems caused by missing (or too much) escaping, and much more reliable treatment of errors. More than one domestic router has security problems due to this mindset.</p>
<p>Most of the explorer.exe operations can be done via documented COM interfaces. IMHO, the only legitimate reason to launch &quot;explorer.exe /e C:somefolder&quot; is when you want to give the user an exporer.exe window on that folder (for instance, the user clicked on an &quot;Open Explorer here&#8230;&quot; button). You shouldn&#39;t do anything to the resulting window afterwards (it might have opened on a new tab of an existing window or something equally crazy, for instance).</p>
<p>And I dislike this &quot;wait a few seconds&quot; mentality some Windows programmers have. Making a program behave differently just because the computer is slow that day (it might be running some heavy background processing, or trashing because the user opened a too-large image on a web browser) is not a good thing.</p>

		<p>Regarding the hosts file, I always assumed it&#39;s location in System32driversetc is due to the use of part of the BSD network stack in Windows. &nbsp;Under *nix the hosts file is usually at /etc/hosts. &nbsp;If the network driver is under System32drivers, just concatenating the two yields System32drivers/etc/hosts. Same goes for the other files files in that directory.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s just a guess.</p>

		<p>@Pat: I think Raymond&#39;s referring to the mild invective used in the Rude Name. &nbsp;There are many ways to express dislike of Windows; &quot;sucks&quot; or &quot;sux&quot; or however you stylize it is rather classless and rude.</p>

		<p>Why was/is so much of Explorer implemented in shell32? Would it not have made more sense to only put the APIs and reusable components (DefView etc) there and things like the start menu and the file browser frame in explorer.exe? Surely you would save a bit of RAM by reducing the size of the non-shareable PE sections so that only explorer.exe pays the price and not every app that loads shell32?</p>

		<p>@skSdnW: IMO, memory use is a relatively minor problem &#8211; modularity and layering are more important reasons why those things should be in explorer.exe if possible. *Ideally*, no component should ever be loaded into an application&#39;s address space if it doesn&#39;t need to be. It just opens up more opportunities for bugs.</p>
<p>Speaking of bugs caused by component loading, I once had to figure out why application wasn&#39;t loading my modified version of SciLexer.DLL wasn&#39;t being loaded. Turns out, I had a shell extension installed that had its own copy of SciLexer.DLL, and when I went to File-&gt;Open the file I was testing with, it would load the shell extension, and the shell extension&#39;s DLL got loaded before mine ever did.</p>
<p>(I wish incrementally improving Win32 was still a concern for Microsoft. There are so many things that could&#39;ve been fixed, like adding an API to load DLLs based on their full path&#8230; *disillusioned sigh*&#8230;)</p>

		<p>To be fair, &quot;X sucks&quot; for any value of X is practically a punctuation mark in the Internet technosphere. Besides, all existing successful operating systems suck in various ways. All of the successful ones are also awesome in various ways. You always remember the way that a piece of technology frustrated you more than you remember the way it made things easy.</p>
<p>I do have to wonder what applications they were. Am I right in thinking that we&#39;re talking about one or more Microsoft products?</p>
<p>One thing that I find interesting about Windows is that some behaviours lie in this strange land between two worlds, where supported behaviour isn&#39;t necessarily the same thing as documented behaviour.</p>

		<p>Guessing or naming bad apps is against the rules of the blog, but it&#39;s definitely not just Microsoft apps. I&#39;ve fixed plenty of third party apps over the years where I&#39;ve seen them doing things like this.</p>
<p>I think things actually got worse after the internet started to take off, as people would increasingly share &quot;helpful&quot; code for doing things like this, often even in cases where official methods existed.</p>
