		<p>Firefox has this in place for extensions. It&#39;s very annoying, as I can&#39;t move to the next major release until the authors of the extensions I depend on have gone through their manifests and declared compatibility.</p>

		<p>Because it is seriously borken for a program to try to predict stuff about the future? I remember a game, <span style="color:red;">XXX</span> by name, written for Win95 (AFAIR). It refused to run on 2000 because &quot;this game is not compatible with Windows NT&quot;. D&#39;oh. With suitable hacks it ran anyway but it was a bother. Seriously not smart to put that kind of constraints on your program.</p>

		<p>And really, isn&#39;t it the operating system&#39;s job to be backward-compatible instead of the applications being forward-compatible? Yes, Linuxers, I&#39;m looking at you.</p>

		<p>@Marquess &#8211; the OS should be backward-compatible with well-behaved programs. A program that hard-codes &quot;Documents and Settings&quot; or pokes into specific controls of system dialogs is not well-behaved :)</p>
<p>Of course there&#39;s nothing wrong with writing apps that depends on certain OS version. I do that all the time. However the app should still handle incompatible versions gracefully and fail in a user-friendly way.</p>

		<p>Lets not forget the fact that Visual Studio will not even allow you to create a program for anything &lt; NT5 these days because it forces the subsystem version</p>

		<p>I remember that DOS utilities used to check the version of DOS they were running on and refuse to execute if it wasn&#39;t the version they were shipped with. Back before hard drives were common you couldn&#39;t expect all DOS utilities (like FORMAT and FDISK) to always be available, so it was handy to keep your favorite ones on the floppy disk you carried around with you. Since the DOS 3.3 FORMAT wouldn&#39;t run on DOS 4.0, though, you had to carry around a separate floppy for each version of DOS you expected to encounter.</p>

		<p>Since we mentioned DirectX&#8230;</p>
<p>The best way to help compatibility is to ensure programming against interfaces instead of implementations. The rest of Microsoft could learn a thing or two from the Direct3D team. The D3D debug runtime is very good at filling buffers with garbage and validating every last function call with trace output.</p>
<p>Honorable mention to AppVerifier, and the Visual C++ library team for things like checked heap, iterators, and comparators.</p>
<p>The most ironic part of all this is that the first 1% of effort in automated sanity checking kills 90% of the most embarrassing blunders that Microsoft bends over backwards to maintain compatibility with. Provide developer versions of all API components. Virtual PC images of Windows with highly nonstandard configurations. Tighter integration of this stuff into the development process. And keep the most fundamental low-overhead checks in retail.</p>
<p>Instead, we have important bits like the shell that contain more compatibility hacks than actual implementation.</p>

		<p>@James Schend</p>
<p>There is more than one. Boy is there ever.</p>
<p>@asf</p>
<p>Support for Windows NT 4 has run out several years ago. Support for Windows 2000 ended this year, after the release of VS2010. I wouldn&#39;t be surprised if the next version dropped it.</p>

		<p>&quot;Don&#39;t tell that process about any data that didn&#39;t exist in Windows XP.&quot;</p>
<p>This would also rely on the Win7 programmer *knowing* XP-land well enough to even be able to try such a thing; and that doesn&#39;t even take into account the effort required to *write* the code to be that careful. &nbsp;The possible pool of developers who could, and would, do such a thing correctly is vanishingly small, even before it&#39;s pared down by the cruel reality of schedules and cost/benefit ratio.</p>

		<p>Morton: I know exactly what game you&#39;re talking about. (Unless there&#39;s more than one.)</p>
<p>Their installer made the baffling assumption that DirectX would never be ported to Windows NT&#8230; what it *really* was looking for was DirectX, but instead of asking whether the system had DirectX or not, it just declared it didn&#39;t because it was NT.</p>
<p>Sadly, people in web dev used to do this all the time. &quot;I can use XMLHttpRequest because document.all exists.&quot; Uh&#8230; no. If you want feature X, check for feature X&#8230; don&#39;t check for unrelated feature Y and assume all systems that do Y also do X.</p>

		<p>@blah: You could ship all of those things, but that&#39;s not the problem&#8211; as you said, MS already has really good debug tools that cover 90%+ of the issues.</p>
<p>The problem is, how do you get the slacker developers to run them? Or, how do you get the *real* slacker developers involved in the community so they know it&#39;s even something they should be doing? People who read this blog aren&#39;t the problem, it&#39;s the hundreds of thousands of programmers who aren&#39;t discussing things like this that are.</p>

		<p>@James Schend: I&#39;ve only ever met the one but then I&#39;m not much of a gamer. But yes, it was the installer wot did it now you mention it.</p>
<p>@Raymond: sorry, I didn&#39;t think when I put that name in (even though the franchise is quite dead). The upside is that now your blog shows up when people search for XXX. Enlightening the world one surprise at a time&#8230; ;-)</p>

		<p>Hi,</p>
<p>One thing crossed my mind when reading &quot;&#8230;the Windows 2000 look, another program would have the Windows XP look, and a third program would have the another program would have the Windows 7 look&#8230;&quot;.</p>
<p>When I create a button using CreateWindow the visual themes are not applied on the button. Is there a &quot;flag&quot; that enables visual styles on controls or rather a separate call? On the other hand, when I use MFC and CButton visual themes are automatically applied. Where is the &quot;magic&quot;? :-)</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Wilczek</p>

		<p>Now now Raymond. Nemo will think you&#39;re picking on him. Not everyone has had to deal with versioning problems. That&#39;s why some job postings specify that you have to have dealt with it. A lot of programs never have to touch files from older versions. You have to learn the mindset to think through the problems changes cause. That&#39;s why web companies, which rarely had to deal with versioning issues, have had so many problems when they create APIs.</p>

		<p>&gt;A program manifested as being tested only on Windows 2000 would have the Windows 2000 look, </p>
<p>&gt;another program would have the Windows XP look, and a third program would have the another </p>
<p>&gt;program would have the Windows 7 look</p>
<p>Wasn&#39;t there another one in there between XP and 7? &nbsp;Or is that like Crazy Cousin Bob, the one we don&#39;t talk about?</p>
