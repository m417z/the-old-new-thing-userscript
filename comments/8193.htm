		<p>[Static text controls automatically copy their contents to the clipboard when you double-click them if you set the SS_NOTIFY style.]</p>
<p>The best part about this feature is that it&#39;s not documented (as far as I can tell).</p>

		<p>That, I&#39;m afraid, smells like a feature that was needed in one place that leaked into the base implementation. It should have been a new SS_COPYTOCLIPBOARD style that people opted into, it&#39;s completely inappropriate to cause random new behaviour in existing applications.</p>
<p>Yes, I know, you have to opt in to the new common controls via the manifest, but come on: you really think people are going to check that LABELS still have the same functionality before turning this on?</p>

		<p>While I don&#39;t mind the new feature (have to opt-in through the controls v6), I do agree that it is a very curious thing to add at this point. Also, besides the already mentioned issue of near impossible discoverability, there is no consistency nor feedback available either! This is almost as bad of an issue as the Ctrl+C for MessageBox, except that short-cut is universal and can eventually be discovered by a considerable leap of faith and frustration by a user with average Windows experience.</p>
<p>Some text may or may not copy when you doubleclick, but the only way you will find out whether it did is by trying to paste something (and if you are unlucky, you just pasted 20 paragraphs from a letter you had been working on earlier&#8230;) The user never knows what to expect with regards to this control because its behaviour is not consistent.</p>
<p>As for the feedback.. if I actually doubleclick something accidentally and it happens to copy something, I want to know so I don&#39;t end up tearing my hairs out wondering why the hell my clipboard got messed up. It best give some sort of visual feedback to avoid this problem. (I have not tested this; I can&#39;t make a test program right now and do not know where to find a label in the OS to test with; but as it was not mentioned I presume there is no such feedback at present.)</p>

		<p>It&#39;s always painful to be reading text and not have the ability to copy it, regardless of the Control.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve worked with the Windows API since Win16, and I didn&#39;t know that you could copy the contents of a MessageBoxW with control-C&#8230;</p>
<p>By the way, I wish that Microsoft&#39;s example code would stop using the ANSI version of the Windows API. &nbsp;Many programmers copy and paste such code. &nbsp;I&#39;m tired of applications that don&#39;t work the instant you try to give them a filename containing Unicode characters. &nbsp;The example above should use wWinMain. &nbsp;(Personally, I explicitly use the W versions of functions rather than rely upon the #define.)</p>

		<p>Please someone tell me I misread or interpret it wrongly. If you add a static text, starting with Vista, if you don&#39;t add the SS_NOTIFY style it will not fire the double click event. Because that is my understanding. Please tell me I got it wrong because if I got right&#8230;then LOOOOOOOOOOL&#8230;..and more&#8230;&#8230;ROFLMAO&#8230;and even more LARONFLOOLMAOOOOO</p>

		<p>Wait a second&#8230; you mean if I absentmindedly double-click static text in a dialog it *might* copy it to the clipboard? &nbsp;WTF?!! How are users supposed to know about this behavior change, if most developers don&#39;t even know about it!</p>

		<p>@Rangoric &#8211; I don&#39;t normally google for biographies of people who add random comments to web pages, so it frankly doesn&#39;t matter how long this person has or has not been working for Microsoft. All I can see is a comment, made 3-4 years ago that *still* hasn&#39;t been incorporated into the official docs.</p>
<p>To me, the most likely explanations are EITHER that the comment is untrue OR that this isn&#39;t behaviour that I should depend upon. Raymond&#39;s pretty much made a blogging career out of documenting the reasons why you shouldn&#39;t depend on something just because it happens to be true in the one version of Windows that you tried it on.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; so it would be a compatibility problem if suddenly it started studying its return code so that the parent could respond</p>
<p>No, it wouldn&#39;t be. Old applications use old version, new applications use &quot;version 6&quot; &#8211; no problem to change behaviour for new apps. I understand, that changing &quot;version 6&quot; NOW would be potentially problematic, but still, it won&#39;t be a problem for &quot;version 7&quot; controls. Even adding SS_COPYTOCLIPBOARD won&#39;t be a compatibility problem for &quot;version 7&quot; &#8211; only it should be very well documented, listed in &quot;changes since last version&quot;, etc&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Rangoric Even if this comment is from Microsoft employee, I don&#39;t consider it documentation. Additionally this comment must have been made on the page documenting the styles of static controls.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  &gt;&gt; This was a change to version 6, which already shipped in Windows XP
</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree about the design and I didn&#39;t notice, that all availabe style bits are used, however, nothing to stop you from changing the required OS version and/or any other means, included, but not limited to, additional API that would configure the particular flag usage or by specifying some configuration information in the manifest. Whether or not is worth the efforts is whole another issue.</p>
