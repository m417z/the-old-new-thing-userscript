		<p>My understanding is that it was the X-ray backscatter imaging machines that were removed from airports. The millimeter-wave scanners are somewhat less controversial and are still in use at most US airports.</p>

		<p><!-- p>Ugh -- sorry, for some reason I thought HTML worked here. &nbsp;Retrying this:


<p>I think David Morgan-Mar&#39;s explanation of cricket is pretty good: <a href="http://www.dangermouse.net/cricket/" rel="nofollow" target="_new">http://www.dangermouse.net/cricket</a></p>




<p>In particular, I like his explanation of how to turn baseball into cricket: <a href="http://www.dangermouse.net/cricket/baseball.html#3" rel="nofollow" target="_new">http://www.dangermouse.net/&#8230;/baseball.html</a></p>

		<p>Quote: &quot;[Wait a second, whose blog is this? -Raymond]&quot;. Oh my bad, I thought is blog of a person who doesn&#39;t give a flying xxxx about stupid things Micro$oft does, but that kinda change it since you worked so hard on Flop3 (aka Win8) and especially us, your readers, attack it so hard in past couple years. Yeah, you&#39;re growing old and bitterness is growing inside as well. Ray I know from 2005 would jump on this, but meh, this new Ray &gt;2012 apparently doesn&#39;t. Don&#39;t tell me, Win8 stuff are out of question here? Only &lt;Win7 OS&#39;es stories of &quot;other side of the air hatch&quot; are allowed?</p>

		<p>@Danny I&#39;m not sure what you expect him to say about it. There are really only two viewpoints (three if you count the &quot;this &#39;vulnerability&#39; is a non-issue&quot; side) and I think they&#39;re all covered well enough in the comments of the ticket in question on Google&#39;s tracker. (Which, oddly enough, is a much more appropriate place to discuss this than an unrelated blog post.)</p>

		<p>[And it was my example of a bad explanation. I mean, who cares about the number of piece of leather which comprise the ball cover? -Raymond]</p>
<p>I think the composition of the ball is a bad example to pick on, as its one of the key things that changes during play, outside of the score.</p>
<p>In all forms of the game, it&#39;s important to know that the ball has a raised seam around the equator, as this is the dominant aerodynamic feature of a new ball. The ball is also bounced, and the seam is important as to how it behaves once it does.</p>
<p>Particularly in one day and test matches, the fact that it is leather, and has a hard core is important: as the same ball is used for 50 or 80 overs(~a day), and the seam wears off, the core softens, and the ball wears unevenly/is polished on one side by the bowling team, which affects the aerodynamics(so called &quot;reverse swing&quot;)</p>
<p>Interestingly (at least to me), if the ball is &quot;damaged&quot; during play (for example, if it is no longer round, or if it is a white ball and has picked up too much green colour from the grass), it is replaced with a ball that is roughly as worn as the ball in play: that is, the umpires will get the ball, and a selection of pre worn replacement balls, and compare them to find the best match.</p>
<p>Granted, this information is not necessary to start to watch cricket, but the fact that it has a seam and a shiny side(eventually) is useful to all but the most casual of viewers.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>My target audience is the casual viewer, however. Secondary considerations (e.g. ball wear, choosing the batting order, fielder positioning) can wait. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>[(But probably not. I&#39;ve learned to steer away from controversy.) -Raymond]</p>
<p>As soon as a demonstrated non-bust is out there won&#39;t be much problem. (I refuse to debate whether or not 8.1 is non-bust and the uptake is too slow to have yet demonstrated one way or the other).</p>
