		<p>Of all the issues with the event that shall not be named I think the most egregious is NBC&#39;s refusal to air things live. &nbsp;I mean seriously, LOLWUT? &nbsp;A global event (that SHALL NOT BE NAMED) has the world&#39;s attention and we learn about the results from news broadcasts BEFORE the event (that SHALL NOT BE NAMED) is shown? &nbsp;My God, it&#39;s full of fail!</p>

		<p>It was aired live in Israel, and the broadcasters were just as bad. They were reading from the sheets, but half the time they were wrong because they either read a line that wasn&#39;t supposed to be read yet, or one that had already happened half an hour ago&#8230;</p>

		<p>It&#39;s not clear to me why this isn&#39;t both an editorial news piece and a series of journalistic statements of fact, but I can see why you wouldn&#39;t want to bother your lawyer with this. I really do wish they would stop with the commercialization that steps on people&#39;s ability to act normally. For another example: I heard that, in the nameless city, no-one except the fast food chain that had paid for the official sponsorship of the games is allowed to sell anything resembling french fries except as part of a &#39;fish and chips&#39; combination &#8211; and the last bit was a last-minute compromise due to public outrage.</p>

		<p>Well, I live in the host country for the event that shall not be named, and at least our presenters were doing a lot better. Of course, since it is our own history and stuff, it would be a sad day if they didn&#39;t know that.</p>

		<p>The reason that NBC is refusing to air certain things live is simple: money. &nbsp;They get far more ad revenue by selling ads in prime time slots for popular events that people want to watch than they would if they aired those events during morning/afternoon hours and sold ads for those time slots instead. &nbsp;When the choice comes down to giving the people what they want or making more money, what do you think a big corporation is going to do?</p>

		<p>Is your avoidance of the protected marks a satirical comment, or simply a way to stay out of trouble? Just asking out of interest; after all, I don&#39;t want you to get into trouble because I typed London, do I?</p>

		<p>NBC, through its much maligned streaming and tape-delay decisions, appears willfully ignorant of the fact that there are faster sources of information than television.</p>
<p>I find it unsurprising, even fitting, that their representatives didn&#39;t recognize the inventor of the World Wide Web.</p>

		<p>almost as bad, imo, was when, during a section about the 7/7 London bombings (the day after London won the right to host the 2012 games) that was remembering the victims, NBC decided to show an interview with Phelps instead&#8230;</p>

		<p>@RP:</p>
<p>The eye-oh-see is extremely protective of their assumed right to mention anything about the sporting-event-modeled-after-an-ancient-Greek-event-of-a-similar-nature. &nbsp;So some of it is satire and some is an honest attempt to avoid involving MS in a lawsuit.</p>

		<p>In Spain, the ceremony was broadcast live by Spanish national television (TVE, Televisi&oacute;n Espa&ntilde;ola). And the commentators/translators were well informed: they had right every name I&#39;m aware of (even that of Tim Berners-Lee), and their comments about what was inspiring the act were helpful (even when you usually don&#39;t need that info for a neighbor country).</p>

		<p>Raymond: In this case, the word &quot;editorial&quot; is not being used as the noun that means &quot;an opinion piece written by the editors&quot;, but is an adjective that means &quot;the literary content&quot;. Generally speaking, &quot;commercial use&quot; means use in advertisements, while &quot;editorial use&quot; means use in any other part of the publication. Using the marks in your post would be considered editorial use.</p>
<p>frymaster: The NBC editors thought it was a generic memorial and didn&#39;t know that the memorial piece was specifically addressing 7/7. I haven&#39;t seen it, but I&#39;m guessing that there was nothing about it that overtly said &quot;7/7 bombing memorial&quot;.</p>

		<p>In the summer of 2012, many shops across England have closed. Birmingham, Newcastle, London, Southampton; all cities have been affected.</p>
<p>Several Games have closed, directing customers to their nearest branch of the sister brand, Gamestation.</p>
<p>With the cost of iron, copper, gold and silver changing, scrap dealers are having a great time, while pawnbrokers are starting to feel some pressure; people are pawning, but not rebuying.</p>
<p>Tanning salons are having to cut their prices drastically in order to meet competition from bronze sprays which are available from any corner shop now.</p>
<p>Sorry, Raymond.</p>

<p>Really, the protection of &quot;Olympics&quot; with respect to sporting events is not especially stronger than the protection Apple receive for and &quot;London 2012&quot; is not esentially the same as the protection afforded &quot;Windows 95&quot;</p>

		<p>@GWO The Olympics don&#39;t get the same trademark protection as everyone else. &nbsp;They actually get their own special protections in their own special legislation. &nbsp;See, for example, the &quot;Olympic Symbol etc. (Protection) Act 1995&quot; and the &quot;London Olympic Games and Paralympic Games Act 2006&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Adam Rosenfield: Isn&#39;t the reason ad revenue is higher in the evening exactly because there are more people watching then? &quot;When the choice comes down to giving the people what they want or making more money&quot;: Isn&#39;t giving the people what they want how to make more money? Not that I think giving people Geraldo and the Solid Gold dancers is some kind of selfless noble act, but it&#39;s clearly giving the people what they want. (Sorry, I haven&#39;t watched TV for a long time.)</p>
<p>A large percentage of commenters on this blog sit in a cubicle and can read blogs and watch streamed sports while at work, but most people don&#39;t have that option. If most people really were able to watch during the day, ad revenue would be higher during the day.</p>

		<p>Random, repeating events means that they would be able to show fewer events overall.</p>

		<p>@Random832: &nbsp;I thought the same thing, that the opening ceremonies could be shown during the day and again in prime time. &nbsp;Ad rates for both broadcasts could probably be set high enough for the network to be happy. &nbsp;But the network seemed to want to broadcast the opening ceremonies in prime time *only*, for some reason. </p>

		<p>&quot;repeating events means that they would be able to show fewer events overall.&quot; &#8211; or they could just have more channels. But this argument doesn&#39;t apply to the opening ceremony &#8211; there&#39;s no event to show at 4pm.</p>

		<p>I love the BBC, but recently their events coverage has been awful. During the Jubilee boats-on-the-Thames-thing the name of which escapes me, I was watching BBC coverage &#8211; they kept cutting away from the boats to show Fearne Cotton, and when they WERE showing the boats they had no clue what was going on. I&#39;ve heard Sky&#39;s coverage was much better, but I don&#39;t fund the Murdoch empire so couldn&#39;t have watched it in HD (Sky News HD is part of the HD pack, which combined with the basic pack comes to something like 30 GBP per month&#8230;). Their opening ceremony coverage was better but stil not great &#8211; Trevor Nelson, the male black Fearne Cotton, was there to drag things down with inane comments. I bet he didn&#39;t know who Tim Berners Lee was, but at least there were two competent commentators there to speak for most of the time :p</p>

		<p>Random, I believe that they are already using all of their channels pretty much full time. &nbsp;As for the opening ceremony, as someone else stated, that probably involves things such as IOC licensing it to them for only a single full showing.</p>

		<p>GregM: NBC paid over $1,000,000,000 for the rights to air the games. That means they get to pretty much dictate the terms. If they wanted to show the opening ceremonies twice, I&#39;m sure they could have easily negotiated for it.</p>
