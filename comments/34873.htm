		<p>I don&#8217;t know if the name of the play is actually &quot;El S&#225;lon M&#233;xico&quot;, but I believe you should&#8217;ve written &quot;El Sal&#243;n M&#233;xico&quot;.</p>

		<p>I saw the Moscow Symphony Orchestra play Tchaikovsky&#8217;s 5th here in Dallas and it was simply amazing. Who better to play a Russian composer&#8217;s song than the Russians?</p>

		<p>The kazoos reminded me of being in the audience when my choir was doing Bernstein&#8217;s <em>Mass</em>, a huge work written in the early 1970s when Bernstein had just discovered how trendy the Catholic church was (this was just after Vatican II, when (in the words of Tom Lehrer) the Pope had changed a lot of things &quot;in an effort to make the church more commercial&quot;).  <em>Mass</em> does, in fact, use kazoos, to great effect.  It&#8217;s a shame the only extant recording is by an undersized and underpowered choir who didn&#8217;t do it justice; my choir &#8212; actually, a combination of university choirs from all around Australia attending that year&#8217;s Intervarsity Choral Festival &#8212; did a spectacular job, and the guy singing the lead sounded like Nick Cave at his best.  Easily the best concert I&#8217;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>So, in summary: kazoos can be good.</p>

		<p>It demands quite a bit from the basses in the choir at the end&#8230; do you know how hard it is to fake singing low low low Bb?</p>
<p>: )</p>

		<p>After two weeks of partying all night and rehearsing all day at an Intervarsity Choral Festival, believe me &#8212; the trick is getting any notes ABOVE a low low low Bb.  And that&#8217;s if you&#8217;re a soprano.  Basses by that stage need clearance from the local seismological institute before they warm up.</p>

		<p>I wish I had known you were coming, I would have looked for you. :-) I was singing Bass. The Barber was really fun to do: I never had to learn to sing a 12-tone melody before. I&#8217;m starting to hit the saturation point on the Mahler, though &#8212; while I was very emotionally affected at some of the rehearsals, by the time we got to the concert, I was having a bad case of been-there-done-that.</p>
