		<p>If you believe Wikipedia &quot;Ren and Stimpy&quot; were Exchange Client and Schedule+. I would have thought it was Exchange Client and Microsoft Mail though. I remember in 1998 training for my MCSE and having to learn the Exchange Client because it came with Exchange Server 5.5. </p>

		<p>I suppose there&#39;s more back story as to why he assumed Christopher Wren and didn&#39;t just assume the project was named after a type of bird?</p>

		<p>@Jack B Nimble: Exchange Client and Schedule+ makes much more sense. &nbsp;Schedule+ was going to be an enterprise-ready calendar and task management solution, while Exchange Client would serve as an e-mail client companion to the Exchange Server. &nbsp;Outlook, the resulting program, ended up combining the featureset of both programs into a single solution. &nbsp;Microsoft Mail was the precursor software to Exchange, so it doesn&#39;t make any sense to develop that in addition to Exchange Client and then merge them; a much more sensible solution would be to add backwards compatibility support in Exchange Client (which they did).</p>

		<p>Exchange Client (-&gt; Outlook) was part of Windows 95 (mainly as Fax solution) and Mail and News, too. Mail and News was later renamed Outlook Express because of the success of Outlook and to give an impression of an Outlook Light. Actually, it wasn&#39;t. The two programs were developed independently. Outlook was developed by the Office team, and Outlook Express was developed by the IE team.</p>
<p>So, yes, the &quot;other&quot; being Schedule+ fits perfectly.</p>

		<p>This one time, I wrote a proposal to daboss@Microsoft to support esoteric programming languages to assist in porting a project. Never heard back :(. But now come to think of it, I wrote the proposal in Whitespace (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language#Whitespace">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Esoteric_programming_language</a>) and sent it via Outlook. I bet Outlook was configured for html messages or something and corrupted my proposal!

		<p>Hmm, I&#39;ve never heard of Christopher Wren, and, although I *have* heard of &quot;Ren and Stimpy&quot;, I expect that if *I* were working at Microsoft in the 90s and heard of a project codenamed &quot;Ren&quot; in isolation, I would wonder why a mail client was codenamed after a command used to rename files.</p>
<p>Also, I didn&#39;t realize that Outlook was only introduced in 1997. The first version of Office I used was 98, and I kind of assumed Outlook has been there for a while, it was quite mature for a 1-year-old project. That explains why Outlook Express wasn&#39;t called that until 1997.</p>

		<p>Outlook is one of the (few) reasons my company will buy new Office and Exchange versions &#8211; another is the sheer amount of legacy office documents with macros and complex pivot tables. We searched for a suitable replacement a while back, but either the alternatives hav not all functions or cost even more&#8230;</p>

		<p>Raymond, on the topic of Outlook could you do a post discussing on the Office file formats (specifically Msg format) and compatibility considerations (and maybe mention a few mistakes) made over the product lifetime. I am curious as to the decision process that resulted with the different MIME properties being used for the same data by various Outlook versions and how minor decisions for the msg format point early in the development (at a time when file size and memory requirements had considerable performance implications) continue to have to be worked around.</p>
<p>If possible could you also allude to why Microsoft has yet to make the transition to a newer message format (say msgx, akin to docx and xlsx). I understand that such a new format would require providing of a free viewer / translator to msg format (but I seem to recall that this was done for docx) and that no new feature is not without it&#39;s cost but Exchange web services already returns .EML format items &#8211; is the internal inbox format not separated enough to allow it&#39;s replacement?</p>

		<p>Seph: but why not ask someone from Office to do so? Raymond works on Windows, in an entirely separate team.</p>

		<p>@Boris, Stephen Griffin wrote about this in 2008 with <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/stephen_griffin/archive/2008/01/08/no-msg-for-you.aspx">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/no-msg-for-you.aspx</a> but I think Raymond would have some interesting insight and opinions on supporting and expanding legacy (and until recently proprietary) file formats and would be able to provide some interesting anecdotal examples of why things are they way they are. Rather than a dry response such as &quot;MFCMAPI provides the code needed to save MAPI properties to XML format but we (Microsoft) have no plans to officially support it&quot;.</p>
