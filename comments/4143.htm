		<p>I&#39;m always amazed at how often people want to mess with other processes that are not designed for it, or are even made by third parties. &nbsp;Often, the developers even want to put such tricks into production applications.</p>
<p>I do reverse engineering on occasion &#8211; I definitely have messed with applications that don&#39;t like to be messed with (malware, for example), so I know various ways of modifying the operation of other programs. &nbsp;But really, such techniques should only be used by debugging tools or highly-specialized system information tools. &nbsp;Process separation exists for a reason, and applications would be more stable and compatible if they kept more to themselves. &nbsp;Your application is not special.</p>

		<p>@Mark Y. Press the compose key, then press &quot;, then press o (don&#39;t try to hold any of those keys down). &nbsp;You get &#39;ö&#39;.</p>
<p>What, you don&#39;t have a compose key? &nbsp;Well, just Google &quot;O with umlaut&quot; (even though that&#39;s actually a diaeresis) and copy/paste.</p>

		<p>My question is rather where that &quot;ö&quot; in &quot;coöperative&quot; comes from &#8211; whether it belongs there at all.</p>
<p>Usually, &quot;umlauts&quot; (or any modification of a vowel sound) comes in conjugations or other modifications of a base form. (In English it isn&#39;t always reflected in spelling of the vowel sound, such as child/children, woman/women, but it&#39;s the same phenomenon.) But there is no vowel sound modification from &quot;operative&quot; to &quot;cooperative&quot;, so why the change in spelling? Or would you spell it &quot;öperative&quot; (&quot;öperation&quot;, &quot;öperate&quot;, &#8230;) and as well?</p>
<p>(For those unfamiliar with the &quot;ö&quot;: In West European languages using it as a plain vowel, it is pronounced somwehat like the opening vowel sound of &quot;up&quot;. I never heard any native English speaker pronounce &quot;cooperative&quot; like &quot;co-upperative&quot;.)</p>

		<p>@j b: The &quot;ö&quot; in &quot;coöperative&quot; has a diaeresis on top of it, not an umlaut (although they look the same). It is very common in the Dutch language for instance. See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaeresis_(diacritic)">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Diaeresis_(diacritic)</a> for its usage.</p>

		<p>@Ramon: although, in Dutch, non-technical speakers often call the diaeresis an umlaut anyway (or, even more commonly, &quot;dots&quot; &#8212; which, though prosaic, has the benefit of being not technically incorrect). The proper Dutch term for the diaeresis is &quot;trema&quot;. There&#39;s no real confusion since Dutch itself has no umlaut, except in German loanwords (most prominently &quot;überhaupt&quot;).</p>
<p>Use of the diaeresis in English is rare, almost archaic. It&#39;s certainly pointless &#8212; orthographically, English is too far gone to offer pronunciation hints in diacritics.</p>

		<p>Still off-topic, but &#8230; even though we think that American English has 26 letters in the alphabet, older writing will have (sorry for the discomfort) words like &quot;diarrhoea&quot; where the o and e are combined into one letter. &nbsp;Perhaps that&#39;s &quot;chiefly British&quot;, but it&#39;s certainly not one of the 26 letters&#8230; along with ö.</p>
<p>I disagree that the diaeresis in English is pointless. &nbsp;Some magazines print coöperate as a matter of course, and I think it&#39;s helpful.</p>

		<p>The diaeresis in English shows the second vowel is pronounced separately, not as part of a dipthong. So &quot;coöp&quot; discusses people or things that work together while &quot;coop&quot; is the place where chickens live (this is overly simplified but basically true).</p>

		<p>@DWalker: if there were ever a reasonable case for &quot;cooperate&quot; with the &quot;oo&quot; pronounced as one vowel, you&#39;d have a point. There is no ambiguity; there might be a slight benefit to non-native speakers but even that is dubious (given that pronouncing &quot;cooperate&quot; from spelling will probably be the least of their worries).</p>
<p>In the rare case where there is ambiguity (Nick&#39;s coöp versus coop) I don&#39;t know why anyone wouldn&#39;t just use a hyphen and write it &quot;co-op&quot;, which has the benefit of avoiding potential encoding issues with the diaeresis. Even so &quot;co-operate&quot; would be overkill since there is no other way to read &quot;cooperate&quot; (except, again, if you don&#39;t know the language).</p>
<p>Since the diaeresis is the only native diacritic English has left I can see why people would cling to it, but it&#39;s still a relic.</p>

		<p>Ramon Beiboer,</p>
<p>&quot;Umlaut&quot; and &quot;diaresis&quot; are really two sides of the same coin. &quot;Diaresis&quot; is the graphical indicator, &quot;umlaut&quot; is the effect (roughly speaking: &quot;changed sound&quot;). In my native language, Norwegian, &quot;omlyd&quot; can be indicated in writing in various accents or change of vowel (e.g. &quot;tann&quot;/&quot;tenner&quot; &#8211; tooth/teeth); not restricted to diaresis. In German, diaresis is by far the most common way to indicate an umlaut (and that is what the diaresis is used for, nothing else that I know of), so &quot;umlaut&quot; has become the common way to refer to the two dots. (&quot;Diaresis&quot; doesn&#39;t sound &quot;at home&quot; in the German language!)</p>
<p>Worth mentioning: In Norwegian (and Danish), ö originally was an o umlaut, but has for about a hundred years been replaced with a slashed o (&quot;ø&quot;) which is used in lots of words as an &quot;independent&quot; vowel &#8211; that is, not an umlaut. Many words are written with an ø in its base, unconjugated, form. Similarly, the ä (a diaresis) has been an independent vowel (&quot;æ&quot;) for just as long. In Swedish, however, ö and ä (more or less interchangeable with the Norwegian/Danish ø and æ) are still written with diaresis, yet treated as independent vowels &#8211; e.g. they are sorted at the end of the alphabet, not as their &quot;base character&quot; &#8230;but not in the same order as in Danish or Norwegian&#8230; (The Swedes go å, ä. ö, while we go æ, ø, å) &#8230;The good things about standards, and so on. We all know that one.</p>

		<p>Nick, </p>
<p>&gt; The diaeresis in English shows the second vowel is pronounced separately, not as part of a dipthong. </p>
<p>That explanation makes sense, and even more if you think of the use of e.g. i diaresis (ï) in words like &#39;naïve&#39;, where is serves a similar purpose: To indicate that &quot;ai&quot; is not a diphtong. For &quot;co-operative&quot; a hyphen could be (and often is) used for the same purpose, but you never write &quot;na-ive&quot;.</p>
<p>In German-related languages (like the Nordic ones) we never use ï (i diaresis) in the official spelling. You _might_ encounter &quot;naïv&quot;; we sor of accept the &#39;Latin&#39; spelling but think of it as a mixture of some writer pretending to be An Intellectual :-) and someone who thinks it necessary to help the first-time reader of the word to learn its pronounciation. We explain it as &quot;a long &#39;eee&#39; sound&quot; &#8211; just as we explain the circonflex accent on &quot;fôr&quot; (fodder) as &quot;a long oooo sound&quot; to distinguish it from &quot;for&quot;, the preposition. </p>
<p>Official spelling omits both the diaresis in &quot;naive&quot; and the circonflex on &quot;for&quot;. You are supposed to deduce both meaning and correct pronounciation from context &#8211; which happens to be far easier in Norwegian than in English. For those who do not know &quot;English is tough stuff&quot;, look up, and read out loud, <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://appliedabstractions.com/2010/02/04/english-is-tough-stuff/">appliedabstractions.com/&#8230;/english-is-tough-stuff</a> (it is found at dozens of other sites as well).</p>

		<p>It is naïve to assume that English entirely can be written without diacritics.</p>

		<p>@j b: (Still off-topic here, sorry Raymond!) Well, maybe I am using the wrong English term here (I&#39;m not English, I&#39;m Dutch so forgive me). What I meant to say is that the diaeresis (the two dots) can have two meanings: the umlaut (changing the way the vowel is pronounced) and the &#39;trema&#39;. The first one is only used in Dutch in words taken from other languages, like German (überhaupt, see JM&#39;s comment). The trema is used more often and has a different effect. The Dutch translation of diaeresis is a goog example of it: diëresis. The trema (or &nbsp;diëresis) is placed on the first &#39;e&#39; to indicate that the &#39;ie&#39; is not proncounced as one sound, but as two seperate sounds &#39;i&#39; and &#39;e&#39; (in the Dutch language we have a special sound for &#39;ie&#39;, &#39;eu&#39;, &#39;oe&#39; and more of these two-vowel combinations). And the separation is also the case for the English word &#39;coöoperation&#39;. But you are right about the umlaut and it&#39;s usage in German and Danish and Norwegian :)</p>
