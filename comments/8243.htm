		<p>It&#39;s like a flag. The @ stands for our land, the , stands for our history, and the &#8211; stands for defense against invaders.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t ask how. They just do. Because I said so.</p>

		<p>So basically indirect-string:filename?index=123 vs. indirect-string:filename?id=456</p>

		<p>Icons don&#39;t use a @ in front of the filename. So it&#39;s not that the format for strings is the same as the one for icons, it&#39;s just that an implementation detail for icons that&#39;s meaningless for strings was for some reason used for strings. That&#39;s fine, but it seems a bit silly to pretend there&#39;s a good reason for it (unless it&#39;s just a way to get in a free sneer at the person asking the question).</p>

		<p>Since we&#39;re on topic of localization: will Windows ever learn to use plural forms in languages that use more than two of them? (Actually, does the current MUI format even allow for something like this?)</p>

		<p>I wish I was reading oldnewthing back in 2003.</p>
<p>That entry does explain the weird phrasing I see all around the UI (the most common &#8211; &quot;X items selected&quot; in Slovenian is translated as &quot;This number of items is selected: X&quot; &#8211; and it sounds much worse in Slovenian). Such phrasing is really unusual in Slovenian, and stands out, which is why I was wondering if the support for plural forms can be added in a future version of Windows (I&#39;ve also seen places where &quot;X things&quot; was used [in Slovenian], which was not the right plural form for X). A certain popular open-source localization framework has a working solution.</p>
<p>BTW, that article mentions that Slovenian has dual &#8211; this is true, but we actually use 4 different forms depending on the number of items.</p>

		<p>So what you&#39;re saying is that the minus sign stands for &quot;use icon id rather than index&quot;, as semicolon in C++ stands for &quot;end of statement&quot; and comma stands for &quot;end parameter with another parameter following&quot;.</p>

		<p>Reading that old topic again, since I&#39;ve read something about complex script from Micheal Kaplan&#39;s blog, I&#39;d think the rotating rule should be governed by the fonts themselve instead of specific code of the toolbar. (I checked to see there&#39;s no such indicator in complex script specification, just suggesting it&#39;s possible to do so there)</p>
