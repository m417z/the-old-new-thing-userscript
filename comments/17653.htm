		<p>What do you think the odds are that when he said &quot;Thai&quot; he actually meant &quot;Taiwanese&quot;? This is a fairly common source of confusion for uneducated people in the United States.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a medicine I once saw which was manufactured in Germany for sale in Russia. The entire label was in Russian (except, I think, the name of the manufacturer was in German), but there was a single line of English on the bottle: &quot;Made in Germany&quot;. It was not repeated in German or Russian anywhere else on the bottle. Someone please explain that one to me.</p>

		<p>I was born in Spain, but a few years back I spent a year in &#197;rhus, Denmark. Over there, while attending Language School, the teacher once tested us by telling us a little joke in Danish (my first!). It went kinda like this (transmogrified into American English):</p>
<p>&quot;Once, there were two men sitting on the front lawn of a house in some little town somewhere in the American midwest drinking beer, when a car stopped in front of the house. The driver rolled down the window and muttered a question in some language that sounded like Chinese or something. The two men just gave him a shrug and told him in English that they didn&#8217;t understand. The driver proceeded to try asking in other languages. German, Russian&#8230; who knows, but in the end he just rolled up his window and drove away in frustration. One of the men turned to his friend and said &#8216;Maybe I should find a school or something and learn how to speak some languages&#8217;. &#8216;How come?&#8217; asked his friend. &#8216;Well&#8230; if I had known more languages I might have been able to help that gentleman in the car&#8217;, to which his friend replied &#8216;I don&#8217;t know about that. See&#8230; that man spoke like Chinese and German and who knows which other languages, but that didn&#8217;t help him any&#8217;&quot;.</p>
<p>Anyway&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Someone You Know: That&#8217;s not a mistake a Swede would make. Thailand is one of the top tourism destinations for Swedes. In fact, when the tsunami hit, Swedish were the non-local people most affected (/killed).</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s also the bad accent approach. Mumble something to yourself, preferably in Gibberish, then say in an awful accent &quot;I don&#8217;t speak &lt;insert language here&gt;&quot;, preferably with mistakes too. I say &quot;ne parlon Franchese&quot; a lot in France, and it works every time. I do speak some French though, just not to those people.</p>

		<p>@Boris: &quot;Made in Germany&quot; was used by the British to mark produce made by the enemy in order to promote the home-grown stuff. The plan backfired when the label turned out to be more a sign of quality. That is why you still have the English catchphrase instead of a German one (&quot;Hergestellt/Produziert in Deutschland&quot;).</p>

		<p>@Boris: Various treaties require that all products in international trade have the country of origin marked on them in English, even if the rest of the packaging is in some other language. &nbsp;The customs folks want something consistent so they can quickly process items, even if it&#8217;s not in their native language, and most of them worldwide know English by now, so it made sense to standardize on that. &nbsp;Even if a given customs agent doesn&#8217;t know English, there are only a few hundred possible values for that &quot;Made in X&quot; label, so they can simply memorize what the various values (or the most common ones, at least) mean and what duties to charge for that value.</p>

		<p>&#8230;beyond English being common, it has a very small character set, and I&#8217;d venture to say the most recognizable character set in the world. &nbsp;(Though there are a few countries whose short English names include an e-accute &#8212; R&#201;UNION, SAINT BARTH&#201;LEMY, and one &#244;, C&#212;TE D&#8217;IVOIRE &#8212; according to <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.iso.org/iso/english_country_names_and_code_elements" rel="nofollow">http://www.iso.org/iso/english_country_names_and_code_elements</a>.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll bet the average Chinese-speaker can copy down strings in ALL UPPERCASE ENGLISH and have them be recognizable afterwards then the average English-speaker can copy down strings in Chinese and have them be recognizable afterwards. &nbsp;This may speak more to how much Chinese people are exposed to English then to how easy a language English is.</p>

		<p>@theorbtwo: it&#8217;s funny to notice that the accentuated country names are all French names.</p>
<p>And, French language doesn&#8217;t require the upper cased letters to keep their accents&#8230; so the e-accute could have been removed as well.</p>
<p>And for the C&#244;te d&#8217;Ivoire, it could have been translated to Ivory Coast, but I suppose the countries themselves decide for ther iso short name, and maybe these ones were attached to their &#233; or their &#244;</p>

		<p>I agree with Anthony Wieser &#8212; it was probably a recruiter for some kind of cult, probably a religious cult. The combination of illogical reasoning, pretending to be helpful, and annoying persistence, points in that direction.</p>
