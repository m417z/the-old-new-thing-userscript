		<p>At least MS is smart enough to not do it to themselves. Unlike that portable computer company (whose name escapes me right now), who announced the successor to their current product, thereby stifling sales and lacking money to actually develop the successor.</p>

		<p>(Side note: I recall a commercial a couple of years back where there was someone singing to the camera while four people sat on a couch eating pizza. There was only one slice left, and suddenly all four simultaneously lunged for it. However, one of them had the brilliant idea of sneezing on the pizza slice rather than grabbing for it.</p>
<p>So keith, if you thought &quot;cookie licking&quot; was gross, at least it beats &quot;pizza sneezing&quot;.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been fortunate enough to not ever have to deal with cookie-licking at any of my jobs &#8211; a couple of companies ago, two different departments both began work towards a single idea, but the company took the road of &quot;put the groups together and make a single product&quot; instead of wasting time arguing about who had the rights to the idea, or who had the better plan for realizing the idea.</p>

		<p>Patent trolling.</p>
<p>If a company can acquire a patent, they can effectively prevent others from implementing that idea, whether or not the patent holders plan to implement the idea themselves. I have no personal experience with this, but the impression that I get is that this is particularly common with software patents.</p>

		<p>There was a car commercial a while back that had people allocating themselves cars by licking the door handles. Perhaps this commercial was inspired by cookie licking.</p>

		<p>Story:</p>
<p>Child at a party needs to go off to the bathroom but is afraid the other guests will eat all the cookies while he is gone. &nbsp;So, he licks the cookies and leaves them on the plate while he&#8217;s gone.</p>
<p>The other children turn the cookies upside down and lick them, returning them to the plate to await the return of the bathroom boy.</p>

		<p>Following on from Jared&#8217;s story, I&#8217;m reminded of the chap in the pub who needs to go to the toilet but worries that somebody will nick his pint; so he leaves a note on top of his glass reading &quot;I have spat in this pint.&quot;</p>
<p>When he returns his pint is intact, but on the note somebody has added &quot;So have I.&quot;</p>

		<p>Bloke in pub wants to go to the toilet but has to leave his pint on the bar, so writes a note on a bit of paper &quot;I have spat in this&quot; and leaves it on the top of the glass. When he returned somebody had written &quot;So have I&quot; on it.</p>

		<p>It occurs to me that how one interprets the phrase &quot;cookie-licking&quot; depends on whether or not that person would actually eat a cookie after someone has licked it.</p>
<p>Which brings me to my 2nd point: &nbsp;That&#8217;s nasty, Michael G.</p>

		<p>Engineering companies have a particular lingo for product development that isn&#8217;t obvious to outsiders, leaving them easy prey for propaganda by jealous competitors and know-it-alls.</p>
<p>ANNOUNCES: the company has money to invest in a product, and wants customer suggestions about what it should be. Actual development typically hasn&#8217;t started. Delivery could be months away, and anyone who knows the lingo understands that.</p>
<p>INTRODUCES: the product has been prototyped and is ready for refinement and manufacturing</p>
<p>SHIPS: The product is ready for mass-production.</p>
<p>Again, this is engineering companies in general. Not just Microsoft. Not just software companies. Not just apparent monopolies.</p>

		<p>Some years ago, there was an Australian TV ad involving two workers with one chocolate bar. One of them took the bar, licked one (long) side of it and gave the other a smug look. The other one took the bar and licked the other side. Eventually, they got a hacksaw and cut it through the centre, but then forgot which piece &quot;belonged&quot; to whom!</p>

		<p>&gt; In both cases, the examples fail to capture the concept of preventing people from doing something by saying that only you can do it. It is a political tactic internal to an organization, not something done in public. </p>
<p>I disagree. &nbsp;Yes, &#8220;Google plans to enter the X market with product Y&#8221; doesn&#8217;t *prevent* someone else from entering the same market, but it is strongly discouraging. &nbsp;Just in the same way that licking a cookie doesn&#8217;t really *prevent* someone else from eating it, it&#8217;s just strongly discouraging.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>True, the effect is similar, but &#8220;cookie-licking&#8221; as used inside Microsoft refers specifically to &#8220;I am doing it so you <u>can&#8217;t</u>&#8221; &#8211; as opposed to &#8220;I am doing it so you probably don&#8217;t want to.&#8221; -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>It reminds me of a story a friend of mine told me. </p>
<p>His grandmother gave him and his sister a chocolate bar to share. </p>
<p>He immediately grabbed the bar, licked it and offered it to his sister. Things didn&#8217;t turn out as he expected, though. </p>
<p>Instead of refusing the chocolate, his sister took the bar, *licked the other side of the bar*, said &quot;nah, I don&#8217;t want it &#8211; you can have it&quot; and gave it back him.</p>
<p>Not sure if there is a separate term for this&#8230; (double cookie licking?)</p>

		<p>I saw this trick a lot while at MS. In my experience, it was all about preventing any sort of encroachment on an existing franchise (&quot;defending the business&quot;)and more importantly, on the team delivering the current franchise. Windows, Office, SQL, and Exchange all practiced this trick. It frequently involved deep negotiations between CVPs. Interestingly, toward the end of my time at MS, even MSR was trying to stop things they felt were getting too close to one of their research areas.</p>
