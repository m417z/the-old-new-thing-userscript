		<p>If the 1/11 concert isn&#8217;t called Bach to Bach to Bach, there&#8217;s something very wrong with the universe.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m a long way from Seattle, but my wife and I recently attended a performance of our local symphony orchestra. We&#8217;d acquired the tickets from a quiz night so we didn&#8217;t look at the program until the day, when we saw there was the premiere of a new trombone concerto. If we&#8217;d known ahead of time I would have made sure we got a ticket for our eldest daughter, who&#8217;s studying trombone; the concert was recorded for broadcast by the classical radio station the following week, and I got her to listen to that, but sadly neither the orchestra nor the radio station were able to sell me a copy of the recording. It was an amazing piece so I was really disappointed that we couldn&#8217;t hear it again.</p>

		<p>Love the Baroque and Wine series, all three of those are right in my sweet spot (and extra bonus points as they also involve wine). </p>
<p>Not entirely sure I can justify the return flights from North-West England to Seattle though &#8230; (and a +1 / upvote for R P whilst I&#8217;m here)</p>
