		<p>This is why we get so many lousy user interfaces, because somebody decides that people are better off doing something in a prescribed way, rather than doing it in a more natural way.</p>
<p>To that end, I think e-books will never work, people prefer handling a paper version. Hypertext rarely works to my satisfaction (MS help documentation is often big offender in this area &#8211; and I keep sending them feedback) &#8211; I am often frustrated by jumping to a page with no more than a single sentence or paragraph.</p>

<p>Last time I brought a counterpoint with a analogy[0], Raymond yelled at me! Like a girl, ok, but still!! :)</p>
<p>Good luck with yours!</p>

		<p>On shopping sites signing up for an account should be optional. If i buy something in a store, i dont have to pick a username and password that im never going to use again, and will probably forget anyway. Billing information is obviously mandatory.</p>
<p>For example, this weekend i was purchasing movie tickets online. Why do I need to sign up for an account? The tickets are non refundable, there isn&#8217;t any shipping to track, etc. If the theater wasn&#8217;t far nicer than any other nearby i would have made purchasing the tickets optional as well.</p>
<p>A few sites allow you to purchase items without having to sign up for an account which i really like for one time purchases. If its a store i frequent, then an account is more acceptable, but i dont want it required that i have a login if i dont intend to come back.</p>
<p>So yes, it actually does mean buying something is optional to me.</p>

		<p>Well, in case of a user-interface the preferred way is to have just mandatory fields. Of course, every fields will be needed in the further process.</p>

		<p>This happens more than half the time: </p>
<p>When installing <font color="red">XYZ</font>, I am presented with a pre-checked option to &#8220;Show me the advantages of <font color="red">ABC</font>&#8220;.</p>
<p>If I forget to turn this off and click the installer&#8217;s &#8220;Finish&#8221; button, the dialog goes to lunch and never returns. &nbsp;I have to kill it manually via Task Manager.</p>
<p>So here is a case where the &#8220;optional&#8221; option is defaulted ON for me (on a MANDATORY download) and results in a computer near-death-experience unless deactivated. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Irony aside, what possible reason is there for the checkbox? &nbsp;Is this another example of the marketing suits hovering over the shoulders of the dev team, or a legal issue, or what?</p>

		<p>Ha, you&#8217;re lucky, more often that I&#8217;d like to see, when I click a survey button all the work that went into the form for which the survey was asking about get&#8217;s lost. &nbsp; I no longer fill out web-based survey&#8217;s like that.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been harking on about this for a while. This happens all the time, even on Microsoft surveys. I would be willing to bet they would get a lot more feedback if they removed mandatory fields.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a recent experience with my bank. I received email asking me to fill out an online survey. I usually ignore these things, but this time I decided to do it &#8212; I really want to give them specific feedback on their online bill paying services.</p>
<p>Several questions into the survey, I hit the following gem (paraphrased):</p>
<p>Have you tried online statements instead of paper statements?</p>
<p>(O) Yes, I tried it, but I went back to paper statements.</p>
<p>(O) No, I haven&#8217;t tried it.</p>
<p>Note: There is no answer for the &quot;yes, I tried it, I&#8217;m satisfied with it, and I have no need for paper statements now&quot;, which happens to be my situation.</p>
<p>Choosing the &quot;yes&#8230;&quot; answer leads to a series of questions probing for reasons online statements didn&#8217;t work out. Choosing the &quot;no&#8230;&quot; answer leads to questions for reasons online statements haven&#8217;t been tried yet.</p>
<p>Of course, one MUST choose one of these to continue the survey.</p>
<p>Lame.</p>

		<p>My solution would have been slightly different from Raymond&#8217;s. &nbsp;I would have quickly marked all of the 43 questions with &quot;completely unsatisfied&quot; or whatever the lowest score could be and then give them my verbose feedback. &nbsp;I like to operate under the philosophy of &quot;ask a stupid question and you will get a stupid answer&quot;.</p>

		<p>I think what they meant with optional is that the survey is optional. However inside the survey none of the questions are optional.</p>
<p>yeah they could have worded it differently</p>

		<p>Heh, reminds me of a sequence of prompts I saw in an installer for a major programming suite. It went roughly like this:</p>
<p>Prompt 1: Your computer needs to be rebooted before you can use the installed program. [Reboot now] [Reboot later]</p>
<p>I picked &quot;Reboot later&quot;, because I planned to install a few other packages before the reboot.</p>
<p>Prompt 2: Setup has failed to complete as you chose to not reboot the computer. You must reboot the computer before you can use the product. [Exit setup]</p>
<p>Way to go, scaring the user. Ah well, clicked &quot;Exit setup&quot;, and was presented with this gem:</p>
<p>Prompt 3: Setup will now reboot to complete the insall. [OK]</p>
<p>Wait, didn&#8217;t I just tell it to not reboot?. I wonder if the &quot;Reboot later&quot; path was ever tested.</p>

		<p>I totally agree &#8211; I had almost the same experience a while ago. &nbsp;There&#8217;s really no reason all N questions of a survey should be mandatory&#8230;if I had really wanted feedback to give I would have been tempted to just make up answers to all the other questions.</p>

		<p>Of course, part of the problem is that they felt the need to ask you 43 separate questions (I assume you&#8217;re not exaggerating). &nbsp;It&#8217;s common for people to say &quot;What is this, twenty questions?&quot; when people get too inquisitive; of course that&#8217;s a reference to the lame childhood game, but beyond that, it shows quite clearly that 20 is excessive to most people.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t expect good, well-considered answers to more than, say, 5 questions (maybe 10, if the product/service offering were immense in scope). &nbsp;Any more than that and people treat it like a quiz, just trying to get through it as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>The funny thing is, you just know that they&#8217;re using the survey to settle some internal corporate dispute. &nbsp;There&#8217;s no other reason to get so specific.</p>

		<p>Maybe the explanation is simple: they don&#8217;t really want to get feedback, because they were expecting mostly negative feedback! Probably their boss insisted on a feedback form, so they implemented one but made it as hard as possible to send feedback.</p>

		<p>Negative feedback is often more important than positive feedback. &nbsp;People are more likely to complain to others about your products/services than they are to shout your virtues. &nbsp;On the other hand, they&#8217;re more likely to tell you they liked it (more likely than telling anyone else). &nbsp;This doesn&#8217;t help you as much as if they complain to you instead of their friends.</p>

<p>Absolutely not. My prediction is that they&#8217;ll get so little information back that it&#8217;ll be statistically insignificant. If they made all fields optional at least users who only cared for a small part of their app (positively or negatively) would be able to tell them what worked and what didn&#8217;t and they&#8217;d get something to work with. E.g., which part of the survey was actually useful&#8230; :-)</p>
<p>As an aside: a survey with 43 questions for determining user satisfaction is obviously designed by someone so far removed from the user experience as to be totally useless anyway. I never bother with anything above 3 questions: &quot;Are you generally satisfied with your experience&quot;, &quot;What worked&quot;, &quot;What could be improved&quot;. In my company we don&#8217;t even have more than 10 questions on internal surveys after rollouts, it simply doesn&#8217;t make sense to ask for more details from a large user group when doing this kind of measurement.</p>

		<p>You know, on shopping websites, actually buying something is optional.</p>
<p>I suppose you also object to being forced to put your name, address, contact details, etc&#8230; in to actually buy something. After all, if buying something is optional, then all of the fields in the checkout form should also be optional. You don&#8217;t want none of that mandatory optional stuff there, neither.</p>
<p>OK, OK, I agree it&#8217;s stupid to have *those* 43 questions be mandatory in *that particular* feedback section. e.g. you may not have used half the site they&#8217;re asking for feedback on, or something. So that could probably be improved.</p>
<p>But to complain about *any* mandatory fields in optional parts of a website? I think you&#8217;re taking that one a little too far.[0]</p>
<p>Interestingly, I wonder if you&#8217;re required to fill in something in the freeform text boxes also. After all: &#8220;You must complete all the feedback sections before submitting your feedback.&#8221; What if you don&#8217;t have anything to add? Must you put &#8220;N/A&#8221; or similar to complete the form.</p>
<p>[0] Conversely, I hope this isn&#8217;t going too far and earning me a place in nitpickers&#8217; corner. I think it&#8217;s a legitimate counterpoint to your main idea. *crosses fingers*</p>
<div class=post>[<i>The difference is that when I order something, I get something out of it &#8211; namely, the produce I ordered. Whereas the feedback form is out of the goodness of my heart. I think the phrase for it is &#8220;Looking a gift horse in the mouth.&#8221; -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Yes, this is really annoying. I like to give feedback, but when I run into one of these I just opt out.</p>
<p>On a related note, &lt;red&gt;XXX&lt;/red&gt; makes a couple foolish mistakes with their annual survey. They have low-end, midrange, and high-end products. If you are on a support contract for one (1) of them they send the appropriate survey for that product. My company uses the high-end product, but also has the legacy low-end product on support. They send only the low-end product survey, which is twice wrong.</p>
<p>1) They should send both surveys. If I don&#8217;t feel like completing both, I might opt to answer the one about which I have something to say.</p>
<p>2) If they are only going to send one, wouldn&#8217;t one assume the high-end product is more important to me? I certainly pay more for it! Or does this signal that the low-end product is more important to them, and I am about to be abandoned by a company opting to move down-market?</p>

		<p>There sure are a lot of people who comment on this blog with no sense of irony whatsoever. &nbsp;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a whole lot of websites that don&#8217;t think nearly hard enough about their interface. &nbsp;And presumably don&#8217;t test with real people.</p>
<p>It is really dumb to lock up an input form with so much &quot;error&quot; checking that half the people won&#8217;t ever complete it. &nbsp;You&#8217;ll never even know why.</p>

		<p>Leaving aside the bad UI, what puzzles me is that they think they&#8217;ll get any kind of meaningful feedback out of those numerical ratings.</p>
<p>Say &quot;Selection&quot; gets a 2. &nbsp;So they need more products. &nbsp;But of what kind? &nbsp;Their tedious survey will discourage most people from telling them what kind.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#8217;s a lot of work to manually go through people&#8217;s specific responses and translate them into action items, even if it has the distinct advantage of actually being effective.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s pretty easy, on the other hand, to have a computer tabulate survey results, and then send out a mass company e-mail: &quot;Attention all employees: We&#8217;re running a 1.5 average rating on Friendliness. &nbsp;All employees are hereby reminded to be friendly. &nbsp;Employees refusing to comply will be summarily fired.&quot;</p>

		<p>Actually, what irks me most about some online shopping sites are those that ask for your billing information (not just address, but credit card info) first &#8211; before telling you the total with taxes, shipping, etc.</p>
<p>And they usually give no indication that you will see the total before you submit &#8211; as if they may show you what they really charged after charging you.</p>

		<p>Great post, Raymond! It seems like the moral of the story is that the only things that should be required to perform a task in a UI are things inherantly necessary to the task (ok, that principle can get violated with metaphoric interfaces, but at least it&#8217;s for the good cause of learnability). Purchasing something on the internet pretty much implies providing a form of payment, an address, etc. Providing feedback does not imply answering 43 questions. It would be like going to purchase a copy of Raymond&#8217;s book requiring you to also purchase 42 related titles!</p>

		<p>&quot;To that end, I think e-books will never work, people prefer handling a paper version.&quot;</p>
<p>No I don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>I prefer my Sony Clie TH-55 over dead tree anytime. Dead trees don&#8217;t have backlight.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve seen some tool that after installing offered me the choice between &#8216;reboot now&#8217; or &#8216;shut down without rebooting&#8217;. (!)</p>
<p>The latter allows you to continue. (!!)</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t remember which tool it was, because I&#8217;ve had to reinstall a lot of them after an unlucky system restore.</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>As for the mandatory questions, they should make the whole survey optional (as RC said), but making each individual question optional (as Morten said) would probably not be a good idea. Just a single critical field skipped could render the whole thing useless.</p>
<p>Advanced statistic techniques exist for salvaging surveys with missing questions, but those surveys are already biased by a nonrandom sample, too much missing data would remove any remaining credibility. Skip the wrong two questions and your survey is garbage bin fodder.</p>

		<p>The worst experience I had with a mandatory field was in an insurance company online quote web app. &nbsp;After carefully filling in pages of information it refused to accept the quote because I &#8216;hadn&#8217;t entered a valid email address&#8217;. &nbsp;I went back over the 5 pages of data entry; nowhere was there a field for entering my email address! &nbsp;I phoned the company and told them; they hurriedly glossed over the omission but took my details for the quote over the phone there and then, at least redeeming themselves a little.</p>

		<p>Yes, this is just common sense. &nbsp;It was optional for you to click the feedback button. &nbsp;After you have done that you can&#8217;t pick and choose what feedback you want to provide.</p>
