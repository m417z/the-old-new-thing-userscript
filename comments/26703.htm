		<p>I always wonder what happens to the Ig Nobel winners. What would happen if they were nominated? Would we get a situation where someone was a winner of both a Nobel and an Ig Nobel? Does the Nobel committee want to appear hip?</p>
<p>In any case, it&#8217;s good to know that it only takes a little persuading to get a Nobel nomination for a deserving person. I guess they mostly do the limited nomination thing to increase the drama for television, but for a non-spectator-driven event like the Nobels it&#8217;s more important to concentrate on the winner.</p>
<p>(Man, and this was the one place where the nitpickers would be totally off base! (Because mentioning Godwin&#8217;s Law nullifies an invoke.)</p>
<p>Of course, stupid people on the Internet are a dime a dozen these days.)</p>

		<p>Why bother going through the trouble of actually getting a nomination? &nbsp;Wouldn&#8217;t it be easier to just claim that you are a Nobel nominee? &nbsp;You have 50 years before anyone finds out otherwise.</p>

		<p>Humans ascribe significance to being associated with some official body or organization &#8211; especially if that body has a mythos of credibility.</p>
<p>This is true for being nominated for a Nobel prize. A patent does not mean that an invention actually works or is useful. Nor does publishing something make it authoritative.</p>
<p>Perhaps one positive outcome of the Internet may be that the sheer volume of &quot;published&quot; stuff is so great that it will dilute the mythos of authority given to the printed word. Or &#8230; maybe not given the volume of urban legends that make the rounds (I heard Bill Gates will give me $1 each time my comments are read).</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I&#8217;d guess this isn&#8217;t really true; nominating someone &#8216;unworthy&#8217; costs the nominator an iota of credibility. But maybe someone who&#8217;d nominate an idiot doesn&#8217;t have any credibility to start with.</p>
<p>(It&#8217;s the same thing as giving good references for a job, I suppose. If I give a good reference for a lousy candidate, it&#8217;s my reputation that suffers.)</p>

		<p>The Peace prize is the most watched one since it&#8217;s the only one effectively open to the public. Most people probably couldn&#8217;t even describe what most the winners of the physics or chemistry prizes did unless they&#8217;re familiar with the field in question. And many of the authors who win are equally obscure.</p>
<p>Anyway I&#8217;d like to plug one Peace prize laureate who actually deserved the award: Norman Borlaug, father of the green revolution.</p>

		<p>The Peace Prize is a strange beast. &nbsp;In the early days, it basically was given to anyone who worked towards disarmament, or concluded a peace treaty. &nbsp;That&#8217;s why Teddy Roosevelt got his Prize (which is still in the White House). &nbsp;Rather ironic since the result of the Portsmouth Treaty was to leave all three parties (Russia, Japan, and the US) resentful of each other.</p>
<p>Hitler likely got the nod for the Munich agreement of 1938, which was thought to be the end of Germany&#8217;s territorial ambitions in Europe. &nbsp;&quot;Peace in our time,&quot; after all. &nbsp;Chamberlain was nominated in 1939 too, for that very reason. &nbsp;But Hitler got one nomination and Chamberlain several. &nbsp;I wonder if Kim Jong-Il was nominated for the 2000 prize?</p>

		<p>Miles: Peace &#8211; funnily enough, the nomination was withdrawn in 1939 for some reason. On the other hand, merely nominating Adolf Hitler is nothing &#8211; the same prize was actually *awarded* to Yasser Arafat, which seems (to me at least) every bit as absurd.</p>
<p>In 1934, a Jewish author writing for the NY Times suggested awarding it to Hitler &#8211; clearly sarcastic, unlike the actual nomination mentioned. (Her rationale was that by driving out Jews and his political opponents, clearly he was ending conflict!)</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>His purpose in inventing dynamite was that it could be handled more safely than its predecessors. &nbsp;It would tend to blow up when you wanted it to instead of when you didn&#8217;t want it to.</p>
<p>Now did he really intend this to be a boon to farmers or to murderers&#8230;</p>

<p>Hmm, maybe that&#8217;s why later Nobel Peace Prizes moved towards results that left resentful parties at war with each other instead of just resentful.</p>

		<p>Stalin got nominated twice, once in 1945 by some Norwegian guy for &quot;attempts to end WWII&quot;, and once in 1948 by a Czech Professor, presumably eager to back a winner around the time of the communist coup.</p>

		<p>Re: the dagger;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a symbol, and like all symbols it&#8217;s subject to changes in interpretation. More importantly, we lose little meaning in having the dagger be equivalent to an asterisk when used for footnotes, especially seeing as it&#8217;s uncommon to see the dagger used anyway and the asterisk has several overloaded meanings.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d call it more elegant to use the dagger for footnotes, as it properly means &#8216;the second footnote&#8217;, than to use an asterisk, which may mean &#8216;see footnote&#8217;, &#8216;this word is not being used as its meaning implies&#8217; (e.g. &quot;absolutely free!*&quot;), &#8216;wildcard&#8217;, &#8216;password character&#8217;, &#8216;multiplication&#8217; or any number of other things depending on context. The dagger has one meaning. It means &#8216;footnote&#8217;.</p>
