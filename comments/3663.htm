		<p>Are we supposed to guess at your email ? Because it&#39;s nowhere on this page, and I don&#39;t particularly feel like scanning through the links on this page to try to find it if I ever want to contact you.</p>

		<p>Not that I have a need to contact Raymond, but I tried googling &quot;raymond chen email&quot; and got this amusing link: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.uspto.gov/about/bios/chen_bio.jsp">http://www.uspto.gov/&#8230;/chen_bio.jsp</a></p>

		<p>Alex Marshall:</p>
<p>Raymond&#39;s email address can be found in the &quot;Raymond Chen&quot; link in his TechNet column. It goes in the form of <a href="mailto:somebody@someoperatingsystem.somecompany.com">somebody@someoperatingsystem.somecompany.com</a>. I hope he doesn&#39;t get too much spam. And why was my previous comment deleted?</p>

		<p>If I were to speculate, I&#39;d say that finding Raymond&#39;s email address is supposed to be something like an intelligence test to discourage casual use. I did find an email address that either is or was his; I just don&#39;t know for sure if it&#39;s current.</p>

		<p>&quot;I hadn&#39;t heard of that site before, but I checked it out.&quot;</p>
<p>Not sure whether their question was an internal PR stunt for the new Flurb or for <a href="http://internalsite/newflurbs" rel="nofollow">http://internalsite/newflurbs</a> itself.</p>

		<p>&gt; Sometimes people can be so helpless</p>
<p>Or Clueless. I maintain a website, and received an email (not too long ago) sent through the contact form of the website (!) asking me if I had any RSS-feeds that they could use. So I replied: sure, have you seen the links on *every* page on the website (including the page that holds the contact form!) that say &quot;RSS&quot;?</p>
<p>The answer: Oh yes, I guess I should have looked at your website first.</p>

		<p>@stefan,</p>
<p>If the information is available on the web: sure. But I have several times been in arguments with vendors who won&#39;t disclose their documentation until we&#39;ve bought their products. I insist that reading the (complete) documentation is one of the essential ways to discover limitations and restrictions in the software, important to our decision to buy or forget. Referring me to &quot;the URL and login code you received when you bought the product&quot; is quite meaninless then.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is a different situation from the one you describe. but it shows that the user (read: potential customer) doesn&#39;t always have all the information you take for granted, or operates in a context like the one you take for granted.</p>

		<p>@jb,</p>
<p>Very true. But they also for some reason do not look for or search for the information that they want if it isn&#39;t immediately shoved in front of them. They also do not seem to understand that there may be other users with different needs/requirements that you also have to serve, so as provider you have to find a middle ground where basically nobody is competely satisfied. As an example: I once gave a customized training on a piece of software to 6 employees of a customer. When I received the evaluation forms on that training, 4 of them said they were not entirely satisfied, two of them were. On closer inspection 2 of the 4 said that there was too much practical exercise and too little theory, the other two said they received too much theory and too little practical exercise. The last two thought the split was just right. So from my perspective as the trainer I did it exactly right, even though 4 of 6 said that I didn&#39;t. But apart from training them separate there was no way I could have done better.</p>
<p>That&#39;s from a provider/vendor&#39;s point of view. From a customer&#39;s point of view, you are absolutely right, and if a vendor would ever say that to me I would take my business elsewhere (and I would let them know too!).</p>
<p>I guess it all boils down to: You can never do it right :-) (but you can find a middle ground usually)</p>
