		<p>Before you blanch at the 6k SEK price &#8212; if you walk into any bicycle store you won&#39;t find a standard bicycle for much less than 5k. &nbsp;Even a new bicycle at a discount store will probably set you back 2500 SEK. &nbsp;With than in mind, 6000 SEK for an electric bicycle doesn&#39;t sound so bad.</p>

		<p>@SimonRev That&#39;s insane pricing&#8230; a &quot;discount&quot; bicycle in the US is ~$100 / 600SEK&#8230; a mid-range bike might be ~$300 / 2000SEK</p>

		<p>Hopefully they&#39;ll include all of the required components when packaging this. &nbsp;I wouldn&#39;t want to buy one and end up with two frames or missing handlebars. &nbsp;Though I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re less likely to mistake various pieces for another with a bicycle than they would with, say, a bookcase.</p>

		<p>Yes, I have always thought that bicycles in Sweden were quite expensive. &nbsp;I was going to rent one for the three weeks I was just there &#8212; but I couldn&#39;t quite get over the cost. &nbsp;It was definitely cheaper to buy a cheap one in the US and throw it away (the airfare to ship it was too steep). &nbsp;I did nearly try and buy a used one for about 1200 SEK though. </p>
<p>But the cost is balanced by the fact that there are very nice bicycle paths everywhere and bicycles have the de facto right of way (it may not be legal, but they tend to cut in front of cars and nearly run down pedestrians with equal impunity).</p>

		<p>&gt; Price: Around 7200 SEK ($1100 USD) in Austria</p>
<p>Why Austria? I thought this bike was being sold in Sweden.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s not really a mile, it&#39;s 10km and called &quot;mil&quot; in Swedish , lacking a better translation it becomes a mile</p>

		<p>@Anon: Things are expensive before they went mass production. Remember this is testing product only, they can&#39;t order large quantity of parts at once because they might want to switch parts to make it strike better balance. The production cost is going to be high.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m shocked that in Sweden they charge so much for bicylces when your bicycles don&#39;t even have any brakes. &nbsp;I learnt this the hard way! ;) I will be buying a bike in Britain and shipping it over :P</p>

		<p>In ancient times, a swedish mil was how far you could travel in a day. After metrication it became 10 km, 10000 meter.</p>

		<p>Every bicycle I have used in Sweden has had brakes. (and I have borrowed about a dozen or so over the past years) &nbsp;Now most of them are the kind like BMX bikes here have where you pedal backwards to lock the rear wheel &#8212; it takes a while to get used to that. &nbsp;Some also have a hand brake on the front wheel.</p>

		<p>The whole &quot;mil&quot; thing confused me when I moved to SE.</p>
<p>People were very kindly speaking English(*) to me, but kept saying &quot;mil&quot; as &quot;mile&quot;. So, someone said &quot;It have a long 6 mile commute&quot;, my initial thought was that &quot;Gosh, they are so spoiled by excellent bus service, that just a few minutes car drive is a disaster&quot;. After a while I worked out what was going on&#8230;</p>
<p>(*) And they still are. The downside of programming software from a home office is that I rarely have to speaking SV. I am at a point where I can have shop- or restaurant-conversations and am not always replied to in English, but definitely not a real chat! Shame on me.</p>
