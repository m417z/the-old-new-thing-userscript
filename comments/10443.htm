		<p>I&#39;ve been in this situation. The user asks my application A to do something. My application A calls on third-party application B to do processing (via COM). When application B finishes processing, the users want to see the results in application A. But application B insists on taking the focus while it processes, and does not expose any way to ask for the focus back. The vendor of application B is a large, unhelpful, organisation (not Microsoft, if it matters) and won&#39;t work with me because I only have a few dozen users. Focus-stealing starts to sound good.</p>

		<p>If there is never a good reason for stealing focus, why does Windows allow it at all? Even Visual Studio does it when it hits a breakpoint.</p>
<p>Seriously &#8211; this drives everyone nuts and needs to be fixed. Can we start a petition or something? Who or what would Microsoft listen to on a subject like this?</p>

		<p>Wow a long chain of walls and ladders.</p>
<p>@MarkJ: you can use the anti-focus stealing against them as well by arranging for your COM interop to be fired from a process that does not have the focus: Start new process, create window, give focus back to your main process, then trigger COM interop to big vendor&#39;s process. If they steal focus anyway, learn their technique and use the exact same one to steal back, that way your technique works until Microsoft gets around to breaking their technique and the transition is seamless.</p>

		<p>Breakpoints can steal focus because the foreground process was being debugged (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms632668(VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/ms632668(VS.85).aspx</a>). &nbsp;That&#39;s like if the firetruck stops in the handicapped parking space because it&#39;s close to the fire hydrant.</p>

		<p>@Ens: You&#39;re making the assumption that the foreground process was being debugged. &nbsp;With VS2008 it&#39;s not uncommon for me to start debugging a long running non-interactive task and then switch over to a different program. &nbsp;It&#39;s always annoying to be writing an email when Visual Studio suddenly grabs focus and I&#39;m typing into my break point location. &nbsp;I understand why it does it and I can&#39;t think of any better way to ensure I notice something I really want to notice but it doesn&#39;t make it any less annoying.</p>

		<p>Some seem to be missing a point Raymond often makes, which is that once you provide something like this it becomes pointless and easy to abuse. You could end up with more than one app on your desktop, each convinced that it is so special it must be on top, and the result of that is (potentially) constant focus stealing as the focus ping-pongs between each app leaving the user helpless, and probably blaming Microsoft too.</p>

		<p>This sort of thing happens to me every day:</p>
<ol>
<li>I&#39;m in Outlook and come across a Word document as an attachment. I want to continue working with my emails but also want to open the document, preferably in the background, so I launch the attachment.</li>
<li>
<p>Nothing happens immediately (my computer is pretty slow) so I click on another email to read.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>After a couple of seconds, the Word splash screen comes up and obscures my view.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I click in Outlook to continue reading my email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Word opens its window in the foreground but has not loaded the document yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I click in Outlook to continue reading my email.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Word finishes loading the document and brings its window to the foreground.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I click in Outlook to continue reading my email.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Does this qualify as focus stealing, or is Windows just doing what I asked it to do (open a Word document)?</p>
<p>Am I justified in wishing that Windows could handle this situation better or am I expecting the computer to read my mind?</p>

		<p>@AK: I wish I could write LOL but that&#39;s not funny anymore. I know your situation all too well.</p>
<p>Browsers has solved this quite neat though, with tabs. Ctrl-click/middle click defaults to open a tab in the background and I can happily go on reading my current webpage until I&#39;m ready to deal with the new now completely loaded page. I wish my interaction with Windows and all my applications could work in a similar way (maybe we just need some really fast computers with SSDs).</p>

		<p>Programs in a suit can &quot;steal&quot; focus from each other if they implemented a infrastructure for that.</p>

		<p>I was about to point to Visual Studio 2010 for annoying focus stealing, but it seems other people were faster. Stealing focus during compilation when an error occurs, or when compilation finishes. Both highly irritating.</p>

		<p>@office focus: Such a feature only needs the ability to &quot;pass&quot; focus, not the ability to &quot;steal&quot; focus. &nbsp;That is, whatever window has focus has the right to give it to another window. &nbsp;Of course, some programmer is bound to get a bonus by writing a library that can be used to cause whatever program has focus to pass it to another program.</p>

		<p>@office focus: In this case, I suspect it is simpler than that. Outlook launched Word (in show the attachment). The remarks on AllowSetForegroundWindow() indicate that processes that were started by the current foreground process are permitted to set the foreground window (stealing focus).</p>
<p>Word probably doesn&#39;t bother to check if it is currently in the foreground. Likely, it just attempts to set the foreground and assumes Windows will block it when appropriate.</p>

		<p>@poday Absolutely! Start debug, wait, wait some more, get bored, browse reddit, *focus steal*, type LOL in the code by accident, *face palm*</p>
<p>@PhilW Fair point, but I&#39;ve been waiting for Raymond to bring this issue up again so I could get his opinion.</p>
<p>Fundamentally: Why should Windows allow focus stealing at all when it already provides FlashWindow and NotifyIcon?</p>

		<p>The Windows shell has, since XP, a nice way of notifying the user without interrupting him. W7 is even better at allowing the app to send urgent notifications without interrupting. It is just not valid to interrupt, especially if that interruption includes a response popup.</p>

		<p>@poday</p>
<p>Hmm, okay. &nbsp;My workflow involves the Visual Studio remote debugger (VS2010) and I don&#39;t really recall encountering this, so I just assumed you were doing local debugging. &nbsp;It&#39;s possible that it happens even in this scenario but I don&#39;t generally notice it.</p>

<p>You also have to pay money to every suit of software, for not letting them implement a infrastructure for giving away focus to other apps in their suit.</p>
<p>For example, VS &amp; Office could agree on develop a focus sharing library, whatever windows os trying to is prevent.</p>
