		<p>I use SysInternals ProcessMonitor utility to diagnose this sort of problem at least once a month. &nbsp; &nbsp; The last time it was the Oracle libraries needed a version of the MS C runtime that wasn&#39;t installed (in the path). &nbsp; </p>

		<p>Somewhat annoying is that when loader shows the &quot;missing file&quot; dialog during the initial loading of the application it uses internal knowledge that is simply not available when calling LoadLibrary.</p>
<p>If the start of the application fails because a DLL is missing that&#39;s 4 dependencies away from the application image, it still tells you exactly what file is missing. But if you call LoadLibrary and a DLL is missing that&#39;s 3 dependencies away from the the DLL you are trying to load, all you get is an error code telling you it couldn&#39;t load the DLL, not why. There probably should be a version of LoadLibrary that returns a more detailed description of the nature of the error than just an error code.</p>

		<p>Having just read the headline, my psychic debugging powers said the problem was that the program was a .Net executable compiled with AnyCPU that tries to load a 32-bit DLL. The systems where it fails would be 64-bit systems.</p>
<p>Are there any other likely scenarios that cause these symptoms?</p>

		<p>I found it&#39;s easier to just run depwalk (the dependency walker) on the EXE to check all dependency at once. Of course it doesn&#39;t work for delay loaded libraries but it usually does do the work. And the best thing is it doesn&#39;t require much explanation on how it works, so a decent tool to ask junior collegues to carry when they&#39;re sent to site for on-site works.</p>

		<p>Joker_vD: As Raymond said, if your program is dynamically linked against a version of the CRT that isn&#39;t installed, you get an error dialog and your program won&#39;t even start.</p>
<p>In this case the program dynamically loaded a DLL that was linked against a version of the CRT that wasn&#39;t installed. The program started but got an error when it tried to load that DLL.</p>

		<p>@cheong00: I don&#39;t know about depwalk but depends.exe found a DLL loading issue for me quite recently. (A dependent DLL needed to be relinked when two DLLs it depended on were merged but I had skipped the relevant dependency checking.)</p>

		<p>@cheong00, Dependency Walker has a &quot;profiling&quot; feature that runs an executable and catches runtime library loading errors, so it&#39;s really the best tool.</p>

		<p>@Thornsten: I fully agree.</p>
<p>A shame the loader doesn&#39;t maintain/expose a per-thread variable that could be used for such diagnostics, with a function such as GetLastModuleNotFound(LPTSTR, int)&#8230;</p>

		<p>Is it a legacy issue of the LoadLibrary function of sorts? It cannot use exceptions or something? If it can then what is preventing it from throwing an exception with name of the missing file specified in it all they way up to the process trying to load a library?</p>

		<p>Presumably when Win32 came about with structured exception handling, they could have made a new version of LoadLibrary (LoadLibraryEx?) that throws exceptions instead of returning errors. Of course, if you&#39;re just going to introduce a new API, you can introduce a function called GetLoadLibraryLastError and then not even have to create a new contract.</p>

		<p>Failure to load a library (which is presumably required to run an application) does seem a bit catastrophic to me as a developer of the application. :) As for Win16, well, if I understand it right, it is old and not used extensively nowadays at all. Keeping backward compatibility has to have its limits so that (inefficient) legacy code does not impact modern development, I think. In any case, recently I tried to run some old 16-bit application on Windows 7 and it didn&#39;t start. So backward compatibility is already somewhat broken for old applications.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>I think you&#39;re missing the big picture. It&#39;s a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/09/02/224672.aspx">chain of compatibility</a>. Compatibility with Win16 is important to Windows NT 3.1. Compatibility with Windows NT 3.1 is important to Windows NT 4.0. Compatibility with Windows NT 4.0 is important to Windows 2000. And so on to the present day. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>&gt; &nbsp;And so on to the present day.</p>
<p>I understand. But this chain has to break at some points in time I believe. Otherwise having to adhere to this paradigm will hold new development back and make it less efficient. The example we just saw &#8211; a function not throwing exception when it&#39;s appropriate to do so because there were no exceptions mechanism the day the function has been written. What I am saying is sometimes it&#39;s worth abandoning something old in favor of letting something new evolve faster. But that&#39;s just my particular developer&#39;s view on it, I am far away from business prospective of all this stuff. :)</p>

<p>Have you ever used streams from the STL of C++? I just love that when input/output on a stream fails, the stream becomes all sad and emotional and refuses to do anything unless you cheer it up with clear(). And of course, you technically can enable exceptions on streams — but that breaks such a huge amount of third-party library code that you definitely don&#39;t want to do it.</p>
<p>And the absense of any way to know what exactly went wrong whith that DLL is indeed quite stupid. Which reminds me of a related gotcha: if you start a console program with CREATE_NO_WINDOW, the &quot;The program can&#39;t start because XYZ is missing from your computer&quot; dialog won&#39;t appear. Amazing, isn&#39;t it?</p>

		<p>Escaper: If a DLL is required to run an application, why would you call LoadLibrary on it? Your DLL would be implicitly linked and your app wouldn&#39;t start without it. You use LoadLibrary to enable optional functionality, whether a plug-in, a COM object, or perhaps to avoid paying for a feature until you know the user wants it.</p>
<p>I&#39;d hate to be unable to use some app just because a plug-in I don&#39;t even intend to use fails to load when the app initializes.</p>

		<p>Gabe, ok, we could have two versions of the LoadLibrary following the well-known pattern: LoadLibrary throws an exception, while TryLoadLibrary returns a value. But that is not the point. The point is LoadLibrary could return name of the missing file one way or another. That would save a lot of time for a lot of people who are trying to find out what particular file is missing.</p>
