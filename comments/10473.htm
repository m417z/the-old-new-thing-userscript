		<p>•Unplanned Unplanned Outage &#8211; something unexpected happended and the server went down</p>
<p>•Planned Unplanned Outage &#8211; management said we need to give a months notice for a planned outage but we dont want to wait that long so we will give a weeks notice and call it unplanned, but it really is planned so well call it planned unplanned.</p>
<p>•Immediate Deployment Timeframe. This one even has its own TLA: IDT &#8211; Management said we can only deploy at certain times but for whatever reason we need to deploy sooner then that, but it doesn&#39;t have to be right this second.</p>

		<p>&quot;what is faster than immediate?&quot;</p>
<p>That would have to be the &quot;Immediate Deployment 1/0 Timeframe&quot;. &nbsp;And it&#39;s corresponding FLA.</p>

		<p>&quot;There must be some other TLA that means now, but what is faster than immediate?&quot;</p>
<p>I would not put it past Microsoft (or any other large, complex corporate entity) to have a four- or five-letter acronym that means &quot;now&quot;.</p>

		<p>the airline code for &#39;now&#39; &nbsp;is &#39;at this time&#39; (&quot;at this time please turn off all electronics&quot;) so the TLA for it should be ATT</p>
<p>The problem is that the airline code for &#39;then&#39; is &#39;at that time&#39; (&quot;at that time use of electronic equipment will be permitted&quot;). The TLA for that is also ATT</p>
<p>maybe ATI and ATA as in At ThIs time and At ThAt time</p>

		<p>No, that&#39;s exactly what it means (consistent with the definition in OED from 1837). I&#39;m guessing Raymond&#39;s wish is that the &quot;perfectly good word&quot; &quot;remedy&quot; be used instead.</p>

		<p>Well, according to the rules of Magic the Gathering that were current when I was in grade 4, &quot;interrupt&quot; is faster than &quot;instant&quot;, and &quot;instant&quot; seems to match &quot;immediate&quot;. &nbsp;Therefore, Interrupt Deployment Timeframe. &nbsp;As a bonus, it keeps the same TLA, so nobody has to be bothered with the difference between now and almost now.</p>

		<p>&quot;Faster than immediate&quot; deployments IME usually are a cause of many unplanned unplanned outages, sadly enough&#8230;. &nbsp;As well, I usually am thinking of garbage dumps as the target of a remediation. &nbsp;It&#39;s an odd mental picture when servers are put in that frame.</p>

		<p>I suppose I&#39;ll be the one to ask the obvious: Why isn&#39;t it just &quot;planned/unplanned outage&quot;. The extra &quot;unplanned&quot; seems unnecessary, because it can be removed and still be logically consistent. (There are no, say, planned planned outages, or unplanned planned outages).</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Why isn&#39;t it just &quot;planned/unplanned outage&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<p>That allows only two possibilities; there are three.</p>
<p>There are planned outages &#8211; for example, to install security updates on the servers.</p>
<p>Then there are the two kinds of unplanned outages that Raymond outlines.</p>
<p>Users don&#39;t care whether an unplanned outage is planned unplanned, or unplanned unplanned. &nbsp;In fact, they usually don&#39;t even care whether an outage is planned or unplanned! &nbsp;Users just don&#39;t want outages to happen at all; and when they do happen, users want them over as soon as possible.</p>

		<p>&quot;Intentional unplanned outage&quot; would have been clearer. You can even confuse it with &quot;intentionally unplanned outage&quot;, but that&#39;s OK because it&#39;s practically the same thing &#8212; it&#39;s an outage you could have planned, but chose not to. An &quot;unintentional unplanned outage&quot; is a crash, and an &quot;unintentionally unplanned outage&quot; is when the outage was planned, really, but you forgot to update the calendar. Finally, an &quot;unintentionally planned outage&quot; is when you tried to just hit the power switch, but someone intercepted you and insisted you plan for it.</p>
<p>Of course, it&#39;s trivial to convert intentional unplanned outages to planned ones &#8212; just schedule them 20 seconds ahead of right now. Not my fault your RSS feed is slow today. If people are already used to IDT, you can call this &quot;micro-IDT&quot;. Sapir and Whorf were really on to something with this &quot;language shapes thought&quot; thing &#8212; by synergistically leveraging idioms, we can enhance the richness of our user&#39;s experiences. I got a lot of learns out of this day.</p>

		<p>If &quot;immediate&quot; means &quot;as soon as possible&quot;, then faster than that might be &quot;premature&quot;. But as far as I know nobody ever makes an announcement that something will be done too early, it&#39;s only applicable to later analysis of what went wrong.</p>

		<p>I can see the difference, but the phrasing is confusing.</p>
<p>If I was patching the SQL Server Cluster, and I took each server down in rotation and brought it back up, I could patch those servers with no downtime.</p>
<p>If, while doing so, I made a mistake or ran into a problem that resulted in downtime- I planned the change, but did not plan the downtime. Planned Unplanned Outage.</p>
<p>It might be useful as a method of tracking the causes of outages, I guess. We categorized those as &quot;Induced&quot;, and the remediation was generally Training or Process Improvement.</p>
<p>This segues into Remediation. Used to mean &quot;Correcting an existing problem&quot;, that&#39;s fine. Our company tends to use it for any change. Requirements change on the project, how do you remediate your deliverable to comply with the new requirements. Or am I too caught up in the jargon that I&#39;m missing the point?</p>
