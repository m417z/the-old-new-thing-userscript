		<p>shouldn&#39;t the themed controls take advantage of (use) the ODS_HOTLIGHT flag so people don&#39;t have to mess with trackmouseevent manually? Or does this break some other great piece of software in your company? :)</p>

		<p>@Random832: In non-themed menus, MF_DISABLED will display the menu item text in the normal text style/color but the item cannot be clicked while MF_GRAYED will also draw the text in disabled style/color. This only applies to the older menu APIs, the newer APIs that use the MENUITEMINFO struct just have #define MFS_DISABLED MFS_GRAYED</p>

		<p>I notice that the Status control &#39;Oops&#39; is represented by a blank cell and talk about uninitialised garbage, but the Static control &#39;Oops&#39; cell is filled in and coloured. This leads me to guess that the static Oops is deterministic and that people have worked around it in code, hence the fact that it cannot be changed. And now if you&#39;ll excuse me, I have to put my tinfoil hat back on.</p>

		<p>@Gabe: The only thing that came immediately to mind was popup menus, where you might want a &quot;title&quot;, but even then the greyed-out version would probably be preferable. It&#39;s an odd use case, indeed. Fortunately for us, the greyed state implies disabled; imagine the fun if greyed and disabled were orthogonal!</p>

		<p>&quot;I can pretty much guarantee that there is some application which doesn&#39;t draw correctly if the ODS_DISABLED flag is not set.&quot;</p>
<p>Equally, you can surely pretty much guarantee that there is some application which doesn&#39;t draw correctly because they followed the original spec. Is it just policy that bugs in released code should never be fixed &quot;for compatibility&quot;, or has someone actually researched which apps are affected and decided that one group is more deserving than the other?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>The control shows up disabled, and they obviously knew it because it <span style="text-decoration:underline;">always</span> shows up disabled, and since they shipped it that way, then it stands to reason that showing up disabled is what they intended. (Because if it isn&#39;t, they would have fixed it.) We have done similar things in the past, &quot;fixing&quot; a bug, and getting bug reports from customers saying, &quot;The <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Name</span> label used to be gray, and now it&#39;s black.&quot; Customers don&#39;t know what the intent of the app was. They know what they see. They see gray. If it is no longer gray, then it&#39;s a bug. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Expanding on Ken&#39;s point, I&#39;d have thought that the ODS_DISABLED issue would be &quot;better&quot; addressed by fixing the bug for cleanliness and the 99% case, and creating shims for the 1% of apps which rely on the &quot;incorrect&quot; behaviour.</p>

		<p>Quote: &quot;You can always detect a control by checking the window handle&quot;. No you can&#39;t. As with the increase of cross-platform applications windowless controls are becoming more and more the norm. The method of checking and getting information of a control through its handle is so 2009.

		<p>Raymond, FYI &#8211; The table doesn&#39;t fit (and doesn&#39;t wrap) when viewed at normal (i.e. 100%) zoom on a 1280-pixel-wide monitor. The last column visible is for the Tab control. Not sure if you can use a smaller font for wide tables in future articles.</p>

		<p>@Danny &#8212; true more and more frameworks don&#39;t use actual HWNDs for their controls (for various good reasons most of them revolving around child window translucency which wasn&#39;t properly possible until Windows 8).</p>
<p>However controls in those frameworks are probably not receiving custom/owner draw messages with DRAWITEMSTRUCTs either.</p>

		<p>&gt; there is some application which doesn&#39;t draw correctly because they followed the original spec</p>
<p>But that application will *never* have worked correctly. &nbsp;If they haven&#39;t noticed that bug yet, then they clearly think it&#39;s clearly not worth fixing.</p>

		<p>If it was the customer&#39;s intention to *always* display as disabled, they wouldn&#39;t check the flag at all. I find it hard to contrive a case where an app bothers to check the flag and yet depends on that flag being wrong.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I&#39;ve certainly released code which was then broken by a bug in a later version of Windows which wasn&#39;t fixed because (we were told) someone might be depending on the broken behaviour. You (MS) are probably on a hiding to nothing either way, but I&#39;m curious to know how much information the decision makers collect on &quot;who&#39;s broken now, and who would be broken by a fix?&quot;. That would seem to be a very hard question to answer, which makes me wonder if in fact there is (by default) a tendency to leave bugs unfixed.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>See previous example. The app checks the flag and draws as if disabled. It turns out that they wanted gray text, so this works out great for them. If the bug is fixed, then they will not draw as if disabled any more, and people would report it as a bug. This actually happens. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>But who will test each and every program released years ago, if some compatibility shim would fit?</p>
<p>In the first place, some developer (not the user who suffers from the change in behavior) needs to be tasked/paid on re-testing older software. And second, this developer need to know about all existing compatibility shims *and* the special detail each of them is supposed to fix. Third, this shim must be deployed to all the unknown users of the now-buggy software (I believe it must somehow registered in a shim database at the local PC?).</p>
<p>I don&#39;t see how shims can be useful for most of the Windows programs in use.</p>

		<p>@Tim: Are you sure that applies to their own DLL&#39;s bug-compatibility? All they&#39;d need to apply the &quot;COMCTL32: use bug-compatible owner-drawn static behavior&quot; shim would be the identity of softwares that require it (name/hash of the executable) and this should be obtainable with each support ticket for &quot;my text is no longer displaying correctly&quot;&#8230;</p>
