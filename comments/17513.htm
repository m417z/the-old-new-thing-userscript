		<p>Poor thing. &nbsp;If Ish had beaten Cole in the City Council contest, she undoubtedly would have found a way to divert hundreds of thousands of Duvall&#8217;s dollars into her own pockets. &nbsp;Instead she was reduced to stealing less than ten grand a year from soft targets like her boss and McDonaldâ€™s.</p>
<p>Like the saying goes: There are no small crimes, just small criminals.</p>
<p>-Wang-Lo.</p>

<p>There is a link to view the online records. &nbsp;Looks like they charge $.15 a page.</p>

		<p>It wouldn&#8217;t even occur to me to sue a restaurant over hurting my teeth biting into a bone that was accidentally left in meat. Meat contains bones, it&#8217;s fact of life.</p>

		<p>Vegetables, when harvested mechanically, can contain rocks or bits of wood.</p>
<p>Improperly maintained processing equipment (such as a meat grinder or robotic packager) can shear off bits of metal or plastic into the food.</p>
<p>Regular inspections are supposed to stop this sort of thing, but what profit-oriented middle-manager wants to risk his job recalling a million hamburger patties because one of them might contain a screw?</p>
