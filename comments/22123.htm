		<p>It is/was a neat show, but the action level dropped severely and the interpersonal drama level rose too much. They then jumped the shark by adding &quot;the young guard&quot; kids.</p>

		<p>I bet Jamie and Adam have some interesting stories.</p>
<p>The kids are to pull in the young demographic. I think they enhance the show (especially Kari Byron).</p>

		<p>Sure, they jumped the shark by adding the build team &#8212; who have been there for the last 90 of 115 episodes. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sorry forgot my &lt;sarcasm&gt; tag&#8230;</p>

		<p>Anyone know if their traveling show is any good? &nbsp;Reviews, etc? &nbsp;$45 is a lot&#8230;</p>

		<p>I went to the show in Columbus, OH a couple of years back. It was worth the money, they had a lot of inside information about the show and they ran a few &#8220;uncensored&#8221; Mythbusters clips. If you&#8217;re a big fan of the show then its great.</p>
<p>The down-side was the Q&amp;A part where for every good audience question you got three losers trying to ask Jamie and Adam for a job (&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any skills, but I&#8217;ll do anything to work on the show..&#8221;). Although it was funny watching Jamie and Adam nicely refuse.</p>

		<p>Maybe the Portland copy wasn&#8217;t a mistake. &nbsp;Maybe it&#8217;s a way to weasel out if the show doesn&#8217;t live up to expectations: &quot;We said it was a hilarious evening, nothing about afternoons&quot;.</p>

		<p>Cool. &nbsp;There was an internet rumor that they weren&#8217;t on speaking terms and Adam was going to leave Mythbusters for Smash Lab. &nbsp;After I saw this I went back to wikipedia, and sure enough all references to the feud are gone.</p>

		<p>They may have jumped the shark literally, but definitely not figurativly.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the difference between geeks and the rest of TV land. We want to see things work or blow up; others want sexual tension.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I gave up watching Monster Garage. Great ideas, not enough technicalities.</p>

		<p>I guess I&#8217;d rather have this as a web cast or DVD if we wouldn&#8217;t get to see them blow anything up.</p>

		<p>The build team would probably be a lot more interesting if they weren&#8217;t given boring myths to work with. I guess it&#8217;s nice that they tackle the less spectacular urban legends, but still.</p>
<p>I do appreciate that they&#8217;ve worked in more science content into the show, with a little warning label notifying you that there is science content.</p>

		<p>What annoys me about the TV show is that they quite often spend a whole episode busting a myth that anyone with high-school physics, a calculator and a piece of paper can &#8216;bust&#8217; or confirm in 2 minutes. Sometimes they myths are so obvious they don&#8217;t need calculation at all.</p>
<p>The more obscure myths are cool though.</p>

		<p>Aaargh: If people was that smart it wouldn&#8217;t have been a myth in the first place and Mythbusters are probably smart enough to know a myth is gibberish. But that the whole point of the show: some people refuse to believe anything unless you prove itshow it (i know some of those my self), so its really necessary (though I fear the most stupid refuse to believe even after Mythbusters).</p>

		<p>&gt; They then jumped the shark by adding &quot;the young guard&quot; kids.</p>
<p>&quot;The Kids?&quot; Kari&#8217;s 33 and Tory and Grant are 37. In fact (according to Wikipedia RMV*) Adam is only 3 years older than Tory. Jamie at 51, is 11 years older than Adam.</p>
<p>Did you notice the episodes where Adam talked *really* stupendously fast. Quite reminiscent of someone on some sort of powdered substance. He seems to have reverted to his usual self the last season or two.</p>
<p>* Reality May Vary</p>
