		<p>So why doesn&#8217;t FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH cause a FlushFileBuffers() on every write?</p>
<p>FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH is not documented as &#8220;setting the FUA flag on write operations&#8221;, it is documented as &#8220;Write operations will not go through any intermediate cache, they will go directly to disk.&#8221;[0] If calling FlushFileBuffers() is what it takes to do that, why does FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH not do it?</p>
<p>Yes, yes, the linked article points out that FlushFileBuffers() kills your performance, but that&#8217;s what ignoring/flushing caches does, and anyone who asks for FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH has explicitly requested that tradeoff be made.</p>
<p>Or should the documentation for FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH be updated to mention that it may be a no-op?</p>

		<p>Stand back a little and you will find the answer.</p>
<p>First, there is the problem that programs would suddenly be slower. As Raymond often mentioned, making a new OS version that is perceptibly worse would prevent its adoption. If Windows 8 had made write-through more strict, then existing programs (that may even have used it inadvertently) would be worse.</p>
<p>Second, there is the problem of backward compatibility. If you started to write code using write-through instead of flush-buffers under Windows 8, users of older OS would not get the correct behaviour because these previosu OS would not enforce it on the driver level.</p>

		<p>But the only reason that the program was running &#8220;faster&#8221; before is because it was buggy and incorrect! It wasn&#8217;t actually doing a thing it was meant to be doing.</p>
<p>And yes, if you fix a bug in a new version of your OS, older versions of your OS are not magically fixed also. So? Are you claiming that this is a good reason not to fix bugs in new versions of your OS?</p>
<p>OTOH, if you&#8217;re happy to trade speed for I/O correctness, Windows could make most programs run much quicker (if less correctly) by simply terminating them when they perform their first I/O operation. Tada!</p>

		<p>Presumably this flag is still honored by SCSI drives, so it does have <i>some</i> utility, albeit not consistently.  Microsoft could make the flag trigger FlushFileBuffers in a future version of Windows 10 (they&#8217;ve done stuff like that before, though it&#8217;s rare), but presumably there isn&#8217;t much impetus to do so, especially if no customers have come demanding that the FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH behave as documented.</p>

		<p>SCSI drives had this broken long before IDE did.  I remember writing drivers for SCSI drives in the late 80s/early 90s and had to include a whole table of workarounds for various bugs in this mechanism.  The worst one that I remember was the Iomega devices, which threw away the data write if you set the&#8230; whatever the equivalent of FUA was at the time.  Took us a long time to figure that one out (because there were so many other bugs and error conditions that could have caused that or a similar-looking problem).  Reported it to Iomega, their response was &#8220;well no-one uses that flag anyway&#8221;.  Pretty much said it all for Iomega&#8217;s engineering approach as a whole.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Write operations will not go through any intermediate cache, they will go directly to disk.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, they do go directly to the disk. But the disk keeps them in its own buffers. It&#8217;s quite possible that even with the flushing on, the writes still go through the buffers, but simply do not linger there. The only thing you know for sure is that Windows isn&#8217;t storing the info in an intermediate cache itself.</p>

		<p>I think &#8220;go directly to disk&#8221; in this context means &#8220;go onto the magnetic platters&#8221; (or into SSD flash memory).  </p>
<p>The disk is the whole drive and all of its electronics, and the disk is also the round thing or the set of stacked round things (the discs) so the terminology is ambiguous.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m glad that somebody finally did in that hydra.</p>
<p>I was pondering the sequence of buy disk, run published test to detect that flush doesn&#8217;t work, than return disk as defective, running in a loop until the manufacture got the point.</p>

		<p>Semi-related: Raymond, is TxF actually going away anytime soon, or are they just saying that?</p>
<p><a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh802690(v=vs.85)" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh802690(v=vs.85)</a>.aspx</p>
<p>I&#8217;m asking mostly because, on non-TxF systems, you have to do much more complicated things to get TxF-like semantics, e.g. see <a href="https://www.sqlite.org/atomiccommit.html#_multi_file_commit" rel="nofollow">https://www.sqlite.org/atomiccommit.html#_multi_file_commit</a>, and I want to know whether this is going to become true of Windows as well.</p>
