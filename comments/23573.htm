		<p>If something like &quot;the object you are attempting to [perform actions upon] defines what it can do&quot; is not obvious to a programmer, then they&#8217;re in the wrong business.</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t understanding object core to actual non-trivial programming?</p>

		<p>And yet how many people dig into the internals of Windows in order to be able to do something? While I think every programmer would understand it when asked, not everyone keeps it in mind.</p>

		<p>The answer does seem obvious.</p>
<p>However, reality is never so simple.</p>
<p>On far too many occasions I hear about bugs in libraries that I designed. After investigating, it turns out that other teams (who have access to the source code) have altered my libraries in the following ways: 1) changed private methods to be public 2) added new methods to existing interfaces, or 3) added new methods exposing internal structures.</p>
<p>When asked why they do this, I am told various reasons such as that they needed access to internal structures or doing it any other way would take too long etc.</p>
<p>And when I revert my libraries, existing code ceases to compile, so I am tasked to &quot;fix&quot; that too as if it is my fault&#8230;</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  without the permission of the creator of a control and the control itself, you can&#8217;t do anything to it.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think that&#8217;s fundamentally wrong. But, it will be equally wrong to expect it to work with a new version.</p>
<p>Do I need any permission from the creator to remove ads from any site while browsing? If the page does not render nice after the ad picture removed, that will be my problem too. I can&#8217;t expect the creator to fix it now, or ever.</p>
<p>I won&#8217;t generally mess with someone else&#8217;s controls, but I can do it if I want, and I won&#8217;t need a permission, no. BUT, at the same time, I won&#8217;t expect any support for my little hack from the creator in the future.</p>
<p>And if the tables were turned, I won&#8217;t feel obliged to support any hack to my code. If somebody files a bug, I&#8217;d just say that this is how things work, this is not a bug, rewrite your code, get a life.</p>
<p>And this is so obvious to me&#8230;</p>
<p>I may suspect that some internal info about an object is not being supplied to me (or offered for any price), but to others, which creates an unfair situation. Certain functionality may not be possible without messing with internals of someone else&#8217;s object. This may be a valid reason to do it. In that case, you may expect the internals will change even just to make your application incompatible (if your assumption was wrong, of course).</p>
<p>I remember Microsoft&#8217;s defense about DR-DOS not being compatible with MS-DOS for running Windows after checking internal structures. You can&#8217;t be 100% compatible unless you are identical.</p>
<p>You should try to respect creator&#8217;s intentions, in order to be able to expect future compatibility.</p>

		<p>Most of the time, I would agree that you don&#8217;t want to mess with program internals. &nbsp;However, sometimes the API is poorly designed, or there is a very useful feature that is missed in the API&#8217;s design.</p>
<p>Certain functions in ntdll.dll come to mind. &nbsp;They can do a lot of things Win32 can&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>Despite all this, I find AutoIt is a fun tool for manipulating other Windows programs. &nbsp;I made a download monitor that tracked several programs and reported files and file progress and download speed by reading control text from different windows. &nbsp;Granted it was easy to break (reordering listview columns would be enough) but it was also pretty easy to fix given AutoIt&#8217;s scripting language syntax.</p>
<p>Sadly, AutoIt doesn&#8217;t work with some programs, based on exactly the points made in the article. &nbsp;For example, in XPSP2, the taskbar refuses to be resized by AutoIt to, for example, stretch across multiple monitors. &nbsp;I&#8217;m guessing it blocks the resize in WM_WINDOWPOSCHANGING or whatever.</p>

		<p>The degree to which one Windows application is allowed to mess with another has always surprised me. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve noticed this ability has been pared back somewhat in Vista, presumably because the &quot;programmers will use their powers for good&quot; maxim continues to be proven false&#8230;</p>
