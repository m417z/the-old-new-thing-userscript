		<p>You can change it so they start appearing in the Recent Items list. Using NirSoft&#39;s FileTypesMan, you can allow or prevent any file type/extension from appearing in Recent Items list. In FileTypeMan&#39;s &quot;Edit</p>
<p>File Type&quot; dialog, check the option called &quot;Don&#39;t add this file type to Recent Documents&quot;.</p>
<p>What I would like to know if there or isn&#39;t there a way in Windows 7 to add a file to the Recent jump list when launched by my own app launcher?</p>

		<p>@chentiangemalc: I don&#39;t think that answers xpclient&#39;s question, which is how to launch (presumably via ShellExecuteEx) a file, in another application, and have the file added to that application&#39;s automatic jump-list.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve run into this problem myself. There does not seem to be any documented way to do this. You can add files to the auto-jump-list if you know the app&#39;s AppUserModelID, but MSDN explicitly states that there is no way to get the AppUserModelID for an app, in general (i.e. when it is auto-generated). Besides which, I don&#39;t think there is a reliable way to find out which app ShellExecuteEx actually launched int he first place.</p>
<p>As is often the case, it seems the API was written and documented to the bare minimum needed for Windows Explorer to function, with no thought for alternative tools needing to do the same thing. :(</p>

<p>i.e. The assumption that Windows Explorer is the one and only application launcher, and that anything else that might want to do anything similar is up to no good and must be prevented, rather than trying to do something useful. :(</p>

		<p>Yes, mother (um,&#8230;Microsoft) knows best. If the people wonder why the files are not there (I&#39;ve been wondering all the time) that&#39;s because they wont them in the list. If I double click at a file to play it, the file is interesting, not an album. If I double click on a playlist, the playlist is interesting. What *I* open I think is interesting, not what Microsoft assumes. Too much thinking behind our backs.</p>

		<p>@jon much better to not have other 3rd party software messing with my software when typically users don&#39;t require/want this &#8211; it sounds like simple request at first, but will go straight to open slather abuse&#8230;</p>
<p>Microsoft has made it very easy to use Jump list system for 3rd parties &#8211; for either web sites in IE9+ or native&amp;managed code applications. Just keep it to your application/website. Perfectly reasonable limitation.</p>

		<p>@LeoDavidson</p>
<p>Lets step back and think for a moment if you could do what you want. What is there to stop super awesome application a from installing itself and registering itself on any jumplists that it can? Explorer was obviously designed this way to stop anyone but the application itself and users from being able to modify this list.</p>
<p>I know that jon was being sarcastic there, but yes, this wasn&#39;t to make things easy for third party apps, it was to keep users majorly in control of their settings. If you dislike this idea then I really don&#39;t know what to say since I know I like being able to say what goes in a jumplist and what doesn&#39;t.</p>

		<p>Oh so it&#39;s &quot;by design&quot;. Explorer from anywhere (Run dialog, Start Menu&#39;s Recent Items and all the ShellExecute methods) are all given special permissions but not third party launchers. And yet MS takes away the Start Menu in Windows 8. Talk about having your cake and eating it without sharing. Lack of a feature is justified as some security measure. Any app or malware can modify the &quot;Recent Items&quot; on the Start Menu, why not an app&#39;s jump list?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Who said it was a security measure? It&#39;s a design decision. There is no supported, documented way for one application to modify another application&#39;s jump list.

		<p>@xpclient: Apparently the jump list is super-secret highly sensitive information that nothing except the exalted Explorer be allowed to modify. Either that or Raymond just makes stuff up to justify design &quot;decisions&quot; that probably amount to no more than Microsoft not thinking or caring about what third-party applications might want to do.</p>
<p>&quot;Implement the bare minimum in an API to make Explorer and Office work&quot; has been the Microsoft way for years now.</p>

		<p>Btw, for musics most players including WMP have their own &quot;recently played file&quot; list, and most people play music only in one or two music software. They add them once, and play from their playlist afterwards. There&#39;s little point to include them in the &quot;Recent Items&quot; list.</p>

		<p>Trollfest in comments above. Yeah it&#39;s a good thing that apps can&#39;t mess with other apps stuff, news flash guys. There probably should have been a method for an app to be allowed (by the user, through system UI) to act as a &quot;service level app&quot;, or even better, a fine grained permission system, buut. You can&#39;t program everything.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of browser toolbars, applications have the power to install them. Given the option to not install them is there, but the option always defaults on. The end result is many of the normal (non-power/techi) users have at least one browser toolbar, some people I know have like three. Someof which are hostile, one family friends computer had a browser toolbar that would insert more ads into facebook into the user feed. So in light of browser toolbar mantality, i do not want third party apps touching other apps jump lists either ;), as much as i hate to say it. As a programer id like to be able to do whatever id like with the system too, but it seems more bad than good.</p>
