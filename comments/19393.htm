		<p>Wow, deja vu here. &nbsp;I once had a problem with my Honda Del Sol that the engine would hesitate and stutter if I drove at over 130mph for more than two hours continuously.</p>
<p>The garage could never reproduce the problem and when I told them exactly how to reproduce it they said &quot;Don&#8217;t do that.&quot;</p>

		<p>Wow, these are the days before SetEvent, I&#8217;m guessing.</p>
<p>Create a manually-reset event, and helper app WaitOnSingle/MultipleObject(s) on it. First thing it does after a normal wait is reset the event (arm it so it can receive a new one &#8211; this may mean it does a useless loop at the end), then process the queue. Once queue is empty, wait again.</p>
<p>The interrupt stashes data into the queue, then signals. (if it&#8217;s signalled already, SetEvent does nothing).</p>
<p>The reason for the immediate reset is to avoid a race where you finish processing, but before you reset the event, another event gets in (and is lost).</p>
<p>Then again, one realizes that auto-reset events work too, since the event does reset until one thread was released. (To release all threads then reset, PulseEvent is your friend).</p>
<p>Yeah, I guess I&#8217;d be lost on 16-bit Windows.</p>

		<p>Of course, in the 16 bit days, it was pretty easy to overwhelm a system with IO to the point that there was insufficent overhead to process the data.</p>
<p>One has to wonder how much processing those 10,000 samples a minute actually required and whether that would be the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back no matter what hand off was attemtped.</p>
<p>To futher your analogy, you can drive slower and make fewer trips by carrying more per trip, but don&#8217;t try to move a 10 ton loads with that Camry no matter how slow you go.</p>
