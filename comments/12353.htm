<p>That was my basic thought too. I&#39;m not familiar with these formats, but I imagine that at this point it would be an unholy nightmare to try to add to these long-established specifications. It might be nice to add this in the next incarnation of Windows, however.</p>

		<p>As far as the rename a copy issue goes, IIRC desktop.ini&#39;s have a DeleteOnCopy section that would have stripped the name if some tool other than robocopy had been used I&#39;m guessing</p>

		<p>I remember reading on TDWTF about those IT bosses who seriously thought FAT is more secure/stable than NTFS.</p>
<p>And archived files. Seriously, why this marginal feature even deserves mentioning. Last I heard, it&#39;s phased out. The whole tape support is being phased out. Good riddance.</p>

		<p>@Adam Rosenfield: My client site archives all the network drives to tape every day. Restore from tape isn&#39;t common, and it&#39;s usually single files that need to be restored. But there have been cases of several GB of data being requested from archives because someone deleted an entire folder and nobody noticed for 4 months. Tapes are a lot cheaper to purchase compared to hard drives. Our tapes aren&#39;t going anywhere anytime soon.</p>
<p>That said, the tapes aren&#39;t available as a network drive though. As far as I know they&#39;re stored in a box somewhere with a date written in sharpie on the outside. Data is required to be kept for something like 7 years. Somewhere there&#39;s a big room full of boxes.</p>

		<p>I have another solution: Leave file names English-only and teach users accordingly. Deep down below, the files are still named in English (or in the first language that was installed, which is worse), no matter what desktop.ini says; and sooner or later this fact will manifest itself to the user, in the most inconveniencing way if the user is not prepared.</p>

		<p>Not withstanding the NTFS vs. FAT argument, couldn&#39;t a lot of the arguments about alternative streams be dealt with by putting the localized names in an alternate stream of the directory itself? Now, you have two reads (directory in English, directory in localized language), instead of the 500 or whatever number Raymond uses. Further, it seems like a logical extension &#8212; the name of the file is kept in the directory, the localized name of the file is kept in (the localization stream of) the directory.</p>
<p>@Adam Rosenfield: Yes, many of our customers archive hundreds of gigabytes of medical images to tape.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Yes, basically you need to keep it somewhere outside the file. Desktop.ini, or an alternate stream on the directory. Desktop.ini has the advantages of (1) working on all file systems, (2) being something that backup/restore programs know how to back up and restore, (3) having its own ACL, if you want the access to the stream to be different from the access to the directory. (I admire using the &quot;if you ignore the NTFS requirement&quot; clause, it&#39;s like opening with &quot;Notwithstanding that we&#39;re on the wrong side of the airtight hatchway.&quot;) -Raymond</i>]</div>

<p>That&#39;s not archive, it&#39;s backup. &nbsp;Tape is still very suitable for backup in a lot of cases, but what&#39;s being talked about here is a HSM solution where older data gets pushed off to slower secondary media.</p>

		<p>What I still don&#39;t get (after skimming the articles) about the localized dir names is the following:</p>
<p>On German Vista/7 explorer shows &quot;C:Programme&quot; while cmd shows &quot;C:Program Files&quot;. So far so good.</p>
<p>Editing the text in the explorer bar (i.e. going from bread crumb to edit) shows the english names again. But here comes the catch: The autocompletion after entering e.g. &quot;C:Pro&quot; only suggests the German name and then <em>does not work</em>. Explorer fails to accept its suggested input of &quot;C:Programme&quot;.</p>
<p>Is this a PEBKAC situation, a bug or a &quot;feature&quot; by design?</p>

<p>Seriously?

		<p>@Me, @JonPotter: I think it&#39;s mostly intentional, actually, albeit a little confusing.</p>
<p>In XP, localisation was done by physically changing the folder names (so a German installation of Windows would actually have C:Programme on disk, and there would be no C:Program Files). &nbsp;One of the problems with this is that if you switched UI languages then the folder names wouldn&#39;t change, which would confuse people using the same PC with multiple users, each running their own language (admittedly, not common, but as Raymond said, this is intended for those big multinational companies &#8212; think about remote login servers for a moment). &nbsp;The other problem with it is that stupid software didn&#39;t think to check the folder name and assumed it would always be called C:Program Files, and thus broke horribly on localised PCs. &nbsp;(And again, some would say &quot;and they deserve to&quot;, but the big companies wouldn&#39;t look favourably on an OS upgrade that stopped their old and crusty LOB apps from working.)</p>
<p>In Vista/7, it was changed so that the name on disk is fixed, but the displayed name varies according to whatever the current name at the moment is. &nbsp;This fixes both of the problems from before, but introduces an odd disconnect &#8212; pathnames (which is what you&#39;re editing if you click into the address bar and start typing) use the on-disk paths, but the breadcrumbs themselves (and the folder view) shows the localised name. &nbsp;Windows doesn&#39;t actually have a way to represent a path using the localised names &#8212; paths are always physical.</p>
<p>An interesting quirk of this is that if you navigate through to some folder under a localised location (eg. the breadcrumb bar shows C: &gt; Programme &gt; Some App), and then click into the bar to switch to path editing, then the display will change to the physical path (eg. C:Program FilesSome App). &nbsp;Then when you click out again it&#39;ll change back.</p>
<p>Yes, it&#39;s a bit weird. &nbsp;But if you think about it, you&#39;ll see why the autocomplete won&#39;t work on the localised names &#8212; and it&#39;s the same reason as discussed in this post.</p>
<p>[Disclaimer: I have no connection to MS, so I don&#39;t know if this is the &quot;real&quot; reason or not. &nbsp;But it makes sense to me.]</p>

		<p>@Miral: I agree, in part, but if you re-read Me&#39;s original post you&#39;ll see that the main problem is that the autocomplete actually completes the <em>localised</em> names. If you type C:Prog on a German system, it will auto-complete as in C:Programme, NOT c:Program Files. So if nothing else I would say that definitely is a bug &#8211; what&#39;s the point of auto-completing a path that won&#39;t be recognised when you press return?</p>

		<p>@Frode Aarebrot:</p>
<p>Those are backups, not offline files. In 2010 it&#39;s time to get with the program already and use &quot;snapshots&quot; (or &quot;previous versions&quot;) feature of NTFS. Available like since 2005 or so.</p>
<p>And I don&#39;t think it&#39;s possible to buy 2TB of uncompressed tape space for $150.</p>

		<p>The English names on disk, localized names in (most) UI is really confusing &#8211; I&#39;ve had several users complain that my (pre-Vista) program showed different paths than Explorer, and once this was fixed that the directory listing shows one thing, but the text box requires something else (this even confused me for a when I first encountered it).</p>

		<p>Yes, in 2010 people do still use archive to tape solutions. If you don&#39;t think so, just write an enterprise indexing solution that doesn&#39;t respect the archive bit and see how fast those hot fix request start popping in as you drag hundreds of thousands of files back off of tape.</p>

<p>Actually, I just tried on German Windows 7 x64. Entering &quot;C:Pro&quot; suggests both &quot;C:Programme&quot; and &quot;C:Program Files&quot; (and the corresponding x86 versions) and all of them work. Entering &quot;C:Ben&quot; also suggests &quot;C:Benutzer&quot;, which leads to &quot;C:Users&quot;. So on my system it works like it should (with one exception: For some stupid reason, I have a real &quot;C:Programme&quot; folder, so entering that into the bar will lead to this one, not to &quot;C:Program Files&quot;).</p>

<p>800GB uncompressed for about £30 == about $50, so 2.4TB for the $150 you suggested. &nbsp;Admittedly not a big saving over disks, but probably more reliable for long term storage situations.</p>

		<p>Everytime I have a new account on a Vista/Win 7 machine the first thing I do is go through all of the directories under %UserProfile% and delete the LocalizedResourceName line from all of the Desktop.ini files.</p>

		<p>If I understand correctly,</p>
<p>* for directories, the localized name is in the directory itself&#39;s Desktop.ini file,</p>
<p>* while for files, the localized name is in the parent directory&#39;s Desktop.ini file?</p>

		<p>Is there a registry hack to disable showing localized names?</p>

		<p>@Frode Aarebrot:</p>
<p>I agree with Alex: &nbsp;Hard drives are cheaper than tapes nowadays, on a cost per byte basis.</p>

		<p>@Frode Aarebrot:</p>
<p>Well, that link shows tape at a 50% discount, so if you compare suggested retail price, disk is cheaper.</p>

		<p>Two things: Firstly (and less importantly), I&#39;d have thought that dynamically translating folder names made it harder to give users reliable instructions. &nbsp;I can&#39;t tell people to look in `Program Files&#39;, for example, because that folder might have a different name for the reader &#8212; even (now) that we actually use the same machine. &nbsp;Given that Microsoft doesn&#39;t do these sorts of things lightly, does anyone know what the costs of this problem actually are relative to the obvious benefits of having things in users&#39; preferred languages? &nbsp;(The Unix approach is simply for the main system directories to have runic names which are more or less incomprehensible to everyone.)</p>
<p>Secondly, I&#39;ll dispute Raymond&#39;s analysis of the network server case: he makes a classic confusion of latency versus throughput. &nbsp;I&#39;m sure that CIFS is capable of pipelining requests, so we should be counting only necessary round trips: one for the directory contents and two (open and read, respectively concurrent!) for each of the files&#39; alternate name streams. &nbsp;Raymond&#39;s other reasons seem sound, though.</p>

		<p>Are there 3 different names for Program Files?</p>
<p>Progra~1, Program Files, and localized. Insane!</p>
<p>Why not store the non-localized LFN at the same place as the localized LFN?</p>
