		<p>This reminds me of one of the conversations I had with an open source proponent friend of mine in college. &nbsp;One day he managed to drag me into one of those &quot;Linux is Superior to Windows&quot; conversations we all know and love. &nbsp;Typically, I don&#8217;t back down from such conversations but that day I really needed to get some studying done as we had a test for Formal Languages and Computability coming up in a few days. &nbsp;We went back and forth a few times with him pointing out that Linux is more secure, you have access to the source, and the usual diatribe the linux crowd has been spewing for years. &nbsp;I struck back with Windows better back compat, better interface, etc.</p>
<p>It was clear we were going no where fast as I pointed out Windows&#8217; market share. &nbsp;My friend said, &quot;So you&#8217;re saying Windows is just superior for the market but not superior to linux.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>I said, &quot;Yes, Windows is just superior for the market.&quot; &nbsp;I left it at that.</p>

		<p>That’s very unlike my experience with the Japanese immigrants in Brazil. &nbsp;It generally goes like this:</p>
<p>me: [japanese]</p>
<p>they: [portuguese]</p>
<p>me: [japanese]</p>
<p>they: [portuguese]</p>
<p>me: [japanese]</p>
<p>they: [veery carefully admitting to themselves that a caucasian is speaking japanese] oooh, you speak Japanese?</p>
<p>me: just a little, I’m still learning, I’m very bad at it etc.</p>
<p>they: no, no, that’s amazing, you speak very well! [said in the tone of “look mom, the horse can do math!”]</p>
<p>I also think the amount of praise is inversely proportional to actual mastery of language.</p>

		<p>I visited a friend of mine who lives in Japan a few years ago. He hosted a party at which an Indian was a guest (Ravi). &nbsp;Ravi was born and raised in Japan. He told me the exact same story you did. &nbsp;The Japanese people he ran into could not comprehend that a brown face was speaking perfect Japanese. &nbsp;They felt the Japanese language was &#8216;in the genes&#8217; and non-Japanese people should/would/could not speak it perfectly.</p>

		<p>Perhaps he should learn some silly complex kanji and turn the tables, asking the interlocutor whether *he* knows written Japanese.</p>

<p>Actually, most Japanese probably aren&#8217;t able to write the characters for rose (薔薇) and soy sauce (醤油).</p>

		<p>The native speaker in question sounds like quite a jerk. And the title is a special case of the more general advice &quot;Sometimes it&#8217;s easier to let the bigger jerk win&quot;.</p>

		<p>IF it was me (which it couldn&#8217;t be since I don&#8217;t know a jot of Japanese!) I&#8217;d be tempted to concede the game very early in the exchange and, once lost, just let natural conversation sho where my level really is. &nbsp;And see how long to takes to dawn on them.</p>

		<p>My sister is classed as a native Japanese speaker (though we are both caucasian) &#8211; she has reason to be in Japan for work quite regularly and often speaks to loads of Japanese people in a prominent public position as part of it.</p>
<p>She has never been challenged in the way you describe &#8211; not even by Japanese friends.</p>
<p>The reason for this is because Japanese people tend to be overly polite &#8211; it would be rude to suggest that one&#8217;s spoken or written language is imperfect. &nbsp;Even when ASKED to pass judgement they will more often tend to tell you &nbsp;only what was correct rather than point out flaws. &nbsp;Only the closest of friends will deign to say anything negative, and even then it will be cast in a positive light.</p>
<p>I think it far more likely your colleague is either having you on, or actually enjoys the challenge (ie. asks to be tested).</p>

		<p>I think they just want to be encouraging. &nbsp;Let someone show off a little, appear impressed. &nbsp;Then one party says &#8216;I still have so much to learn!&#8217; and the other party goes &#8216;Your Japanese is so good! How long have you been studying?&#8217;, or some such. &nbsp;And then, have you ever been to Japan, when was the last time, how long, etc.</p>
<p>Kind of like how when a friendly Japanese person with a cart full of groceries is in line at the supermarket, he or she may ask you if you want to cut ahead of them with your few items. &nbsp;Sometimes you will be asked 3-4 times if you want to cut. &nbsp;It&#8217;s just one of those weird exchanges.</p>

		<p>I can barely speak English, let alone another language, but I have experienced the same sort of thing with spicy (hot) food, along the lines of &quot;No, no, that&#8217;s for Thai|Indian|Malaysian|Lao|etc people&quot;, and gosh, look at that, the funny looking guy likes it. I guess the equivalent in my locale might be Vegemite: &quot;No! Don&#8217;t touch that, only Australians think it tastes good.&quot;</p>

		<p>&quot;Dr Pepper?&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mind Dr Pepper. You just have to hold your nose as you&#8217;re drinking it because it smells like vomit. Drinking from a can helps because you can just cover the hole with your mouth.</p>
<p>But vegemite is delicious! I spread it a centimeter thick on my toast :-) The trick to liking vegemite is to spend about 10 years in Australia. I find that everyone comes to like it after spending enough time here&#8230; must be something in the water.</p>
