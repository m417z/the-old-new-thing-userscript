		<p>I think you actually solved the mystery of the Notepad author about a week after that first post &#8211; <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20091117-01/?p=15993" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20091117-01/?p=15993</a>. </p>
<p>(Wikipedia attributes the very first version to Richard Brodie but that doesn&#8217;t seem to be who you&#8217;re talking about, so perhaps there&#8217;s still some mystery.)</p>

		<p>Although the Year 2000 event was a one-off and passed without any of the predicted drama, another will occur on Tuesday, 19 January 2038 when signed 32-bit integer time will overflow. Although all major OSs will have been using 64-bit integer time for a several years there will still be plenty of embedded systems that don&#8217;t and could roll back to 13 December 1901. I wonder if this time it will go as smoothly, or if complacency will have set in. Or perhaps the number of affected systems will be vastly greater than last time, they will be less accessible, and identifying and fixing them will prove an impossible task.</p>

		<p>A lot of &#8220;cloud powered&#8221; IoT devices will fail in 2038 because they use 32-bit systems and SSL/TLS libraries. When they check certificate expiration they will fail. When they DHCP and / or get network time, they will fail.</p>
<p>Whether or not any of today&#8217;s Linux powered light bulbs are still running in 2038 is a different question. I doubt it. I don&#8217;t think the vendors will bother maintaining the domain names and web services.</p>

		<p>The problem is not the tall trees. The problem is that in the US, power lines are not usually buried as there are in many other countries, rendering falling trees harmless to the power infrastructure.<br />

		<p>Utilities generally have found buried power lines to be LESS reliable than lines on poles, not more. In fact you have to over-provision them to compensate for the fact that when they fail you have to dig up a street to repair them, which is just not something you can do many times a year. </p>
<p>Those small boxes you see on the streets in neighborhoods with underground wiring that have dire warnings about electrocution are points where they can swap around between redundant cables when one fails to quickly get service restored.</p>

		<p>Well, whatever the case, I honestly can&#8217;t even remember the last power outage here in Germany, certainly none within the last 3 years. And we do bury our cables. On the other hand electricity is at least twice as expensive as it&#8217;s in the US, so maybe it&#8217;s just a case of &#8220;you get what you pay for&#8221; ;)</p>

		<p>When an underground cable failed in our town we (and 50 or so other properties) were fed from a large diesel generator, deposited on a nearby verge, for several days before a repair could be effected.  Admittedly the temporary supply was 100% reliable, although I expect the frequency was off.</p>

		<p>Most of the power cables in the UK are underground, although the power is distributed around the country with cables on pylons. Powercuts are usually caused by one of those going down, or a fault at the substation.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t get much seismic activity, which may explain why the cables are safer underground than above.</p>

		<p>Putting power lines underground is just too expensive. It may work in some parts of the country, but where I live in Massachusetts the ground is full of rocks and ledge. There are serious estimates that it would cost a trillion dollars (yes, with a T) to bury the lines in just Massachusetts.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s one source: <a href="http://boston.cbslocal.com/2011/10/31/patrick-1-trillion-to-bury-power-lines-underground/" rel="nofollow">http://boston.cbslocal.com/2011/10/31/patrick-1-trillion-to-bury-power-lines-underground/</a><br />
And I know I&#8217;ve heard &#8220;it would cost trillions&#8221; in person from some National Grid spokesman at some point on the issue, but I don&#8217;t have an easily citable source for that.</p>

		<p>And trimming trees that grow up near/around power lines costs far less than burying the lines.  There&#8217;s been a big push by utility companies in the Northeast U.S. to trim vegetation back from the power lines after several crippling storms came through in recent years.</p>

		<p>While obviously someone has to be responsible for maintaining Notepad (otherwise you would have to remove it), it seems more of a symbolic appointment; I can&#8217;t imagine there&#8217;s much actual maintenance.</p>
