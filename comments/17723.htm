		<p>Same as with the Dell Laptop disclaimer when you start it for the first time. &#8211; at least, it was with the Latitude D410 some years ago. I don&#8217;t know if newer ones have the same:</p>
<p>There was a legal disclaimer you had to acknowledge. I did not acknowledge the first time, as I did not have the time to read everything. Thus, I switch off the Dell instead.</p>
<p>On next boot, I did not see the disclaimer anymore.</p>
<p>Thus, I never accepted it, right?</p>

		<p>As described in &quot;The Agreeable Cat&quot;, you simply need to construct a device to enable your pets to agree to accept all EULA type agreements.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you could find a way to get the cat to pull that sticker off the Heelys. Catnip, perhaps?</p>

		<p>Older versions of Windows (and many computer games) also had a similar problem. A EULA sticker (you break it, you agree) was placed on the CD case in a manner that would force you to break it in order to get at the contents. Unfortunately, no one ever thought that a user might simply take the CD cover off of its hinges and open it from the other side.</p>
<p>oops.</p>

		<p>PaulCam:</p>
<p>At least, for Germany, this is not really a problem: A license agreement you see only after you have already purchased the item would not stand in court. You must know everything before you buy it, or the license is void.</p>
<p>Note that you must not return the item if you do not want to accept the license: Just use the item as if this agreement was not there in the first place.</p>
<p>Simple, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

		<p>That is why companies also put their EULAs and terms of use online.</p>
<p>Dutch courtrulings consider this to be an acceptable alternative.</p>

		<p>@alt-92:</p>
<p>In Germany, most lawyers do not consider this an acceptable alternative. Everything that gets part of a contract must be known to both parties in advance. If the customer has to lookup a web site (how can he if he wants to buy his first PC?), this is not enough. The seller must tell him before the contract is made.</p>
<p>Note, however, that there is one difference: If you get the EULA before downloading something, this is acceptable. Thus, for example, MS giving its security updates and presenting an EULA, this EULA is considered valid.</p>
<p>It is not very easy. However, the fine print: Shrink-wrapped EULA are not enforcible in Germany.</p>

		<p>Yes well, just because they wrote it on a sticker doesn&#8217;t make it so. Turns out, that just declaring something loudly doesn&#8217;t make it hold up in court.</p>
<p>Heck even things that get signed don&#8217;t always hold. I can remember back in the 90s a few people I knew getting non-competes thrown out because they basically prevented the person from working in the industry at all.</p>
<p>Lesson: &quot;An agreement has to be legal to be valid.&quot;</p>

		<p>In most cases, as far as I know, at least in Europe, any agreement absolving a manufacturer of responsibility when their lethal product injures people is very dubious.</p>

		<p>So in Europe people aren&#8217;t allowed to freely choose to take risks? Because if the alternative is that the product cannot be sold at all (because no-one is willing to sell it), that&#8217;s essentially what it becomes.</p>

		<p>The whole thing is silly anyway. &nbsp;If it ever comes up, all you have to say is &quot;Yellow sticker? &nbsp;Mine didn&#8217;t have one. &nbsp;Someone must have fallen asleep at the factory. &nbsp;Or maybe they were returned without it.&quot; &nbsp;Good luck to them trying to prove you wrong.</p>
