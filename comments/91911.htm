		<p>&quot;I would rather a product be a Honda Civic or Toyota Corolla: Affordable, gets the job done with no fuss, high reliability, low TCO, no exotic parts or special driver training required.&quot; Speaking like a true Asian, lol.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t fall into either category either, being a young male engineer who has never found various cars to be sexy or desirable. &nbsp;That being said, when it comes to software I usually prefer the solution that finds a good balance between power/customizability (the two generally being one and the same) and simplicity/ease of use. &nbsp;This is why I prefer Windows: it gives me a lot of customization if I need it and power if I want it, but it doesn&#39;t force me to when I don&#39;t want to. &nbsp;Fruit-inclined OSes are almost actively hostile with giving their users any degree of power or lower-level control, whereas penguin-inclined OSes are far too happy to let me do whatever I want, but oh yeah, if you run it on this hardware then the window server needs these flags set, and if you use this processor you definitely want your kernel to be compiled with these flags to get the best performance, and we didn&#39;t test that checkbox and the other checkbox together and now your system is constantly crashing, you say? &nbsp;Well drop a line in one of the hundred forums and maybe someone will help you or call you an idiot. &nbsp;Depends on the weather.</p>

		<p>This is probably my favorite update ever. :-)</p>
<p>And count me in the same category as MNGoldenEagle. &nbsp;I&#39;m in neither category, don&#39;t want to be in either category, and own a Honda Accord that still looks and feels almost new even though it&#39;s over ten years old. :-P</p>

		<p>It sounds like your colleague with the two Ferraris now has three problems: two expensive cars in the shop, and still in need of a vehicle for transportation.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t fall into either category, either. &nbsp;I&#39;m a young engineer with absolutely no interest in sports cars. &nbsp;However, I have described my main means of transport as a mid-engined, rear-wheel-drive sports vehicle (it&#39;s a bicycle).</p>

		<p>Snark: Is that why Windows never features prominently in High Performance Computing benchmarks?</p>
<p>Comment: Agree with Raymond&#39;s philosophy. After years of tinkering with the OS, all I want is a OS that is stable, and works every single time. My general philosophy is to neuter third party OS extensions &#8211; unnecessary kernel mode components &#8211; drivers, services.. explorer add-ins etc. And once I setup a PC to a working state &#8211; I make sure to never touch anything. Has served me well so far. My work PC stays up indefinitely without crashing. I manually schedule security updates once in every two months if needed and that&#39;s when I usually reboot.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s a consequence of buying too much into the trendy, innovative, bleeding-edge, cool conception of technology products and brands these days. Who wants to be a boring old company like IBM, with an endless array of graying engineers wearing ties focused on iteratively improving long-standing enterprise offerings under a logo that hasn&#39;t been updated since 1972, when you can be a trendy hip company spending big money on bigger bets in the consumer space in hopes of breaking into and re-inventing the next big thing? Of course, business is consistently stable and profitable at old tech giants like IBM, while most of the companies who have bet on emerging consumer markets like mobile have lost big&#8230;</p>

		<p>In reference to the quote,</p>
<p>&quot;The presenter said, &quot;We created a Ferrari, basically.&quot;</p>
<p>Was the presenter opining that the product was what everybody wants a Ferrari to be, or what they actually are?</p>

		<p>I&#39;d go for a Mazda3 diesel (3rd gen): Incredibly good performance (fuel economy), enough electronics to be useful without getting in your way, reasonable price. &nbsp;My only concession to vanity might be to go for the sedan rather than the hatchback. &nbsp;If it was an OS, it&#39;d be Windows 7.</p>

		<p>I love the products I use to be cheap and reliable. My smartphone is 3 years old. But I prefer to devlop something on the cutting edge &#8211; to engineer a Ferrari, if you will. For bonus points, try to fit the Ferrari features inside a Fiat 500. There is still much to do for Corolla, but is is like working at an assebly line &#8211; very important work, but where is the fun?</p>

		<p>Times are changing. In former times all people wanted to develop a space rocket and now only a slow Ferrari. BTW: I drive a Honda. Haha</p>

		<p>@jwraith: If you&#39;ve got a DeLorean that isn&#39;t constantly breaking down and in need of maintenance, you may want to get it put in a glass case, it&#39;s probably the only one of its kind.</p>
<p>(A guy I know has one. &nbsp;Its one of the few cars to be rated in miles-per-person-pushing).</p>

		<p>@Alex Cohn: I think the point is that you can certainly have fun, but only after you&#39;ve done all you can to keep your customers happy, then the people who&#39;ll maintain your code, then the people who&#39;ll read your documentation, etc. This is different from, say, writing an app as a hobby, where you get to pick everything and make it more of an artistic endeavor, and if other people like it, fine, if not, it&#39;s an expression of yourself and you don&#39;t really care.</p>

		<p>I really wouldn&#39;t mind building a software Tesla: Expensive, sure, but top-grade quality and actively reinvesting the proceeds from the software into fixing some of the biggest problems in the software world by simply making them obsolete? &nbsp;Where do I sign up? :D</p>

<p>Windows is supposed to be something companies can write garbage for with confidence that Microsoft will spend all their money ensuring said garbage continues to work for decades.</p>

		<p>@Dave &#8211; At 34 years old a DeLorean is only as reliable as those who have maintained it over the years. It sounds like your friend and the previous owners of his car haven&#39;t really been up to scratch. I&#39;ve only had to push mine once, and that was my fault for ignoring the low-fuel warning light!</p>

		<p>&quot;So your target audience is wealthy jerks?&quot; I don&#39;t own a Ferrari, but I know a number of people who do. Some of them are wealthy, and some of them are not. None of them are jerks, unlike many of the strangers they meet when seen getting in or out of their cars (perhaps because of generalisations like those in this post about cost and reliability).</p>
