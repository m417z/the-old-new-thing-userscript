		<p>I believe that the strategy of intentionally committing delay-of-game-like penalties is no longer effective.</p>
<p>From NFL Rule 4-7-1:</p>
<p>&#8220;Two successive delay penalties during the same down, is unsportsmanlike conduct (12-3-1-o). After enforcement of the 15-yard penalty, the game clock shall start on the snap.&#8221;</p>
<p>While the defense could repeatedly commit encroachment penalties to keep the clock stopped, the repeated application of 15-yard penalties would eventually move the offense into easy touchdown-territory.</p>

		<p>&gt; If a penalty is committed that stops the clock, the team that did not commit the penalty has the option of requesting that ten seconds be removed from the game clock.<br />
I am not that familiar with football, but would it be possible, like in soccer, to intentionally fault the opponent?<br />
&#8212; If I am winning, and I could keep faulting my opponent, AND double penalize them by taking time off the game.</p>

		<p>Under the current rules, the foul stops the clock unconditionally, so your attempt to take time off the clock has failed. Under my rules, the opponent would decline the option to remove 10 seconds from the clock.</p>

		<p>What I meant is that, what if you could commit an intentional action, which result in the opponent to be the faulting party.<br />
Under your proposed rule, if the opponent is at fault, you will be the one to decide whether to take the time off.</p>

		<p>It rather involved being on the other side of this airtight hatchway: Sportsball edition<br />
If you can induce the opponent to make mistakes, you might as well skip the fouling and make them let you score touchdowns.</p>

		<p>American football does not have diving like association football does.  You only get &#8220;unnecessary roughness&#8221; if you were *really* being a jerk.</p>

		<p>Back in the day, some punters were pretty good at flopping to try to get a &#8220;roughing the kicker&#8221; penalty called. I don&#8217;t watch much football now, so I don&#8217;t know whether that still happens.</p>

		<p>Well, American football does have a form of injury faking, but for the puspose of prolonging a game, rather than trying to get another player penalized. This comes from officals stopping the clock to allow for injured players to be atteneded and get helped off the field. If a team is badly hurting for time and is out of time outs, faking an injury can be beneficial in effectively creating an axtra time out. There are som rule tweaks that try to discourage this, but it definately still happens on ocassion.</p>

		<p>Also Rule 12-3-2 would likely come into play for intentional delay-of-game-like penalties within 15 yards of the defense&#8217;s goal line:</p>
<p>&#8220;The defense shall not commit successive or repeated fouls to prevent a score.</p>
<p>&#8220;Penalty: For successive or repeated fouls to prevent a score: If the violation is repeated after a warning, the score involved is awarded to the offensive team.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Well said that man! Soccer is real football. How can you have a game entitled &#8220;football&#8221; when most of the time, the players are carrying the ball?</p>

		<p>Both gridiron football (played by the NFL) and association football (soccer) are derived from rugby. Rugby was originally known as &#8220;football&#8221; because it was played &#8220;on foot.&#8221; The implication was that it was the game that peasants played. The comparison was to polo, which was played on horseback.</p>

		<p>Well. For Europeans (I am German.) the rules are quite confusing. It all starts with the name of the game: Football, but the ball is moved by hand most of the time. It is like as if we would call our soccer &#8220;headball&#8221;.</p>
<p>Actually the rules are simple. Carry the ball 10 yards, get four new attempts. Carry the ball in the endzone, score three points and kick the ball through the goal for another one point. Well &#8220;actually&#8221;. But there are so many exceptions! I wonder if the Americans know all the exceptions.</p>
<p>Plus, way too many breaks. I think my bladder is much too big for American Football. Or my refrigerator is much too small, ;) There is no continuous game play.  </p>
<p>But for some reason I like to watch it.</p>

		<p>Well, after reading this last week, it was interesting to see this (the ten seconds removed from the clock) get called on the second to the last play during this past weekend&#8217;s SuperBowl.<br />
BTW, I&#8217;m assuming when people talk about &#8220;real football&#8221; in these comments, they are referring to Canadian Football :-)</p>

		<p>american football, canadian football &#8211; both are just rugby for wimps ;-) Shoulder polsters, helmets with metal grid before the face &#8211; but call it a full-contact sport. Plus all those substitutions possible &#8211; either you are good and hard enough to play the whole time or you need to find a better sport ;-)</p>

		<p>More likely, they&#8217;re referring to the sport played mostly with the feet and where taking the ball in hand is legal for only 1 player on each team, and only in a restricted area.</p>

		<p>Re: Delay of game.</p>
<p>What if the ball simply goes live at 25 seconds? If not snapped, it&#8217;s treated as a fumble.</p>
<p>(I also say; spike the ball&#8211;fumble.)</p>
<p>(Of course, then there is the weirdness where the ball crossing the goal line is a goal, but out-of-bounds is determined where the feet are.)</p>
