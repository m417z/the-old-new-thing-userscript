		<p>Ray You made my day&#8230;</p>
<p>(&quot;Every complex system resists its proper functioning&quot;)</p>
<p>Now I know why every chunk I start to test usually fails&#8230; Now I can explain that its not the developers fault.. its proven Maths.. it has to fail as its complex.. :)</p>

		<p>I think I need to make a trip to the library for The Design of Everyday Things. Maybe it will finally give me some insight as to why the automatic paper-towel dispensers in public restrooms are so over-designed. You know the kind: you have to wave your hand over a sensor, and voila, you get a paper towel. Of course merely walking past the dispenser accomplishes the same thing. But never fear, because it also has a sensor to detect whether a paper towel is still hanging from it, so as to avoid paper towel avalanches. If it didn&#8217;t have the hand-o-wave sensor, and just spit out a paper towel after the last one was removed, it wouldn&#8217;t be quite so buggy.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t even get me started about the ghosts that randomly turn on the wave-o-hand faucets while you&#8217;re relieving yourself.</p>

		<p>Reading this here about the &quot;Fundamental Failure-Mode Theorem&quot; makes me laugh on the inside, I marvel at this every day with all the &nbsp;try-catch&#8217;s in the C# code I work with. &nbsp;It&#8217;s amusing how they&#8217;ve kept the code running &quot;normal&quot; through the most catastrophic stuff that would have torched and blasted C++ programs.</p>

		<p>Every newcomer to a complex system believes (I know, I&#8217;ve been one) that the system is overly bloated and too complex. Since they&#8217;re usually eager to show how good they are, the first lesson is to let them refactor a piece of it and test it afterwards. After they have felt the pain, they are introduced to Systemantics. The scars will never disappear :-)</p>

		<p>The problem sometimes is not from developer or engineer. It&#8217;s from the management, either middle or higher. They always believe in process and systems, and they would not quit until they build a screwy one. Even their systems are not working, they can blaim the fault on the ones who build them. The cycle is going again, system always prones to fail as long as it involves with human.</p>

		<p>After DOET, you&#8217;ll enjoy &quot;Things That Make Us Smart&quot; also by Norman. Human-technology interface is considered in a more fundamental relationship &#8211; in that technology is an extension of our minds, and what this can mean for its design. More philosophical than the actionable principles discussed in DOET, but also more primal, seeing as the organization and expression of our cognition is a more basic task.</p>

<p>MIT&#8217;s Gehry monstrosity seems to have won a lawsuit instead. &nbsp;Then there&#8217;s also I.M. Pei&#8217;s Green Building, which is definitely boring, old, and rectangular. &nbsp;And it&#8217;s got a built-in airflow amplifier that would prevent you from opening or closing the doors to the building on a windy day.</p>

		<p>I have heard Don Norman say that he prefers the original title because it makes a better acronym.</p>
<p>If I were to add a fourth title to Raymond&#8217;s list, it would be Peopleware by Tom DeMarco and Tim Lister. Another must read. Get the 2nd edition with additional chapters.</p>

		<p>Can I recommend one other book. &quot;How Buildings Learn&quot;, by Stewart Brand. It looks at buildings and how they adapt to changing needs, which can be done either by not having changing needs, adapting to changes, or being knocked down and rebuilt. The longest lasting buildings tend not to be those that have a single function built in, but those which are strongly adaptable in ways you havent thought of.</p>
<p>Obviously, this is very relevant to software design.</p>

		<p>The Mythical Man-Month is a great book, although I have read some criticism of it (which is not entirely off the mark). &nbsp;Still, it&#8217;s a great book. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The other big point that I remember from the book is, if you constrain the amount of space or time or anything else for one functional area, the developers are forced to &quot;throw it over the wall&quot; and declare that these functional areas are the responsibility of a different group. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think this came up in the design of the various OS/360 control blocks.</p>

		<p>My preferred law from Systemantics is &quot;A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that works.&quot;</p>
<p>It explains most OSes nowadays.</p>

		<p>MadQ: &quot;Maybe it will finally give me some insight as to why the automatic paper-towel dispensers in public restrooms are so over-designed.&quot;</p>
<p>Reading The Design of Everyday Things won&#8217;t tell you why something is badly designed, but it will help you appreciate that many things around you in your everyday life &nbsp;are badly designed, things you may not have realised.</p>
<p>It can kind of be summarised by this phrase &quot;Don&#8217;t take any &lt;bleep&gt; from a toaster&quot;, meaning if something should be making your life easier isn&#8217;t&#8230; get a new something. When you replace toaster with software design (especially UI) it really can open your eyes to what is dreadful behaviour in software.</p>
<p>Such as, for instance, let&#8217;s say you see an 8 year old kid in tears because they can&#8217;t find Print because the File menu of a major office package has changed into a logo. That kid was taking &lt;bleep&gt; from a toaster.</p>
<p>It is amusing/frustrating/surprising to see how many of his examples are real, with my favourite being doors. For instance in fancy-pants kitchens in these here parts often have no handles, you just open them&#8230; but how do you know which side of the door to pull? Why do many push doors have handles &#8212; you pull a handle, push a plate.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d recommend it. Some of his other books are interesting, too.</p>

		<p>&quot;catastrophic failures&quot;</p>
<p>I would like to know, how you garentee the state of the program in case of a catastrophic failure? This tells me, instead of finding the root cause of the problem your simply turning a easy to find bug into a impossible to find bug.</p>
<p>A catastrphic failure to me is defined as a NULL pointer, or deferencing a null pointer or memory access vialation. There is no possible way to recover from these states, you have to quit the program and restart. By continuing you assume that the world is a good place and the damage is local when you have no idea how much damage has been done.</p>
<p>The other problem is, any routine that does anything useful and also takes into all the possible situation where it would be used incorrectly. Is the main reason why so much software turns into complex mess.</p>
<p>I think you will tell me next that every routine should check if new or delete failed and then take action in case new failed?</p>

		<p>&quot;how you garentee the state of the program in case of a catastrophic failure?&quot;</p>
<p>That is why catching access violations are not a good idea.</p>

		<p>I just love that type of mistakes. &nbsp;I set a thread window hook in a DLL at initialization but forgot to remove it at destruction. &nbsp;But it never crashed until a year later, when in a new patch we started getting sporadic crashes when shutting down the application.</p>
<p>It turned out that the new patch fixed a bug where the application was leaking a reference to the DLL. &nbsp;The DLL was then getting unloaded, exposing the underlying bug and crashing when the hook was called.</p>
<p>In this case, the &quot;safety systems&quot; are actually themselves bugs.</p>
