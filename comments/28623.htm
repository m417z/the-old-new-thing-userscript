		<p>Now that&#8217;s bad-memory lane, I tripped over this problem several times. In the Win98 era before VerQueryValue was fixed, there used to be a KB article about the problem. I never knew what the core problem was, though. At the time, there must not have been a lot of Unicode resources on files.</p>

		<p>No resource compiler today could get away with writing a byte count because VerQueryValueW returns this count directly in its puLen parameter. puLen is &#8212; you guessed it &#8212; documented as *character* count, and has been for at least a decade.</p>

		<p>If you try to call GetFileVersionInfo for UPX-compressed executable, it will cause a crash in krnl386.exe under Windows 98 (the bug is corrected in Windows XP). So, if you want your application to work under all versions of Windows, you may want to parse the resources yourself without relying on (those buggy) Win 32 API functions.</p>

<p>Sorry you&#8217;re right, it&#8217;s the program that has to do the copying. &nbsp;VerQueryValueW tells the program how many characters to copy.</p>
<p>Does VerQueryValueW figure out the correct number of characters even when cbData isn&#8217;t a byte count? &nbsp;(OK, I should experiment instead of asking. &nbsp;So far I&#8217;ve only needed this on Windows CE where it works well enough. &nbsp;VerQueryValueW reports the correct number of characters there (after the .rc file has been hand edited). &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t look at the cbData field in the binary.)</p>

		<p>&gt; But wait, there&#8217;s more. Somebody who calls the</p>
<p>&gt; VerQueryValueA function expects to have the</p>
<p>&gt; version string returned as ANSI, so</p>
<p>&gt; VerQueryValueA needs to know how many</p>
<p>&gt; characters to convert from Unicode to ANSI.</p>
<p>&gt; If VerQueryValue trusted the erroneous cbData</p>
<p>&gt; value, then ANSI callers would get only half</p>
<p>&gt; the data they were expecting.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s more.</p>

		<p>Are arbitrary binary data allowed in string fields? How can a null<br />
terminated string have embedded nulls? A terminating NIL char could<br />
have been used to terminate the string instead of a byte count integer.</p>

		<p>&gt; You can see embedded NULs in the 16-bit</p>
<p>&gt; version resources a few days ago.</p>
<p>The ones I noticed were intended to be terminators. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t notice any that weren&#8217;t intended to be terminators.</p>
<p>Since ordinary string resources don&#8217;t automatically get NUL terminators appended, programmers have to code the terminators themselves[*], and some programmers didn&#8217;t notice that version string resources are different. &nbsp;Some of those programmers produced some versions of Visual C++, so a lot of executables have redundant NUL terminators. &nbsp;I never complained about this very minor bug, a very slight waste of memory with no other consequences. &nbsp;Had I been involved, I would have given priority to fixing more serious bugs than to this one. &nbsp;Though I don&#8217;t have any complaint about its having been fixed either.</p>
<p>Anyway, do you know of cases where NULs were intended to be embedded rather than intended to be terminators?</p>
<p>Putting binary data in fields that are labelled as non-binary sometimes causes bugs. &nbsp;For example BSTRs sometimes get converted to ANSI without the programmer noticing because the programmer&#8217;s code page is different from the customer&#8217;s code page.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve used strings with embedded</p>
<p>  nulls.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes and no. &nbsp;I coded stuff using string syntax with embedded nulls in RCDATA resources, i.e. binary resources. &nbsp;I did not do so in STRING resources.</p>
<p>In a setting having nothing to do with resources, my discovery that sometimes BSTRs get converted to ANSI did come the hard way, but I luckily discovered it before the product shipped and I&#8217;ve never repeated that mistake. &nbsp;I learned belatedly that the MSDN section that I had read included an invisible restriction (visible in some other pages that I belatedly discovered) so it didn&#8217;t apply to the particular code I had written.</p>
