		<p>Just last week, I was helping someone debug a problem that was aggravated by COMDAT folding.  The software had a test that purposely mutates a function at runtime.  Because of cool optimizations, the target function was COMDAT-folded into another function that never should have been mutated.  It took a while to figure out what was actually happening.</p>
<p>Interestingly, COMDAT folding, while an important optimization, leads to C++ standard violations which requires function to have unique identities.  (You should be able to take the pointer of a function and know that it won&#8217;t match any pointer to another function, even if that other function is byte-for-byte identical.)</p>

		<p>While true (which is why it is disabled it you compile with strict standards compliance from what I remember), self modifying code is a maintenance nightmare in any case. I&#8217;ve yet to come across a situation where there wasn&#8217;t a better solution available (except for some rare performance optimisations that is)</p>

		<p>One stupid thing DDK/WDK (and maybe VC) was doing was enabling ICF in the debug build.</p>
