		<p>I was at a conference in Vegas just last week (the SHOT Show in my case). &nbsp;My car didn&#39;t go anywhere the whole time I was there, despite the fact that my hotel was a mile and a half from the convention center. &nbsp;I walked or took the Las Vegas Monorail everywhere I wanted to go.</p>

		<p>Or buy the bike and a good lock. &nbsp; Lock it up somewhere and come back next year to see if it&#39;s still there. &nbsp; </p>
<p>Perhaps you discreetly hide the key to the lock somewhere and let friends know about it so they can borrow the bike when they arrive in Vegas.</p>

		<p>Reading a longer Google translation like this may be easier than reading just a sentence or two. I deduced that &quot;date&quot; meant the convention, for example, whereas that would have stumped me in a shorter excerpt. And once I came across &quot;here are as good as all the city&#39;s hotels&quot;, I thought &quot;Some of these idioms sound like Swedish. I should try translating it to Swedish instead of English.&quot; Oddly enough, &quot;Ja, richtig&quot; becomes &quot;Yeah, right&quot; in both Swedish and English.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>The idiom &quot;as good as&quot; meaning &quot;for all practical purposes&quot; also exists in English. &quot;The game is as good as over.&quot; = &quot;The outcome of the game is certain.&quot; But it so happens that &quot;all&quot; is not one of the adjectives it can be applied to. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>As a European, I find the story highly amusing and fully share my fellow continental inhabitant&#39;s bemusement. The story has a nice build up in that you expect some amazing conclusion after his quest to get and ride a plain old bike, but there isn&#39;t any: you can bike around Las Vegas just fine, people just think you&#39;re weird for doing it.</p>

		<p>Based on the fact that the title has only one word that&#39;s not English, and the US popular culture puns (&quot;Uneasy Rider&quot;, &quot;Fear and Cycling in Las Vegas&quot;), I was a bit surprised that the article wasn&#39;t written in English.</p>
<p>Do the cultural references &quot;easy rider&quot; (US slang or a movie title, &quot;Easy Rider&quot;) or &quot;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&quot; (a book, later made into a book) have any sort of currency in Germany? Or is heise targetted at a demographic that is familiar with American culture?</p>
<p>I certainly can&#39;t imagine an article in an American magazine with puns on any German movie titles (aside from &quot;Das Boot&quot;).</p>

		<p>Gabe, yes, typical readers of c&#39;t will be well versed in English, as it is a computer magazine.</p>
<p>English, and incorporating English words in German texts, is generally considered modern and well-sounding in Germany. In this particular case, the pun is not too far fetched, I consider it to be pretty usual.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t get the hate for cycling as transportation. For me, it&#39;s a good compromise between a car and public transit/walking everywhere. I love my bike. Half hour walks to shops take maybe 10 minutes. Good exercise.</p>

		<p>I am not surprised at the concierge reaction. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;where is the taxi stand&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;where are you going&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;freemont street&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;why would you want to go there?!&quot; &nbsp;Then he stares at me for 20 or so seconds</p>
<p>&quot;Dont know? &nbsp;To see the lights?&#8230;&quot; &nbsp;me realizing he was serious</p>
<p>&quot;It is over there&quot; after 20 more seconds of thought and he points the correct direction</p>
<p>*IF* it is in the hotel the concierge is brilliant. &nbsp;Outside they will try to steer you back into the hotel. &nbsp;Its their real job. &nbsp;Once you realize this the story makes more sense of him trying to rent something more expensive to the guy.</p>
<p>Also on my last trip they had &#39;rent-a-bike&#39; stations all up and down the main drag. &nbsp;Course that may have changed by now&#8230;</p>
<p>Biking in vegas would be brilliant its super flat. &nbsp;But like he quickly found out, no where to lock things up. &nbsp;That would change if more people did it. &nbsp;But think about what sort of people they want to attract. &nbsp;They do not want the hipster with his single speed bike who has 20 dollars. &nbsp;They want the guy who has to roll up in a fleet of limos&#8230; &nbsp;Bikes racks do not convey the vegas image of opulence. </p>

		<p>@Chipsa, I really hate folding bikes for longer travels. Their wheels are just too short. Also they are not exactly &quot;small&quot; even folded, which might be a problem in a crowded environment.</p>
<p>I am living in a german region where almost all students are using bikes. It gets to the point where car drivers are the minority.</p>
<p>But obviously this depends a lot on the climate and the region. I never tried biking while living in Aachen with a 15% incline at my doorstep.</p>

		<p>Very amusing story, thanks for posting it. Your German translation is also quite good!</p>
<p>I would maybe translate the expression &quot;Logisch ist anders&quot; as &quot;It&#39;s not very logical&quot; &#8211; it expresses a thought that goes along the lines of &quot;logical things would probably be different from what I&#39;m seeing here.&quot; At least it does in Dutch, and I&#39;m assuming the idiom in German to be identical.</p>

		<p>The cycling experience is very different in different cities, naturally. &nbsp;One of the bigger determinants of bike-friendliness is the era in which the town matured. &nbsp;Cities that grew up before the ascension of the automobile tend to be a bit friendlier to bikes than ones which came along later. &nbsp;(You may feel this is a gross generalization. &nbsp;You would be correct.)</p>

		<p>Gabe &#8211; yes, &#39;Easy Rider&#39; and &#39;Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas&#39; are pretty well known amongst Germans, not only among Heise&#39;s audience (as example, try searching for either title on spiegel.de, one of the most popular german news sites).</p>

		<p>In the US, I suspect people who rent bicycles are either &quot;avid&quot; cyclists or people going for a short ride (like at a beach resort). I doubt there are many visitors to Las Vegas who are interested rentals for short-rides. That is, I suspect that the only people who would be interested in renting bikes in Las Vegas are going to be &quot;avid&quot; cyclists, which would mean they wouldn&#39;t be interested in the cheap sort of bike he&#39;s interested in renting.</p>
<p>Janssen appears to think that $150 per week is too much money. That does seem a bit high (I&#39;ve rented good-quality road bikes in San Diego for about $100 per week).</p>
<p>What does renting a bike in German cities cost? (I tried to look but wasn&#39;t successful). I suspect that most visitors to German cities don&#39;t consider renting bikes (just like visitors to Las Vegas). Is it practical at all to rent bicycles in German cities (I have no idea)?</p>
<p>As a few people have mentioned, the typical visitor to Las Vegas isn&#39;t going to be cycling from casino-to-casino. It might not be a good business idea to provide cheap bicycle rentals to the rare German who wants to rent one.</p>
<p>(A bike share program, like the one in NYC, might work for him if he was only doing a couple of trips per-day. Otherwise, it would be expensive. And I doubt that there would be many takers of such a service in Las Vegas.)</p>

		<p>Are you allowed to ride your bike on the sidewalk in Vegas? The local cops in this part of the US say you aren&#39;t allowed to do that (you are to either ride on the Bike path if there is one or share the road, that being said I have yet to see them show me the ordinance). Not that anyone would hassle you about it (who uses sidewalks?).</p>

		<p>I&#39;m a couple days behind as I was out of town, but I actually live in Las Vegas and ride my bike all over the place (and when I&#39;m feeling lazy for the ride home I often use the bus as they all have bike racks). &nbsp;I&#39;m glad the guy riding the article figured it out as for the most part it really isn&#39;t a problem. &nbsp;There are a couple places (generally in the vicinity of Las Vegas Boulevard) where there is no sidewalk, median or lights or that just have a ton of cars and weird traffic patterns that I really don&#39;t like at all, but for the most part you can ride on the sidewalk and really the ride on the street isn&#39;t that bad. &nbsp;Henderson actually has a lot of real bike paths and depending on where you are at (mostly newer areas) there are quite often at least painted bike lanes. &nbsp;The RTC website even tells you where these things are. &nbsp;</p>
<p>For parking, most of the casinos have bike racks because they tend to have low paid employees who can&#39;t afford a car. &nbsp;The trick is finding where they are (I know of at least two at Mandalay Bay but they are not obvious at all). &nbsp;For places that don&#39;t have a bike rack I&#39;ve found that the poles for handicap parking signs make excellent lockup points. &nbsp;It is very rare that your bike attached to a handicapped pole would be in the way of a handicapped person getting in or out of their car and/or trying to get on the sidewalk and I&#39;ve never been scolded for using them. &nbsp;Oddly enough the LVH is one of the few places where I haven&#39;t found a bike rack or a handicapped pole so I just end up locking the bike unattached to anything. &nbsp;I don&#39;t go there that often though so I&#39;m sure I could find something if I looked harder.</p>
<p>As far as the police go, in 4.5 years of riding I&#39;v been pulled over 3 times, all within a mile of my house. &nbsp;Two of them they legitimately pulled me over because I was being a little loose with the traffic laws and they told me not to do that. &nbsp;The other time he said the official reason he pulled me over was for being on the sidewalk (which seems to be in some sort of quasi-legal status) but he actually pulled me over because there had been burglaries or something nearby recently and they were using bicycles as &quot;getaway cars&quot;. &nbsp;I was not happy about that one. &nbsp;I did get the sense that most of the people they see riding bicycles in Las Vegas they expect have something on their record that prevents them from driving and/or they can&#39;t afford a car rather than something they actually do by choice.</p>

		<p>Raymond, thanks a lot for translating the article from German. &nbsp;Of all thing things that I expected to see on Old New thing, an article on transportation-biking is not one of them. &nbsp;I happen to frequent many bike-related websites and blogs and I never expected to see much crossover in content : ) &nbsp;I live in the US (specifically: northeastern US) and would love the flat terrain of Las Vegas. &nbsp;Up here, it really is uphill both ways, and in the winter, it gets damn cold. &nbsp;Winter over there probably is shorts weather as far as I&#39;m concerned. &nbsp;I also commute by bike 5 days a week. &nbsp;I&#39;m the only one in my area to bike through the winter, but in the nearby cities, there&#39;s a growing winter-bike community.</p>
<p>Sidewalk riding may or may not be allowed, depedning upon where you live. &nbsp;In my state, sidewalk riding is OK outside downtown areas. &nbsp;Not that anyone strictly follows that law, nor is it enforced too my knowledge. &nbsp;But them&#39;s the written rules. &nbsp;I don&#39;t ride in the sidewalk much myself. &nbsp;I stick to the streets and basically follow all of the traffic laws (probably better than most motorists around me).</p>

		<p>In defense of America:</p>
<p>* Las Vegas does not epitomize the United States.</p>
<p>* The population density of the continental United States (98 people / square mile) is nearly half that of Europe (188 people / square mile). This makes cars more practical than other transportation in most cases, regardless of the level of infrastructure.

		<p>@Mashmagar: Population density of the whole country is a pretty useless metric to apply though. Most of the car travel (especially in the US I&#39;d say) isn&#39;t across the country but across distances that are easily doable by bike. Heck I&#39;ve seen people drive 5 minutes to the *gym* in a car in the US and I had to explain why I found that hilarious to them. This article being the perfect example of this.</p>
<p>Now obviously in such a large country as the US there are lots of people who don&#39;t fit the stereotype (I know people who are WAY more sporty than I ever will be or was!) but in general I think it&#39;s fair to say that the US isn&#39;t an especially bike-loving country.</p>

		<p>@davep: I did a qucik search for berlin and found a 12 euro / day offer. </p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.rentabike-berlin.de/fahrradverleih_berlin.aspx">http://www.rentabike-berlin.de/fahrradverleih_berlin.aspx</a></p>
<p>I am living not in Berlin, so I cannot tell how much the Bikes are used.</p>
<p>I visited Paris last year and they have a very extensive &quot;rent a bike&quot; System called Velo. I did not use it, because they Bikes are sturdy and slow as hell.</p>

		<p>But isn&#39;t it annoying when bicycles sneak up on you while you&#39;re merrily walking on the sidewalk, then clear you by about six inches? The same goes for segways.</p>

		<p>@ChristianSauer:</p>
<p>Cool. That&#39;s $16 per day (it drops to $11 per day for 3 days). The $150 (which I think is a bit high) for a &quot;fancy&quot; road bike is $21 per day. (I&#39;ve found rentals in Las Vegas that are less than $150.)</p>
<p>Many local people living in Berlin ride bicycles (if it&#39;s like other German cities). No one lives in the area of Las Vegas where the conferences are held (people are either just working there or are tourists). It might make sense to have a business renting bicycles in Berlin. I doubt it makes much sense to rent bicycles in Las Vegas for tourists to travel between casinos. That is, it&#39;s odd to expect that Las Vegas (it&#39;s pretty unique) would be like Berlin (which might be somewhat like NYC).</p>
<p>NYC has a &quot;rent a bike&quot; (also called &quot;bike share&quot;) program called &quot;citibike&quot; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://citibikenyc.com/pricing">http://citibikenyc.com/pricing</a>).</p>
<p>The cost of that is $10 per day but the trip lengths are limited to 1/2 hour each (you get charged increasingly more for every 1/2 hour beyond the first).</p>

		<p>Davep, thanks for the tip. &nbsp;I have been going through the ONT archives (slowly) and had come across the &quot;I drive a car the way most people use computers&quot; posts, but nothing about biking. &nbsp;I&#39;ll search the archived posts for that.</p>

		<p>I would not expect there to be a lot of bike theft in a place without much biking. Bikes aren&#39;t valued enough there to sell clandestinely&#8230; and it wouldn&#39;t be worth it for a thief due to being rare. So I would expect even a minimal security precaution would solve the security issue&#8230;. Bring a frame lock over from Germany! (then park anywhere you want)</p>

		<p>There are great possibilities for CSI episode here. </p>
<p>The forensic team discover a dead European with tyre marks all over his body beside a bicycle on the side of a sreet. </p>
<p>But they still can&#39;t figure out how he died because the idea of cycling in Las Vegas is so damn unthinkable. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>I&#39;m European, and my family lived in San Jose (California) in the early 1980&#39;s for a while. My mother was regularly stopped by the police when out walking (walking!) with my baby brother. Questions included: Why was she walking, where was she going, why didn&#39;t she drive, didn&#39;t she have a car, etc. They thought she was nuts. Nothing much has changed, evidently.</p>

		<p>I may be from the land that invented queueing but waiting for an hour in a queue just to get into an overpriced cab that subsequently gets stuck in traffic isn&#39;t how you play.</p>
