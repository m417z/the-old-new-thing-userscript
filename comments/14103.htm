		<p>My father has a number of little affectations which were quite confusing for me growing up; he would refer to the temperature of an oven as its &#8216;speed&#8217;. I was a teenager before I realised that it was just my dad who used this term and that everyone else would get confused if I talked about &#8216;the oven needs to be on a speed of 200&#176;&#8217;.</p>
<p>We also in my family had the word &#8216;sillies&#8217; for pre-dinner snacks (crisps, nuts etc.)&#8230;</p>

		<p>I was well into adulthood before I realised that &#8220;misled&#8221; is not the past participle of the verb &#8220;to misle&#8221;. I still unconsciously see it that way when I see it that way in print.</p>

		<p>When we visited my parents, who lived 6 hours away, my son would see this awesome park near their house and ask if we could go there, and we&#8217;d always say &quot;maybe next time&quot; (we usually only visited in late fall for thanksgiving/xmas), eventually that just morphed into can we go to the &quot;next time park?&quot;</p>

		<p>The first time I heard the word &quot;condone,&quot; the speaker actually meant &quot;condemn.&quot; I had the meaning backwards for years.</p>
<p>I do have many other examples, because the majority of my vocabulary is from reading. While definition mistakes were not unheard of, pronunciation mistakes were all too common.</p>
<p>To this day there are words that I only write and do not speak.</p>

		<p>My parents used the word &quot;thongs&quot; to refer to the footwear now called &quot;flip-flops.&quot; &quot;Thongs&quot; isn&#8217;t wrong, just not in common usage anymore, as &quot;thong&quot; now means a different kind of clothing. But I still say &quot;thongs&quot; just to see people&#8217;s reactions.</p>

		<p>Kinda related. &nbsp;For years I never understood the old joke &#8216;How do you get down off an elephant&#8217;, but dutifully laughed anyway. &nbsp;It was not until I was an adult that someone pointed out the pun, and I was totally embarrassed.</p>
<p>Until a couple of years later I was watching Johnny Carson interviewing a college professor who had written a book about humor. He mentioned one kind humor where the hook is that the answer has no relation to the question. &nbsp;He used as his example &#8216;How do you get down off an elephant&#8230;You don&#8217;t, you climb down off a duck!&quot; &nbsp; University professor, studied humor and wrote a book about it, and he didn&#8217;t get the joke!</p>

		<p>James: the correct pronunciation of &quot;array&quot; eluded me for quite awhile. Worse, when I was told my pronunciation was wrong (AIR-ay), I thought it was simply a matter of taste. (One knows everything at age 16.) I envy people growing up in an age where collections are the norm, not chunks of memory.</p>

		<p>bemused does not mean to be mildly amused, rather &quot;to &nbsp;cause &nbsp;to &nbsp;be &nbsp;bewildered&quot;.</p>
<p>I learned that relatively recently.</p>
<p>For the truly embarrassing, when I was about seven or eight, I thought rape meant to attack voraciously. One Sunday dinner, we had chicken and I said &quot;I&#8217;m going to rape this chicken.&quot; Needless to say my mom wasn&#8217;t happy, especially given our religious guests at the table.</p>

		<p>@James</p>
<p>I can understand that. &nbsp;One word in particular that I pronounced wrong for ages was &quot;melee&quot;. &nbsp;I always said it as &quot;mee-lee&quot;. &nbsp;Even after I found out that was incorrect I continued to say it that way because I thought it sounded better (as you may have noticed, my small crusade to change the way it&#8217;s pronounced ended in failure).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve gotten over the habit of saying &quot;mee-lee&quot;, but I still think it sounds better.</p>

		<p>@Nick: Melee is a problem for a lot of my friends. The downside to playing role-playing games: You&#8217;re exposed to a lot of archaic words that are rarely heard aloud, then you pronounce them hilariously wrong until someone points out the correct pronunciation. Another one I encountered:</p>
<p>Amulet -&gt; Om-you-let</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s ignoring the secondary issue of made-up words that everyone finds their own way to pronounce and no one ever agrees due to the absence of an authoritative source. I get that one two fronts, both RPGs and random web neologisms. My ears still grate when someone pronounces &quot;Wiki&quot; as &quot;Weekee&quot;. I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s the correct pronunciation in the source language, when you&#8217;re talking about web technologies, it&#8217;s just annoying.</p>

<p>Those mean the same thing (aweful is made up though.) &nbsp;The opposite word you&#8217;re thinking of is &quot;awful.&quot;</p>

		<p>Speaking of getting &quot;rape&quot; wrong&#8230;</p>
<p>This is kind of a backwards instance of this problem. At Caltech (at least when I was there) &quot;rape&quot; was used to mean &quot;screwed over&quot; in a mild general sense, rather than just the literal violent one. E.g. &quot;Oh man, your prof assigned homework over the holiday? What a rape!&quot;.</p>
<p>It took me years to break myself of that habit.</p>

		<p>My first semester of graduate school I learned the word &quot;posterity&quot;. &nbsp;Up until then, I always said and wrote prosperity, assuming that &quot;for posterity&quot; was just a phrase people said that didn&#8217;t really make sense if you thought about it too hard.</p>
<p>And @Josh: &nbsp;Great observation, and too true.</p>

		<p>French being my mother tongue and living in the US, an English speaking country, more than once has it happened that I learn that some word I thought was English is actually a borrowed French word. The pronunciation was just so completely different, I just never put two and two together.</p>
<p>For instance, I would sometime hear the word &quot;new-sense&quot;, like in &quot;I don&#8217;t want to be a new-sense.&quot; And I never gathered the courage to ask what that word was or meant, I just figured it meant something like &quot;fly in the ointment&quot; or some such.</p>
<p>Until DECADES later, in the middle of someone&#8217;s sentence, I finally clicked (in my head): &quot;OOOOH! &#8216;NUISANCE&#8217;!!!!!&quot;</p>
<p>Subsequently, a hardly explainable explosion of laughter on my part and people asking me if I&#8217;m all right because it&#8217;s not like what they just said was particularly funny. &quot;Yes, yes, I&#8217;m fine. Never mind me. I&#8217;m just&#8230; Prffffft. No, really, I&#8217;m fine. Mmmprrfrffttt. It&#8217;s just&#8230; Er&#8230; Whew&#8230; Please, go on. What were you saying?&quot;</p>
<p>Honestly, if you&#8217;re just talking in front of me and I suddenly start laughing. Don&#8217;t take it defensively. It&#8217;s not you, it&#8217;s me. (Laughing at myself, believe me.)</p>
<p>p.s. I can&#8217;t really spell it phonetically but it&#8217;s like &quot;Nu-ee-zanh-ss&quot;. In any case, the two pronunciations are a universe apart.</p>

		<p>Stephen: I had the same problem. Particularly with the word &quot;array&quot; which, if you&#8217;ve only read it and never heard it, you have *absolutely no idea* how to pronounce. (Or at least I didn&#8217;t.)</p>
<p>There were actually a whole bunch of words I said wrong, due to being a bookworm, but &quot;array&quot; is the only one I still remember.</p>

		<p>A colleague of mine told me this one.</p>
<p>He is American with Italian roots. &nbsp;When he was a kid, his grandma used to say &quot;disgrazia&quot; whenever he did something. &nbsp;He was sure it meant &quot;cute&quot; for many years :)</p>
<p>Of course it means &quot;disgrace&quot;</p>

		<p>I thought for a long time there was only one awe*** word, while there are awesome and aweful which made understanding a bit hard since they mean almost the opposite.</p>

		<p>I used to mispronounce &#8216;boolean&#8217; as boo-Lean. Purely because, at the point when I learnt about it (when I was a kid) I had never heard anyone else actually say it.</p>
<p>Not until I was taught about circuits and and boolean algebra did I realise my mistake</p>

		<p>I think there a lot of words I knew from reading books, but hadn&#8217;t heard how they were pronounced, hence, when I heard them, I thought it was a different word.</p>
<p>Like awry&#8230; I thought was pronounced &quot;orry&quot; and that hearing &quot;a rye&quot; well, that&#8217;s a different word.</p>
<p>I knew how to say and read Kansas, which I thought extended to Arkansas&#8230; very different, actually. And reading cowboy comic books, I thought Texarkansas followed the pronunciation of Kansas as well.</p>
<p>The example that fits the blog post the best might be flammable and what I thought was the opposite, inflammable. I thought that for a very long time.</p>

		<p>Not 100% related. </p>
<p>English is my second language (and I still cannot master it&#8230;) I learned it when I went to school in Hong Kong, when it was a colony of Britain. I guess they taught us British English. One of the word I learned was &#8220;anguish&#8221;.</p>
<p>Later, I attended university in Toronto. But I never heard &#8220;anguish&#8221; in Toronto. I wonder if Americans use this word or not.</p>
<p>One time, when I wanted to borrow an eraser, I asked my classmate, &#8220;Can I borrow your rubber?&#8221; And she gave me a weird look. It took me &nbsp;some time to figure it out. </p>
<p>And when I referred the &#8220;elevator&#8221; as the &#8220;lift&#8221;, no one understood me.</p>
<p>Let me tell you how difficult for a Chinese to learn English. As a lousy analogy, chinese is Python and English is the assembly language. In chinese, there are no tenses, no subordinate clauses, no prepositions. The grammar is much simpler in chinese. For me, learning English is like a python programmer learning assembly language. Well, maybe I am biased. </p>
<div class=post>[<i>Chinese makes up for the lack of tenses with the very subtle way tense information is conveyed by other means, like the inscrutable rules surrounding the particle 了. (And then there are the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Chinese_classifiers" rel="nofollow">dozens of different noun genders</a>&#8230;) Oh, and Chinese does have subordinate clauses; you just don&#8217;t realize it because you never learned them formally. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Is &quot;banzai&quot;(萬歲)Japanese? I always thing it&#8217;s a Chinese word that&#8217;s literally equal to &quot;Hurray!&quot; in English.</p>
<p>This word has 3 usage that I know. You now know one of them, the second is what you&#8217;d name the Emperor of current dynasty. (There&#8217;re also names like &quot;九千歲&quot; (nine thousand years) and &quot;千歲&quot; (thousand years) for close relatives of him.</p>
<p>For the third one, I&#8217;m not sure whether it&#8217;s local usage in Hong Kong or not, means &quot;I&#8217;ll pay for all the expense of the party/dinner&quot;. The reason? You&#8217;ve probably guessed it right &#8211; The sound come out when someone declaring this.</p>
<p>On a related note, there&#8217;s one small bell in bars that we named &quot;萬歲鐘&quot;. Be sure not to hit it unless you have lots of money and can&#8217;t find a better way to spend it. (Related to the third meaning I explained)</p>

		<p>@sumdumgai: Hehe, I went to school in Hong Kong too for a while in that period, and I thought the exact opposite. Chinese was hard compared to English (which is a second language to me, as my primary language is Dutch).</p>
<p>Melee -&gt; we always say &#8216;muhlee&#8217; (maybe a bit of a Dutchism there), but I guess the correct way is meh-lay?</p>
<p>Why would &#8216;cache&#8217; be pronounced &#8216;cash-ay&#8217;? It almost like people saying &#8216;Portia&#8217; when the mean a Porsche (then again I noticed in South Africa that a lot of kids think words ending in &#8216;er&#8217; end in an &#8216;a&#8217; and in other places it&#8217;s just the other way around: &#8216;Cucumber&#8217; -&gt; &#8216;Cucumba&#8217;, and &#8216;Banana&#8217; -&gt; &#8216;Banan-urr&#8217;</p>

		<p>Vivid was my one I got completely the opposite meaning to this word because people say they had a &quot;vivid dream&quot; a lot. Was about 20 before I realised this because it&#8217;s not something you would be corrected on easily.</p>
<p>Also thought it was normal to have a tiny hole in the roof of your mouth until I was about the same age</p>

		<p>When my nephew was 12 he was dismayed that he hadn&#8217;t &quot;started poverty&quot; yet.</p>
<p>I had a friend that pronounced cache like &quot;cake&quot;. I had no idea what he was talking about for the longest until I said &quot;ahhh! cash!&quot;</p>
<p>When I was little, I had a poster on a wall with a little boy offering an umbrella to a girl in the rain that said &quot;A little courtesy goes a long way.&quot; I knew I had an Uncle Curtis, so I figured that courtesy was the boys name, and had no idea why giving someone an umbrella would make him travel a long distance.</p>

		<p>A friend of mine was on a business trip to Europe, and during the meeting he would answer &quot;piece of cake&quot; to their questions about the product&#8217;s technical abilities.</p>
<p>After a few minutes, the confused Europeans asked him &quot;Are you hungry. Do you require food to continue?&quot; He spent the next few awkward moments explaining American colloquialisms to a bewildered audience who thought he was demanding pastries in exchange for work.</p>

		<p>Is it just me, or are people making a whole lot of spelling (and other) mistakes? If so, then this is truly a self-demonstrating article (and of Muphry&#8217;s Law in action also)&#8230;</p>
<p>Asians will pronounce Wiki as wick-y. Mostly. How else would you pronounce it?</p>
<p>As for cache, well, how would you pronounce cachet? Hence the slight confusion.</p>
<p>And of course, something that affects your behaviour obviously had an effect on your behaviour.</p>
<p>Mind you, for the longest time I never did put together the fact that most people pronounced harangue like they would meringue. I always pronounced it ha-runge.</p>

		<p>I read an article on MSNBC (can&#8217;t find it now) about Anne Jarvis (founder of Mother&#8217;s Day), which suggested that she lobbied hard for the rendering &quot;Mother&#8217;s Day&quot;, as opposed to &quot;Mothers&#8217; Day&quot;, in order to emphasize the idea that it&#8217;s explictly *not* about celebrating all mothers, but about individual families celebrating the mother within the family. </p>
<p>You general point (as espoused in the target of your link) is still valid (since technically what you&#8217;re doing is helping your kids celebrate their mother), but technically, the day does not &quot;honor all mothers.&quot;</p>
<p>&lt;/nitpicking&gt;</p>

		<p>This whole thing would be a lot easier if words were just spelled how they sound. Why we have all these complicated rules and special cases is beyond me, and English is my native language. I guess it has to do with backwards compatibility.</p>

		<p>My grandmother never drank the last bit of coffee in her cup and when I would ask why, she said she didn&#8217;t like the &quot;drugs&quot; in the bottom. &nbsp;Took years for me to realize that caffeine didn&#8217;t sink and that she meant &#8216;dregs&#8217;.</p>
<p>She would also say that she would do things &quot;the reckly&quot; (&quot;I&#8217;ll make your dinner the reckly&quot;), which I took from evidence to mean &quot;at a time later than now&quot;. &nbsp;What she was really saying was &#8216;directly&#8217; which means exactly the opposite.</p>
<p>I also had a roommate who had a thing for the &quot;mack-a-bray&quot; (macabre).</p>

<p>It&#8217;s because modern English is a hodgepodge of syntax and vocabulary from several other languages, including (but not limited to) Greek, Latin, German, French, and Arabic.</p>
<p>All these competing influences combine and interact to form a language that is wildly inconsistent.</p>

		<p>The only one I remember from my youth is totally misspronouncing &quot;gesture&quot;, however being a parent lets you enjoy your kids errors.</p>
<p>Case 1) We used to buy a brand of salsa that had a garden picture on the front, including a ladybug. My daughter, age 2, would eat it by the spoonfull and called it &quot;bugs&quot; because of the picture. We thought that cute as heck and didn&#8217;t correct her&#8230;. until we took her to a mexican food place and she started shouting for more bugs. The waiter (and surrounding guests) were not amused&#8230;</p>
<p>Case 2) A girl at summer camp told my son (at age 8 or so) that he was sexy. He asked for clarification, and was told it meant he was &quot;hot&quot;. Well, it WAS above 95F that day, so he accepted that as being a temperature-related descriptive, and proudly used the word in that context when I picked him up to drive him home. Upon being aprised of the real meaning of the word (in an age-appropriate way), he turned red as a beet and declared the word &quot;sexy&quot; verboten in our household. I, not being one to stand down from a challenge, ripped a copy of Right Said Fred&#8217;s tune to my MP3 player and played it non-stop as I drove him to camp the next day.</p>

		<p>My wife, who is Japanese, also says &quot;Banzai&quot; or &quot;Banzai shite&quot; when she wants my kids to raise their arms to take shirts off. &nbsp;So &quot;Banzai&quot; certainly is used that way by native Japanese speakers, whether it is proper grammar or not.</p>

<p>That was very hard to read&#8230; not at all logical either. A better language would be Finnish (which is my mother tongue)</p>
<p>Written Finnish is very simple in a phonetic sense. Each letter always sounds the same, no matter where it is positioned in the word. Once you learn the alphabet, you should be able to pronounce any word so that anyone can understand you.</p>
<p>&quot;Ai wud laik tu bai tuu piises ov foor bai foor vuud for mai sans trii haus.&quot;</p>
<p>The simple fact is that you can&#8217;t write &quot;good sounding&quot; English with just the Latin alphabet. We should be using phonetic symbols, such as IPA.</p>

		<p>My worst one was Tucson, AZ. I always thought it was pronounced &quot;tuck-son&quot;. My electronics teacher would tell us of stories from &quot;two-sont&quot; which I thought there was a Toussaint, AZ (as how a French person would spell it).</p>
<p>Took me many years to figure out they were the same place.</p>
