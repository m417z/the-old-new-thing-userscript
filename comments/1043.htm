		<p>While technically doable, I fail to see any real use case of this&#8230;</p>
<p>(Maybe when &quot;extending&quot; an existing V5 application with nice features like TaskDialog without breaking the current look&amp;feel?)</p>
<p>I personally never encountered a situation where this is required&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Daniel &#8212; this is useful when you&#39;ve got a DLL that wants v6 controls loaded into a process that&#39;s using v5 controls. Personally, I&#39;ve never needed it either, but I suspect that Windows Explorer extensions use it all the time (or should do &#8212; I suspect Raymond has some horror stories there, too).</p>

		<p>Does LoadLibraryExW automatically activate the activation context of the new library for the duration of the LoadLibraryExW call? &nbsp;I&#39;m curious because when I was debugging why some iTunes installations corrupted themselves during updating earlier this year, I noticed that it was failing because msvcr90.dll was rejecting its activation context. &nbsp;The EXE had no manifest; it LoadLibrary&#39;d a DLL with a manifest that depended on msvcr90.dll, but msvcr90.dll&#39;s call to FindActCtxSectionStringW during msvcr90.dll&#39;s DllMain(DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) failed.</p>

		<p>I know the linked article says it&#39;s per-window, but this post seems to imply you can have both a V5 and v6 version of the same control in the same window: &nbsp;create one button, activate your context, create a second one, deactivate the context.</p>
<p>Normally I&#39;d test this out but I don&#39;t know anything about activation contexts and don&#39;t have the time this week to do all the research necessary.</p>

		<p>@Rick C: it&#39;s still &quot;per window&quot;: Each button is it&#39;s own window after all. (There&#39;s nothing here to say that CHILD-Windows need to use the same version of the common controls)</p>

		<p>Myria: If the loaded DLL&#39;s manifest is resource ID 2, it gets activated for the duration of the call to DllMain.</p>

		<p>@Myria, I&#39;ve used LoadLibrary with multiple DLLs statically linked to msvcr80.dll with the manifest in the RT_MANIFEST ISOLATIONAWARE_MANIFEST_RESOURCE_ID resource of each DLL from an application without manifests and no use of the activation context API.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know about LoadLibraryEx, but LoadLibrary surely does activate the DLL&#39;s context, so msvcr80&#39;s DllMain doesn&#39;t fail, which is very similar to msvcr90&#39;s DllMain regarding the context check.</p>
<p>Side rant:</p>
<p>The maninfested runtimes were supposed to resolve the DLL hell, where every VC++ version had a msvcrt.dll. &nbsp;However, either the name change or the manifest would suffice. &nbsp;With the introduction and check for the manifest came the manifest hell. &nbsp;I guess this was fashion when comctl32 became side-by-side, but that DLL didn&#39;t change name.</p>
<p>For instance, which version msvcr90.dll are you talking about?</p>
<p>9.0.21022.8</p>
<p>9.0.30729.1</p>
<p>9.0.30729.4137</p>
<p>9.0.30729.4148</p>
<p>9.0.30729.4926</p>
<p>9.0.30729.4940</p>
<p>9.0.30729.4974</p>
<p>I know about redirection, it&#39;s done at system level when installing a newer redistributable package, but it&#39;s one more thing you have to know and worry about if you&#39;re (really) trying to isolate an application. &nbsp;I&#39;m not saying you should isolate every app, but sometimes you must isolate one app or two (e.g. services, particularly distributed ones).</p>
<p>In newer versions, they resolved both the DLL hell and the manifest hell by just having a different name and not requiring or checking for a manifest. &nbsp;Export symbols don&#39;t change between 10.0.x and 10.0.y or 10.0.z (e.g. msvcr110.dll), so not a big deal.</p>

		<p>It was very frustrating the first time I encountered the issue of version 5 of the library loading when I wanted version 6. &nbsp;I can&#39;t think of how this could have been implemented with more complexity and potential to confuse.</p>

		<p>Thank you very much for this post! </p>
<p>Our use case is exactly as Daniel above speculated: We are writing an MSAccess application in corporate environment. An while we cannot change the msaccess.exe.manifest to use CommonControls6, I can now write my own little manifest, switch to it using the ActivationContext API, call maybe the TaskDialog and clean up afterwards. </p>
<p>As the same techniques basically applies to using &quot;registration-free COM&quot;, I will probably be able to call into some additional COM objects without having to write to the registry, which I can&#39;t do as normal user either.</p>
