		<p>Still not very clear with rule, that&#39;s why we need so many lawyers in this country. It&#39;s their profession to argue it out??</p>

		<p>The ump didn&#39;t give the batter much time to get back in the box. I&#39;m not sure the batter was even aware of what was happening. The announcers certainly had no idea.</p>
<p>I coach my son&#39;s teams and there are always a couple of kids who step out of the batter&#39;s box between pitches. I keep telling them that they can&#39;t do that but they don&#39;t listen. My favorite thing is when the kids put their back hand up toward the ump while they get set in the box, just like they see on TV. It doesn&#39;t mean anything when the pros do it (time is not out but the pitcher doesn&#39;t throw a pitch out of professional courtesy). When they do it during batting practice I throw a pitch. Some of them learn and some don&#39;t.</p>

		<p>The umpire might have been right according to the rulebook, but he was being a real jerk. If he didn&#39;t like Catricala giving him grief over the bad strike call (the video isn&#39;t conclusive, but it sure looked like a bad strike call to me), he should have thrown him out at the time Catricala questioned the call instead of when Catricala was obviously cooling off instead of escalating the argument.</p>

		<p>Yep, it seems a little rude to me when a batter puts his hand out toward the ump as he steps in, without actually asking for time (Jeter does this as a habit). &nbsp;It seems like he&#39;s asking the UMPIRE to wait.</p>

		<p>And then there was the day the umpire called a full-swung-at pitch with full follow-through a ball.</p>
<p>That umpire should have been ejected from the game by both teams for gross incompetence.</p>

		<p>Interesting. &nbsp;But I do disagree with your calling the downtime &quot;wasted.&quot; &nbsp;The rhythm and timing of the game is an important part of it. &nbsp;What fun would it be if it were all over in 15 minutes?! &nbsp;If you want almost continuous action, watch soccer or basketball.</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8230; watch soccer&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>Watching an hour-long game that ends in a 0-0 tie? Yeah, that seems exciting.</p>

		<p>@Brian EE &#8211; You need to brush up on your sports. Soccer is a 90-minute game that ends in a nil &#8211; nil tie. That&#39;s much more exciting :)</p>

		<p>@Brian: Action doesn&#39;t necessarily mean scoring. In fact, a lot of action in sports involves stopping scoring (amazing catches in baseball or blocks in most ball-oriented sports).</p>

		<p>@Brian EE: So you define how exciting a game is by how many scores are made? Umn well ok, I assume that&#39;s one &#8211; if completely illogical &#8211; way to do things. </p>
<p>If you go by the slightly more sensible measure of action of &quot;fraction of time something is actually going on and not just people standing around&quot; baseball fares rather badly &#8211; well 10% action to idling ratio still beats american football so it&#39;s not that bad I assume.</p>

		<p>Sadly, the one-thrown-pitch strikeout video is no longer available on YouTube. &nbsp;(Too much traffic from your blog post, is my guess.)</p>

		<p>voo: I&#39;m not sure what the actual action:waiting ratio is for American football, but its advantage over baseball is that it has a clock. There is a limit to how much time a team can waste because not only is there a clock for when the ball is in play, but also a timer for between plays. Furthermore, if the time runs out, there is a fixed amount of time for overtime play (except when a winner must be decided, of course).</p>
<p>Baseball has no clock, nor a fixed number of pitches, so even a single at-bat could last forever if the batter keeps hitting foul balls that don&#39;t get caught. Since there is no concept of a game ending in a draw, a tied game can go on forever.</p>

		<p>Gabe: The WSJ also did a count for how much action there is in a typical NFL game and it came out to.. less than 11 minutes in a 3 hour game (this comes out to about 6% action vs. idling). So baseball despite not having a clock or a fixed number of pitches on average still does better than American Football..</p>
