		<p>I would imagine that the customer could have gotten confused, kd.exe is installed as part of Debugging Tools for Windows in the Windows SDK.<br />
Windbg.exe also supports the -k and -kl options, so that could have an effect on windbg, although to be honest I have never really needed to use the kernel debugger.</p>

		<p>A quick Google reveals WinDbg can, in fact, do kernel debugging.</p>
<p>it&#8217;s like saying you proudly don&#8217;t own a gasoline car, and thus, don&#8217;t pollute the atmosphere. But you drive a gas motorcycle.</p>

		<p>the title is a bit clickbaitish, it doesn&#8217;t relates to __FILE__ macro directly and it but to any string literal viewed under kernel debugger.</p>
<p>non the less, it provides useful anecdote for kernel mode debugging.</p>

		<p>First of all, click bait implies that you would be more tempted to click it due to this title . But since __FILE__ macro implies C style string literals, I don&#8217;t see why it would be any more tempting. In fact, if you weren&#8217;t well versed with the pre-processor, then the title would be more confusing.<br />
Secondly, since the pre-processor replaces __FILE__ with a C style string literal then it is directly related. In fact the customer really noticed this because they were looking at code which took the string literal that came from the __FILE__ macro as a parameter. So either way, it is still directly related.</p>

		<p>yeah, explain :)<br />
I didn&#8217;t know you can unknowingly run LIVE KERNEL DEBUGGING. Opening up a dump file is one thing, but live kernel debugging? Wouldn&#8217;t that interfere with more than just your application? And how do you even run that undistinguishably from user mode debugging? You don&#8217;t choose a process to debug in kernel mode, right? You debug &#8220;the computer&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Yeah, that puzzles me, too! And when you debug a NT installation, don&#8217;t you have to boot with a special flag? And connect another Machine via USB or something? And connect the debugger on that second machine to the debug target, (because it will wait for the debugger to connect)?</p>
<p>How can one do all these things and not be aware of them?</p>

		<p>If you run a program without knowing what it does, or run a program with command line options without knowing what those options do, or run a program that runs another program in a way you weren&#8217;t expecting, you can unknowingly do&#8230; anything the computer lets you do. Including call the kernel debugging APIs.</p>
<p>Yes, running a kernel debugger will interfere with more than just your application. That&#8217;s kind of an inevitable consequence of the fact that it&#8217;s a kernel debugger.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not debugging a &#8220;process&#8221; (or &#8220;task&#8221; or &#8220;thread&#8221;) in kernel-mode debugging, what are you debugging? The kernel may not have a PID (or it may?), but it has a thread (or threads) of execution, each with a stack, a stack pointer, an open file table, a set of memory mapped pages (with TLB entries), a set of synchronisation objects, and pretty much everything else a user-mode process has. If you want to step through &#8220;the computer&#8221;, you&#8217;re stepping through something that looks exactly like a process. And, as you would want to switch between threads in a user-mode debugger, you&#8217;ll want to switch between user-mode and kernel-mode &#8220;processes&#8221; in a kernel-mode debugger. (With others paused, and maybe others running in the background on other CPUs?)</p>
<p>If you didn&#8217;t want that, you shouldn&#8217;t have run a kernel-mode debugger. On the other hand, if you don&#8217;t really know what programs you&#8217;re running, you probably shouldn&#8217;t be running them as Admin, or as any other user with kernel-debugging privileges.</p>
