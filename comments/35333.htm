		<p>Off-topic:<br />
<br />I wonder why programmers tend towards various but mostly predictable hobbies: juggling, martial arts, cartoons, gaming, techy gadgety hacks (okay, that&#8217;s a given), etc.</p>
<p>Juggling in particular seems like a strange correlation.  I learned to juggle when I should&#8217;ve been studying for finals.  And since there were a lot of finals I should&#8217;ve been studying for I learned to juggle pretty well.  ;-)</p>
<p>Any tips from some more accomplished jugglers for someone who does 3 pretty well trying to learn 4?  (Crossing over, not 2 in each hand)</p>

		<p>I guess if you list all hobbies available, then you can say any group chooses predictable (listed) hobbies :-).</p>

		<p>If you want to cross four balls you have to either throw a 5-ball pattern (4 with a hole) or throw them in a shower pattern (a circle).  That&#8217;s the way the math works out.</p>
<p>See examples here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://juggling.org/help/balls/four/" rel="nofollow">http://juggling.org/help/balls/four/</a></p>

		<p>I started juggling last summer. I can do a 5 cascade pretty well now (maxing out at 107 catches, last night actually). It&#8217;s a fantastically fun thing to do. I&#8217;ve discovered that people are pretty unimpressed with you until you can do 5, at that point, they&#8217;ll look at you mildly interested for 3-5 minutes. But I do it for myself, not for them.</p>
<p>Learning new things in juggling is a very incremental process. You have to start on the easier things before you can move to the harder. Don&#8217;t skip steps.</p>
<p>&quot;Crossing over&quot; with 4 balls (assuming you mean like a 3 ball cascade, but with 4) is hard, because it is asymmetrical. Definitely start with 2 in each hand first. Then you can try a synchronous half shower (throw two balls at once to the other hand, one ball going higher than the other ball). And learn a bunch of 3 ball tricks first too. Get your brain prepared for the extra speed of that fourth ball.</p>

		<p>Why do programmers gravitate to juggling?</p>
<p>1. Something to do during those long compiles<br />
<br />back in school, when it&#8217;s too impractical<br />
<br />to get a football or baseball game going.</p>
<p>2. Club passing, particularly with more than<br />
<br />two passers, is like a physical realization of<br />
<br />an elegant 5-line lisp function.</p>
<p>3. Two words: site swaps</p>
<p>4. Trivia question (it&#8217;s not horrible<br />
<br />etiquette to pose one in someone else&#8217;s<br />
<br />comment blog, is it?):</p>
<p>Which well-known juggler has a Knuth book<br />
<br />dedicated to him?  Which Knuth book?</p>

		<p>How could you forget the beloved hobby of music? We OWN that one!!   12 guys in my group, I play sax and about 8 play guitar, one being a music major. How do you like those odds?</p>
