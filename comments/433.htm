		<p>In my 30-year career I&#39;ve worked at three different places. &nbsp;One was a three-person shop, where every project I worked on I was analyst/designer/architect/programmer/QA/documentation/trainer/support, one had 40 employees, and my current company employs about 100 people. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I always find it fascinating to read how large organizations organize themselves. &nbsp;Thank you, Raymond.</p>

		<p>There are many project methodologies plus all the clone ones. But in the end is the personality contest among the Business Owner, Development or engineers and QA. Whoever dominates the corporation dominates the process.</p>

		<p>One other important aspect of Tell Mode is it gives the central shiproom an idea of what sort of things teams are fixing. &nbsp;I.e., if most teams are still fixing very basic bugs in core scenarios, it probably means lock down needs to go on for a bit longer.</p>

		<p>@A: They talk about the build process in &quot;Show Stopper!&quot; Are you thinking of that, maybe?</p>

		<p>I have one issue with &#39;Bug Bar&#39;s</p>
<p>Find a bug early, file it, response is &quot;We&#39;ll fix it later.&quot;</p>
<p>Later: &quot;It doesn&#39;t met the bar.&quot;</p>
<p>So all the little bugs live forever.</p>

		<p>This is off-topic, but I once read a very interesting (and somewhat technical) description of the early Windows NT build process. I have been looking on and off for this site for several years. Does anyone have any ideas? These are *not* the one I&#39;m talking about:</p>

		<p>@John Muller: Technically the bugs won&#39;t live forever. Before they enter Ask mode, they&#39;ll perform tracklog cleanup.</p>
<p>All &quot;feature wish list&quot; that won&#39;t make it will be marked for consideration in future version. All bugs that won&#39;t make it will be marked as &quot;won&#39;t fix&quot; or &quot;by design&quot;, waiting to be filed again when next version is released.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve never worked in a place that had such a formal process so, like Matthew said, it is interesting to hear how it is done. &nbsp;This post reminded me of the fourstones piece:</p>

		<p>@John Muller: in my environment there is no &quot;later&quot;. It is fixed as soon as any higher-priority bugs are fixed, and if it isn&#39;t important enough to go into a particular release, it is merged into the branch for the next one.</p>

		<p>@Boris </p>
<p>You say there is no &quot;later&quot; and then describe a process that makes you fix them &quot;later&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;@John Muller: in my environment there is no &quot;later&quot;. It is fixed as soon as any higher-priority bugs are fixed, and if it isn&#39;t important enough to go into a particular release, it is merged into the branch for the next one.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s pretty rare to have time to fix all bugs. I was in a similar position until the boss retired and the new guy was a sociopath, who decided to &quot;turn the company around&quot;. He did in a way, the cost of everything went up and software quality went down.</p>

		<p>@smf: you didn&#39;t compare my &quot;later&quot; with John Muller&#39;s. He argued that &quot;all the little bugs live forever&quot;, as a result of being filed for later fixing. My point was that they need not stick around indefinitely, if they are fixed as soon as possible in the branch for the next release.</p>
