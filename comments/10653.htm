		<p>The thumbnail in the EXIF data was immediately my first thought as well (though I was unaware of the rule Explorer used for deciding whether or not to use that thumbnail). &nbsp;For once my psychic powers are in line with Raymond&#39;s!</p>

		<p>I occasionally capture screenshots and crop them to share the image with other people. Not that I really have anything to hide, but I wouldn&#39;t want to give unwanted info away in the metadata.</p>

		<p>I used to sell a shareware product that would remove EXIF (and other data) from JPEG files. &nbsp;It fixed this issue.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve since made it freeware and longer update it, but that&#39;s a different matter.</p>

		<p>There&#39;s also the converse problem: an editing program performs an image transformation by modifying only the EXIF, and then another app comes along that fails to honour this. This is what happens if I rotate an image in GNOME/F-Spot, and then copy it onto a memory card for use in my el-cheapo digital picture frame. &nbsp;What a Royal pain.</p>

		<p>This is a perfect example of how formats are being over-engineered to make them more user friendly, at the cost of usability. While I consider automatic thumbnailing in an ordinary system file manager as a big security issue anyway (I remember that about one year ago, even Windows had a security hole), and a user can just use an image viewer that does thumbnailing (which is a big difference, since then he explicitly requests seeing the images, instead of just opening a folder), putting that kind of meta information into a file without somehow trying to enforce its correctness (or trying to make it harder not to support it properly than to support it properly) sounds just plain stupid to me. Bad enough that geolocation data may be put into the meta data of images.</p>
<p>Having this default behavior in the Explorer seems ok to me, but I would expect that there is a way to change it, is there one?</p>

		<p>In Windows XP, thumbnails could be forced to refresh by right clicking and selecting &quot;Refresh thumbnail&quot; from the context menu. In the horrible Vista/7 OSes, thumbnails can no longer be forced to regenerate by right-clicking the image and selecting Refresh thumbnail. Why is this so? Many times the abominable Explorer fails to show a thumbnail at all and would then never generate a thumbnail for that image/video even after clearing the thumbnail cache.</p>

		<p>I have a number of interesting examples that I&#39;ve collected in various places on the web, including one where the main image shows a single person posing against a coloured background but the thumbnail shows a second person behind them and with their arm wrapped around the first person&#39;s waist.</p>

		<p>I would argue that the behavior of the Explorer is needlessly inconsistent. Why it is relying at the embedded icon under some obscure circumstances, but not *always* ? Given that Explorer is able to generated this icons on its own, it would be better to always generate the icons, regardless of icon dimensions, and to replace the EXIF icons in the Explorer view with the self-generated icons as soon as they are available.</p>

		<p>@jader3rd &#8211; if the pixel data and EXIF info disagree, there&#39;s no right answer. &nbsp;Displaying the pixel data as-is will always be the faster choice, though.</p>
<p>Also watch out for edge cases where the rotation sensor on the camera lied (especially happens while shooting up/down) and rotating the image based on the EXIF data will produce incorrect results. &nbsp;Likewise with editing software that rotated the pixel data, but didn&#39;t update the EXIF rotation.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen image editors display an un-rotated thumbnail, only to rotate it correctly when actually opening the image. &nbsp;That can be confusing, too.</p>
<p>In my younger days, I wrote a script to normalize the rotation (and update EXIF) when copying files from my memory card to my hard drive. &nbsp;Between that and fixing mis-rotated images in-camera, I no longer have images of my own that are incorrectly rotated. ;)</p>

		<p>@Skyborne</p>
<p>My experience has been that every device (camera, photo frame, etc) uses the EXIF data. The only two things which rotate the pixels instead of updating a meta data tag are Explorer and Windows Live Photo Gallery. The result is that if you rotate a picture in Explorer the devices can no longer understand the picture. Resulting in your mother complaining to you for weeks about how you broke her camera, preventing her from showing a couple of pictures to her friends.</p>

		<p>@Raymond: [This suggestion makes the assumption that bandwidth is free. -Raymond]</p>
<p>This response is not constructive and make no sense to me; If you want to preserve bandwidth at all cost, you should not displays anything beyond the filename. Also, you do not take into account with this statement that a large amount of photo viewing takes place at home computers, not in the corporate network.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>If you want to consume a reasonable amount of bandwidth, then you use the thumbnail when it is available. Companies often have corporate servers which hold lots of images. Not all JPGs are vacation pictures. (And networking is not the only low-bandwidth channel. Should Explorer read a 15MB image off your CDR just to refine the thumbnail?) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>As in other disputes in this blog here about Explorer: The right answer would be an option to allow the user to toggle if the Explorer will always generate the thumbnail or not.</p>
<p>Also, Raymond: Explorer will generate the previews in Extra Large Icon mode, so it seems that bandwidth saving is not the only answer here.</p>

		<p>&quot;Explorer conserves bandwidth by not trying to refiner thumbnails.&quot;</p>
<p>You have already made that statement, I understand you. But Explorer don&#39;t have to follow that goal, because the use case here for most of the Windows computers is &quot;Home user is viewing his photo collection&quot;., For this use case, it is better to show consistent behavior, and/or allow the user to refresh the thumbnails from the original image, than to &quot;preserve bandwidth&quot;. Or introduce a setting for that (I can also repeat my statements, Raymond.)</p>
<div class="post">[<i>I guess we have different definitions of <span style="text-decoration:underline;">consistent behavior</span>. &quot;How come the pictures on in my Pictures folder display thumbnails one way, but the pictures on my NAS storage display thumbnails a different way?&quot; There are arguments on both sides.

		<p>My favorite image &quot;bug&quot; (which, like most issues discussed here, isn&#39;t a bug at all) is how I had a bunch of images that I had looked corrupted when I moved to Vista &amp; 7. Turns out that the preinstalled photoviewer correctly uses the XResolution paramater in the file, but the program that saved the images didn&#39;t set it correctly.</p>
