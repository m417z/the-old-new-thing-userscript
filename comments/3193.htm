		<p>We use some backup software at work (I&#39;ll leave the name out) that has a foreground component and a background component that runs as a service. &nbsp;Believe it or not, it uses DDE to comunicate between the foreground and the service. &nbsp;I can&#39;t believe that software is still using DDE. &nbsp;BTW, even though I won&#39;t name the product, it is from a very big company that everyone knows.</p>

		<p>Is there a way to tag a process as does not use DDE? Due to certain UI design decisions that I did not make but are a selling point, there are RPC calls in WM_CLOSE.</p>

		<p>Ah, that explains why Visual Studio 2008 behaves differently on Windows 7 than it did on XP when opening files. &nbsp;I usually have several instances running, and I might want to open a file in one or another instance depending on where I wanted to set breakpoints or debug something, and I used to be able to just switch to the instance I wanted, find the file in a file search tool, just open it, and it&#39;d go to the right window.</p>
<p>Now I have to find the file in Explorer (or somewhere else that supports dragging files (i.e., not the file search tool I like)) and drag it to the window. &nbsp;Slightly annoying, because I used to be able to do it entirely with the keyboard. &nbsp;Nice to at least know what happened, because there was no way to do a search to find out more.</p>

		<p>About optimizations.. I suppose if somebody would take say Windows 2000 source and then merge into its code all optimizations made in all subsequent Windows&#39;es but do not merge any additional functionality&#8230; Then finally we would get awesome fast system!</p>

		<p>We still have &nbsp;VB6 code that has on screen fields that then link via DDE to word templates (so the address automatically gets filled in when they open the document). &nbsp; &nbsp;You can&#39;t use DDE in .NET and so we&#39;ve left these applications in VB6. &nbsp; I wonder how many years they&#39;ll stay like that, &nbsp;the applications are already getting on for 20 years old &nbsp;(first written in VB3 I believe). &nbsp; &nbsp;I expect when office goes totally cloud based and breaks things completely the code might finially be re-written in something more modern. &nbsp; </p>

		<p>DDE don&#39;t work well in UAC enabled environment. For normal process it works, but once it &quot;runs as administrator&quot; it won&#39; response to DDE commands.</p>
<p>It happens that I occasionally need to launch debug to my IIS process, so after launching VS as elevated process, double-click on a solution file won&#39;t work.</p>
