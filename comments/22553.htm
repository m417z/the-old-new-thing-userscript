		<p>Hello, Raymond.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been following with interest your posts regarding your visit to my hometown.</p>
<p>I hope you enjoyed your trip to Sintra, truly a wonderful place. About the Rossio train station, it is also particular for its 100-year-old tunnel, linking the railway to the city center. It&#8217;s a great work of engineering for something that old.</p>

		<p>You need to play more Doom! &nbsp;Once you get used to staggering around computer mazes that all seem to look alike, you start to get a nack for navigating.</p>

		<p>Heh, I recently got lost quite foolishly. I needed to be somewhere quite close to Shimo-Kitazawa (Tokyo), a neighbourhood I&#8217;m reasonably familiar with but this was in an area I didn&#8217;t often visit.</p>
<p>My instructions were quite simple: from the station&#8217;s exit, right at the railroad crossing, left at the Lawson (convenience store), second right etc.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, I used the wrong exit, turned right at the railroad crossing on the wrong railroad track (Shimo-Kitazawa is where the Keio Inokashira line and the Odakyu line), and unfortunately there was also a Lawson in that street so I ended up going in completely the wrong direction.</p>
<p>Via a long detour, I ended up at Shin-Daita, a station on the Inokashira line to the west of Shimo-Kitazawa (and I needed to be on the south-east side!) so I decided to take a train back to Shimo-Kitazawa and try again&#8230; I didn&#8217;t really realize how this could&#8217;ve happened until I checked Google maps. :S</p>

		<p>Indeed. &nbsp;IRL, I&#8217;m always getting lost, even in &quot;non-losable&quot; situations like driving home from work. &nbsp;Doom helped quite a bit. &nbsp;Probably that part of the brain that registers ordering of locations, which seems to be my main problem.</p>
