		<p>I also see lots of &quot;minimize to tray&quot; or similar ideas where the minimized application shows up as a notification icon, which is really desirable for a program that must be always running to function but doesn&#39;t need to real-estate that an application would need. First popularized by anti-virus programs.</p>

		<p>I have to agree with Joshua. It&#39;s probably not how the notification area was envisioned, but an extremely common use these days is to keep a discrete indication about resident apps, and this is probably what the customer wanted to do.</p>

		<p>Wait, what if a program wants the /default/ to be &quot;Only show notifications&quot; instead of &quot;Show icon and notifications&quot; but wants to still allow the user to change that if the user disagrees? &nbsp;(Assume here that the program doesn&#39;t want to force itself to be &quot;Only show notifications&quot; when the user has set the default to &quot;Hide icon and notifications&quot; (assuming you can do that &#8212; I don&#39;t have my Win7 box in front of me at the moment.))</p>
<p>Sure, the program could put its /own/ setting in for whether to show up or not, but then, what&#39;s the point of centralizing the pretty Win7 support for it?</p>

<p>Action Center. Sync Center. Fully hiding Action Center is possible but breaks Windows Update notifications. Too bad actually permitting the notification area to show all icons is no longer realistic.</p>

		<p>&quot;When the situation that calls for the notification has passed, call Shell_NotifyIcon(NIM_REMOVE)&quot;</p>
<p>How does the program know when this has happened? Supposedly they want to hide the icon after the notification is dismissed &#8211; which you&#39;d think should be handled by the OS which is displaying the notification and handling the dismissal. I still see why they&#39;d want to do it the original way (letting the OS manage the display of the icon). Otherwise they have to try work out when the notification is dismissed (perhaps there is a message?)</p>

		<p>[I&#39;m assuming the notification is based on a condition, like &quot;there is an unread email message&quot;..]</p>
<p>There are other common notifications like &#39;Download complete&#39;, &#39;New wireless networks discovered&#39; where the condition persists even after dismissal. It is after-all a &quot;notification&quot;, not necessarily a &quot;state&quot;. I can certainly see a requirement for a generic means to &quot;notify&quot; without having to do icon management.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Can&#39;t the program just go away completely and pop up with a balloon notification (or whatever&#39;s needed) as needed?</p>

		<p>@dave: Sure, add an entry to the suggestion box that says something along the lines of &quot;Raymond, can you remove comment <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/02/22/10270776.aspx#10271450" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/10270776.aspx</a> ?&quot;.

		<p>This &quot;solution&quot; has very different behavior than what was requested.</p>
<p>&quot;No one&quot; already mentioned the possibility for the user to configure the notifications.</p>
<p>But even absent that, the &quot;Show only notifications&quot; causes an icon to appear when the little arrow beside the notification area is clicked to expand hidden icons. &nbsp;Icons there provide access to nifty things like a popup menu to exit the daemon. &nbsp;Exiting the daemon allows things like upgrading dependencies (Java, for instance) without a reboot (if the daemon is left running, the files requiring replacement are in use).</p>
<p>By not creating the icon at all, instead of creating it in the hidden list, there&#39;s no UI to access the daemon.</p>
<p>Now, in Windows 7 the running applications bar is no longer as scarce a resource as it used to be, but having an icon there still uses considerably more screen estate than a notification icon (let alone a hidden notification icon).</p>
<p>So where do you put an exit menu where the user can get to it when needed, but it doesn&#39;t take up screen space otherwise?</p>

		<p>Strange, I can&#39;t think of any applications which have a Start menu item for quitting a running process. There&#39;s a certain comedy value to spawning a new process from a Start menu shortcut just to tell an existing process to quit, but I suppose it could make some sense.</p>
<p>Creating things only to show them again was actually the culprit in a performance issue I debugged earlier this year: we had an outsourced application to gather weekly data on project progress. In order to display the current week&#39;s data, it generated ALL the UI elements for every week of the whole project, then hid all but the current week &#8211; so the longer the project duration, the longer it took to load. (This was a web application, rather than desktop.)</p>

		<p>When I am asked to work on someone&#39;s computer, due to slowness or other issues, I often set it to show all notification icons. &nbsp;Then I go through each program and ask the user if they need program XYZ or not, and often their answer is &quot;I don&#39;t know what that program does, and I don&#39;t use it&quot;. &nbsp;So I uninstall it.</p>
<p>Showing all icons all the time has the terrific side-effect of reminding people to clean up junk that they don&#39;t need. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I am surprised that more people don&#39;t use a two-row-high taskbar. &nbsp;You get the added benefit of date and &quot;day of the week&quot; below the clock, along with allowing all notification icons to be shown without taking up so much of the taskbar.</p>
