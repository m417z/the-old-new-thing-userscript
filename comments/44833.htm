		<p>I wrote one myself earlier.</p>
<p>But my current challenge is to customize all icons that shell displays with a replacement from a local resource. (You already wrote about this.) The current belief in my workplace is that we can gain a market edge if we use a custom shared library containing the Crystal Clear icons to improve the visuals of our program, especially because Windows 10 icons are hideous.</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command: Assuming you mean Windows 10 Technical Preview build 9926 icons, then I agree, they definitely look worse than the previous build. (And I don&#39;t like what they&#39;ve done to the start menu either; I had to pin RDC to the taskbar as a workaround.)</p>

		<p>does this work for SHCONTF_INCLUDESUPERHIDDEN in windows 8?</p>

		<p>Before you mentioned this magic bind context, item enumeration in windows 8 was &quot;broken&quot; in terms of superhidden files. I will try this new approach and as you say it should work &#8212; thanks!</p>
<p>It looks like IShellItem enumeration is basically built on top of traditional IShellFolder enumeration. This would mean that working with IShellItems is perhaps not the most efficient way, if one is looking for maximum speed and efficiency, right? I am working on a desktop search engine (<a href="http://zabkat.com/blog/deskrule-desktop-indexed-search-engine.htm" rel="nofollow" target="_new">zabkat.com/&#8230;/deskrule-desktop-indexed-search-engine.htm</a>) and speed is of the essense</p>
<div class="post">[<em>All the bind context does is let you customize the shcontf passed to IShellFolder::EnumObjects. If there&#39;s a problem with IShellFolder::EnumObjects, that&#39;s a separate issue unrelated to IShellItem. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@Neil: Well, at my workplace, what I like or dislike doesn&#39;t matter. It is my boss that matters.</p>
<p>I have no personal comment on Windows 10 in this blog, but I&#39;d like to say Crystal Clear by EC rocks!</p>
