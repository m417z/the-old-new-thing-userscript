		<p>Oh yeah&#8230;been there, done that. &nbsp;I&#8217;m sure a fair amount of them are frauds, but the one or two I used to deal with only required you fax them your medical history and have a &quot;phone consultation&quot;. &nbsp;In a matter of days UPS or FedEx would make the delivery. &nbsp;Granted, this was some years ago but I cannot image the process or availability has changed all that much.</p>

		<p>Saw a documentary once that showed drugs being relabeled to show higher dosage amounts and sales past the sell-by date. &nbsp;I&#8217;m not sure how they would go about relabeling the capsules, though.</p>

		<p>The other &quot;Silent partner&quot; in the Internet drug biz is FedEx and another other overnight delivery companies. Along with the credit card companies, they create a trust management system that holds the whole thing together. FedEx can prove I got the pills, and Visa/MasterCard can prove I paid, making it harder for the dealer to cheat the customer or vice versa.</p>
<p>The dealer is likely to be a doctor who figures that he can make a killing for a year or two before the D.E.A. catches up with him. With a two hundred dollar profit on each sale, its a great way to beef up the retirement plan.</p>
<p>The pills themselves are worth pennies each, and go for $2.00 to $3.00 &#8212; about the same as the drug dealer on Jones Street.</p>
<p>The worst part of the whole thing is that the telemarketing calls trying to get you to buy more never stop.</p>

		<p>The root of this problem is the presumption that adults should have to obtain permission slips from the Government to purchase certain medicines.</p>

		<p>Hmm I am unsure on if I should get my &quot;repeat prescription&quot; on which I keep getting email reminders now. Funny thing is I do not remember ordering any?</p>

		<p>Duncan, one question I like to ask during a debate is the following:</p>
<p>Suppose a new drug is created that boosts intelligence by 50 IQ points, and its side effects are as rare and benign as Tylenol&#8217;s. Should we require a prescription for this drug?</p>
<p>If my opponent answers &quot;yes&quot;, there&#8217;s no helping him, and the debate might as well be over. I suppose my opponent secretly wants to create an office of Handicapper General.</p>

<p>Easy to debate, since the existence of such a drug having such minimal side effects (and known and proven as such) is dubious</p>
<p>Drugs that have that kind of effect on someone probably need a fair amount of testing long term&#8230;so yes, I would require a prescription</p>

		<p>Not`to mention some drugs gave serious interactions (thus the &quot;permission slip&quot; helps keep those to a minimum), some are addictive (and the permission slip helps try to keep one from being addicted), while others have long-term effects that shouldn&#8217;t be used for an extended period of time.</p>
