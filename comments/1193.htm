		<p>How true the last sentence is! It remembers me of those bugs hidden in plain sight, when the project won&#39;t compile because you have made a silly mistake, and you see it the hundredth time you re-read the code&#8230; (When it happens to me, I know it&#39;s time for a walk in the park!).</p>

		<p>Also, make sure you make a map of where you placed your eggs. Invariably, there&#39;s always that one egg that nobody can find until a few days later when you smell it.</p>

		<p>We&#39;ve started a new tradition a few years back. &nbsp;Our second cousins invite us and our shared cousins over. &nbsp;Us older guys (me, my brother, and our first cousins) hide the eggs for the younger girls (second cousins) and vice versa. &nbsp;It&#39;s fun!</p>
<p>We hunt outdoors so some rules like drawers aren&#39;t needed, same idea comes into play though. &nbsp;But outside eggs tend to fall if it&#39;s windy enough depending on where you set them.</p>
<p>One of my favorite eggs I hid last year was wedged between a downspout and the house at their eye level. &nbsp;It was high contrast to both elements. &nbsp;Standing right next to it the girls never thought to remove their eyes from the ground. &nbsp;I love hiding eggs at eye level.</p>
<p>And then there&#39;s the eggs that are hidden and never found and nobody remembers where it was. &nbsp;Sometimes once you finish and count all the eggs, you have more than were hidden, and you can only assume it was an egg from last year (this hasn&#39;t happened to us there, but when I was growing up our family hid eggs indoors and frequently we couldn&#39;t find one or two until Mom stumbled on it six months later).</p>

		<p>My grand daughter turned 5 today and Mrs. 12 BitSlab and I will be hiding eggs for her on Sunday morning. &nbsp;Part of the art of hiding eggs is to vary the locations from year to year. &nbsp;Last year she remembered where we hid them when she was 3. &nbsp;The hunt was over too quickly. &nbsp;This year, we will hide them in plain sight, but in different places.</p>

		<p>my parents like to tell how they would remove a light bulb from a lamp, and place the egg in its place.</p>
<p>Seems their approach fits into your criteria (assuming it&#39;s a desk/floor lamp, not a ceiling mounted fixture).</p>

		<p>We always hard-boiled eggs, colored them, and then used those for our egg hunt growing up. One year, we found the dozen eggs that we&#39;d colored, plus one that had been colored but also had the plastic shrinkable wrapping on it. At the time, it had been about 4 or 5 years since we&#39;d used the shrink wrap though. Needless to say, we didn&#39;t open that one indoors.</p>

		<p>Quote: &quot;It&#39;s surprising how long it can take somebody to find a yellow egg resting brazenly on the lap of a yellow teddy bear.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s also surprising how long a pink egg can be &quot;hidden&quot; in plain sight in the middle of the lawn (was the last egg to be found this year. I&#39;ve just put it beside a bigger bunch of grass (so nobody accidentially stepped on it)</p>
<p>Note: Yes, I know that easter is still ahead&#8230; we had to move it one week this year so everybody was able to come.</p>

		<p>When my kids were little, I tried to be as creative as possible in hiding eggs, including putting one on top of a door&#8211;closing the door would knock it off. To help, we&#39;d tell the kids how many eggs were hidden. I do recall that the last year we hid eggs I forgot where several were, so some eggs were found over the next few days.</p>

		<p>@Kiliman: If you use real eggs, even when they are found, there is the risk that the founder puts it in his/her pocket and then hugs somebody.</p>

		<p>I have a neighbor who writes down the location of where every egg was hidden so they can be recovered if not found.</p>

		<p>@The MAZZTer: I guess because it&#39;s traditional and egg pecking against each other is tremendously fun. Seems to be a cultural thing again: In Europe people generally use real eggs, while the US seems to go for chocolate eggs. Although I haven&#39;t seen that many egg hunts in the US to want to make general statements there.</p>
<p>@Fleet Command: You have a misunderstanding there, you still use hardboiled eggs, so hugging someone isn&#39;t really a problem although it bereaves you of the best part of it.</p>
<p>PS: Best place to hide an egg is in the fridge.. in the egg carton.. with the normal eggs :p </p>

		<p>Norwegian newspapers report today that 52% of all Americans think that the Easter Rabbit came before the Easter Egg.</p>
<p>I find it hard to believe. We had Easter Eggs in abundance when I was a kid, but I never heard about the Easter Rabbit (or Easter Hare or Easter Bunny or whatever you call him &#8230; or her, we are talking about laying eggs..) until I had grown up. </p>

		<p>According to Wikipedia, it was the Easter Eggs that came first, though j b must be pretty old, since Wikipedia says that the first recorded reference to the Easter Hare as it was then was in 1682 (already delivering Easter Eggs)&#8230;</p>

		<p>We had some friends and their kids over for a big hunt in out back yard. They pretty much followed your rules, except we put some up high in &quot;hard&quot; places, such as the top of a play structure. The older kids noticed those eggs right away and were distracted by the race to see who could get them first, so they didn&#39;t grab all the easy eggs before the younger kids got a chance.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m so satisfied that my most successful hidden egg this year was out in the open. &nbsp;I piled up some small rocks around it so it was about 50% covered, but the egg was bright pink and still rather obvious. &nbsp;It&#39;s just that there were so many nooks and crannies nearby though that everybody&#39;s vision was darting here and there, never stopping in the middle of the open area to see the bright pink spot.</p>
