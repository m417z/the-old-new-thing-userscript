		<p>According to Wikipedia¹, the first publicly released version of the SSL spec was SSL 2.0 in February 1995, but that had a number of security flaws; the SSL 3.0 spec was much improved and was released in November 1996. &nbsp;Of course, it probably took a while before browsers starting supporting SSL.</p>

		<p>20 years ago, it was completely different. New albums were still being released in vinyl records, and the most sold medium was the cassette tape. Downloading a short sample from Sub Pop&#39;s web (30 second mono, low quality WAVs weighting at about 800 KB) took about about 10 minutes with the then-typical 14400 bps modems. Downloading a full album in 128 Kbps MP3 would have took 8 to 10 hours &#8211; and then there would be the problem of storing it, with hard drives in the range of 400 MB and no CD writers. Physical records weren&#39;t old technology at all, and selling them in a web store was a great idea.</p>

<p>FYI, cookies was released in Netscape 0.9 released in late 1994, SSLv2 was released with Netscape 1.1 released in early 1995 and SSLv3 was released with Netscape 2 released in early 1996</p>

		<p>@Adam:</p>
<p>That timeline sounds reasonably close from memory &#8212; although I think there was a SSL 1.0 between Netscape servers and Netscape clients before SSL 2.0 was published as a standard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The thing is &#8212; a lot of times the web forms would collect the data and then&#8230; wait for it&#8230;. wait for it&#8230; send it by email to some mailbox anyway. &nbsp;And so you&#39;d fill in that you were ordering, and some guy would get the message, read it, and manually process the order. &nbsp;</p>
<p>@Antonio:</p>
<p>Don&#39;t give me a wav! &nbsp;That stuffs huge &#8212; S3M, MOD, MID &#8212; I&#39;ll load that on my Gravis Ultrasound and it&#39;ll sound plenty good with a tiny little file. :P</p>

<p>&quot;Downloading a full album in 128 Kbps MP3 would have took 8 to 10 hours&quot;</p>
<p>According to the same wikipedia website that people like to cite here (dutch version) MP3 implementations exists since 1994. So while in theory it would have been possible for the site to use MP3 it was surely not so well known &amp; spread as it is now..</p>

		<p>@Dave Bacher: I didn&#39;t include MODs in my dissertation because their working makes it nearly impossible to legally use them for commercial music: they contain the complete music score, all the samples used by it (which the musician wouldn&#39;t be able to license for redistribution from the publishers) and, if the piece isn&#39;t instrumental, recordings for every sung verse.</p>
<p>@Nathan: maybe I should have added a &quot;if they had enough support back then&quot; to the sentence. I knew the specification existed back then (for example, Philip&#39;s DCC, the Digital Compact Cassette, released in 1990, was based on MPEG Layer II, a.k.a. MP2), but I thought it wasn&#39;t necessary to point that.</p>

		<p>Not sure what qualifies as &#39;online shopping cart&#39; in your world, but the internet had this function back in the 80&#39;s [where you could order, change your order, pay].</p>

		<p>@old guy,</p>
<p>In the 80s, the protocols on the internet were lie SMTP for email, FTP for file transfer and Telnet for remote login. The first public presentation of HTML was in 1991 (although work started around 1989 and insiders had probably seen prototypes during 1990).</p>
<p>Obviously, you could send email to, sya, Sears, telling them to put a selection of goods into a basket, but I don&#39;t think that is comparable to the web based shopping carts.</p>

		<p>The other option for payment collection is the one some sites still offer: over the phone. &nbsp;You submit your order on-line and then you can phone up to just pay for it, rather than having to give the full details of the order over the phone.</p>

		<p>@Scott^N The bit in the &quot;Real Frank Zappa Book&quot; is actually pretty prescient, considering the man has been dead for twenty years. &nbsp;When people ask me why I still prefer CDs / LPs and DVDs to purely online services, my default answer is &quot;Fetish and Fondlement Value&quot;</p>
<p>Also, Sub-Pop is an amazing label. &nbsp;Much respect for the people who put out SuperFuzzBigMuff.</p>

		<p>@KC,</p>
<p>Unless you insist on the electronic ordering mechanism being digital, you might push it back even further, to the 60s or even 50s. Maybe even before that. In my childhood (that would be the 60s) we could transmit our shopping list through analog electronic devices (called &quot;phones&quot;) to vendors of, say, foodstuff (i.e. the local grocery store) and have the coontents of our shopping cart delivered to our home, by the end of the day (at the latest).</p>
