		<p>Oh, that&#39;s one of my favorite concertos! &nbsp;A friend introduced me to it when he gifted me a CD of the 1951 Horowitz recording. &nbsp;As he handed me the gift, I heard him say, &quot;I thought you might enjoy some rock music.&quot;&#8211;it wasn&#39;t until I opened the gift wrap that I realized what he meant by &quot;rock&quot;.</p>

		<p>That reminds me of a semester in college where couple of us engineering students discovered a room with a computer that was gifted to the university. &nbsp;We were working on a PDP-11 20 learning assembly, and took the wrong door. &nbsp;In there was a HUGE main frame, took up 3/4 of the room. &nbsp;And a grad student. &nbsp;He says &quot;Hey, want to see something?&quot; &nbsp;So he showed us how to run it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This was in the days of you only got x amount of dollars in computer time to write your programs. &nbsp;You had to submit your programs to the operators who ran them on the mainframe and gave you the printouts and your stack of cards&#8230;</p>
<p>Well, this thing ran Fortran, and Algol if I remember. &nbsp;So we would write our programs on the old behemoth in the back room until they ran right, then submit it to the mainframe. &nbsp;Turn them in with one run. &nbsp;The teaching assistant could never figure out how us three got all of our assignments done in one try, every time. &nbsp;;)</p>
<p>That went on for a whole semester. &nbsp;I came back at the start of the next semester to find the room empty. &nbsp;The grad student graduated, and the dean of the computing school decided they needed the room.</p>
<p>then there was the other PDP that had a vector graphics screen and a cool Star Trek game&#8230;</p>

		<p>Whose performance was that? My favorite is Lazar Berman with London Symphony/Andre Previn.</p>

		<p>My story involves a Solaris SPARC workstation computer room that noone use for the most of time.</p>
<p>Not only I can utilize all the 4 dot matrix printers to print notes/homeworks (we only have dot matrix printers in computer rooms at that time, so you could imagine how difficult it was to print things in Windows computer room at exam weeks), I also got to play freeciv at times.</p>

		<p>At University the main computer rooms would be locked at night which made hunting for a free terminal on which to play multi-user games (not available during the day) tricky. Fortunately other departments weren&#39;t quite so careful with their computers, in particular there was one room of BBC Micros that was usually left unlocked. I was even able to resolve the minor problem of a lack of a VT102 emulator by writing one (the Acorn Archimedes port of which was much simpler to write).</p>

		<p>Reminds me of a time in college when I had a part time job as a &quot;labbie&quot; in a networking lab students didn&#39;t know about. After a semester and a half of being paid to study and do my homework there I arrived one day to find my door code no longer unlocked the place. Went home. Came back the next day to find the room empty. Never bothered to find out what happened!</p>

		<p>George Costanza, after getting caught faking a handicap, which helped him get a job, then refusing to leave before the end of his contract:</p>
<p>&quot;Hello Margery, George Costanza. How are you sweet heart? Listen, can you give Mr. Thomassoulo a message for me? …Yes. If he needs me, tell him I’M IN MY OFFICE! Thanks.&quot;</p>
