		<p>Let&#39;s not forget the entire programming language known as &#39;M&#39;. AKA MUMPS. Or colloquially around these parts: &#39;that piece of crap language, don&#39;t you dare put me anywhere near that thing&#39;. Which is different from Microsoft&#39;s own M language, of course. And definitely not to be confused with M, AKA MATLAB &#8211; another completely unrelated programming language.</p>

		<p>Windows Home Server was originally code-named &quot;Quattro&quot;, but that got changed to &quot;Q&quot; due to fear of infringing on others&#39; trademarks.</p>

		<p>Actually, Raymond, here&#39;s the full story on the Windows Home Server codenames:</p>
<p>The incubation PROJECT for Windows Home Server, when I first started it, was called Quattro. I named it this because this was my fourth attempt to incubate a home server project at Microsoft. The &quot;team&quot; was literally just myself when I first wrote the words &quot;Project Quattro&quot; on a document.</p>
<p>As we progressed and the incubation project transitioned into actually building a PRODUCT, we needed a codename (because the final product name had not been decided and we needed to call it SOMETHING). I wanted to just call it Quattro, but there&#39;s always a risk of using trademarked names for codenames, even if they are never intended to &quot;go public&quot;. &nbsp;Quattro is trademarked by multiple parties including Audi, Schick, and Borland (!). Microsoft&#39;s legal department has guidelines to avoid codenames that might infringe on trademarks and one is to use names of physical places (e.g. cities). &nbsp;My project planner, Todd, suggested <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qaanaaq" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Qaanaaq</a> but we deemed that too esoteric. &nbsp;Then we just decided on &quot;Q&quot;.</p>
<p>After Windows Home Server v1 shipped and we were starting to work on V2, someone on the team came by my office and asked me &quot;Charlie, where did you grow up?&quot; &nbsp;I said &quot;Vail, Colorado&quot;. &nbsp;The next thing I knew V2 was codenamed &quot;Vail&quot;&#8230;.</p>

		<p>I thought this would be about Memphis/Cairo/Blackcomb/Longhorn (Yes, I know that these are not synonymous, but they were so broadly defined that they overlapped. I also know that Cairo turned into Windows 98 and Longhorn into Vista. Wikipedia claims Blackcomb is Windows 7. I&#39;m dubious, but if they&#39;re right 7 itself went from Blackcomb to Vienna to Seven). I recall a joke about the then upcoming Windows .NET, that they could remove the E and just call it Windows NT again.</p>

		<p>And, let us not forget &quot;M&quot; the released product name of the &quot;Microsoft Editor&quot;, MSFT&#39;s first (as far as I know) full screen text editor. I can&#39;t recall now if it was intended as a general purpose text editor, or specifically for programmers. &nbsp;It would soon lead to PWB &#8211; The Programmer&#39;s Work Bench and then to QuickBasic and eventually VisualStudio.</p>

		<p>As someone who worked on windows client, my recollection is: &nbsp;&quot;Longhorn&quot; started out as the umbrella under which Whistler and Blackcomb (Client/Server) lived, and then later came to mean &quot;Vista&quot; (Client &#8212; we got longhorn hats at one point while we were killing ourselves to ship pre-reset, if I recall correctly), and then when Vista neared actual shipping, somehow Longhorn magically morphed to mean Server. &nbsp;I think Longhorn was one of the most misunderstood codenames ever, and that was by the people working on it. :)</p>

		<p>But why was Max killed? What was wrong with a cool WPF app for P2P sharing of photos? Such products should be released unsupported instead of killed. Whoever killed it must be the same guy who decided to kill Windows PowerToys and created the atrocious policy of no unsupported downloads.</p>

		<p>At my current job, we use trees as code names. By the time we release, we are so used to the code name we still use it internally. [Does a quick check.] And, yep, the code name is still in the file version resource for our latest release.</p>

		<p>I was an intern on the Microsoft Max team in summer 2006. I think the milkshake reference was from a song that not everyone liked. I can&#39;t confirm about the dog, but I think I remember hearing that the dog belonged to one of the PMs.</p>

<p>Extremist: A build of Max without the sharing features was released after the project ended, but I can&#39;t find the link now. I think all you could do was view photos.</p>

		<p>For a long time we used to use the names of small towns in rural Utah for our code names. &nbsp;Then someone came up with the idea to use restaurant names in the hopes that the management team would send the project team there for lunch upon completion. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That worked well, but now no one will work on the projects named after po-dunk towns for fear they will be sent there for lunch instead.</p>

		<p>And of course, sometimes the &#39;codename&#39; will stick! &nbsp;I worked on an internal tool code named &#39;Espresso&#39;. &nbsp;So of course, when we shipped, we called it&#8230; &#39;Espresso&#39;. &nbsp;Nobody could be bothered to come up with a &#39;real&#39; name!</p>

		<p>@Hotchin: The same thing happened where I work. My company was developing a tool for monitoring breakages in our build system, which had been affectionately codenamed &#39;Terry&#39;, after Terry Tate (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RzToNo7A-94" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch</a>). There was some consternation that this probably wasn&#39;t an appropriate name for a finished product, but the damage was done. That&#39;s what it&#39;s called to this day.</p>

		<p>I have a rule, called &quot;Lippert&#39;s Rule For Naming Products&quot; which is that management is allowed to change the name of my product *once per version*. If they change it twice, *they* can be the people who scrub the source code looking for stray instances of the now-forbidden string. I did it once, I&#39;m not gonna do it again. I instituted this rule after &quot;Windows Script Thingies&quot; because &quot;Windows Scriptlets&quot; became &quot;Windows Script Components&quot; in the space of a couple of days; the rule has served me well since then. &nbsp;(And I know what you mean about monstrosities, having worked on &quot;Microsoft Visual Studio .NET 2005 Tools For Microsoft Office System 2003&quot; or whatever the heck VSTO&#39;s formal name was. It had &quot;Microsoft&quot; in it *twice* for heaven&#39;s sake.)</p>

		<p>How appropriate.. Windows Embedded Compact 7 (WinCE 7, for those who keep trying to figure out the name lineage (&quot;Windows Embedded&quot; sounds great, until you run into Compact, Mobile (Handheld?), Standard, Enterprise and Server, which mean CE, WinMo and XP/7&#8230;) shipped today, codenamed &quot;Chelan&quot;.</p>
<p>Raymond&#39;s timing is uncannily impeccable again.</p>
<p>Of course, one of the problems with codenames per version is you&#39;re dependent on a table to map the name to a version, and some are known better by their number, others by name. And when the official pages delete the codename, that mapping can get lost. And then your customers will ask for support&#8230; either by version or name, usually the one you&#39;re least familiar with.</p>

		<p>I can&#39;t help but picture the Milkshake mascot as &quot;Master Shake&quot; from Aqua Teen Hunger Force. &nbsp;I&#39;m kind of hoping this really was the logo.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Master_Shake" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Master_Shake</a></p>
<p>For those not familiar with the show or the character, I guess wikipedia&#39;s description of &quot;acerbic manner&quot; captures it well enough. &nbsp;Definitely not your first choice for corporate mascot.</p>
