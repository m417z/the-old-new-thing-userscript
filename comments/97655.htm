		<p>Interesting guess on the origins of this idiom.  From the title and first paragraph I got the impression that the explanation for its usage would relate to books or other form of longer writing, which usually have an index or table of content, and of which a disproportionately large piece would be devoted to the fringe topic.  I could picture a book editor giving you this same feedback under the circumstances :)</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

		<p>Let&#8217;s just put &#8220;the no-widget-manager scenarios&#8221; on appendix. (That&#8217;s why we sometimes have Appendix longer than the main article.)</p>

		<p>ISTM the widget example merely demonstrates the fact known to most developers.  In a well-founded design much of the code and most of the intricacy is dealing with the inevitable edge and corner cases.</p>
<p>IOW, if you find lots of intricacy in your main branch logic, that&#8217;s a bad design smell.  If you find lots of intricacy in your corner cases, that just demonstrates for the umpteenth time that the world is a messy place.</p>
<p>So, as cheong00 says, if you find the corner cases overwhelming an explanatory doc, that&#8217;s a sign to split the doc.  Not to curtail the info about the necessarily messy corner cases.  Complex corner cases are the <i>last</i> place you want to gloss over the gotchas.  That&#8217;s true whether it&#8217;s a design doc, code comments, dev-level API docs, or end user how-to docs.</p>

		<p>I think the origin of &#8220;over indexing&#8221; is from polling and surveying. You &#8220;over index&#8221; a group where the sample size wasn&#8217;t large enough. For example, if the population is 20% blue-eyed, and your sample was only 10% blue-eyed you might over index the blue-eyed sample to come up with the population in general. This is similar to &#8220;over sampling&#8221; where you have a larger than population in general sample size (in this example, if your survey sample included 30% blue-eyed).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure someone who is more familiar with sampling design and surveying could give a better explanation.</p>
