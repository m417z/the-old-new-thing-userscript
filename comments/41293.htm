		<p>I’m amazed that they can get speech recognition running on such a small form factor device! I’ve been using Microsoft Voice Command on my xda for a couple of months and it is pretty good… frustrating when it strangely refuses to work sometimes… but mostly works well. But I’m a geek and I’m prepared to put up with less than 100% accuracy, at least for a while. I don’t know if the psychgraphic profile of people working in the industries mentioned in this article, that is healthcare, retail and manufacturing, are willing to put up with less-than-perfect recognition. I wonder how good it is on the Vocera?</p>

		<p>If it is a wireless communications device, it can transmit the speech to a big computer in a closet somewhere, that can do the speech recognition, and send the results over to whatever agent is acting on it.  I haven&#8217;t looked at the current offering, but you can employ the traditioonal telephone network to understand how to &quot;get speech reco on a tiny device&quot; &#8230; the tiny device, like a traditional telephone, is just a simple hookup to the resources of the greater network.  All the magic actually happens in a plain brick building downtown.</p>
