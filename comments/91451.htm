		<p>It&#39;s not strange if you consider that marriage law originates from church procedures (we&#39;re working on fixing that.)</p>
<p>The Anglican church has established rules for religious procedures; a common thread is that the religious action needs a &quot;minister&quot;. Usually this has to be someone duly recognized by the official church.</p>
<p>But weddings are special &#8211; the *bride and groom* are the actual &quot;ministers&quot; of the act, and the official church guy is just there to watch it happen. So the &quot;it&#39;s a marriage if the bride and groom believe it&#39;s a marriage&quot; makes total sense.</p>

		<p>Looks like this diverged when the Roman church split into the Western and Eastern halves. Catholic-based branches of Christianity behave as I describe earlier, but Eastern Orthodoxy-based branches have the official church guy as the minister.</p>

		<p>So, Raymond can perform marriages in Washington for fans of his blog when they get married.</p>
<p>It&#39;s an interesting article, but I wonder what circumstance happened that this came to Raymond&#39;s attention&#8230;</p>

		<p>As a Washington state resident I know of at least 3 marriages of couples getting married by friends who got specifically ordained to perform the ceremony. Also note that combined with the large amount of foreigners in this area, visa rules (fiancé, H1, Green Card, etc.), confusing wording of the marriage license (see the civil vs. religious question), and typos getting added at every step (see foreigners above); I&#39;m not surprised the lawmakers just gave up and decided to take the &quot;whatever, if there&#39;s a form we&#39;re good&quot; approach.</p>

		<p>Most States have putative marriage laws that protect against people&#39;s understandable ignorance of the various requirements for marriage in each jurisdiction. You know because marriage is an &quot;objective&quot; covenant from &quot;God&quot; that somehow varies depending on which political sundivision you find yourself. </p>

		<p>They probably just accidentally ordered the marriage forms in triplicate instead of duplicate, and didn&#39;t want to waste them.</p>
<p>Or it&#39;s related to my favorite quote from Civilization 4 (probably by Oscar Wilde): &quot;The bureaucracy is expanding to meet the needs of the expanding bureaucracy.&quot; :)</p>

		<p>Colorado law actually goes one step further, allowing two people to marry each other *without* benefit of an officiant. Some friends of mine recently did just that. (Bonus points: They&#39;re a same-sex couple!)</p>

		<p>A marriage is just a special kind of contract, mainly for handling joint property. So long as all participants enter into it knowingly, there&#39;s no reason that there needs to be a special officiant.</p>
<p>In fact, many states have a concept of a &quot;common law marriage&quot;, which is just a de facto marriage. In other words, if you&#39;ve been acting like you were married for long enough, you&#39;re effectively married.</p>

		<p>&quot;So if your officiant turns out to have been unqualified, don&#39;t worry. The marriage is still valid.&quot;</p>
<p>It may be legally valid, but may not be valid according to the rules of that particular religion, which is a grave reason to worry about if you choose religious ceremony not only for bells and whistles but because you really believe in that religion.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s another example of putting the &quot;user experience&quot; first, even if the intermediary between the user and the system was misbehaving. If the people involved believe that what they did was valid, then the system lets it stand, even if the officiant who signed the papers was unqualified to do it.</p>

		<p>Regarding the phrase &quot;if anyone can show just cause why this couple cannot lawfully be joined together in matrimony, let them speak now or forever hold their peace&quot;, I can envision one of the relatives saying &quot;I don&#39;t like the groom, this marriage is a bad idea&quot;, and the couple saying &quot;shut up, we don&#39;t care what you think&quot;, and the wedding proceeds anyway! &nbsp;What kind of &quot;just cause&quot; would anyone provide? &nbsp;Claiming that one of the couple is still married to someone else?</p>

		<p>@Max: Now we just need to get computers to act like that (more often).</p>
<p>@DWalker: That could work, if e.g. someone unknowingly failed to get a divorce/annulment (hey, another sitcom plot!) or (in ye olden days) if one of them is unknowingly the illegitimate child of the other&#39;s parent or something like that (one does have to wonder how you get all the way to the wedding ceremony without realizing either of these things, but&#8230;).</p>

		<p>@DWalker: &nbsp;Yes, exactly. &nbsp;That wording dates from a time when it was easier to hide information. &nbsp;An existing marriage would be just cause, or evidence that one partner was not who they said they were, or some other fraud that would invalidate the financial settlements.</p>

		<p>Insanity that someone tricked during the ceremony can be held to the marriage. I guess it would be a loophole they don&#39;t want to open up and presumably the person that was tricked really thought they were going to get married (and were okay with it). Still something being valid because you thought it was seems like a bad law. Would be like an illegal search is valid because the pushy police officer scared you into believing you had no choice.</p>

		<p>@Mr Cranky: Because there are legal benefits involved with marriage? If you really don&#39;t want the state involved then you&#39;re free to have a purely religious ceremony and not notify the state, but then you won&#39;t to be able to file taxes as a couple or be recognized as the spouse at the hospital or anything like that.</p>
<p>@Mike: It&#39;s because thinking you&#39;re married, only to find out later from a representative of the state that you weren&#39;t actually married, is likely to be troubling, troublesome, or possibly even outright traumatic, depending on your beliefs. The state simply doesn&#39;t have enough real interest in the qualifications of the person officiating the marriage to justify butting in on things after the fact.</p>

		<p>As late as the 19th century, a Scottish couple could (at least in theory) form a binding marriage simply by introducing themselves as husband and wife. Wilkie Collins got a whole novel out of that one.</p>

		<p>@Max: First part, I agree, but most churches do not. &nbsp;Second part, you totally begged my question.</p>

		<p>@Mike: &quot;something being valid because you thought it was&quot; is the basis of contract law. &nbsp;Reaching an agreement makes it real.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t know about other religions, but in Orthodox Judaism, there is a concept very similar to common law marriage. If you think you&#39;re married while consummating your marriage then you&#39;re married (as long as the marriage is allowed by Jewish Law in the first place, so no close relatives, for example). It doesn&#39;t even matter if you were religious at the time. I should know, my parents are an example. I&#39;m not considered to be born out of wedlock. Though they had a traditional wedding something like 20 years after the fact, it makes little legal (religious) difference. </p>
