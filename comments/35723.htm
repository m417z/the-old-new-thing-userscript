		<p>What if you wanted to always display the underlined menu accelerators (such as VS.NET)?</p>

		<p>You should be respecting the user&#8217;s settings, not ignoring them. (If you still want to ignore them, then go ahead and ignore all these cue management messages.)</p>

		<p>Paul: I think you need to do it yourself :). The VS.NET menus have nothing in common with the Win32 menus.</p>

		<p>What a poor choice to disable by default accelerators! Why someone at MS has taken that decision? Is the second thing I disable when I install XP (the first one is to enable the old style Start menu).</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m testing out the ODS_NOACCEL flag with an owner-drawn menu, but I don&#8217;t seem to be getting the flag in all the right situations (meaning, it doesn&#8217;t match the behavior of a plain menu).<br />
<br />Test case: 0-Make a dialog that has a button that shows a popup menu. 1-set focus to the button with the mouse. 2-hit the spacebar. 3-cancel the menu. 4-click the button with the mouse.<br />
<br />For a plain menu, the mnemonics are shown in only case 2. For owner-drawn, the ODS_NOACCEL flag is sent in case 4 as well (and all subsequent times the menu is shown, in fact).</p>
<p>Also, if you uncheck the &quot;hide keyboard cues&quot; option, I would expect ODS_NOACCEL to never be sent. Instead, I have to also check SystemParametersInfo(SPI_GETKEYBOARDCUES) which seems like unnecessary work.</p>

<p>Er&#8230; the accelerators aren&#8217;t disabled. The UI hints for them are just not displayed. You can make them appear at any time by hitting ALT &#8211; and they all still work just the way they did before &#8211; the UI just looks cleaner.</p>

		<p>Hm&#8230; I never noticed they were gone.  I guess since I spend most my time in applications that ignore the settings I didn&#8217;t miss them.</p>
<p>Cleaner or not, this is one feature I think should default to on.  (To me, a feature is something you can turn off easily.)</p>

		<p>Was the reason for hiding them by default simply to make the UI look cleaner?  Or was there some other argument?</p>

		<p>when the &quot;Hide underlined letters for keyboard navigation until I press the Alt key&quot; option is enabled, is there a way to prevent the accelerator cues for window menus from being drawn on the window ? (useful in cases where the window is non standard)</p>

		<p>? If you don&#8217;t want Windows drawing a menu don&#8217;t give your window a menu.</p>

		<p>Slightly OT, but is there any specific reason why the ampersand was chosen to signify that the next character is the accelerator (or at least that it should be underlined)?  Although it&#8217;s not a common character it&#8217;s one that does get a reasonable amount of use, and it&#8217;s not uncommon to see underlined spaces in odd locations when something like &quot;Fish &amp; Chips&quot; crops up as a caption.</p>
<p>Why not pick something more obscure?  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever used the &#172; character for anything, and yet it&#8217;s been on every keyboard I&#8217;ve ever owned!</p>

<p>Use &quot;and&quot; instead of &quot;&amp;&quot; is one of the written English &quot;Good Style Guide&quot; bulletpoints. The only time you should ever see something like &quot;Fish &amp; Chips&quot; on a dialog is in a title &#8211; and that isn&#8217;t something you put a mnemonic accelerator on. You can disable the prefix handling using a style on the static text control too, if you really need to.</p>
<p>Also, you can override it just by typing &quot;Fish &amp;&amp; Chips&quot;.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s not on this one I&#8217;m using. Nor has it been on any others that I&#8217;ve ever owned since I left England. Although you might have a point if you suggested the use of the &quot;^&quot; character &#8211; although even then, you might well suggest the &quot;~&quot; character, and all of a sudden that became commonly used in web pages on unix systems.</p>

		<p>&quot;Use &quot;and&quot; instead of &quot;&amp;&quot; is one of the written English &quot;Good Style Guide&quot; bulletpoints. The only time you should ever see something like &quot;Fish &amp; Chips&quot; on a dialog is in a title&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>Unfortunately we have several departments here that have an ampersand in their internal code &#8212; P&amp;S, M&amp;E, H&amp;S, and O&amp;M to name four &#8212; and it causes a few oddities in some of our apps.  In stuff we&#8217;ve developed internally we&#8217;ve tended to filter them when using them as captions, but third party apps get all manner of confused&#8230;</p>
<p>(An example: Earlier today I printed a few hundred documents called &quot;P&amp;S xxx&quot;, and Word quite helpfully told me it was printing &quot;PS xxx&quot; with the S underlined.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s situations like that, where an ampersand is more than likely going to show up sooner or later, that make me wonder why they picked such a common character.  (Alternatively, use &amp;&amp; to signify an accelerator, and treat a single ampersand as a single ampersand.)</p>
<p>Obviously it&#8217;s waaaay too late to change now, but it&#8217;s still strikes me as an odd decision.</p>

		<ol>
<li>&gt; underlined accelerators and focus<br />
<br />&gt; rectangles (collectively known as &quot;keyboard<br />
<br />&gt; cues&quot;) are hidden by default</p>
<p>Not in the defaults we get from Microsoft.</p>
<p>2. &gt; Note that this setting actually controls<br />
<br />&gt; both underlined letters and focus rectangles</p>
<p>Not that I could tell.  I changed the setting from the default to what you call the default, and the underlines disappeared from the shortcut letters in menu bars and menu entries.  However, focus rectangles continue to be displayed.</p>
<p>3.  I changed the setting back to the actual default.  Underlines reappeared in some but not all cases, which looks like a bug.  Existing windows got their underlines back under the shortcut letters in menu items but not in menu bars.  Newly created windows got their underlines in both menu items and menu bars.</li>
