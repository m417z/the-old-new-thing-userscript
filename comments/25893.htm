		<p>Raymond &#8211; Sounds like you had a good time. &nbsp;And it almost makes me want to get into biking (almost, not quite yet). &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Great advice! &nbsp;Heck, that&#8217;s fine advice for training for long races, not just bike tours. &nbsp;For what it&#8217;s worth, the best way I&#8217;ve found to reduce pit time: &nbsp;eat on the bike. &nbsp;Working in pairs to fix flats reduces time too.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If you are into performance statistics, you can bring a digital camera (or use the one built into your phone) and take a picture as you arrive at each stop, and again as you leave.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Hi Raymond &#8211; The STP sounds like a fun ride. &nbsp;Those are some great tips for any long distance ride.</p>
<p>I just finished the Tri-State Trek (www.tristatetrek.com) and you forgot one other very important tip:</p>
<p>Drink a lot of liquids! &nbsp;Even when you don&#8217;t think you need it.</p>
<p>When we left it was raining and since it was so wet I forgot to drink &#8211; by lunchtime I was really ill from lack of hydration.</p>
<p>Hopefully not a mistake I&#8217;ll make again.</p>

		<p>Ghbleh, you&#8217;re making me actually think this exercise stuff might be fun.</p>
<p>Amusing nitpicker&#8217;s corner about the rounding. You&#8217;ve taken all the fun I would have had. I can no longer argue that that highway 507 is more correctly known as 507.1 after resurfacing work removed some UI bugs&#8230; or that the razor rider only counts as half a person, so it would have been 8998.5 people riding with you. Though perhaps I could still argue he wasn&#8217;t a *real* person, giving 8998+j.</p>

		<p>Sounds like you had a good STP experience too, Raymond! It was my first time too and I was pretty nervous about it (especially since the longest ride I&#8217;d done before that was an attempted ride to Snoqualmie Falls that didn&#8217;t quite get there), but I&#8217;m proud to say that I finished the 2 day STP almost exactly as the finish line festival was ending.</p>
<p>On a hybrid commuter/mountain bicycle, no less, so 13-14 mph was pretty much a high speed for me&#8230;</p>
<p>Do you think you&#8217;ll be doing it again next year?</p>

		<p>Hey Raymond,</p>
<p>Last year I did the 2-day STP, and also stayed in Toledo High School (this year&#8217;s location was Winlock Elementary, and to think I missed a chance to meet my favorite micro-celbrity!). I have a story to share about that occasion. Me and my girlfriend arrived Toledo dead-tired, had some food, and picked a spot in the school&#8217;s library to put down our sleeping bags. We were by the &quot;career advice&quot; shelf, if my memory serves me correctly. Soon enough, the room more or less filled up, and around 9 pm the lights went out. That&#8217;s when we found out that we picked a spot directly underneath the one light that was not turned off, and as the custodian-in-charge eventually informed us, could not be turned off. As in, there was no switch to disable it. We couldn&#8217;t easily move into another spot without invading someone&#8217;s personal space bubble, either. At the end, I ended up crawling under a nearby library desk, and snoozing there. It worked out OK, except when I woke up at night to use the bathroom, sat up, and hit my head. Stupid light.</p>
<p>Anyway, I am curious, did they have the light that could not be turned off this year as well? (assuming you slept at the library). And, for bonus points, which Windows feature would be most analogous to that light in your opinion?</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Alex</p>

		<p>Ray,</p>
<p>Congrats on finishing the ride.</p>
<p>On the butt pain part, different shorts can make a huge difference. The new thing in shorts is having thin and flexible sides on the chamois, so that it moves rather than rubbing. These make a *huge* difference for me &#8211; I did a hard century last weekend and was still pretty comfy at the end. </p>

<p>[That&#8217;s a bit of an investment for just one ride, though. -Raymond]&quot;</p>
<p>yeah, maybe. But I bet you&#8217;d find yourself using for a lot more than just that one ride. A ForeRunner 305 (or any other model, really) is a lot of fun for biking, walking, hiking, running, skiing, even driving and road trips. I enjoy plugging the data into any number of websites, like motionbased.com or mapmyrun.com to see all the ride/run/drive data, including map overlays, which are always fun.</p>

		<p>One more thought&#8230;</p>
<p>If you have an expensive heart rate monitor, you get all the timing data recorded for you so you don&#8217;t have to take pictures or nuthin&#8217;.</p>
<p>To Joe:</p>
<p>To run a garmin on STP requires an external power supply as the battery doesn&#8217;t have a long enough life for most riders.</p>

		<p>ericgu &#8211; A Garmin ForeRunner might make it the whole way. The ForeRunners are very small and efficient &#8211; not like the big clunky ones with removable batteries. I&#8217;ve left a ForeRunner 305 powered on during 11 hours cross-atlantic flights &nbsp;(multi-leg flights) and it still had juice when we landed. I&#8217;ve also gone over a week without recharging it while using it nearly every day, for probably 10-12 hours of use, and it never died on me.</p>
<p>but, whatever. I&#8217;m just saying &#8211; having a GPS on any bike ride or run is really quite fun, and if you have one, you might end up using it a lot more than you would think.</p>
