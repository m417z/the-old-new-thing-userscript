		<p>The real question is: even though the address line shows \tsclient&lt;x&gt;, why you cannot go back in the Explorer history, if the terminal session reconnected? Is it because the history keeps some ephemeral token, instead of the UNC name (which would have made much more sense)? And why tsclient is so slow, even slower than SMB?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>If you reconnect, you might be reconnecting from a different machine, so \tsclientx refers to a potentially unrelated drive.

		<p>The X terminology mirrors the terminology used for terminal servers, in the earlier sense of a box on a network to which physical terminals are physically connected, which itself reflects usage such as printer server, a box on a network to which printers are physically connected.</p>
<p>A terminal server serves up terminals!</p>

		<p>And to think &#8212; here I was marvelling at the cleverness of finding a name that wouldn&#39;t ever conflict with an actual server on a real network!</p>
<p>For a little background, the original terminal server did not create what look like network shares. It just mapped your local drive letters (C:, D:) to the terminal server session&#39;s drive (C:, D:). So how did your local C: drive avoid conflicting with the server&#39;s C: drive? Well, when you installed a terminal server, it called its install drive M: instead of C: &#8212; obviously that only worked because you were installing Terminal Server as a separate OS product.</p>
<p>When they integrated terminal services into the OS for remote administration, obviously installing to the M: drive isn&#39;t going to work, and that&#39;s presumably where TSCLIENT came from.</p>

		<p>How does Explorer utilize IStorage to create a folder? &nbsp;I would surmise it calls IStorage::CreateStorage, but the documentation for that and RenameElement both indicate that the maximum length of the names is 31 characters. &nbsp;The file system supports longer names, though, so how does the delta get rationalized?</p>

		<p>I tend not to use the \tsclient drives, because for some reason they work much slower than other means of data transfer. At least for me. So if possible, I just use regular network shares, or FTP, or even e-mail attachments.</p>

<p>As currently implemented, it absolutely works as you describe. You open a document in Notepad by its UNC, you save it back by its UNC. If the UNC goes to a different place now, too bad. It can happen with SMB shares, too. It&#39;s only Explorer that messes up its history by using some tokens in it instead of strings.</p>

		<p>&quot;In Terminal Services terminology, the machine you are connect from is the client, and the machine you are connecting to is the server.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;So someone actually got this right (contrast this with the X terminology, where what you expect to be a server is a client and viceversa).&quot;</p>
<p>But&#8230;they&#39;re both the same, and both right!</p>
<p>In both cases, and in all client-server (basically all non-equal-peers) instances, the machine doing the connecting is the client, and the machine listening for and accepting (or rejecting) the connection is the server.</p>
<p>If you RDP to a remote computer, the machine you are connecting from &#8211; the one you are sitting at &#8211; is the client, and the machine you are connecting to &#8211; the remote one &#8211; is the server.</p>
<p>If you SSH to a remote computer, the machine you are connecting from &#8211; the one you are sitting at &#8211; is the client, and the machine you are connecting to &#8211; the remote one &#8211; is the server.</p>
<p>If you run an X program on a server you have SSHd to, the X program initiates a connection to the X server. The machine which is doing the connecting &#8211; the remote one &#8211; is the client, and the machine being connected to &#8211; the one you are sitting in front of &#8211; is the server. The X program on the remote machine is the X client, requesting a service (draw my window please) from the display on your local machine, which is the X server.</p>
<p>(Is this *really* so hard to understand, or is it just haters intentionally feigning confusion?)</p>
<p>&quot;Now, it turns out that the Terminal Services folks could&#39;ve customized their Other to say, &quot;Actually, yeah, I do support IStorage.&quot; You do this by setting the bit 0x00000008 in the Attributes value of the ShellFolder key when you registered your instance object.&quot;</p>
<p>Wha&#8230;.? Surely the way to say &quot;I support IStorage&quot; is to return S_OK from IUnknown::QueryInterface(IID_IStorage, &amp;ppv); Because, you know, that&#39;s how COM works. Isn&#39;t it?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Oh, the do respond S_OK to QI(IStorage).

		<p>in a Citrix XenApp 6.5 (former MetaFrame, dunno what they call it in its latest incarnation), the clients drives are mapped as \ClientC$ (so at least the &quot;UNC&quot;s are invisible to the explorer :-)) and show as &quot;Lokale Festplatte (C: on MYCLIENT)&quot; on my german localized Servers Explorer, below all other drives. New Folder seems to work.</p>
<p>@alegr: well, in most cases a UNC path is not changed while still being logged on. If it points to a server then the administrators deliberately have to change the name of the servers and convince all clients that nothing really happened when their sessions dropped, just move on (and relogon to the share). If it points to DFS, well then it&#39;s the administrators who have to take care that all servers with the same DFS name have the same content (greatly helped by DFS-Replication and such). Only in the case of TSClient-&quot;UNC&quot;-Paths the user itself can do so himself, perhaps without knowing what he&#39;s doing.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Exactly. If an administrator takes a server down, they know that they are screwing everybody who was using that server.

		<p>&gt; The ones created by Remote Desktop Device Redirection are shell instance objects, which is a way of creating certain types of shell extensions using just a handful of registry keys.</p>
<p>So when I connect through RDP, registry keys are being added? What if I connect from two places at once, in different sessions? Or if the power is yanked out, wouldn&#39;t the keys remain present?</p>

		<p>As I see, the arguments boils down to following:</p>
<p>Me: If RDP session gets reconnected, the explorer&#39;s back history should not get invalidated. If Explorer cannot go back because the folder is not there anymore, it&#39;s OK to display an error (just like for other cases of missing local and network locations). Other programs don&#39;t care, anyway, and will happily save a file back, if possible.</p>
<p>Raymond: If RDP session gets reconnected, it&#39;s OK to make it impossible to return back in Explorer history, even though the UNC still points to the same existing location.</p>

		<p>\tsclient is even more broken than I thought. If you make a shortcut to a location on it, it may or may not work after reconnect, depending on how you created the shortcut. If you opened the folder by \tsclientc path, you have more chances.</p>
<p>You have an Explorer window open with some \tsclient location. After reconnect, you will not be able to reopen that location in that window, even if you type the UNC path in it. But if you open another explorer window, and type the path in it, it will work. If in the meantime you open a CMD window, and type dir \tsclientc, it may not work, either. But dir \tsclientd (if there is D:) will work. After another reconnect, dir \tsclientc may now work.</p>
<p>If you have a pleasure of using Virtual PC for Windows 7, remember that \tsclient connection will break and reconnect EVERY TIME you resize the window, or switch to full screen. If you are copying any files to/from your host during that, you&#39;re SOL. I haven&#39;t checked if the HyperV client connection has the same bug.</p>

		<p>having IP address is already in the &quot;you should know what you&#39;re doing&quot; category. Using non-static ones raises the bar quite a bit towards &quot;you have to be insane to use it&quot;. At least in my opinion :-)</p>
<p>Despite that, you have additionally to be really unlucky (or have a really dumb DHCP server) so that the server you use loses it&#39;s IP during DHCP refresh and another server where you *also* have write access *and* which answers to the same UNC path coming along getting the same IP address while you notice nothing. Sure, if you work on detached sessions or so, but most use cases save work at least every few hours :-)</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command: I know my local machine drive letters well enough that I never actually tried to see them. Enumeration is so slow it&#39;s more efficient on my time to browse locally and copy the path via the clipboard. I&#39;ve got enough paths memorized that I can usually type them in.</p>

		<p>Oddly enough, you can &quot;map&quot; the drive with </p>
<p>net use * \tsclientd</p>
<p>and then everything works on the mapped drive</p>

		<p>I wish Microsoft added a FUSE-like framework to Windows. Then shell drives could be implemented as &quot;real&quot; drives.</p>
