		<p>I always thought that Icon represented filtering because it starts off wider at the top and is narrowed at the bottom to represent the smaller result set with the filter. &nbsp;Doesn&#39;t even remotely look like a coffee filter to me.</p>

		<p>The funnel icon just mirrors what Excel uses for its filtering. It makes sense that MS would have a common icon for a given feature. Other software (like SysInternals&#39; ProcMon) also use a funnel to represent filtering.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t see a connection to coffee, either. All I see is that lots of stuff goes in one end and few things come out the end.</p>

		<p>You know, as a non-coffee-drinker, all this time and I didn&#39;t make the coffee filter connection. I remember being confused the first time I tried to use something that used that funnel/filter/roughly-triangularly-shaped thing because I didn&#39;t connect it in my head with filter.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#39;s supposed to be &quot;funneling&quot; you to the right selections? Larger set funneled down to a smaller set? Probably a good example of a UI choice that might not have been the best in retrospect but is widely-known now.</p>

		<p>As avid coffee quaffer I must say that I never made the connection with coffee filters either. It&#39;s obviously a funnel, which is a bad metaphor for what it does since funnels don&#39;t funnel larger sets into smaller sets; they just squeeze the same set into a smaller bucket.</p>
<p>The stupid thing is that if I search the web for ‘filter icon’ I only get funnels, probably all inspired by Microsoft&#39;s use of the icon. So what would be a good metaphor? A sieve possibly?</p>

		<p>Well, a sieve might have been the right metaphor, but a funnel it was, a funnel it is, and a funnel ist stays. That&#39;s the thing with lock-in, inertia and &#39;never change a running system&#39;.</p>
<p>Or, as its often said, it was good enough for gramps, its good enough for me.</p>

		<p>The whole funnel thing did seem illogical. Coffee filter now that makes sense! Never thought of that before. Filter away the bitter coffee grinds to get the beautiful, refreshing lifeblood of the development world. &nbsp;It&#39;s coffee filter for me now. I think that is better than sieve because we filter data not sieve it.</p>

		<p>I always thought it was less representative of it&#39;s actual functionality of &quot;removing unwanted data&quot; and more the high-level goal of &quot;reducing the flow [of information] to manageable levels&quot;. Never made a coffee connection.</p>
<p>BTW: The &quot;uncommonly used things might have bugs&quot; obviously doesn&#39;t apply to security bugs, so if a security reviewer finds a non-security bug in the source, is that likely to be logged? (Not that it would make the bar to get fixed.) Or would that mean the security reviewer gets &quot;last touch&quot; status on that component?</p>

		<p>Having just looked at the Event Viewer in Windows 7 I see the funnel icon is still alive and well. But then, so are these: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_funnel" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Filter_funnel</a> (also can search for images of them). So we get the best of both paradigms! :-)</p>

		<p>The funnel as a filter symbol made sense to me as a metaphor from chemistry classes in high school (as in circular filter paper, fold into quarters, place in funnel). &nbsp;I had always assumed that to be the case, which shows that what is gobsmackingly obvious for one person is not always so for someone else. Plus, here is Australia, filtered coffee would not be thought of as the height of coffee geekdom.</p>
