		<p>In a similar vein to the &#8216;skipping CD&#8217; problem, about a week ago my main home PC hit an unexplained I/O error, playing music from my NAS system. Because of the I/O error, the music player looped playing the last buffer contents &#8211; which happened to sound exactly like the &#8216;click&#8230;whir&#8217; of a dying hard drive. Combine that noise &#8211; from a speaker near the RAID array &#8211; with the I/O error on screen: result, me spending several minutes trying to figure out which drive has failed and why it produced this result&#8230;</p>

		<p>I wish I could come up with some &quot;work free&quot; way of bilking individuals out of their wealth by calling my creations &quot;art.&quot; Get snooty and and saying critics aren&#8217;t smart/capable/avant-garde enough to understand it. Profit! If I&#8217;m really good, maybe I&#8217;ll get some grants too, or that British prize, the Turner&#8230;</p>
<p>A-flat for 15 minutes. Since I think &quot;defecate in a box&quot; and it&#8217;s various incarnations have won too many times.</p>

		<p>A co-worker had that network-timeout buffer-cached-loop skipping problem come up once upon a time, but it was techno music, so it was several minutes before he realized there was a problem.</p>

		<p>I would have assumed it was because of, you know, minimalism&#8230;</p>

		<p>As is happens, Music For 18 Musicians is one of my very favorite pieces of orchestral music. Yes, at a shallow level it may sound like endless repetition (apropos &quot;the CD player&#8217;s skipping&quot; comment; I have heard that said about the piece whan I&#8217;ve had it on in a semi-public work area), but the subtle variations are where this music breathes for me. And unbeknownst to me, it introduced my mind to a very common 6/8 bell pattern from Afro-Cuban folkloric music, a pattern that became explicit for me when I started studying that genre of music. Anyways, great music for working to, or riding a stationary bike.</p>

		<p>Heh&#8230; I have trouble when I need an audio CD at work, because the only time I do is when I buy one and haven&#8217;t brought it home.</p>
<p>Alas, people know me as the tech guy, so they ask me for MP3s and videos&#8230; but the don&#8217;t realize I don&#8217;t have mainstream music tastes. I basically ask my coworkers for generic music, since it beats responding with something strange.</p>

		<p>Eventually, I grew to love &quot;Music for 18 Musicians.&quot; &nbsp;Great to work to, but I&#8217;ve seen it give one person a headache.</p>
