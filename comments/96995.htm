		<p>How can 1 and 2 both be correct? Win95 has a undocumented flag to allocate memory that is shared by all processes. (From your TechNet article: &#8220;&#8230; that emulate the Windows 95 heap down to the very last detail&#8221;)</p>

		<p>To be specific, emulates the heap memory layout down to the very last detail. Because the shim is for programs that relied on details of the heap layout (usually inadvertently, such as the exact lifetime of memory after it has been freed).</p>

		<p>Win 95 doesn&#8217;t always have MSVCRT installed but it might be there depending on which features you selected during installation. Obviously, it is not the one from VC6 that most people depended on, probably 4.1 or 4.2.</p>

		<p>Since Windows 7 has shared memory there&#8217;s no reason they couldn&#8217;t implement the shared across processes flag. Obviously it would only work against processes that enabled EmulateHeap.</p>
<p>The only reasonable mistake that could be depended on is memory freed retains its value until the next allocation; this would actually be true with classical heap managers. To be fair, I used to abuse that, but only with malloc and free and when I knew the library version of malloc and free implemented a classical heap (that is, never returns free heap to the OS). I didn&#8217;t ever try it with the Windows heap allocation functions. I want to say because I didn&#8217;t know you could do that, but in fact I knew you couldn&#8217;t do that.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The only reasonable mistake that could be depended on is memory freed retains its value until the next allocation.&#8221; Um, no, they depended upon a lot more than that. I&#8217;ve vaguely recall one program that inadvertently relied on the fact that if they allocated memory, freed it, then allocated four more blocks of memory, the last block would be pointer-identical to the memory that they freed a while back. Something like that.</p>

		<p>Yeah, one of the major SQL vendors (not microsoft) had some really strange memory allocation issues. You could see when it started allocating memory quickly then it started logging internal memory inconsistency errors and connections locked up.</p>
<p>Of course we were the only customer reporting that issue (it was on their latest offering so no wonder) and it must be something wrong with the queries were were executing (wait what???).</p>
<p>They never fixed it. We found daily defragmenting the database and log file &amp; trying to get it to allocate a huge amount of memory upfront would let us keep the database running.</p>
<p>It turns out they have an A and B development team. The A developers write the new code, then release it and move on to their next bug creation phase. The B developers then have to hack fixes in. I&#8217;m not naming the vendor in case they sue.</p>

		<p>Which also reminded me of the VC6 small block heap debacle where the old VC5 allocator had to be added to MSVCRT. I think even some MS software was affected. I wonder if many would be considered security bugs nowadays.</p>

		<p>&#8220;They could have just written a program that does whatever they like and run it. [&#8230;] In this case, the attacker is attacking himself.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hmmm&#8230;..thinking about this brings to mind Return Oriented Programming.[0] There can exist situations where an attacker has no way of creating new executable code on a system, or even of modifying existing executable code, but is capable of running existing executable code in new, exciting, and previously not-considered ways, as but one step in a long series of leveraging small vulnerabilities into increasingly larger ones.[1]</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible that the attacker is not the user, and that the attacker is someone who does not have the ability to write a program that does whatever they like, but can somehow change the configuration of existing programs. Just because one person can&#8217;t imagine how a given bug might be turned into a vulnerability, that doesn&#8217;t mean that no-one else on the internet can.</p>

		<p>I agree with just about everything you&#8217;ve written (particularly that this is a reasonable design decision for compatibility mode), but I&#8217;m not sure about the &#8220;airtight hatchway&#8221; model.  Taken to its logical extreme, it suggests that we shouldn&#8217;t bother with defense in depth at all.</p>

		<p>I think his point is that if you install an insecure programme that doesn&#8217;t sanitize it&#8217;s inputs, then it&#8217;s not windows fault.</p>
<p>Things like ASLR make it more challenging, but you can&#8217;t stop a program from writing to it&#8217;s stack. Although CPU&#8217;s could sign stack frames<br />

		<p>Well, the truth is that the victim would probably set the compatibility mode without knowing that it has security implication, just to make the program run. It gets worse because the vendor has no incentive to fix their issue since there&#8217;s this handy work-around.</p>
<p>Then the attacker would simply profit from the situation as a side effect.</p>

		<p>In practice, this would be improbable. Why does Windows get all the viruses, even when other desktop OSes have security vulnerabilities too (as evidenced by their patches)? Because Windows has a 95% usage share. If I&#8217;m going to write a worm or a piece of spyware, I&#8217;m going to target that 95%, instead of the 1-4% of the other platforms.</p>
<p>In the same way, if I write malware, I&#8217;ll be aiming at a standard configuration. How many users will be running a 15-year-old version of some program under a current version of Windows? I guess there won&#8217;t be too much&#8230; If you still have doubts, see how Windows XP came out unscratched from the recent WannaCry attack, even if it is technically vulnerable. It seems that attackers didn&#8217;t bother to target an OS with less than 1% usage share.</p>

		<p>That depends on the attack. If it&#8217;s a generic &#8220;infect anything you see&#8221; type of attack (like WannaCry) then you are right. On the other hand there are more specific attacks on people, e.g. spearfishing. These could very well use knowledge that the victim uses a specific program.<br />
Then there are attacks like Nyetya this june which only attacked a specific program only a small subset of companies worldwide use, but with devastating effects nonetheless (shipping company Maersk lost up to 300 Million $). In this case the update mechanism was compromised, something unlikely for a program needing Win2000-mode (but could very well be for XP-mode programs), but there are other ways to compromise a system. And it only needs one infected computer in a company network&#8230;</p>

		<p>&gt; see how Windows XP came out unscratched from the recent WannaCry attack</p>
<p>&#8230; I wouldn&#8217;t call a BSOD loop (especially on embedded and/or medical equipement) as &#8220;coming out unscratched&#8221;.<br />
But yes, that was quite surprising, compared to what happens on Windows 7 (for example).<br />

		<p>I&#8217;ve never set the compatibility mode of something I didn&#8217;t REALLY need, let alone if one mode didn&#8217;t work and I had to keep going back in time. While I might not assume that there was a specific security vuln, I would absolutely assume that a broken program would be broken and vulnerable in many ways.</p>
