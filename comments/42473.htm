		<p>A good answer to those asking the question could be &quot;use delay loaded imports&quot; (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/vccore/html/vcconlinkersupportfordelayedloadingofdlls.asp" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/vccore/html/vcconlinkersupportfordelayedloadingofdlls.asp</a>)? The programmer must of course still add code for handling loader errors, but the framework for loading the imports on demand is already there, and it&#8217;s a smooth one.</p>

		<p>You can do this on Linux and MacOS X (iirc) using weak refs. It&#8217;s a useful technique, but requires support from the actual libraries you&#8217;re linking against (the symbols must be marked as weak). You can check if the symbol is null before calling it.</p>
<p>Typically, dlopen/GetProcAddress is a better way to proceed though, even if it is less convenient.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not saying that it can&#8217;t be done. I was trying to explain why allowing it to be done by default was a bad idea.  For example, how many people check for a null before using a weak ref or a delayloaded import? Do they even know or care that the function they are calling is weak/delayloaded? Apparently not, because I&#8217;ve seen apps crash due to a failed delayloaded import &#8211; we&#8217;ve reinvented the Windows 3.1 Unrecoverable Application Error dialog.</p>

		<p>Of course you did not say anything like it couldn&#8217;t be done, and I did not for once think that <em>you</em> did not know about it. However, I thought it would be a good thing letting people know about delay-loaded imports, in case they did not already know.</p>
<p>When it comes to handling loader failures for delay-loaded imports, the linker documentation is very clear stating that your code &quot;must handle errors robustly&quot; and elaborates on how it can be done through exceptions (SEH) or hooks. If used correctly, I even think it’s less error-prone than having a bunch of GetProcAddress-calls scattered throughout your code. After all, many crashes I see on my computers are due to failure of checking return values and dereferencing null pointers. And you wouldn’t use delay-loaded imports indeliberately (using a weak reference is another thing, even another OS).</p>
<p>By the way, I love reading your retrospects on things like the system tr&#8230; uhm, notification area. Please keep them coming! :)</p>

		<p>I see the point here, but what about a more pressing issue (at least for me):-</p>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t CoCreateInstance() load a library using LoadLibraryEx() and not LoadLibrary() &#8230; it makes it significantly harder to chain DLL loading in a COM object?</p>

		<p>If you forward to a function, it still has to exist.</p>
