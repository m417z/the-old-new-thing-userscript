		<p>This seems similar to the way many voters choose one candidate over the other: it&#39;s the only name they recognize. &nbsp;(Whether or not the candidate is a &quot;bad one&quot; is entirely another matter).</p>

		<p>Thus demonstrating again that people assume that &quot;more popular&quot; is &quot;better&quot;. :p</p>

		<p>@EnaiSiaion, voting contests, be it political or entertainment, have shown time after time that it&#39;s all just about popularity.</p>
<p>The vast majority of the voting people can&#39;t assess the (lack of) qualities of the ones they&#39;re judging, so we&#39;re left with the common base of popularity, sensation, etc.</p>
<p>I refrain from voting on things I&#39;m totally ignorant about. On the other hand, I don&#39;t feel like I have to be an expert to vote.</p>

		<p>People may not know a candidate to vote FOR but often remember which ones to vote AGAINST. This is why negative political ads work so well.</p>
<p>Of course after a campaign season filled with negative ads I often vote Libertarian or wish to write in None Of The Above because I am sick of all of them.</p>

		<p>At least nowadays you can vote on your favorite 80s pop songs from the comfort of your own kitchen table.</p>
<p>Well, as long as you have a stamp.</p>

		<p>Part of the problem is that there&#39;s a long line of people waiting to vote and many people haven&#39;t seen the ballot until stepping into the booth. &nbsp;So, they feel pressured to be quick and the quickest way to vote is going by name recognition. &nbsp;To me, voting always felt like a school test. &nbsp;I felt weird bringing reference materials into the booth with me. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Making the ballot available online helps. &nbsp;I like vote by mail. &nbsp;Then I can do all the research I want and take as long as I need without inconveniencing anyone else.</p>

		<p>@Marc K: if there were one voting booth at the polling place, then I can understand what you&#39;re saying, but I haven&#39;t seen anything like that in any election. &nbsp;The olling places that I typically see have upwards of ten booths, so even if a few people take their time, there are enough booths available to keep the line moving. &nbsp;There&#39;s also the time factor to consider. &nbsp;Voting takes time out of one&#39;s day, and perhaps people just want to get it over with and back to their regular lives quickly.</p>
<p>In my area, ballots are provided online generally a few weeks before the actual voting day. &nbsp;Sometimes the problem is actually finding the ballot (though search engines and local newspapers should help minimize that issue). &nbsp;More likely people may not even be aware that the ballot is online in the first place.</p>
<p>I like to do research, too, though since the voting date is generally known well in advance of the day, I do my reasearch in advance, and thus when I get to the booth I already know which way I&#39;m going to vote.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m just curious about the songs you didn&#39;t recognise, Raymond. &nbsp;Did the &#39;director&#39; of your dream put real songs on the list (so you don&#39;t think you remember the songs, but they are embedded in your subconscious) or just make up song titles to fit the narrative?</p>
<p>To me dreams are a weird window into the weirdest organ of the body &#8211; the brain. &nbsp;I generally don&#39;t recall a thing about my dreams, which is good since the post-dream analysis would do the rest of my head in.</p>
