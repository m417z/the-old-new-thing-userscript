		<p>I saw a new low in opt-out marketing this week. I phoned a company and my call was held in a queue, and in among the holding music and the &quot;your call is important to us&quot; messages was a message informing me that the company WILL send me marketing mailings unless I tell the rep who eventually answers my call that I don&#8217;t want any.</p>
<p>If I&#8217;d been ignoring all the rubbish that&#8217;s played during holding, I&#8217;d have missed the message.</p>
<p>When my call was eventually answered, I told the rep I didn&#8217;t want to receive any junk mail, as per the holding message. She said &quot;Hang on, I&#8217;m not sure what I have to do about that; I&#8217;ll go and check.&quot; Evidently I was the first to notice and act on the opt-out.</p>

		<p>Now if only the people responsible for designing Group Policy settings would listen to Raymond&#8230;</p>
<p>I know this isn&#8217;t Raymond&#8217;s area, but seriously, 50% of the Group Policy settings involve at least one negative, and half of those are double negatives (with the additional complication of figuring out what Not Configured means).</p>

		<p>Yes, some of the Group Policy settings are really confusing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I suspect that some things were always turned off or not allowed, and there&#8217;s now a setting to remove this &quot;not allowed&quot; state, and the people who describe the feature apparnetly can&#8217;t figure out any good way to word the option. &nbsp;</p>

<p>&quot;If you would like to receive business or career-related offers from Penton Media you do not have to respond to this email. &nbsp;You can easily opt out each time you receive an email from us if you don&#8217;t find the information useful and worthwhile.&quot;</p>
<p>I had not subscribed to any of their emails, but they took it upon themselves to add me and then I would have to remove myself I to opt out. &nbsp;I had never opted in to start off with!</p>

		<p>David Walker: The easier solution would be to simply change the default state of the checkbox, and word the message in an easy-to-understand fashion. As opposed to keeping the default checkbox state the same and going through verbal contortions to attempt to explain it.</p>
<p>Hopefully, Microsoft does this when it rolls out new products. IE&#8217;s Internet Settings -&gt; Advanced dialog contains a lot of confusing checkboxes also, even in IE7. :(</p>

		<p>On a spoofed site I once designed a long form where one advertisement-checkbox would simply return to its initial state after 2 seconds :-)</p>
<p>And another one that just disappeared if you moved the mouse near it so you couldn&#8217;t uncheck it</p>

		<p>What makes it worse is that in some local spoken language (Reading, Berks, UK) the double-negative actually is a negative. &nbsp;So even if you did have a degree in philosophy you&#8217;d still have to reverse engineer the dialect that the author was writting-in</p>

		<p>I had the very same argument last week with our marketing dept when they wanted a new checkbox on our website. I told them double negative check boxes are two-faced, evil and nefarious (then I had to explain it in words they understood). But I won. Kind of. The new checkbox is an upright model of checkbox citizenship, the existing three remain evil. I&#8217;m working on it, doing my bit, bit by bit.</p>
<p>(To make it worse the double negatives are for services people actually want (and pay for); I&#8217;ve decided marketing just like being evil for the hell of it.)</p>
<p>The IE7 &quot;[X] Setting ABC-ON|OFF&quot; thing is one of the three dreadful things in IE7&#8217;s UI &#8212; which idiot decided that was a good idea? (menu layout and Refresh+Stop button placement being the other two. IMO).</p>

		<p>Replace the web page with the human (um, scumbag) who wrote that sentence. Image he told you verbally:</p>
<p>&quot;Uncheck this box if you do not wish to receive electronic communications from XYZ.&quot;</p>
<p>Makes more sense now? He is giving you instructions in the conventional sense.</p>
<p>The problem is most people still have not learned to how to communicate effectively on-line. Those web page authors need to brush up on their Communications degrees.</p>

		<p>Single-negative checkboxes are bad. &nbsp;Double-negatives are monstrous. &nbsp;But I don&#8217;t think the first example is actually trying to be misleading. &nbsp;It&#8217;s just the result of ignorance, and the fact that they certainly insist on the default must be to opt-in. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A smarter option would be to reverse the meaning of the check, default it to unchecked, and instruct the user to &quot;Check this box if you do not wish to receive electronic communications from XYZ.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Arguably, that would be sneakier. &nbsp;But at least it&#8217;s only a single-negative. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s a checkbox without a caption with some accompanying descriptive text. &nbsp;It makes a certain amount of sense in that context.</p>
<p>The problem is that the descriptive text can be interpreted as if it were a caption, which introduces the double-negative and confusing meaning.</p>
<p>If the checkbox were changed to have a conventional caption or the descriptive text were sufficiently separated from the checkbox, then it would be ok.</p>

		<p>Similar to the Group Policy Options settings, I was working with Microsoft.SqlServer.Management.Smo.ScriptingOptions in Visual Studio yesterday. &nbsp;The options include normal things like ANSIPadding, IncludeDatabaseContext, and IncludeHeaders, which you can set to True or False.</p>
<p>The options also include this horrendous mess:</p>
<p>NoCommandTerminator (True|False)</p>
<p>NoExecuteAs (True|False)</p>
<p>NoIdentities (True|False)</p>
<p>NoVarDecimal (True|False)</p>
<p>&#8230;along with many others whose name starts with &quot;No&quot;. &nbsp;I would like to strangle the person/department/Project Manager who wrote/approved those options. &nbsp;</p>
<p>As far as I know, there is no historical precedent in SQL options that says the options in SMO need to be worded in this way. &nbsp;AAAAArghhhhh!!!</p>

		<p>There are many undocumented (yet?) options in Windows that I love to discover with RegMon/ProcMon. The ones that start with &quot;No&quot; are in fact easy to understand. I just set them to 0 and never had any problems.</p>
