		<p>I&#8217;d suspect the question is specific to 64bit programs, in order to make sure their programs deal cleanly with addresses that don&#8217;t fit in 32bits (old code base).</p>
<p>Call the magic &quot;allocateall4GB&quot;, and then, all future allocations will have more bits than fit in DWORD. Anything that does not handle it properly will hopefully crash.</p>

		<p>&quot;AllocationPreference&quot; is &quot;much easier&quot;l well it seems to work on server operating systems, I&#8217;d rather use something I know will work.</p>
<p>We used virtual alloc, or one big malloc, like the questionner did. &nbsp;(This was years ago now)</p>
<p>this is done to run automated test to catch at run time any problem where the pointers could be truncated. In large programs, we can&#8217;t catch them all with compiler warning. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Even with smaller programs, we can have people use the wrong macro or data member in a VARIANT-like union to get a pointer.</p>

		<p>Actually, the 16-bit Windows API included a stress-testing function called AllocDiskSpace; as I recall, this created a STRESS.EAT file that filled the disk.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>That function was not part of the 16-bit Windows API; it was in a stress test helper library that came with the SDK. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<blockquote><p>
  Is there a AllocateAllRemainingDiskSpaceAndFillExistingFilesWithZeroes function?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Hey, I want one of these, but maybe without the FillExistingFilesWithZeros part.</p>
<p>Filling up a multi-TB disk is so tedious these days and SetFileValidData() requires special privileges. I want an API that anybody can call, that will fill up the whole disk (up to their quota), and creates files that only SYSTEM can access.</p>
<p>Removing the leftover SYSTEM-only files that will inevitably result from abusing this API is somebody else&#8217;s problem. :-)</p>

		<p>The default process heap on 64 bit is below 4 GB unless AllocationPreference is changed to force top-down allocations.</p>

<p>So what are you filling the diskspace with? If you&#8217;ll leaving it as is- you effectively got a security hole.</p>
<p>As you immediately have read access to all the contents of deleted files. Why do you think SetValidData() requires privs?</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to overwrite a large chunk of a disk &#8211; it&#8217;s going to be slow &#8211; I can&#8217;t see what you can do about it. (Except to be clever with threads).</p>

		<p>That must be a really old question, as I haven&#8217;t had to deal with x64 porting issues for close to a year.</p>
<p>As some have guessed, the point was to debug code that, scarily enough, had some sections that had gone from win16 to win32 to winx64. &nbsp;Pavel lended an advisory hand to me back in those days while I wrestled with a number of memory and performance issues.</p>
<p>I ended up setting the top-down pref and still wrote a FillUp4GB() (or something like that) function. &nbsp;Compiler warnings about truncation were also immensely helpful. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Even before the days of x64 (when we still had builds for nt 5 on the alpha), my team at the time used general memory allocation replacements that could be toggled to fail from the help menu (internal builds) and address-space filling tricks. &nbsp;Screwing with otherwise repeated initial conditions may not be the best way to test, but I find it an invaluable one. &nbsp;Thanks for mocking my question (and using my name) on your blog. &nbsp;I am now immortal in the eyes of my peers.</p>
