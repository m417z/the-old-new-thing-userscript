		<p>Whereas with iTunes you just tick the &quot;Remember playback position&quot; box in the track info window.</p>
<p>And you wonder why the Zune is a flop?</p>

		<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say the Zune is a flop; next to the iPod ANYTHING will look like a flop. &nbsp;However, I do question the decision to go with brown, not to mention the &quot;squirt&quot; terminology. &nbsp;Maybe it&#8217;s just me, but if I was marketing a product I don&#8217;t think I would want people to associate it with diarrhea (brown squirts).</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, I for once, hate iTunes and the iPod with all my heart. I haven&#8217;t used a Zune yet, but there are many players out there not so overpriced and much superior to Apples cr*p.</p>

		<p>I wonder how someone can mention &quot;iTunes&quot; and &quot;some other product being bad&quot; in the same breath. &nbsp;The iPod is a fantastic bit of hardware, but I will never ever own one and the reason is I just cannot force myself to use iTunes. &nbsp;My first ever mp3 player had 32 megs (yes megs) of storage and connectied with a parallel-to-proprietary-serial cable, and the bespoke software that came with <em>that</em> is better than iTunes, in my opinion.</p>
<p>And it <em>is</em> only my opinion, but with any other mp3 player on the market, I have a choice. &nbsp;I can use windows media player, or I can use winamp, or I can use Amarok, or just about anything at all. &nbsp;With the Ipod I don&#8217;t have this choice</p>

		<p>iTunes on Windows could really benefit from being written as a Windows applications rather than a port of an Apple application. &nbsp;Same goes for QuickTime. &nbsp;I have a fairly decent machine, but those two applications run like dogs.</p>

		<p>Well, the silent majority actually found this very useful. &nbsp;I listen to a few podcasts and never thought too much about the behavior.</p>
<p>Why? &nbsp;It just works.</p>
<p>It turns out, the podcasts I listen to I subscribed through the &quot;podcasts&quot; interface and they are all set up properly.</p>
<p>But, say I find a podcast in the future that isn&#8217;t set up correctly. &nbsp;Now I can fix it.</p>

		<p>On the plus side, it&#8217;s actually possible to move items from the Music to Podcast section and back &#8211; on the iPod, I found it nearly impossible to change audiobooks that have been misplaced in the Music section back to Audiobook. (disclaimer: not my iPod)</p>
<p>Just wondering &#8211; if you add Podcast as a second genre instead of replacing whatever is there, would that get this effect to work? I don&#8217;t actually have a Zune, so I can&#8217;t check myself&#8230;</p>

		<p>I didn&#8217;t expect to find a tip like this here. &nbsp;Thanks, Raymond! &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been meaning to figure out how to do this, but I was going to go the route of uploading audio books to my web space and figuring out how to publish them as podcasts. &nbsp;This is much better.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been setting up a playlist for each audiobook and have just lived with it losing my position whenever it (rarely) cold boots or I want to listen to something else. &nbsp;I&#8217;m looking forward to be able to shuffle my music again without getting an audio book track every 2 songs.</p>

		<p>Again, it&#8217;s a matter of flexibility and accomodating different preferences, versus than &quot;we know what&#8217;s good for you, resistance is futile&quot; attitude.</p>

		<p>Frymaster: You can use Amarok quite happily with an ipod. Mine would be a fairly expensive paperweight otherwise.</p>
<p>I presume the same applies to Rhythmbox and probably several other players too.</p>
<p>Token disclaimer: I don&#8217;t know if you can use it with a Zune. This comment hence may or may not be on topic.</p>

		<p>So, it used to make me sad that for a long time, you&#8217;d include preemptive snarky comments at the bottom of each of your posts.</p>
<p>Basically it seemed that the negative commenters had gotten inside your head.</p>
<p>Thanks for continuing to post helpful and interesting information like this, even though your blog is probably a lot more popular than you intended it to be, with all that comes along with that.</p>

		<p>Step 1 would be finding somewhere that sells them in the UK. :( Shame the Zune is still US-only as it seems a decent bit of kit after the recent updates.</p>

		<p>you know that Zune 3.1 supports audiobooks, right? You can use the Overdrive Media Console to add audiobooks to your Zune.</p>
<p>There are some tools out there that can easily create a &quot;.wax&quot; file from an MP3 in audiobook form.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.zuneboards.com/forums/zune-marketplace/35932-audiobooks-help.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.zuneboards.com/forums/zune-marketplace/35932-audiobooks-help.html</a></p>
<p>I feel that using the &quot;Genre=podcast&quot; method is a little inflexible &#8211; you can&#8217;t set album art for example &#8211; that was what really prevented me from going that route :).</p>

<p>If you don&#8217;t like comments, delete them. People will learn not to post comments displeasurable to you very quickly (though there will always be an influx of new targets, of course).</p>
<p>On the other hand, maybe the current situation where you simply call people out does make for the most entertaining reading, so I wouldn&#8217;t say I&#8217;m in favor of such measures.</p>

		<p>Raymond, you&#8217;re probably not seeing consistent results with Drag/Drop because the groveler is asynchronous. In fact, the groveler should have started up on the change instead of the Drag. &nbsp;You might just be racing the groveler when you browse the UI.</p>
<p>Also, any reason why you don&#8217;t edit the metadata in Zune? I can see checking the file timestamps first outside the app, but after that, the metadata editing UI should be sufficient &#8211; and the collection update should happen instantly upon saving the new Genre/Album/Artist.</p>
<p>Power Tip: You can even do some of this with drag/drop metadata editing if you change the Genre last&#8230;</p>
<div class="post">[<i>My first attempt was editing the metadata in Zune, but that didn&#8217;t move it to the Podcast library; it just sat in the music library with genre Podcast. I just tried it again &#8211; no dice. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Peter: I think it depends on the iPod; my brother has a new model nano and found Amarok didn&#8217;t work; iTunes is pretty much the only reason he maintains a windows PC at all* (or maybe it depends on the brother, he might just fail ;) )</p>
<p>*personally I&#8217;m OS-agnostic &#8211; I have both linux and windows because both are useful for different tasks &#8211; but some people are a bit more&#8230; militant&#8230; about these things</p>

		<p>I use my N95 for podcasts and it looses it&#8217;s place if you turn the phone off. Can be quiet annoying.</p>
<p>I would love a Zune, but they&#8217;re not available in the UK :-(</p>
<p>I apologise for talking about iTunes &#8211; but one of the features I am eagerly awaiting in Windows 7 is popper support for AAC files in Media Player (at the moment I can play them, but can&#8217;t seem to burn them). As a former iTunes user, I feel Microsoft could do more to convert customers from a rival product (without the obvious answer of transcoding).</p>

		<p>You can edit the metadata in Zune, but you have to remove the files from Zune and then re-add them to make them move over to the Podcast section.</p>

		<p>So I guess my question is, when I rip a CD (let&#8217;s say using WMP) how exactly is file creation determined. &nbsp;Are all the files the same creation time, or do they tick up in the seconds it taks to rip the song (thus ensuring if I rip an entire CD at once, and all the tracks are in order, the timestamps should work.)</p>

		<p>tsrblke: &nbsp;Here&#8217;s what you do:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Insert an audio CD to rip.</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Start your CD ripping program (let&#8217;s say WMP).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Rip the CD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Look at the creation times.</p>

</ol>
<p>Repeat the experiment until you&#8217;ve answered all your questions, and report back here with your results.</p>
