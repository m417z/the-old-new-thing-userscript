		<p>Don&#8217;t get me started on marketing stuff. &nbsp;Just the other night I got a call from an auto-dialer at American Express. &nbsp;It informed me &quot;there are no available agents to speak to you at this time, but if you&#8217;d like to speak to an agent you can call us back at ###.&quot; &nbsp;Huh, why is the computer still dialing numbers if there are no agents to connect it too?</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem is that, to optimize the process, the software dials you by the time it expects the agent to finish the conversation (so the agent will be connected with you and can start talking immediately, rather than twiddling his thumbs through the dial sequence). Unsurprisingly, its predictions are only 95% accurate, so welcome to the unfortunate 5%.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>It is called anticipatory dialing. In order to serve you better, the autodialer assumes that an agent will become available by the time you pick up. That way you do not get a cranky agent who has been waiting a long time for the opportunity to serve you.</p>
<p>This practice used to result in a lot of dead calls: &quot;Hello? Hello? Is anybody there?&quot; Some jurisdictions now have laws, not banning the practice, but limiting the percentage of calls left hanging more than a limited time.</p>
<p>The recorded message is serving you twice as well by predialing aggressively and avoiding a dead line rule at the same time.</p>

		<p>I regret ever getting a Chase credit card. They call constantly (several eper week), and some of the agents are pushy and rude. &nbsp;I had one tell me &quot;please listen and don&#8217;t interrupt&quot;. &nbsp;Then, after the spiel about a service to pay my bill if I can&#8217;t, I said I had a service, called a savings account. &nbsp;He hung up on me. &nbsp;Now I threaten to cancel the card when they call due to too many calls. &nbsp;And I will, if it keeps up.</p>

<p>You should. I used to have Sprint long-distance phone service. They kept telemarketing me for the same service even though I was already a customer &#8211; and I told their customer service to stop marketing to me. Eventually I canceled my service and never heard from them again.</p>
<p>Chase doesn&#8217;t call me anymore but they keep sending me &quot;convience checks&quot; &#8211; great way for mail theives to also steal my money.</p>

		<p>Aren&#8217;t companies using autodialers required to put a human on the line within 2 seconds of you asking for one? So if Amex is using autodialers without (enough) human backing behind them they&#8217;re breaking the rules (maybe even the law, not sure whether this is just something the FCC came up with or if it&#8217;s an actual law).</p>

		<p>My favorite part is the fact that the letter was sent December 10th. &nbsp;I heard once that banks know the best times to notify customers of fee increases are August and December, because those two months people are frequently on vacation and may not be able to pay as careful attention to bills. &nbsp;This letter was very carefully designed to be lost or forgotten during the holiday rush, allowing them months or years worth of &quot;opt-in&quot; direct advertising.</p>
<p>Shameful and disgusting.</p>

		<p>One thing I noticed down the bottom of the letter is that if you move house, your marketing preferences get reset again.</p>
<p>Because, you know, you only opted out because you didn&#8217;t have a mailbox that could handle the load before, right?</p>

		<p>While I apppreciate your annoyance I think this is totally inevitable; when you have a product that&#8217;s hard to enhance, the only way to really generate more business is through marketing, even when you have an enhancable product marketing is often easier than recruiting genuine talent to enhance that product: marketers are &#8216;people persons&#8217; and are good at (oddly enough) marketing themselves and their ideas, which generally tend to be about the benefits of more marketing.</p>
<p>Companies will mail and email you a neverending stream of crap because it makes money, and they will also telemarket constantly until it&#8217;s made illegal because, despite virtually everyone hating it, it STILL makes money. Most people are passive and somewhat dim; they can be made to buy/spend small increments without a lot of effort.</p>
<p>To provide some balance, the marketing environment in the USA/UK is fairly oblique compared with the developing world, where entire gameshows on primetime TV literally advertise one product repeatedly for 3 hours straight &#8211; and are popular, and when commercial breaks can consist of the exact same 30-second advert repeated 6 times back to back.</p>

		<p>John: &quot;I propose we put all marketers on a space ship and rocket them directly into the sun.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an unnecessarily cruel suggestion. I believe the correct etiquette in such situations is to load them onto a spaceship and send them &quot;ahead&quot; of the rest of us to colonise a new world? ;-)</p>

		<p>This reminds of when Yahoo introduced it&#8217;s marketing preferences a few years ago.</p>
<p>They did the same thing of resetting all the marketing settings to the default.</p>
