		<p>On a tangent, there are also things that I wish did not be translated. IIS likes to translate the names of .net errors (and exceptions) to the language of the machine its running on. Unfortunately that makes it very hard to use Google (or Bing) to find out whats wrong.</p>
<p>A search for NullReferenceException in module blah, tends to get a gazillion hits, a search for NulReferenceUndtagelse i modulet blah tends to get 0. All the people with the technical knowledge to make sense of the error are quite capable of reading english anyway.</p>

		<p>Localizing exception error messages is one thing, but the type names should not be localized in some fake camel casing. The actual type exists and has a name. The searching-on-the-web aspect is a sure reason to modify local thread culture in some desperate cases (unless, of course, that throws off other things).</p>

		<p>Raymond: I&#39;m not surprised, but IMO the ability to communicate clearly is more important than personal comfort. &nbsp;When English is the de facto worldwide language of programming, doing it that way is really a disservice to them because it makes it harder to communicate and thus harder to work productively. And I think most good programmers would agree that the ability to communicate clearly is the second-most important skill a programmer needs, after the ability to reason in formal logic.</p>
<p>I once heard a German guy talking about how when he was a kid, his English classes in school were incredibly problematic, to the point where he had convinced himself that it was something he was completely incapable of learning. &nbsp;Then he decided he wanted to be a pilot. &nbsp;He was dismayed to find out that the international language of aviation is English and he&#39;d never fly airplanes if he couldn&#39;t speak it, but once he had the motivation, it was surprisingly easy to pick up. &nbsp;Today he speaks clear (if accented) English, and it helped him have a long and successful career as an airline pilot.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>The question is whether people hacking out software in their basement for fun should be held to the same standard as professional programmers. Do we want to limit recreational programming to people who have the linguistic aptitude, access to education, and motivation to learn English? (The .NET people appear to believe the answer is &quot;No&quot;. Like I said, that decision has been controversial.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

<p>And this is why ALL the translations MUST be approved by programmers or other people who have a clue. Otherwise it brings awful and ridiculous monstrosities.</p>

		<p>Last try to get this through the comment system&#8230; Fourth try now, and the last three haven&#39;t given me the confirmation message.</p>
<p>You&#39;re claiming that people who don&#39;t want to learn English are too stupid to write good code. I&#39;m honestly not sure how to respond to that.</p>
<p>Imagine if your first &quot;SYNTAX ERROR IN LINE 10&quot; was in Russian, and you realized that you had to learn a whole new language just to understand how to write in BASIC. This is before you learned that you want to make a career of programming, because you haven&#39;t even written a program yet. Do you really think that you would have taken the time to learn Russian just to get started in the hobby? Wouldn&#39;t you have appreciated an English localization of the programming tools?</p>

		<p>Sometimes things get translated that really shouldn&#39;t be. For example, &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd798683(v=vs.85).aspx&gt;:" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/dd798683(v=vs.85).aspx&gt;:</a></p>
<p>cdaudio type track number   Returns the type of the specified track number. This can be &quot;audio&quot; or &quot;other.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;audio&quot; and &quot;other&quot; were translated in at least Win98 through XP, even though they&#39;re part of the interface.</p>

		<p>&gt;Do we want to limit recreational programming to people who have the linguistic aptitude, access to education, and motivation to learn English?</p>
<p>Well, with the worldwide Internet, access to education is trivial these days. &nbsp;And it takes a non-trivial degree of linguistic aptitude to pick up a programming language at all.</p>
<p>As for motivation, I can&#39;t speak for everyone but most of the kids learning to write code that I&#39;ve ever known&#8211;myself included&#8211;were doing it because they wanted to become professional programmers one day. &nbsp;From the day I first discovered BASIC I knew that that was what I wanted to do with my life, and now I&#39;m doing it.</p>
<p>Niklaus Wirth apparently thought it was a good idea. &nbsp;He was Swiss, but when he created Pascal with the specific intention of making an educational language that was easy to learn to code in, he did the whole thing in English, and this was decades ago before the rise of the Internet. &nbsp;It&#39;s only become more important since then. &nbsp;As one of the smartest and most influential guys in the history of programming language design, that&#39;s worth considering IMO.</p>
<p>And WRT the last bit of the question, it could be generalized as &quot;do we want to limit programming to only people with certain intellectual qualifications?&quot; &nbsp;And I&#39;m sorry if this upsets anyone, but I would answer that with a resounding &quot;YES!&quot; &nbsp;Because I&#39;m not just a computer programmer, but also a computer *user*, and I&#39;m sick of using software that feels like it was was written by morons. &nbsp;Having barriers to entry in place to keep out people who shouldn&#39;t be writing code in the first place can only be a good thing, for much the same reason as we have medical licenses to keep incompetent people from becoming doctors.</p>
<p>(Yes, I know you were writing about hobbyist programmers. &nbsp;But when anyone can get free or nearly-free hosting and post something they wrote on the Web for folks to download, it sort of blurs the distinction between hobbyists and professionals in terms of their ability to reach an audience with their work.)</p>
<p>[Second attempt to post this.]</p>

		<p>@@Mason Wheeler (I wish people would stop using &quot;@someone&quot; as a name): I didn&#39;t know English when I started programming. For the longest time I had no idea what &quot;?ILLEGAL QUANTITY &nbsp;ERROR&quot; meant, and I certainly had no clue how to pronounce it. All I knew is that &quot;?ILLEGAL QUANTITY &nbsp;ERROR&quot; appeared because I did something very specific wrong, because I&#39;d never seen it before (unlike &quot;?SYNTAX &nbsp;ERROR&quot;).</p>
<p>This doesn&#39;t steepen the learning curve as much as you might think. The computer starts out as a mysterious device that operates on arcane incantations producing results that, while repeatable, are not initially comprehensible to the uninitiated mind. Having mnemonics in your native tongue is not a particularly big help in overcoming this essential obstacle and may even be a hindrance. The first thing you learn is exactly the limited subset necessary to program, which barely even resembles a natural language.</p>
<p>The basic *idea* behind programming I of course learned from material in my native tongue, but this has nothing to do with localization &#8212; the equivalent would be an English manual to go with your Russian machine, that may even helpfully display the squiggly bits the computer shows and explains under what circumstances they appear, without mentioning Russian at all. Nobody would dispute that that&#39;s a useful thing to have.</p>
<p>By the same token, though, I guess I&#39;m arguing against both Mason and Raymond (or rather the people he&#39;s proxying for) as well. Because, no, I didn&#39;t do anything (and that includes learning English) because I wanted to be a professional computer programmer. I did it because, well, computers are the coolest thing ever. And if you&#39;re the sort of hobbyist who thinks that, then having localization (or not) isn&#39;t the kind of thing that matters. If you&#39;re really into it because you want to be &quot;professional&quot; one day, then I guess it might.</p>
<p>I did, obviously, learn actual English that humans use, but this had little to do with computers.</p>

		<p>@JM: That kind of remind me that when I was 6, I was trying to play a game on 5 1/4 inch disk, and greeted with some &quot;ABORT, RETRY or IGNORE?&quot; error message.</p>
<p>I have no idea of what to do at that time (English is not my native language).</p>
<p>Year later I developed interest on computer programming. I went dive in English computing books section of local library, and a few years later, my English subject acedemic result was way better than most of my classmates.</p>

<p>And since we&#39;re at localization, the Windows built-in MUI support is clearly inadequate when it comes to plurals &#8211; there&#39;s a bunch of weird phrasing around the UI everywhere where counted elements are involved.</p>

		<p>As we talk about the localization, almost everything is translated in Windows when you use a localized version. Language Packs do translate most things you see; the most notable exception is that device names stay in the localized language.</p>
<p>I have to agree with @ender, support for plurals is not adequate. For example, in Russian plurals are not formed by adding &#39;-(e)s&#39; to the end of a word. The things get even more complicated when you have to display: 0 items, 1 item, 2 items, 5 items — you have use different forms of the noun depending on the number: 0 элементов, 1 элемент, 2 элемента, 5 элементов.</p>
<p>Even more to it, Russian version of Windows 7 had the famous hole in Start menu. Fortunately, the hole has been fixed with SP1.</p>
<p>Many translated strings look as though taken out of context, sometimes they don&#39;t fit into the dialog boxes, some menus become too wide. I understand the number of the strings to translate grows with every new version, but it appears the localization gets less attention and then localized product does not look as smooth as the original English version.</p>

		<p>@Drak: You can change the &quot;System Locale&quot; to English, and then get most system-wide components to adhere to he.</p>
<p>I learned to program on a ZX81 Spectrum at the age of 10, when my English language knowledge was quite limited. I didn&#39;t need &quot;PRINT&quot;, &quot;GOSUB&quot; or &quot;SYNTAX ERROR&quot; translated to my native langauge &#8211; Hebrew. I did have Hebrew-language documentation (a book), and that was helpful.</p>

		<p>@@Mason Wheeler: Does my first &quot;SYNTAX ERROR IN LINE 10&quot; (well I didn&#39;t start with VB, lucky me, so not that exact message) in English count because I&#39;m german? I&#39;d think so. And as you see, I managed just fine, as I&#39;m sure all good programmers will. After all learning new things (APIs, languages, programming concepts,..) is an integral part of programming and a bit inquisitiveness (how does this work?) is more than just helpful too.</p>
<p>So basically the only people we &quot;lose&quot; here are those that aren&#39;t interested in learning new things anyhow and those really don&#39;t make good programmers in my experience. And the millions of non-native English speaking programmers around the world show that it&#39;s easy enough to learn programming if you want to anyhow.</p>
<p>On the other hand those annoying translations caused me having to track down the IT guy at my first work and get him to change the language on my machine, because I certainly didn&#39;t want to having translate every error message in my head from german into its likely english counterpart (also I really prefer the whole GUI in english to begin with).</p>

		<p>Looks like some strings are never localized (for example the product name &#8211; Windows)</p>

		<p>Trademarks are still made available to the localizability system because some trademarks have local variants.</p>
