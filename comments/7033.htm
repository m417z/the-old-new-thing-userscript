		<p>&quot;We never did hear back from the customer, so the world may never know whether my psychic prediction was correct.&quot;</p>
<p>I think when you never hear back from a customer you can assume that your psychic predictions were correct.</p>

		<p>I wish that Bonus chatter existed in more documentation. It always seems like there&#39;s four api&#39;s for accomplishing something, and odds are I&#39;m going to pick the overly complicated one.</p>

<p>Did you expect a response?</p>
<p>They asked a question; you answered it. If you want to hear back, I would suggest stating your answer in the form of a question.</p>
<p>Exempli gratia: &quot;Did you give your menu item the right ID, and are you returning the right value from IContextMenu::QueryContextMenu?&quot;</p>

		<p>@jader3rd: the probability of using the over-complicated solution, ironically, is even greater if you do your homework and google the answer: there are many blogs and programming sites that explain the complicated (and, to be fair, more general) way of solving a problem, instead of the simple one that works most of the time and requires half the code. It&#39;s the same as recommending Nero burning ROM, with its ten-page disk burning wizard capable of mixed CD-DA/CD-ROM disks and other authoring extravagances, to a friend who only needs to backup his Documents folder.</p>

<p>Yes. I originally thought that its missing was due to an artifact of such messages not being relayed back to the engineers. Now I know better.</p>

<p>Chances are the customer liaison was just as in the dark about the accuracy of your psychic predictions as you were. They probably never heard back from the customer either.</p>

		<p>Raymond, I want to personally thank you on behalf of all the customers who have not. You&#39;re a brilliant individual with phenomenal powers of software problem diagnosis.</p>

		<p>I have taken to using your phrase &quot;Psychic debugging&quot;</p>

		<p>@Antonio Rodr√≠guez</p>
<p>According to your own advice you would not recommend Windows either as OS since 70% of it&#39;s capabilities are not used by more then 50% of the population. Heck, you would recommend DOS for that matter.</p>

		<p>I originally parsed the sentence beginning &quot;If the menu IDs do not lie..&quot; as &#39;If the menu IDs do not tell a false hood..&#39;, rather than &#39;If the menu IDs do not exist in the range..&#39; which of course give the sentence almost exactly the opposite meaning. I find these sort of ambiguities in natural language fascinating.</p>

		<p>For me &quot;Psychic debugging&quot; is to notice, and remember, strange behavior. And later put that knowledge to use. Naive and sloppy people are often stunned by how you could know stuff, which they could have learned themselves if they were less ignorant.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Double meaning of the word &#39;lie&#39; also happens in other languages. In Russian, these words are related. In German, these are also pretty close.</p>
