		<p>Interesting JPL tidbit: &nbsp;Somewhere around 2004 I had an email exchange with one of the guys at JPL that does their navigation and I asked him what type of floating point math they were using for their calculations. &nbsp;Turns out virtually everything was done with 64-bit IEEE floating point except for their &quot;master planetary ephemeris&quot; (which tracks the major planets). For that they used (if my memory is correct) some old Unisys box with supported a 68-bit floating point format. They wanted to move off that old box, but apparently those extra 4 bits of accuracy were needed.</p>

		<p>For the first reply in &quot;What is it like to have an understanding of very advanced mathematics?&quot; link, I think the mock answer for &quot;Mathematician&#39;s answer&quot; is incomplete. A real Mathematician will try to reduce it to simplest form on reply, with clear steps for how to reduce it to there. Afterall, it&#39;s why those lengthy journal papers exist.</p>

		<p>CamelCamelCamel is nice to use for tracking hard drive prices, which as of this post still haven&#39;t quite made it back to pre-flood prices. What&#39;s interesting to note is that prices were quick to rise and slow to fall; an interesting inside view of how the market works, albeit a very simple and convoluted look. Here&#39;s one example: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://camelegg.com/product/N82E16822136533" rel="nofollow">camelegg.com/&#8230;/N82E16822136533</a></p>

		<p>&quot;Gee, Raymond, all you have to do is change your target audience from &#39;IT Professionals&#39; to &#39;IT Profesionals and xpclient. How hard can that be?&quot;</p>
<p>Easy &#8211; just requires a few minor adjustments to xpclient&#8230;</p>
<p>On the NASA side, I&#39;d have thought a &quot;long double&quot; (80 bit) would do for that? (Not on MS Visual C++ for some reason, that treats it as plain &#39;double&#39;, unlike the Intel compiler.) Talking of them and conspiracies, I loved the suggestion about faking the moon landings that thoroughly being such a hard job, the easiest way would in fact be to do it for real. Clearly, Princess Diana had to fake her own death because she knew too much about that &#8211; but it all went wrong when the emergency cricothyrotomy was done using a pencil instead due to a stationery mixup in Crystal Palace.</p>
<p>The Euro-crisis articles were a good read, though I still can&#39;t shake the suspicion far too many of the target audience are the architects of the situation in question.</p>

		<p>The Mars rover video is pretty cool, but there are so many moving parts; one tiny thing goes wrong at any stage and the mission is done. &nbsp;On the other hand, I&#39;m a bit disappointed that they weren&#39;t able to do a barrel roll and tell us to deal with it.</p>

		<p>@Mark the video says why: &nbsp;the atmosphere&#39;s too thin for aerobraking. &nbsp;Left unsaid is the idea that just using a bigger rocket to land is probably a lot more expensive. &nbsp;Presumably the bouncing inflatable balls used on the previous rovers aren&#39;t scalable to the size of the new one, either.</p>

		<p>Re: The TechNet column on Power Users vs Admins</p>
<p>Sorry to ask such a basic question, but why is it that file associations are system-wide, with all the security implications that creates? Why not per-user, defaulting to the system-wide version when that&#39;s not specified, like most other setttings? This question sort of applies to COM object registrations as well, but I don&#39;t know much about COM so I&#39;m happier to believe there&#39;s an obvious answer I&#39;m missing.</p>

		<p>@Jim: &nbsp;COM object registration and file associations can be per-user or per-machine. &nbsp;The issue is that a normal user can only modify his per-user registration while a power user can modify the per-machine registration.</p>

		<p>From the Seattle thing:</p>
<p>Seattle traffic is so generous and efficient that a woman sued the city in the &#39;80s because it took her more than 7 minutes to get to work.</p>
<p>Maybe so, but ever since the late 90s it&#39;s been a mess, thanks to Tim Eyman getting the funding gutted for the mass transit that kept the traffic congestion down.</p>

		<p>Assuming you mean that you can *override* a per-machine file association with a per-user one, in that case I don&#39;t understand why this is a useful privilege to give to a power user. Just so they can annoy other users on the machine?</p>
<p>(To a certain extent this applies to the program installation privilege too, since you can install programs in your user folder. But I can understand that some poorly-written programs might not work well in that situation.)</p>
