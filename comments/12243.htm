		<p>Happy Birthday, Windows! &nbsp;Thanks for the info, Raymond. &nbsp;I love little historical bits. &nbsp;As a sorta-related aside, I wanted to let you know that perusing your archives, you essentially single-handedly turned me from mildly anti-MS to an apologist for your folks&#39; software and practices. &nbsp;Thanks for fighting the good fight, seeing the historical reasons for things always helps put matters in perspective.</p>

		<p>So why were, at least in Windows 3.x, lots of if not all bundled applications, including the Program Manager, File Manager and the almighty WIN.COM, placed in the Windows directory? Given this reasoning, wouldn&#39;t it have made a lot more sense to put all of that in the System directory, and perhaps a tiny Windows loader stub only (that in effect was little more than a short batch file, responsible for nothing more than passing execution on to the next loader stage) in the Windows directory, simply to make it easier to find? The disk space cost of such a tiny executable would have been minimal, even in the light of the hardware of the day; I imagine that it could have been done within a few hundred bytes.</p>
<p>Looking at old Windows 1 screenshots, it appears that lots of drivers, executables and fonts were put in the Windows directory even back then, and although it seems to have been cleaned up in the interim, at least some applications resided in the Windows directory also in Windows 2. That goes rather contrary to the &quot;the Windows directory is a user profile directory, the System directory contains the system binaries&quot; sentiment expressed in this post, as well as GetPrivateProfile*() et al. I&#39;m curious what your comments on that are.</p>

		<p>@db2: I&#39;m going to go ahead and guess that it wasn&#39;t that bad &#8211; smaller swap files combined with smaller applications results in less overall swap access, and back in those days I&#39;d guess it didn&#39;t impact performance as much as it would nowadays.</p>

		<p>I also enjoy your articles that look back on the way things once were, and explain some of the technical decisions in context. 25 years is an awfully long time in computer time. I&#39;m curious to know the most significant historical design decision that you would change today if you could.</p>

		<p>db2: I remember back in high school, the computer teacher suggested that we could run Windows on our pre-Ethernet network of 20 dual-floppy (360k) 8086-based PCs with monochrome VGA monitors. The idea, of course, was to house all the files on the file server&#39;s 40MB HD and do all of the paging to that. You can imagine my horrified reaction at the time. Fortunately I was able to talk him out of such nonsense.</p>
<p>I thought I had successfully repressed that memory, but it all came back while reading today&#39;s post.</p>

		<p>db2: &quot;Even paging took place over the network.&quot;</p>
<p>Not in my experience. I remember doing an experiment: remove the HDD from the computer, and prepare a floppy with DOS, autoexec.bat and the network drivers. Boot from that, then start Windows 3.0 from the network server.</p>
<p>In my particular combination, paging took place&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;to the floppy!</p>
<p>I&#39;ll take network paging any day.</p>

		<p>Since you brought up the topic of Windows 1, I need to report a bug in it. &nbsp;When you ran paint and went to save the file you got a dialog with a single editable text field to type the name into. &nbsp;This teenager at the time decided to hold down the &#39;a&#39; key to see how many it would let me enter. &nbsp;Eventually getting bored after hundreds and perhaps thousands of them I pressed enter. &nbsp;The screen froze and hard disk light would come on briefly every few seconds. &nbsp;Eventually I reset the machine to find out that most of the contents of the root directory had been deleted. &nbsp;Thankfully those were the days when you could just change the first byte of a name in order to undelete it, and my dad never found out.</p>
<p>TLDR: Windows 1 has a buffer overflow on the file save dialog.</p>

		<p>@db2: Don&#39;t forget in those days networks were a bit different. You could have a network with 10 computers where the only access was for these directories &#8211; no other communication was yet possible. Combine that with very small files, and even a slower network of those times is not contented. Having to buy only one hard drive for the entire office is definitely a plus in that case, even if it&#39;s a bigger one.</p>

		<p>I suspect that even when these configurations were properly supported, half of them ended up not working very well anyway &#8211; because of laziness on the part of third-party developers. I still don&#39;t dare change software install directories or make the primary drive something other than C &#8211; Windows doesn&#39;t care, but boy howdy does a lot of software break!</p>

		<p>I still get annoyed when certain software insists that it needs to be installed into a short folder name in the root of the C drive. &nbsp;Some software breaks if there are any spaces in the program&#39;s path name. &nbsp;Spaces have been in path names for, what, 15 years now at least.</p>

		<p>Happy Birthday, Windows! (except in Nebraska)</p>
<p>Am I correct in assuming that this writable Windows/non-writable System distinction died already with Windows NT? Because there&#39;s this directory named “config“ in there which probably wouldn&#39;t take to kindly to being read-only &#8230;</p>

		<p>@DWalker59: You may see a bit more of that behavior as some software vendors have had to take semi-drastic steps to run under UAC.</p>
<p>Our own used to install to C:Program Files&lt;Application Name&gt;, now it is C:Programs&lt;Application Name&gt;. Installing to program files with UAC on is still a good way to get our software to blow up rather spectacularly a few months or years later due to a bug in folder redirection we were never able to fully qualify.</p>
<p>Cygwin is another. The default is C:Cygwin. Spaces are fine. Running with UAC on is fine. Installing to Program Files with UAC on is not.</p>
<p>The general point here has nothing particular to do with UAC, but rather that when Microsoft changes some fundamental attribute of Windows, some applications basically don&#39;t tolerate it and the makers will take the simplest path to getting it working again.</p>
<p>@Marquess: GetWindowsDirectory() when called from an NT windows returns a directory within your profile.</p>

<p>Network disks were faster than local disks. Yes, really. After all, you spent $$$ on a decent SCSI setup, rather than crummy MFM. In theory the Win9x series still supported diskless workstations, but by then hard disks had got fast enough to make it unnecessary.</p>
<p>@laonianren: Terminal services definitely changes it. So getting the &quot;real&quot; directory of Explorer.exe is harder than you would think. (And no, we can&#39;t just launch &quot;Explorer.exe&quot; since that exposes you to current-directory-based attacks.)</p>

		<p>Nifty. Unix machines were designed around a similar idea: /usr could be read-only and shared between machines of the same architecture (and /usr/share between machines of different architectures). It&#39;s interesting that the Windows designers were thinking along similar lines.</p>

		<p>If I recall correctly, at high school the approach taken was to use a shared read-only System folder on a network drive, and a local read/write copy of the Windows folder &#8212; but this was destroyed and replaced each time Windows was started up. &nbsp;Because students couldn&#39;t be trusted not to totally mess up their environments. &nbsp;(Mind you, to be fair, most students didn&#39;t have individual logins at that point; instead everyone logged in with which room they were in. &nbsp;I was one of the few exceptions, and I altered my copy of the start-windows script so it kept my personal settings intact.)</p>

		<p>@Dave: C64s had local disks? The few I saw only used tape.</p>
<p>@configurator: sorry, but I need to select a file in the folder too.</p>
