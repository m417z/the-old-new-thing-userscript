		<p>For those wondering what a SysLink is, it&#39;s a text control that can have embedded hyperlinks: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb760706.aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/bb760706.aspx</a></p>

		<p>I find this is pretty common with support &#8211; people providing misleading info. As a result I&#39;ve developed strong sense of skepticism when told &quot;facts&quot; About an issue&#8230;have to think &quot;in theory is there any potential for this result with suggested conditions&quot; if no 9 out of 10 times one of the &quot;facts&quot; was not really investigated or confirmed, rather it was assumed. Of course you still have the odd case where there really is a strange obscure bug.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s all too common that an end user gathers symptoms A, B, C and then concludes that it must be &quot;D&quot; that&#39;s the root cause. &nbsp;They then complain about &quot;D&quot; and C &#8211; psychic powers (similar to Raymond&#39;s) eventually draw out A and B and lead to the correct conclusion &quot;E&quot;. &nbsp;I then, as the ISV, go whinge to the customer&#39;s IT support people that then really need to fix &quot;E&quot; since it&#39;s not our issue, but that I&#39;ve fixed it for them this time.. &nbsp; (I just finished such a call) :)</p>

		<p>Oh my, Oh my&#8230; many customers are morons but it doesn&#39;t help that the customer support are arrogant a-holes either&#8230;.</p>
<p>Common ground, people, read about it !</p>
<p>We have all been beginners. So is it so hard to understand when other beginners fail at explaining wrong when they do not know what info we need ?</p>
<p>I have always wondered how some learned people becomes arrogant with an over-inflated self-importance, that think they are special because of what they know.</p>
<p>Elitism so disgusting and so illogical.</p>
<p>Baffling indeed.</p>
<p>Is it just something that goes wring in the head ?</p>

		<p>@Inflated: Uhm.. right.. So when I ask &#39;have you got 3rd party software v8 installed?&#39;, the customer replies &#39;yes!&#39;, and later I find they have v9 installed, and I tell the customer &#39;I asked about v8&#39; and they say &#39;I assumed v9 would be better than v8, so I said yes&#39; then I&#39;m the arrogant a-hole? Nice world view.</p>

		<p>Raymond, your response is disingenuous. You know damned well that when the customer said he&#39;s &quot;not even listening for WM_SETÂ­TEXT messages&quot;, he means that he&#39;s not doing he thinks would cause styles to change in response WM_SETTEXT &#8212; clearly, if his code isn&#39;t changing the style, the style change must be a mystery, because he assumes that the operating system can&#39;t possibly be badly-designed enough to react to WM_SETTEXT that way.</p>
<p>Now, this assumption turns out not to be valid, but that&#39;s not the poor customer&#39;s fault. It&#39;s our fault, and we should just fess up to it instead of blaming the victim for providing &quot;incomplete&quot; information. It doesn&#39;t help your case that the MSDN documentation to which you linked doesn&#39;t mention SysLink&#39;s silly WS_TABSTOP behavior.</p>
<p>The right response is &quot;Sorry about that. We&#39;ve filed a doc bug.&quot;</p>

		<p>@No: &quot;You know damned well that when the customer said he&#39;s &quot;not even listening for WM_SETTEXT messages&quot;, he means that he&#39;s not doing he thinks would cause styles to change in response WM_SETTEXT&quot;</p>
<p>What? That&#39;s not what I get out of that at all. My reading of &quot;I&#39;m not even listening for WM_SETTEXT&quot; is much closer to &quot;not only am I not doing anything actively that would cause styles to change on WM_SETTEXT, I&#39;m not even grabbing WM_SETTEXT messages in the first place, so I can&#39;t!&quot;</p>
<p>What do you think &quot;not even&quot; means?</p>

		<p>@No, @Evan: &nbsp;exactly, don&#39;t blame the customer for not having source code to the SysLink control!! &nbsp;I assume Raymond was linking to this section of the MSDN page about SysLink creation: &nbsp;&quot;Specifying the WS_TABSTOP style ensures that the user will be able to select a link by tabbing to it and pressing the Enter key.&quot; &nbsp;Nowhere does it say anything about modification of WS_TABSTOP style on WM_SETTEXT. &nbsp;Without access to the source code like Raymond had, the customer had no choice but to go by what is stated in MSDN &#8211; which states nothing about this behavior. &nbsp;So they assumed there was a bug.</p>
<p>A more interesting question would be why did the customer notice this in the first place?</p>

		<p>And think about the typical usage of the SysLink control. &nbsp;I can&#39;t fathom a reason why I would have special handling for WM_SETTEXT. &nbsp;So most customers, probably including this one, aren&#39;t going to do anything special, and just defer to the SysLink control&#39;s default handling&#8230;</p>
