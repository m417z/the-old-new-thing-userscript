		<p>&#8230; or he uses a monocle in one eye for near vision, and with the other eye he has distance vision. &nbsp;Depending on which is most important at any particular time, will decide whether the monocle is in the dominant eye or not.</p>
<p>(Clearly the idea that Disney&#39;s continuity failed is ridiculous &#8211; they are professionals, and wouldn&#39;t do that sort of thing.)</p>

		<p>&#8230;or he always wears it in one eye but some of the shots are flipped for &aelig;sthetic reasons (happens in live action movies &#8211; why not cartoons?).</p>

		<p>Martin Bonner has the best explanation for this happening in reality, anyway: known as &#39;monovision&#39;, where one eye gets a different correction than the other, often with either different prescriptions of contact lens or different laser treatments with LASIK/LASEK. That way, instead of having to put reading glasses (or a monocle!) on and take them off every time you shift between distance and close vision, you have one eye optimized for each. (I hate that idea, personally: I&#39;d much rather have symmetry and use reading glasses when needed, but apparently some people adapt and prefer it that way. Others get horribly disoriented by the split and regret it!)</p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t mean he&#39;s only short (or long) sighted in one eye &#8211; just that he only wants correction in one. I imagine a monocle might well have been used for reading purposes in this way &#8211; so it wouldn&#39;t matter which eye it was in, just that one eye was corrected for close vision while leaving the other for distance.</p>

		<p>Note that the lens has no refraction. It&#39;s a shading lens, Of Courseâ„¢! He just chooses which eye gets shaded (to rest?) at a time.</p>

		<p>I think jas88 hit it. This would, of course, allow for both near and far to be in focus at the same time in different eyes. If he has the right mind-type to process this he could read and be well-aware of his surroundings at the same time. Might be beneficial in late medieval times.</p>

		<p>There was a time where a lot of people wore monocles. It doesn&#39;t mean that there was an epidemic of one-sided myopia.</p>

		<p>Alas I recently had to abandon my beloved monocle in favour of a pince-nez. Its cord would become entangled with that of my pocket watch while verifying the time during my morning constitutional. This action, requiring both hands to move in unison during a brisk walk, has lost its ease and fluidity with age.</p>
