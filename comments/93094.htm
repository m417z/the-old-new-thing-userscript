		<p>Someone should come up with a concept whereby teenage girls (or perhaps, grandmothers), for a modest fee, will watch your children for a few hours so that mom and dad can have a night out enjoying dinner and some music.</p>

		<p>The trick is finding six such teenage girls/grandmothers available on the same night.</p>

		<p>Raymond &#8211;</p>
<p>I am a long time reader of your blog, and appreciate your easy-to-understand summary of the Seattle Symphony&#8217;s schedule. I perform with the Spokane Symphony and Pacific NW Ballet orchestra, and also work in the tech industry.</p>
<p>Your remark at the end of this post is why I am commenting. Do you remember what Ms. Hahn played at her recital? Her abilities as a violinist have few peers, yet you remark here about her appearance. I realize it is a &#8220;funny&#8221; anecdote, but would you do the same for a talented female in the tech industry?</p>
<p>Being remembered based on appearance is something women should not have to deal with.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s better than what I remember about one of the piano soloists from that same season: He was awful. He played all the pieces through, so you didn&#8217;t know where one piece ended and the next began. (And at least it&#8217;s fair: I don&#8217;t remember anything either of them played. The only pieces I remember are from the Lab√®que sisters recital. They played Marche Slave and a boring Stravinsky piece.)</p>

		<p>I think she can defend herself. She doesn&#8217;t need a white knight.</p>

		<p>It is a reminiscence, Mr. Bakken. And all reminiscences consist of imagery. And it is not an offensive image either.</p>
<p>Besides, only a musician can properly appreciate another musician. (That&#8217;s true in other industries and groups too.) Don&#8217;t expect Ray to hold Hahn and Fiorina to the same standards. (Fiorina is probably not the best representative of a woman in computing. But at least, everyone knows her.)</p>

		<p>I think that commenting negatively on something that someone chooses to wear is something that is commonly done for men and women. I can certainly think of a few high-profile cases in which the very people who are likely to come out with the same argument that you have, have in turn said much worse things about something a man&#8217;s wearing. Basically, I don&#8217;t see why on earth you&#8217;re attempting to turn this into a sexism thing.</p>

		<p>We weren&#8217;t making fun of the dress. We just thought we were so clever coming up with that way of describing it.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m running out of arbitrary criteria. Furthermore, the schedule is announced just a few days before the tournament begins, which doesn&#8217;t give me much time to build the bracket. I don&#8217;t usually find out until too late.</p>

		<p>Re: Beethoven Cycle<br />
The 3rd Symphony was performed two weekends ago: 2/11, 2/13 and 2/14<br />
The 7th Symphony will be performed in June (6/9-6/11)<br />
The 1st piano concerto headlined the concerts with Alexander Melnikov on 10/22 and 10/25<br />
The 2nd piano concerto was performed with the Berio: Sinfonia for 8 Voices and Orchestra on 2/4 and 2/6</p>

		<p>Thanks for the corrections. Not sure how I missed them. It looks like they had a typo in their brochure, because the brochure says that the 2/4 and 2/6 concerts include the third concerto, not the second.</p>

		<p>These posts always make me wish we were able to attend our local symphony orchestra more often. Unfortunately, we just can&#8217;t afford to these days.</p>
