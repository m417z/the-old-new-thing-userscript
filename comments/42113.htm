		<p>In curling you need to be able to move down ice rapidly but still be able to stop and stand still.  Skates would wreck the ice surface, so what you do is put duct tape on the sole of one shoe.  You can move by keeping the slippy taped foot on the ice and push yourself along with the grippy foot.</p>
<p>Serious curlers have special teflon shoe covers made, but if you&#8217;re just going out for fun, duct tape will do just fine.</p>
<p>And remember, the best part of curling is the yelling.  SWEEP!  SWEEP HARDER YOU IDIOTS!  NOT THAT HARD!</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate that this is the only dedicated facility west of the Rockies.  Long ago in my childhood days, there was a curling club in Fairbanks, Alaska. The urban legend (or maybe it was true?) was that it was one of the few curling clubs in the world that needed heaters to keep the ice warm enough to play.</p>

		<p>I remember NBC showed curling twice earlier this year (US and world championships, I think).  But the matches were on tape delay and heavily edited, so I couldn&#8217;t really get a feel for the game as a whole. :/</p>

		<p>Wow, I had no idea that there were that few curling clubs in parts of the US.  Living in Canada, I guess I took for granted that every town would have atleast one rink.  As for the sliders, I recommend curling shoes (check out <a href="http://www.asham.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.asham.com</a>) &#8211; they look just like normal sneakers, but the sole of one shoe will be slippery, while the other has a good grip on the ice.</p>

		<p>hmmmmm, I get into Sumo about the same way. I love it when it&#8217;s on TV but never think of it otherwise.</p>

		<p>I remember NBC showing quite a few games during the last winter olympics (although they were probably on their various cable channels rather than NBC proper).  As for cool curling links, I really like the flash animations of the curling strategy:<br />
<a href="http://www.curlingbasics.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.curlingbasics.com/</a><br />
One of the best uses of Flash I have ever seen and certainly useful to someone like me who was introduced to the sport for the first time last Olympics.</p>
