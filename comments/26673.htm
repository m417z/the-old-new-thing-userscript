		<p>The nice thing is that, &quot;X&quot; can be interpreted as Roman numeral &quot;10&quot;, or as an unknown.</p>

		<p>Years ago I added a Roman numerals option to the display format for dates in a test system, thinking it would be a passing amusement &#8212; nothing more.</p>
<p>One of the marketing Suits saw it and almost wet himself. &quot;We could display the copyright date just like they do in MOVIES!&quot;</p>
<p>I nodded sagely, agreeing with him, but never mentioning that the copyright information was hardcoded and if he wanted it displayed in Igpay Atinlay he had only to formalize the request.</p>
<p>I *think* the code made it into the production system, which means someplace, sometime, it&#8217;s possible an employee received a check dated in roman numerals.</p>

		<p>Unicode wastes code points on things like giving the mathematical usage of the Greek letter pi a different code point from the non-mathematical usage of the Greek letter pi. &nbsp;I&#8217;m not sure which national character set forced Unicode to do things like that.</p>
<p>For Roman numerals, which can be encoded either in the single-byte range somewhere between 0 and 127, or the double-byte range somewhere between 256 and 65535, I do know which national character set forced Unicode to do it. &nbsp;(People would complain if I said which national character set.)</p>

<blockquote><p>
  why does a &quot;national character set&quot; force</p>
<p>  unicode to have duplicate code points for the</p>
<p>  same character?
</p></blockquote>
<p>For each code point that each national character encoding has, Unicode has to have a code point that can be mapped to. &nbsp;Otherwise Unicode wouldn&#8217;t even be Unicode.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  What is a &quot;national character set&quot;?
</p></blockquote>
<p>The United States has American Standard Code for Information Interchange (formerly United States of America Standard Code for Information Interchange, i.e. formerly USASCII, but that was shortened a few decades ago). &nbsp;Some European countries had national standards, which I&#8217;m not sure if they still have or if they were superceded by ISO-8859-1. &nbsp;There are also some ISO-8859-x code pages for Turkish, Cyrillic, etc. &nbsp;China, South Korea, and an unnameable country also have national standards.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  But what has that got to do with whether code</p>
<p>  points need to be duplicated?
</p></blockquote>
<p>When a national standard had separate code points for the Italian character &quot;V&quot; as a letter and the Italian character &quot;V&quot; as a numeral, and Unicode included that national standard in the set of character sets that Unicode would be compatible with, Unicode also had to have separate code points for the separate characters. &nbsp;By the way, to the best of my knowledge, Italy didn&#8217;t participate in this particular matter. &nbsp;By the way, there&#8217;s a single code point for a character that looks like &quot;II&quot; as a numeral, and one for &quot;VII&quot;, etc., so most of those don&#8217;t duplicate individual letters. &nbsp;&quot;I&quot; and &quot;V&quot; and &quot;X&quot; do though.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  what national character set had two symbols</p>
<p>  for PI?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah I wonder too. &nbsp;Around 10 years ago, I thought this kind of inconsistency would doom Unicode. &nbsp;They did a pretty reasonable job of Han unification, so why did they toss that idea of consistency with everything else?</p>

		<p>AFIK the deal with the two codes for Pi is not that some legacy character set had two codes for Pi, it is that there are two meanings for a visually identical symbol &#8211; a Greek letter, or a mathematical constant. There are also code points for bold and &quot;double-struck&quot; letters, because in mathematical equations it is sometimes necessary to assign different meanings to the &quot;same&quot; letter depending on the formatting.</p>
<p>In other words, the presence of two visually identical code points is often a clue that there is some sort of semantic difference between the two points. Not always &#8211; there are duplicates of the Latin alphabet that have a bounding box the same size as the CJK Ideographs, which is probably rooted in a need to stop embedded Latin characters upsetting alignment.</p>
<p>The Roman Numerals presumably have their own code points because otherwise it is impossible to avoid losing the information that the characters represent a number.</p>

<p>Yes I read the same thing, they used this reasoning in order to discard all the ideas of consistency that they had so painstakingly developed.</p>
<p>The letter X is a Roman numeral AND an Italian letter AND a mathematical symbol meaning unknown, so there have to be at least three different code points for it. &nbsp;The letter e is an Italian letter AND a mathematical constant AND a punctuation mark used in human-readable numerals for floating-point numbers, so there have to be at least three different code points for it. &nbsp;Oops no, the Unicode standard only applies to part of the Unicode standard, otherwise other parts of the Unicode standard apply.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  there are duplicates of the Latin alphabet</p>
<p>  that have a bounding box the same size as the</p>
<p>  CJK Ideographs
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t think so. &nbsp;For full-width and half-width copies of Italian characters, the reason is the original correct reason: &nbsp;Some national standards already included code points for both versions, and Unicode wanted to incorporate those national characters.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The Roman Numerals presumably have their own</p>
<p>  code points because otherwise it is impossible</p>
<p>  to avoid losing the information that the</p>
<p>  characters represent a number.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Well I wonder if they added that reason later when they added a code point for the mathematical meaning of i and engineering meaning for j, to be distinguished from Spanish letters that look like them. &nbsp;But I still think a more likely reason is that a national standard already included code points for several Roman numerals.</p>
