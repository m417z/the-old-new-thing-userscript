		<p>The first thought that came to my mind was the clipboard: the only times I&#39;ve ever written code dealing with HGLOBALs have been when dealing with the clipboard. &nbsp;So, if you wanted your program to have the ability to copy a file shortcut to the clipboard without actually creating the shortcut (and in so doing allow the user to paste that shortcut wherever he wanted), you could create an in-memory shortcut and then call SetClipboardData(CF_SOMETHING, hglob).</p>
<p>Figuring out which clipboard format to use might be tricky: when I copy a shortcut on Windows 7, I get 11 different formats on the clipboard: &quot;DataObject&quot; (49161), &quot;Shell IDList Array&quot; (49312), &quot;DataObjectAttributes&quot; (49502), &quot;DataObjectAttributesRequiringElevation&quot; (49542), &quot;Shell Object Offsets&quot; (49387), &quot;Preferred DropEffect&quot; (49359), &quot;AsyncFlag&quot; (49412), CF_HDROP, &quot;FileName&quot; (49158), &quot;FileNameW (49159), and &quot;Ole Private Data&quot; (49171).</p>

		<p>Once, I actually found myself designing a system where shortcuts were stored in a database. Obviously serializing them to memory is the easiest way of getting the bits to store in the DB.</p>
<p>So why on Earth would I need to store shortcuts in a database? The answer is link tracking. I actually just wanted to keep the paths to files, but people can move and rename files, thus invalidating their paths in the DB. If I stored a shortcut, though, I could deserialize it and tell it to resolve the link. Now I don&#39;t have to worry about files changing names and locations, servers changing names, or even moving drive arrays to new servers.</p>

		<p>I do believe that IBM&#39;s OS/2 used an associative data base to track this stuff (as links) so a connection between two object never got lost. &nbsp;A few things got lost in the divorce!</p>

		<p>@Gabe, I&#39;m slightly confused by your use case. The only way I can parse it that makes sense to me is if you wanted to track URIs, wanted to keep those in shortcut files, but then chose to store them in a database instead.</p>
<p>Is that correct?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Don&#39;t get distracted by the database. The user gave you a path, which you want to save. (Say, a path to the mp3 file to play as background music for your slideshow.) But the user might rename the file or move it to another drive, so just storing a path won&#39;t work. Solution: Instead of (or in addition to) the path, also create a shortcut and save that in your project file. Then when it&#39;s time to play the slideshow, you can use the shortcut to find the background music. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>@Mike: Extending on Raymonds answer; A shortcut has more metadata than just the path, it also knows the UNC name of the computer, the relative path and size, time&amp;data and attribute information, so when you call IShellLink-&gt;Resolve() windows can search all your drives for the closest match if the original path is no longer valid.</p>
<p>@Raymond: IShellItem might be enough, unless you need custom icon, launch parameters etc but that is not really the point, MSDN recommends you to use ShellLinks with ICustomDestinationList::AddUserTasks and ShellItems with ICustomDestinationList::AppendCategory. (I have never tried to give AddUserTasks a ShellItem, maybe it displays it as &quot;myapp.exe&quot; and not just myapp, I don&#39;t know, but MSDN recommends you to use ShellLinks with AddUserTasks and ShellItems with AppendCategory)</p>
<p>@Adam Rosenfield/Raymond: HIDA is not a common term in the public SDK, but it is a pointer to a CIDA struct and a CIDA struct is really just a way to store PIDLs in a array. <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb773212%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/bb773212%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a> shows two HIDA_* macros, off the top of my head, those two and the NSWF_IGNORE_AUTOPLAY_HIDA flag are the only places where the HIDA name is part of a public &quot;function&quot; or flag</p>

		<p>@WndSks, @Raymond, thanks; that was the missing bit I needed. I didn&#39;t realize Explorer could find shortcut targets when the shortcut&#39;s target had moved.</p>

		<p>Now if only the Registry could track down files too. There are many times I&#39;d like to move a program to a different disk for space reasons, or maybe I want to keep old copies of TurboTax on a USB stick.</p>
<p>But nooooo, all the install references are to drive C:original-directory which forces a silly uninstall/reinstall cycle or the use of one of those program mover apps which track down and fix up all the registry keys for you.</p>
<p>The shortcut resolver is only half the problem there. But it is pretty cool that it does work so well so thanks, shell guys!</p>

		<p>I am a little confused. If I move/rename the file, how the shortcut will know to update itself? Yes, I know explorer searches (and sometimes find) moved/renamed programs, but I always thought it is kinda a guesswork (unless the link file contains a checksum or some sort of fileid or whatever). Point is, if I simply move my MP3 around its name remains the same and there is a chance that whoever resolves the shorcut will find the file, but it might find some other file with the same name. Also, what would happen if I rename the file to something *completly* different? </p>
<p>I am not trying to nitpick, I just try to figure how this works.</p>
