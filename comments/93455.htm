		<p>How does the programmer know that &#8220;Message_ID&#8221; gets put into the field named &#8220;Code&#8221;?  </p>
<p>&#8220;the facility&#8217;s status code&#8221; does not sound like a &#8220;Message ID&#8221; to me!</p>
<p>But then again, the customer said &#8220;we defined our message ID as a DWORD&#8221;.  I wonder where they got that guidance&#8230;.  Yes, the MS documentation here assumes some knowledge.  Programming is hard.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&#8221;the documentation for the Message File syntax says Any value specified must fit in 16 bits.&#8221;</p>
<p>Actually, the documentation at that link is a bit confusing and possibly misleading.  It beings with:</p>
<p>MessageIdTypedef=type<br />
The type must be large enough to accommodate the entire message code, such as a DWORD.</p>
<p>Note the usage of &#8220;message code&#8221; and DWORD.  This certainly would lead you to believe that the message code is a 32 bit number.  And I can&#8217;t find anything on that page that specifically calls out &#8220;16 bits&#8221;.</p>

		<p>public int EventId { get; private set; }<br />
    Property Value<br />
    Type: System.Int32<br />
    The event identifier. This value should be between 0 and 65535.</p>
<p>Why oh why is this property an Int32? Uint16 is a real thing that exists &#8212; oh, sure, it&#8217;s not CLS-compliant. -sigh- So close&#8230;</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s the same thing like with the notification area tooltip popup time, IIRC. .NET uses Int32 wherever possible to get rid of nasty conversions, though it requires you to read the documentation on WinAPI stuffs sometimes ;D</p>

		<p>This is all perfectly obvious stuff to a VMS programmer  :-)</p>

		<p>I was just thinking VMS when I looked at that ;)</p>
<p>Useless history lesson follows.<br />
I remember VMS had multiple severity levels for errors, most of which I remember. From lowest to highest, they were &#8230;</p>
<p>S &#8211; Status messages. Not even normally seen, but you might see &#8216;%SYSTEM-S-NORMAL,. normal successful completion&#8217; occasionally<br />
I &#8211; Informational. Such as &#8216;%SHOW-I-NOSUCHUSER, no user found with name CHEN&#8217; if you did SHOW USER CHEN and CHEN was not logged on.<br />
W &#8211; Warning messages such as &#8216;%SYSTEM-W-NOSUCHFILE, no such file&#8217;<br />
E &#8211; Error messages, such as &#8216;%RMS-E-DNF, directory not found&#8217;<br />
F &#8211; Fatal errors, such as &#8216;%SYSTEM-F-VIRTMEM, virtual memory exhausted&#8217;</p>
<p>The error message display could also display up to three levels of nested error messages (not as good as a .NET or Java traceback, but still useful to some extent. For instance if you tried to list a nonexistent directory using the DIRECTORY (you could abbreviate it to DIR&#8230;) command, you&#8217;d get:</p>
<p>%DIRECT-F-OPENIN, error opening DSK:[DIR]<br />
-RMS-E-DNF, directory not found<br />
-SYSTEM-W-NOSUCHFILE, no such file</p>
<p>In the example of DIRECT-E-OPENIN, DIRECT was the Facility, E was the severity (error) and OPENIN was the identifier. &#8216;error opening directory DSK:[DIR] was the text. And you could choose what elements you wished to display using the SET MESSAGE facility. You could run SET MESSAGE /NOFACILITY /NOSEVERITY /NOID /TEXT and all you&#8217;d get instead was:</p>
<p>Error opening DSK:[DIR]<br />
Directory not found<br />
No such file</p>
<p>(It automatically capitalised the first letter of the text).</p>
<p>Some people did that to make VMS more &#8216;friendly looking&#8217; when something went wrong.<br />
One subunit of the company I worked for took it even further and disabled all four elements, meaning you got no error messages. Made things hard to debug (but you could always turn them back on again and rerun to find out what was really going wrong).</p>
<p>I miss VMS sometimes :) I wonder if there are still any VMS jobs to be found in Scotland &#8230;</p>

		<p>My memory is hazy as to whether not finding a directory was fatal (%DIRECT-F-OPENIN) or an error (%DIRECT-E-OPENIN). Also these were mapped to bit fields in the error code, and in Digital Command Language (the scripting language VMS and other Digital OSes used, although VMS had the greatest amount of features&#8230;) the internal variable $SEVERITY (*) told you how severe your error code was.</p>
<p>I am sure there were other error levels, and it took up two bits of the error code. Sometimes if undefined values were written in there, you&#8217;d get a &#8216;?&#8217; instead of a letter in your error message. </p>
<p>Status and Informational error messages indicated an error condition which was not really an error, but just a status.<br />
Warning messages indicated something which could succeed on a retry. For instance &#8216;%SYSTEM-W-NOSUCHFILE, no such file&#8217; might succeed on a retry if you trapped the error and created the file.<br />
Error conditions caused execution to stop but could be trapped and corrected.<br />
Fatal errors meant things were FUBAR (but you could correct and retry if you were lucky ;) )</p>

		<p>This post answered the question in MSDN forum long time ago: <a href="https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/a76f64c3-a3df-4302-820c-1ad28fdf8103/how-do-i-convert-eventlogentryinstanceid-to-the-simple-event-id-i-see-in-event-viewer?forum=csharplanguage" rel="nofollow">https://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/a76f64c3-a3df-4302-820c-1ad28fdf8103/how-do-i-convert-eventlogentryinstanceid-to-the-simple-event-id-i-see-in-event-viewer?forum=csharplanguage</a></p>
<p>We just found how to solve it, but unable to get the idea on why it has to be this way.</p>
<p>Too bad that the question now goes to the archive so I cannot edit to include a link to here.</p>
