		<p>&#39;Nothing says &quot;I don&#39;t care about this meeting&quot; like knitting. &#39;</p>
<p>Well, except maybe simply not even going to the meeting. Such an act has even more impact if one has been specifically instructed to attend.</p>

		<p>Failing to attend a meeting leaves open the possibility that the meeting is of great cosmic importance and is very productive, but you fail to appreciate this through ignorance. Attending the meeting and spending the entire time doing something else (nondisruptive) demonstrates unambiguously that you might as well not be there.</p>

		<p>I tend to agree with Joshua. I had a boss who infuriated one of his peers by sorting out business cards throughout a meeting. Sadly, it was probably not his intent to demonstrate lack of interest that made him do with, but rather his self-absorption.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&#39;t say it says you don&#39;t care. I bring my cross-stitches to meetings all the time, it actually helps me focus (and stay awake). But it helps if you really participate and ask good questions. I guess it also helps that I live and work in Sweden, meeting culture isn&#39;t as formal here.</p>

		<p>@Anon</p>
<p>Unless the meeting is required, in which case you aren&#39;t allowed to decline, period.</p>
<p>Nothing says &quot;disrespectful&quot; like mandatory meetings that do quite literally nothing but waste the time of everyone involved, except for the meeting organizer, of course, who gets to engage in puffery for an hour.</p>

		<p>In a conference call no one knows you&#39;re knitting. Maybe find another passive-aggressive hobby, like woodturning.</p>

		<p>In Norway, knitting is and has always been a VERY feminine activity. Boys may learn the very basic principles &#8211; I did when I was in grade school in the 1960 &#8211; and complete one small square &quot;pad&quot;. We said it was for wiping you ink pen, but nowadays ink pens are history. I don&#39;t think boys today learn to knit even a single four by four inches square piece&#8230; </p>
<p>I don&#39;t think I have ever seen an adult MALE knitting, not in my entire life! For girls/women it was a very common activity; my former wife knittet me several woolen sweaters that I still use. But I would never knit one even form myself.</p>
<p>Is knitting NOT considered a (more or less exclusively) female activity in other countries? Is it common for males to knit their own sweaters or scarfs or whatever, and to create knitwork gifts for others?</p>

		<p>Excellent idea if one is likely to only be on the periphery of a meeting. If worried about the gender perceptions of knitting then maybe bring along an angle grinder (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Flex.ogv">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/File:Flex.ogv</a>). Not quite as good of an effect as dragging a lathe or radial arm saw into the room, but more portable and I&#39;ve found there are very few problems that a 9&quot; grinder can&#39;t solve&#8230; I suppose a Bowie knife could also work for wood carving if you&#39;re worried about the noise.</p>

		<p>Knitting is considered highly feminine in Canada and the US too. &nbsp;It&#39;s also kind of old-fashioned; I wouldn&#39;t bet on a random woman knowing how to knit these days and certainly wouldn&#39;t call it &quot;very common&quot;. &nbsp;This said, some older men who trained for World War II (in Canada) learned to knit while training in the military. &nbsp;I have not heard the same from anybody in the US, although with that said, I&#39;ve met far fewer elderly American men.</p>
<p>I know a non-Raymond Chen meeting knitter. &nbsp;I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve seen more knitting in meetings that outside.</p>

		<p>In the 1960s my father did a lot of travelling on aircraft for his job. He always took his embroidery materials with him &#8211; apparently it was the ideal way to pass time in airports or the aircraft, and the cabin staff were always fascinated by the idea of a businessman doing this. As a bonus once complete we ended up with several nicely embroidered chairs.</p>
<p>The only negative (apparently) was the tedium involved in stitching the large areas of single colours around the edge of the canvas! </p>

		<p>For once I have to disagree with you, Raymond. Knitting, drawing or other activities that do not involve the language and/or logical part of your brain, can help you keep focus. This of course depends on what kind of meeting you are attending, but my experience (I draw in meetings) is that it helps me stay alert.</p>
<p>Reading e-mail or news on your laptop or smart-phone on the other hand, ensures that you don&#39;t follow the thread of the meeting.</p>
<p>I think more people should bring their knitting to meetings. Less daydreaming &#8211; more focus.</p>

		<p>I find that playing solitaire (sol.exe) helps me focus in meetings because. And then I can judge the productivity of the meeting based on how many games I won!</p>
