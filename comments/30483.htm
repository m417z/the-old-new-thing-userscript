		<p>I had the same problem as the DirectX team. &nbsp;We were stuck using the Borland development environment which uses a different object file format, so we had to use their implib tool to generate import libraries for certain Microsoft DLLs. &nbsp;When it came time to develop our own in-house DLL for our applications, we ran into the &quot;import by ordinal problem&quot;, so I had to use the .DEF file to explicitly assign each exported function an ordinal. &nbsp;</p>
<p>After a while I got tired of manually editing the .DEF file, so I made a BASH script (running under cygwin, but I&#8217;m sure it will work on a direct WIN32 port of bash) to process the DLL&#8217;s header files and automatically assign recently added functions to the .DEF file with the appropriate ordinals.</p>

		<p>MFC&#8217;s runtime DLLs do their exporting by ordinal with no name in order to save space. So many functions are exported by the DLLs (6,443 of them in MFC 7.1) that the name table would be massive, especially since they would be C++ decorated names.</p>
<p>(Any idea why the ordinals start from 256?)</p>
<p>You can of course use ordinals with GetProcAddress, but I don&#8217;t recall ever doing it. I&#8217;d thought that Windows CE&#8217;s coredll.dll only offered ordinals but then recalled that passing names to GetProcAddress worked, so that must have been a faulty recollection.</p>

		<p>So how are &#8220;mere mortals&#8221; supposed to use all those unnamed, undocumented ordinals in Windows DLLs that are used by IE, Office, etc? (Rhertorical question, of course the official answer is that we are not supposed to use them.) </p>
<p>If Microsoft insists on using what amounts to their own private API, programmers will reverse engineer that API, even if it does create &#8220;unsafe&#8221; applications. </p>
<p>As for DirectX, wasn&#8217;t the SDK originally only available to owners of Visual Studio (i.e. $600 a pop)? Maybe that&#8217;s why games programmers generated their own import libraries? At least in the early days, most games programmers were using DOS-based development tools (as most games were DOS-based before DirectX 5). Many of these tools had compilers that could generate Win32 executables, so I doubt many games shops would want to spend thousands of dollars for Visual Studio licences (plus all the lost productivity while programmers learn VC++&#8217;s awful GUI) when they could just generate their own import libraries for free.</p>

		<p>No, anyone could get the DirectX SDK, no purchase required.</p>
<p>Now, I do recall that some older compiler tools from other vendors had problems with the supplied import libraries. If you were too cheap to upgrade to newer tools, then I suppose that might encourage you to reverse engineer an import library from the DLL.</p>
<p>However, that&#8217;s still not really an excuse, since what you should be doing is linking by name, not by ordinal. The ordinals were never documented (for exactly the reason Raymond describes here), so linking by ordinal was really asking for trouble. It&#8217;s perfectly possible to build an import generator which does everything by name &#8211; it just seems that&#8217;s not what people did.</p>
<p>I suspect what happened is that the less clueful developers just got some random import library generator tool they found on Teh Internets and didn&#8217;t really investigate what it was actually doing. It appeared to work, so that was good enough. They were blissfully unaware that they were relying on something undocumented until the next version came out and horked them.</p>

		<p>Mike: Are they that many? There are some that are not mentioned in the import libraries and some have names that are not descriptive at all, but I still think they have a name, just not a good one.</p>

		<p>@Tony Cox: &nbsp;The problem was that linking by ordinal was a recommended practice for improving load times, as was rebasing DLLs to reduce loader fixups. &nbsp;I went looking for the proper references in the MSDN but the first one I came across was Matt Pietrek&#8217;s Under the Hood article &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/0500/hood/&gt;" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/0500/hood/&#038;gt" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/0500/hood/&#038;gt</a>;. &nbsp;In it he says &quot;[Optimizing executables typically] means basing and binding, but might also include importing functions by ordinal or changing executable page alignment. Intuitively, these strategies should make your code load faster.&quot; &nbsp;He goes on to perform some real world tests and finds that on Windows 2000 binding by ordinal only improved load times by four percent. &nbsp;So perhaps this &quot;common knowledge&quot; about importing by ordinal is simply a hang-over from the 16-bit days when DLL exports were not sorted.</p>

		<p>What is counted as part of IE and what is part of Windows? <br />Is shell32.dll part of windows or IE? What about shlwapi.dll? Comctl32.dll? </p>
<p>Both Internet Explorer and windows shell components make a LOT of calls into those dlls and I suspect some of them are not documented. </p>

		<p>The separation between Windows and e.g. IE for what is clearly Windows-components (such as common controls)&#8230; simply isn&#8217;t anymore.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always disliked this practice of Microsoft, to even <em>let</em> the application groups modify <em>system</em> components &#8211; if it&#8217;s installed with the operating system, and in the case of common controls just about everything usermode depends on it, then by $DIETY it is a system component. What&#8217;s perhaps even worse is that they change even how the system (from the users experience) behaves.</p>
<p>Just as a thought experiment, imagine Mozilla deciding to overwrite system components, e.g. shipping their own shell32.dll.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve said it before, and I&#8217;ll probably say it again, making Explorer.exe use HTML and putting this crap into the core system was one of the worst things MS ever did &#8211; both to itself, but even worse; to all its users. The flood of viruses exploiting this crap (&#8217;cause crap code it was, else it wouldn&#8217;t be the security nightmare, nay disaster, it still is).<br />
<br />And all this just to destroy Netscape&#8230;</p>
<p>Raymond: &quot;If there are &#8230; from IE&quot;? Just run depends on the IE5 executable shipped with NT5. shlwapi.dll? That&#8217;s a system DLL (it&#8217;s documented so in its version information).</p>

		<p>I think that game designers have a very different perspective on software development than do, for example, enterprise warehouse management or financial control developers. &nbsp;In business, software has to be reliable and it is worth the money to test it and to &quot;do things the right way.&quot; &nbsp;But in most game development it isn&#8217;t about getting it &quot;right&quot; but getting it done. &nbsp;If software fails you lose a single sale but do not face a lawsuit or massive loss of revenue. &nbsp;Entertainment software has a very different focus even though this might not be the best way for the video game industry to make good products. &nbsp;Must like that time period when a very large portion of the video game playing population had switched to Windows 2000 and Windows XP but the 9x family was still the primary target of video game shops.</p>

		<p>Labeling shlwapi.dll as a system dll just because it has a productname of &quot;Microsoft&#174; Windows&#174; Operating System&quot; is wrong, even mshtml.dll (clearly part of IE) has a productname of &quot;Microsoft&#174; Windows&#174; Operating System&quot;<br /></p>

		<p>For many (but not all) dlls, you CAN generate an import lib from the dll:</p>
<p>echo EXPORTS &gt; %DEF%<br />
<br />for /f &quot;skip=19 tokens=4&quot; %%i in (&#8216;dumpbin /exports &quot;%DLL%&quot;&#8217;) do echo %%i &gt;&gt; %DEF%<br />
<br />lib /def:%DEF% /out:%LIB%</p>

		<p>Chris: no, they aren&#8217;t sanitized. Pretty much all import libraries contain all of the undocumented imports. To use them in your code you just need to declare the prototype, which often is public albeit undocumented &#8211; and Raymond said the Office team used to reverse-engineer them long before they had access to Windows internals. I think the only exception are the SystemFunctionXXX exports of advapi32.dll</p>

		<p>Stu: most unnamed ordinals can be resolved to names thanks to the public PDB symbols, like the huge amount exported by shell32.dll and shlwapi.dll. Just, don&#8217;t actually use them :-) That is, unless they have already been documented as part of the EU settlement (you&#8217;ll find a number of them are still undocumented, but most are Unicode stubs for Windows 95/98, and now there&#8217;s unicows.dll for that)</p>
<p>Yeah, sure. Office uses them. That&#8217;s why Office applications are honor guests in the hall of shame of the Application Compatibility database. Do you aspire to that? :-)</p>

		<p>&gt; Now, some people are in the habit of reverse-engineering import libraries, probably because<br />
<br />&gt;they can&#8217;t be bothered to download the Platform SDK and get the real import libraries.</p>
<p>AFAICT, the usual reason is that the EULA for the Platform SDK doesn&#8217;t allow redistribution of the import libraries, so if you&#8217;re packaging up a compiler, you don&#8217;t really have much choice but to make your own version by reverse engineering the system DLLs.</p>
<p>&gt; it was only by browsing some of the Mozilla source code that it dawned on me what the difference between SW_NORMAL and SW_RESTORE is</p>
<p>I find that the WINE source code is invaluable for this kind of thing. &nbsp;I had a piece of code a while back that just wasn&#8217;t working right. &nbsp;My user-defined data parameter to a window I was creating was getting munged in some way that I couldn&#8217;t quite figure out. &nbsp;The MSDN docs were silent on the issue, I had no idea what was going wrong. &nbsp;In desperation I turned to the WINE source code for CreateWindowEx. &nbsp;Just doing a quick dry-run over it revealed the problem: if you have WS_EX_MDICHILD in your extended styles, the user-defined data is replaced with an internal structure that&#8217;s documented not in CreateWindowEx but in CreateMDIChildWindow (or whatever the API is called). &nbsp;I could have spent weeks trying to figure out what was going on if I didn&#8217;t have access to that source code, or if WINE hadn&#8217;t implemented the behaviour. &nbsp;This just isn&#8217;t documented *anywhere*. (Or at least wasn&#8217;t when I was trying to figure it out, sometime around 2002 I think)</p>

		<p>How were functions exported in windows 3.1 (enhanced mode and win32s)? As in 16-bit real/standard mode or as native win32?</p>
<div CLASS=post=>[<i>You already know the answer. Hint: How functions are exported and imported is a file format issue. -Raymond</i>]</div>
