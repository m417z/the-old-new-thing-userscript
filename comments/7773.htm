		<p>The analysis is all well and good, no disagreement there. But there actually is a half-way, not-completely-awful option for the customer: have the program use a single encrypted/signed parameter (encoded as base64) that incorporates the password and any other options for the execution of the program. Then the data in the shortcut can be used by the user only to run the program in exactly the way intended.</p>
<p>Of course, the user can still hack the program itself to retrieve the private key/decryption algorithm and decode the shortcut. But that&#39;s going to be true in any scenario where the password is both stored and used under the user&#39;s credentials (e.g. in a separate file).</p>
<p>One possible fix to that problem would be to implement security-critical components as a service instead of in the executable the user runs. The encrypted parameter block is passed to the service which the user has no access to at all, not even to view the binaries. Then the service performs whatever action is needed on the user&#39;s behalf.</p>
<p>None of this is meant to suggest that these ideas are better than simply putting the sensitive resource itself behind an identity-protected layer and requiring user credentials. IMHO that&#39;s the best solution. But there are acceptable alternatives for scenarios where that&#39;s not possible/practical for some reason.</p>

		<p>Of course, if this were Unix, the &quot;shortcut&quot; (script) could just use setuid to get the password from a file the logged on user doesn&#39;t have access to.</p>

<p>That&#39;s exactly what a lot of UNIX developers would do. It turns out that X message passing is slightly more secure than Windows message passing (you can still fake it out pretty good but things like EM_GETSEL for overwriting memory in the target process don&#39;t exist).</p>

		<p>I suspect xpclient is looking at a Windows Installer COM shortcut, whereby the text shown in the &quot;Target&quot; field comes from some MSI property (I forget which) and so can say pretty much anything it wants as the actual shortcut is resolved via the Windows Installer service.</p>
<p>And no, nothing exclusive to Microsoft about those either.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t think that you always want to grant access based on the user ID: it may make sense to do it based on the tool that the person is using.</p>
<p>Taking a real life example, there was a company with two applications. App 1 was the stock control system. App 2 (mine) had read-only access to the stock control system to look up product codes, but it stored all its information in its own database. Both apps used SQL authentication, i.e. one username/password per application. Shortly after App 2 was installed, they found a problem in their stock control database (missing/incorrect data) and they immediately blamed me for it. I was able to clear myself, because a) my app didn&#39;t make any changes, and b) even if I&#39;d got drunk and written the wrong commands, my app didn&#39;t have permission to make any changes. However, if both apps had used the end user&#39;s credentials then I wouldn&#39;t have had that safety net/excuse.</p>
<p>The best workaround I&#39;ve come up with is pete.d&#39;s method, which is similar to the way that websites usually work: the database can have a single set of credentials (used by the ASP.NET code), then each person who logs into the website can have their own separate credentials (stored elsewhere). However, it seems a bit unwieldy. Is there a &quot;best practice&quot; approach to this?</p>

		<p>@jader3rd: I have seen many highly intelligent folk jump through all kind of hoops to avoid doing what specialists know is the correct/better way of doing things. It seems like they get their mind set on one solution then put blinders on and won’t really consider any other path to a solution. It doesn’t seem to matter what kind of problem it is either. If there is hardware to fix a problem, they will say “hardware is expensive, fix it in the software” then spend more $$ on a software solution than the hardware would have cost, then complain that it doesn’ work as well as they would like. Or, as in this case, there is a perfectly good way to do things in software, but it isn’t the way they think it should be done so they aren’t satisfied. OK, rant over. :)</p>

		<p>This doesn&#39;t seem any different from the standard Unix guidance not to put any potentially compromising information in the arguments passed to a program because command lines can be seen by any user (using &quot;top&quot;, for example). There comes a point where you have to roll with the system, not fight it, and security is one of those points for me.</p>

		<p>@AndyCadley: The implementation of MSI shortcuts are exclusive to MS since it has its own datablock in the .lnk with some encoded text (EXP_DARWIN_LINK) You can not invent your own custom data block (And even you could, Windows would not know that it should gray out things)</p>

		<p>Actually my first thought was that they were trying to start a RunAs-variant that accepts a password on the command line to do some admin job for the user or start a program the users need that cannot cope with non-admin privileges. Sometimes I would have found this handy myself&#8230;</p>

		<p>Nope I am looking at a shortcut to any Metro style app that says notused in the target, hides the actual target: <a href="http://i.imgur.com/O5Qws.png" target="_new" rel="nofollow">http://i.imgur.com/O5Qws.png</a> and can&#39;t be launched from anywhere except the &quot;Applications&quot; namespace extension in Windows 8.

		<p>@Marcel: I sometimes port little application without UI as service, so I can change the account it&#39;s running on (such as to poll data to local Access database), and place a little shortcut on desktop to tell user to run it when they need it. (The application is written as part of DR plan, so normally it won&#39;t be run as the cold standby database server won&#39;t be running)</p>
<p>In that case, Raymond&#39;s tips on how to allow non-admin user start a service is helpful and inspiring.</p>

		<p>Diego&#39;s comment misses out that SETUID can&#39;t apply here, but it is indeed reminiscent of it.</p>
<p>When working on that problem, I have noticed that it&#39;s possible on Windows to have an executable file that can be executed but not read (like say, a program with a password in resources). However that doesn&#39;t prevent a determined user from debugging the program once it&#39;s running.</p>
<p>As for the SETUID problem itself, the root of it seems to be that on Windows you can&#39;t log a user on without that user&#39;s credentials, unlike Unix where the superuser can do that.</p>

		<p>@Medinoc It&#39;s possible for privileged processes to impersonate, so that they can access local resources in another user&#39;s security context, without knowing their password. (Vista makes this really easy via Task Manager.) I have some vague recollection that things worked differently on a domain controller though.</p>

		<p>Did I even say the word &quot;evil&quot;? My point is it masks information from the user which should be shown.</p>

		<p>@xpclient Maybe next time you don&#39;t understand something, first think, then search and then maybe annoy us all with some conspiracy theories? Obviously that would at least halve your post count, but winning a bumper sticker for your 10.000th misguided complaint isn&#39;t the goal here or is it?</p>

		<p>@James Schend, Kemp and voo, three clueless morons and counting who haven&#39;t the faintest idea of what&#39;s the discussion is about between Raymond and me. There&#39;s no question of &quot;not understanding&quot; and &quot;evil conspiracy&quot;. The point is MS hides the target of certain shortcuts and provides no way for end users to resolve them.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m with xp.client on his previous post. Its cheap to bash him without a clue about the subject of discussion. As it turned out, he was right with the &quot;notused&quot; thing and others was wrong by their purely theoretical assumptions about this topic.</p>

		<p>@Medinoc: It turns out it is possible to log on without a password if you don&#39;t want network resources.</p>

		<p>So, what exactly is wrong with the batch file attempt? You can give rights to execute and deny rights to read the batch file, can&#39;t you?</p>

		<p>Sven2: It&#39;s impossible to execute a batch file that you can&#39;t read because it&#39;s executed by first reading the file.</p>
