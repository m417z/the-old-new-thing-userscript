		<p>How come it&#8217;s impossible to use the display properties dialog in Windows since Windows 2000? It&#8217;s window height is too big, accessing the buttons at the bottom is impossible.</p>
<p>Oh and using Aero with 8bpp color depth is fun&#8230;Windows should disable the new UI for such resolutions, it&#8217;s just a huge ugly mess&#8230;</p>

		<p>I believe 640&#215;480 is the only resolution where a 3rd party driver is not required (i.e. a &quot;VGA&quot; card provides address space to display 640&#215;480 without proprietary segment swapping) hence it&#8217;s used in &quot;safe&quot; mode so there&#8217;s a reasonable guarantee the video driver isn&#8217;t a variable. &nbsp;Since &quot;VGA&quot; is the lowest common denominator Windows will likely always have to support 640&#215;480.</p>

		<p>The display properties dialog is 455 pixels high by default, so should be fine under 640&#215;480. &nbsp;The Advanced settings page however, is 558 pixels high on my machine, but then that&#8217;s probably because of the custom ATI tabs &#8211; so I would assume a server might not have these custom tabs installed.</p>

		<p>I think its rather Ironic that the onyl default dialog that doesn&#8217;t fit in 640&#215;480 is the Display Properties one that you use to change the resolution to enable you to see the dialogs. Its so ironic that I almost think it was done deliberately :-)</p>
<p>MS could create a special safe-moe GUI that was useable in special admin situations &#8211; a combination of the command prompt and a Management Console with options to load all the different snapins. This &#8216;admin mode&#8217; would be perfect for remote administration anyway, so the effort would not be wasted in any way.</p>
<p>The argument about users being anxious when running in safe mode and trying to fix their broken computer &#8211; generally, if they have enough knowledge to enter safe mode in the first place, and enough knowledge to attempt a fix, then they will surely be technically-minded enough not to mind that the GUI isn&#8217;t as familiar as when running in normal mode.</p>

		<p>One of the things I&#8217;ve noticed about the start menu in vista is that in higher resolutions it doesn&#8217;t scale. On my 1920&#215;1200 screen it takes up about 10% of the screen when it is open, resulting in lots of extra scrolling and clicking which isn&#8217;t necessary. To me this is a bad use of screen real-estate.</p>
<p>I think there should be some thought taken as to how the start menu looks in wide-screen displays, in large resolutions and in dual monitor situations. The reality is that windows 95 was 10+ years ago, and that setups are much different now. Part of the reason that we had a start menu in the first place was because the old way of doing things (c:frogger.exe) didn&#8217;t make sense with the new vga screens. Likewise the start menu can&#8217;t remain the same. I think there has been some good design done in the media center team to make starting programs on a tv work really well. Likewise I think the start menu needs an update for 1920&#215;1200 and beyond. I find the vista changes totally ignore these new changes in the pc marketplace.</p>

		<p>&quot;Toast&quot; == the ballon help / tooltip things that appear near the notification area on the right-hand side of the tray.</p>
<p>The other trouble is 16 bpp colour &#8211; the default Windows Vista UI maps several control elements to the same colour, making basic navigation (like, to the IE properties page to configure a proxy, and download a display driver), very difficult.</p>

		<p>@GeorgeBell: &nbsp;Just a thought, but it may not appear to &#8216;scale&#8217; due to the fact that Vista properly takes into account your display&#8217;s DPI. &nbsp;On Windows 2000, you could bump up the resolution from 1280&#215;1024 to 1600&#215;1200 and things would get smaller, but that was only because Win2K assumed you were always running at 96DPI, even though your 1600&#215;1200 was probably closer to 100DPI. &nbsp;Vista now recognizes the higer DPI and scales things accordingly. &nbsp;Specifically, a 10 point font should appear to be about .14 inches on your display. &nbsp;Vista trys hard to ensure that it is, &nbsp;whereas older versions of Windows didn&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>Toast = message that comes sliding up, like a piece of toasted bread. MSN Messenger and Outlook have them.</p>
<p>Balloon tips = tooltip with a tip pointing to a system notification area icon. &quot;Screen res too low&quot; is a balloon tip.</p>
<p>Also, even if Windows can&#8217;t find a display driver, it installs a &quot;Standard VGA&quot; driver which can do up to 1024*768 32BPP 60Hz, probably using VBE (VESA BIOS Extensions). A lot of people at my work install new machines, and are then surprised at how slow their new computer is (or not notice it at all &#8211; we develop server software anyways). I do believe that Safe Mode doesn&#8217;t even load this driver either.</p>

		<p>The argument that deisgn of a 640&#215;480 interface would take away from Aero design seems disingenuous to me.</p>

<div class=post>[<i>But that interface would need to be maintained. For example, somebody would have to design, implement, and test a &#8220;Windows 95 style Security Center&#8221;, since Windows 95 didn&#8217;t have one. That will cost you resources. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I love Windows Safe Mode! &nbsp;Really.</p>
<p>There are lots of ancient systems out there that use the 640x480x4bpp paletted mode from the original IBM VGA boards. &nbsp;Since Windows Safe Mode uses this setup, even the fanciest modern video boards still have to support it, so my ancient non-Windows machines still run on modern hardware.</p>

		<p>Another solution would be to use a 800&#215;600 virtual desktop with hardware panning into the 640&#215;480 screen. A stock VGA should be able to handle it. It wouldn&#8217;t be pretty, but you wouldn&#8217;t have problems with fighting the 640&#215;480 UI battle (which was long ago lost).</p>

		<p>To make the story complete, in the current Windows versions there are already some related glitches.</p>
<p>During installation, if the video card is not recognized by the system, you&#8217;re left with 640&#215;480. Now to change to higher resolution, once you install the driver, you need a &quot;display properties&quot; dialog. And that dialog doesn&#8217;t nicely fit in 640&#215;480. At first you are &nbsp;unpleasently surprized and think that you wouldn&#8217;t be able to perform the operation, and then you manage *somehow* (you hide the taskbar or something).</p>
<p>Now not directly related, but wouldn&#8217;t be nice to have a Windows CE (or whatever the its name now is) interface as an option? And it&#8217;s a pitty that it&#8217;s so hard to buy really small LCD&#8217;s, I can imagine some nice uses of them, not only for big sets of servers.</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8230;would you rather spend it on making the Aero interface even more solid?&quot;</p>
<p>The Aero look is transparent, it isn&#8217;t *supposed* to look solid. If it does look solid, there is likely some problem and they should spend time trying to not make it be solid. </p>

<p>100% true. &nbsp;Thank you for mostly addressing that.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Safe Mode is used less than one tenth of one</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>BIOS APIs are used less than one tenth of one percent of the time. &nbsp;But they&#8217;d better work during that one tenth of one percent of the time, or your boot won&#8217;t proceed to the point where XP&#8217;s drivers will take over.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had the same problem with display properties not being usable in 640&#215;480 mode in order to get out of 640&#215;480 mode, and a few other dialog boxes. &nbsp;I guess I get it more than other English-language commenters because my usual Windows environment isn&#8217;t English and the default font size is 9. &nbsp;Sure these dialogs are used less than one tenth of one percent of the time, but they need to be made to work during that time.</p>
<p>Probably the most reproduced example of 640&#215;480 comes from installing Vista under Virtual PC. &nbsp;Other examples come from other video chips that aren&#8217;t recognized, and sometimes (under XP anyway) intermediate stages of installing graphics drivers from Intel or NVidia.</p>

<p>Correction: &nbsp;Windows changes to 800&#215;600 if Windows DETECTS that the adapter and monitor support it. &nbsp;Sometimes Windows doesn&#8217;t detect it automatically even after I install a vendor&#8217;s driver, and I have to finish the settings by hand. &nbsp;(Of course I have to finish the settings by hand anyway, since usually they can go past 800&#215;600 too.)</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what he&#8217;s arguing. I think he was just pointing out that Aero will still have to function in 640&#215;480, because designing a *separate* interface specifically intended for 640&#215;480 would be too expensive.</p>

		<p>800&#215;600 is an everyday, workable minimum for consumers, so that&#8217;s what it says on the tin.</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve seen XP run natively on 320&#215;200, and thanks to terminal services you can have any screen size down to 1&#215;1 (although, strangely, you can&#8217;t go the other way &#8211; mstsc has a limit of 1600 by default).</p>

		<p>As Mr. Semack notes above, and as others have noted (including the example of servers using small monitors), Windows works on smaller resolutions than 800 x 600.</p>
<p>Therefore, the minimum requirement is not 800 x 600. Perhaps it is recommended, but it is clearly not the minumum, unless you ignore the meaning of minimum.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>It is the design minimum. Sure, you can go lower, just like you can drive a car with no tires. But it wasn&#8217;t designed for it. I&#8217;m still baffled that this is such a hard concept. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I&#8217;ve got a Server 2003 box that&#8217;s got a 640&#215;480 display. &nbsp;I use the computer for just a few minutes a week while my other computer is busy doing something else. &nbsp;Sometimes&#8217;s it&#8217;s annoying trying to run through a dialog or wizard clearly designed for a larger screen and not using standard Windows templates. &nbsp;(At least I can keyboard navigate with the Windows Templates.)</p>
<p>So designers and programmers, you need to consider those with the 640&#215;480 screens as well as those that may be running at 768&#215;1024 (Portrait Mode). &nbsp;My little sister got a new tablet PC that supports portrait mode, and I was using a LCD earlier today that was rotated to portrait mode.</p>

		<p>Anyhow, the 640&#215;480 res *does* work with the display properties gump. &nbsp;You just have to unlock the taskbar and move it down. &nbsp;Just did that today to be able to read a 14&quot; monitor without reaching for my glasses.</p>
<p>For those that don&#8217;t know you can always specify 640&#215;480 even though the settings page doesn&#8217;t seem to allow it by clicking on Advanced, then choosing the Adapter tab and clicking the Display All Modes button (or words to that effect.)</p>

<p>I am sure you would discover that Windows <em>can</em> run on specs lower then what is on the box. But that doesn&#8217;t mean that Microsoft have to encourage people to run Windows XP on a socket 3, Pentium Overdrive 8 MHz &amp; 20 MB RAM.</p>

		<p>The new &quot;Origami&quot; UMPC&#8217;s have 800&#215;480 screens, the same height as 640&#215;480. They typically have a hardware scaling system to reach higher resolutions (it looks crappy, but it&#8217;s the only way to make it useable, too many Windows dialogs are too tall).</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what Vista UMPC&#8217;s will have, but it better be higher.</p>
<p>Even Windows 98 has many dialogs that don&#8217;t fit properly on 640&#215;480 screens, you pretty much have to turn on taskbar auto-hide, just to make things barely usable.</p>
<p>If 640&#215;480 support is only being maintained for Safe Mode, why not use a &quot;panning desktop&quot; by default in Safe Mode?</p>
<p>Support has been there since Windows 95, so it&#8217;s pretty mature, and it&#8217;s much more usable to scroll the screen then to have to memorise the keyboard shortcuts to the controls at the bottom of tall dialogs.</p>
<p>I suppose the arguement is &quot;scrolling the desktop would be confusing to newbies&quot; (paraphrased). Well Safe Mode is confusing to newbies:</p>
<p>Why does my desktop background look rubbish? Why are my icons different? Why does my flash pen not work? What do you mean I can&#8217;t connect to the interent?</p>
<p>My computer must be broken. Stupid Microsoft.</p>

		<p>Stu et al:</p>
<p>I am not sure, but considering the lack of performance when scrolling generally (run dir for system32 in safe mode to see what I mean), I would guess that &quot;virtual screeen panning&quot; might be a pretty bad idea after all. Of course, it&#8217;s easier to optimize the code for &quot;scroll the full screen&quot;, but in a pure framebuffer driver, the speed is still limiting.</p>

<p>Safe mode may be confusing for newbies but I doubt newbies will be using safe mode. &nbsp;Safe mode, by definition, is for emergencies when the computer has crashed. &nbsp;So is a newbie going to fix the computer? &nbsp;No, he/she is going to call tech-support. &nbsp;I doubt the newbie will even boot into safe mode &#8211; and in fact not even know about safe mode since the person is, well, a newbie.</p>

		<p>I read the blog all the time and find it valuable.</p>
<p>My question was a legitimate one. Raymond&#8217;s answer was fine, except that for some reason he chose to append &#8220;I can&#8217;t believe I had to explain that,&#8221; implying the question was a dumb one. I have to admit I got snarky after that because I thought his response deserved it.</p>
<p>I am over my snarkyness but I will say once more that the minimum requirement thing doesn&#8217;t make much sense. First of all, as I&#8217;ve pointed out, it redefines the word minimum. Secondly, Raymond&#8217;s post itself talks about how Microsoft designers have to make sure everything works at 640 x 480. So, since 640 x 480 is required to function, and this is the lowest resolution that&#8217;s required to function, most people would say that the minimum required resolution is 640 x 480.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>800&#215;600 is the design minimum. Obviously the &#8220;absolute theoretical minimum&#8221; doesn&#8217;t go on the box because people would have a reasonable expectation that meeting the &#8220;minimum requirements&#8221; would still be usable. I mean, the theoretical minimum number of tires on a car is zero (you could drive on rims), but no car manufacturer is going to say in their vehicle specifications &#8220;tires optional&#8221;. Same thing with the requirements on the box. Why is this surprising? -Raymond</i>]</div>

<p>No it isn&#8217;t and no you can&#8217;t. You&#8217;ll get at most 10 miles and god help you if you have to brake. Meanwhile, the minimum display size is zero &#8211; I have a computer or 10,000 like that and they work just fine.

<p>You&#8217;re completely forgetting that Windows will boot into safe mode automatically if it fails enough times.</p>
<p>Also the old question of not recognizing the video card. With W9* you would get 640 x480 x 16 &nbsp;color automatically. I once ran a computer for two years that way (porn looked vile) because nobody told me I needed to find a driver for the video card.</p>

		<p>Sometimes servers are run at 640&#215;480, where you have a rack of them in the datacentre and one shared popup LCD or legacy CRT monitor to work with. Usually the datacentre is over-cooled, you have a trackball instead of a mouse (pop-out keyboard) see, and invariably some networking crisis to diagnose (if it isnt a network crisis, you can come in remotely, see).</p>
<p>while most apps shouldnt bother to test L&amp;F on a 640&#215;480 GUI, emergency management and system setup tools do still need to work at this level.</p>
<p>The alternative is serial port access and command line operations, which unix/linux does, but which is a lot less easy in windows. Have you ever tried to set up the display and networking settings of a w2K03 server from the command line?</p>

		<p>The fear of confusing users with &#8216;minimum&#8217; requirements brings back memories of a laptop user I knew some time ago, who always made sure to boot his laptop into &#8216;Safe Mode&#8217;. (Well, who wants to run in *unsafe* mode?!) It can&#8217;t have been a great user experience for him; on the bright side, I suppose at least he felt &#8216;Safe&#8217;!</p>
<p>Steve has a point: you might not need/want the Word text formatting dialog to work at 640&#215;480, but if your server&#8217;s network settings can&#8217;t be changed without wheeling over a big monitor, it&#8217;s a serious pain.</p>

		<p>Ring Zero, don&#8217;t feel bad, it&#8217;s been established long ago that Mr. Chen is a supreme asshole with an extemely snobbish attitude towards others. Either you ignore it and stay or you go. Let the little boy have his fun and make his snarky comments and visit another website.</p>

		<p>&gt; See, you said it yourself. It can be done, for 10 miles at least. So you were wrong when you said it can&#8217;t be done. </p>
<p>Nope, there is a presumption that if you can operate a car with 0 tires, you can do it without destroying the car. Likewise, you can run windows in 640&#215;480, it just sucks because MS can&#8217;t manage to make it work. </p>
<div class=post>[<i>You can run Windows 640&#215;480. It won&#8217;t be fun, but it still works. I don&#8217;t think anybody promised that it&#8217;d be fun. That&#8217;s why the box says &#8220;minimum resolution 800&#215;600&#8221;. -Raymond</i>]</div>
<p>Steve:</p>
<p>&gt; Sometimes servers are run at 640&#215;480, where you have a rack of them in the datacentre and one shared popup LCD or legacy CRT monitor to work with.</p>
<p>Why would you ever do this? Am I just spoiled by serial consoles that can be run in a quiet office somewhere else?</p>

		<p>This is the first time I am actually posting something on raymond&#8217;s blog.</p>
<p>Like raymond, I can&#8217;t believe how difficult it is for some to grasp the difference between the design minimum and the absolute theoretical minimum.</p>
<p>The design minimum is one that allows you to use the application/software/OS/whatever at that minimum requirement for long periods of time for no problem.</p>
<p>The absolute theoretical minimum that is used in emergency situations is one that allows you to use the same thing for short periods of time, often to solve a problem but it would be very difficult to use it for long periods of time .</p>
<p>I can use windows xp at 800&#215;600 for long periods of time and all the UI is adjusted properly. However, safe mode uses 640&#215;480 because safe mode is usually used in emergency situations when you need to fix something. Why is it 640&#215;480? Probably because you don&#8217;t need any other drivers (other than the default one) to display at 640&#215;480 and as a result, lowering the dependencies of safe mode operation.</p>
<p>Another analogy, you went to work one day wearing a simple pair of pants and no underwear (because they are all in the laundry). Your minimum design requirement at this point is a pair of pants (unless you want everyone to see you in your full glory). You sat down on your chair and while adjusting the chair, suddenly your pants split and now everyone would be able to take a peak of your full glory if you stood up. You need to get home and change immediately.</p>
<p>You look to your coworker&#8217;s cubicle and you find her long sweater there. You borrow it from her, tie it around your waist so that your glory is once again hidden and you make your way home in a cab to change. What was your absolute theoretical minimum requirements at this point? A pair of sweaters.</p>
<p>Notice how your absolute theoretical minimum requirements is not the same as your design minimum. Because if it was the same, then you wouldn&#8217;t mind going out to work wearing sweaters tied around your waist.</p>
<p>For those who say raymond&#8217;s comments are snarky, understand where he is coming from. For example, if you had to explain to a grown men who is currently participating in advanced some programming class why you should create an array of 100 integers instead of creating 100 individual integers, you would probably have the same reaction.</p>
<p>It was something he felt was very elementary to the readers of his blog and then you guys call him an asshole, a thermonuclear device. Real nice.</p>
<p>And another thing, I understand how microsoft has done some stupid things or even things that are just wrong, but please, lets not jump on the bandwagon and say things like &#8216;Microsoft redefines the word minimum&#8217;.</p>

		<p>Speaking of resolutions, I long ago made a small program that let you change the Windows resolution to anything supported by the graphic card. After playing with it for a few minutes, I readjusted the dialog to fit to 320&#215;200 display (but that didn&#8217;t help me when I somehow managed to set 320&#215;80 at school).</p>

		<p>To all those complaining about Raymond being a thermonuclear device I have very simple piece of advice:</p>
<p>If Raymond Chen is the thermonuclear device then first RTFM before approaching him &#8212; otherwise you don&#8217;t have the right to complain if it blows up in your face.</p>
<p>It pisses me off when people waste my time by asking me to do things they could do themselves.</p>
<p>It is akin to booting your computer just to use calculator, calendar or clock.</p>
<p>I believe that they are not lazy &#8212; they are just spoiled brats and there is really no excuse for such behavior so I vote for zero tolerance.</p>
<p>Here is one fine example &#8212; my mother&#8217;s friend. She bought a pre-paid card to top up her cell phone &#8212; the one you need to scratch to reveal a number which you enter into the phone after dialing a certain number, specific to your service provider.</p>
<p>Of course, she asked me to do it. If she were just lazy you would expect her to say &quot;Please could you do that for me, because I don&#8217;t feel like doing it at the moment?&quot;</p>
<p>Instead she said &quot;Please could you do that for me, because I don&#8217;t know how to do it?&quot; Of course I told her to go forth and multiply because instructions are printed on the back of the damn card.</p>
<p>These days you have to teach people to respect your time.</p>
