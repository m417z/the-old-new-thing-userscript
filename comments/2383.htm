		<p>So what? All this work for waste. Metro will die a slow and painful death because Microsoft will not address key usability and accessibility issues.</p>

		<p>IMHO Metro is great for tablets. The problem is that its experience isn&#39;t as good on desktop computers, but most people insist on installing and reviewing Windows 8 on them. If rummors are true (Thurrott et al.), Windows 8.2 would come with the two most important missing features for pros: the return of the Start Menu, and the ability to run Metro applications windowed in the desktop. Those will allow it to be used easily by pros in desktop computers and full featured laptops. But I guess I&#39;m getting too off-topic for this blog :-) .</p>

		<p>Don&#39;t know what the big problem people have with Metro on non-touch computers. &nbsp;I use Win 8 daily for several months now and it is great. &nbsp;Granted, as soon as I log in I &quot;Win+D&quot; into the desktop and I use exactly zero Metro apps. &nbsp;But I do use the Start Screen as a combo Search+Laucher for programs and control panel entries, and I honestly think it rocks at that, much more so than the tiny start menu of earlier versions.</p>

		<p>@Anon</p>
<p>&quot;As soon as I log in, I X&quot; That&#39;s what&#39;s wrong. You have to do the exact same thing each time you log in, something that you never had to do with any previous version of the OS, something that interferes with workflow.</p>
<p>8.1 &quot;fixes&quot; that, of course, but hides the option.</p>
<p>As for the Start menu, the problem is that it takes additional keystrokes to use the search in Win8 to launch applications/open files/etc. That&#39;s a step backwards in usability, especially for Accessibility.</p>

<p>When I can buy a ~23&quot; touchscreen monitor for $100 and a ~50&quot; touchscreen TV for $700, whether or not it is &quot;great for tablets&quot; will matter.</p>

		<p>&quot;The fix was to turn off the colors and just show plain tiles.&quot;</p>
<p>Hmm? Are you saying in the Start screen if I scroll fast enough the colors will disappear?</p>

<p>Huh? &nbsp;</p>
<p>On Win7 I tap Windows button and start typing, once results appear I use the arrow keys and press enter. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On Win8.1 I tap Windows button and start typing, once results appear I use the arrow keys and press enter.</p>
<p>The workflow is identical. &nbsp;Overall I like the new start screen, although it is different. &nbsp;The big step backwards for me is the flat UI. &nbsp;The removal of the shadows and other UI tweaks actually makes it hard to tell where one window ends and the next begins. &nbsp;That and even if Aero is a bit cheesy, flat shaded rectangles are so 1990.</p>

		<p>Anon#2,</p>
<p>Admittedly, I have not had to use it much yet, but so far the search-to-launch behavior in Win8/2012 seems to match my experience in Win7. [Win], type the first few letters, [Enter]; desired item successfully launched.</p>
<p>Am I thinking of something else, or what did you have in mind?</p>

<p>&quot;I wonder if you guys do this in real life. In response to a cooking demonstration on how to bake a cake, you say, &#39;That brand of oven sucks.&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Actually, I have indeed seen exactly that kind of thing happen, all the time. And if I was a participant, and if I attempted to move back to the original topic, the other participants pretty much always got thoroughly annoyed. &quot;We stopped talking about that 20 minutes ago!&quot; (Actually 1 minute.)</p>

		<p>Now let&#39;s all have a whinge about how no self respecting computer user would use that Fisher Price start menu in XP. And celebrate our victory over the mighty Microsoft when, after years of carping from righteous internet experts, they turned it off in service pack 1 and removed it entirely from Vista.</p>
<p>Keep fighting the good fight guys. What would the world&#39;s most experienced usability and interface design experts know that we don&#39;t? Microsoft could save millions if they closed their usability labs and turned over ui design to blog commenters!</p>

		<p>@Robert: that is not enough. Even if you had a 1000Hz refresh rate, the 60Hz flicker of the ambient lighting could still get you and trigger the visual effect. You could say &quot;buy better lights&quot;, but that does not help if any user somewhere has a 60Hz flickering light (and when you are using a portable computer, you might not be the one who controls the ambient lights).</p>

		<p>@SimonRev a problem I have seen with Windows 8.1 is that when somebody is reading instructions of what to type from a document (sometimes I write those instructions), they can&#39;t see the document once they open the Start Screen.</p>
<p>Another detail is the lack of sub menus. I would like to be able to group tiles, so they are presented as a single one, and when I open that I will find the tiles I have put in.</p>
<p>Yes, I know I type the name of the app. I used to forgive the name &quot;KDiff3&quot;, I just know it is something &quot;Diff&quot; but if I type it wont come up, because it a radix search. Instead I have copied the shortcut to the desktop which I sorted with third party software.</p>
<p>A smaller complain is the size of the tiles. I cannot change the sizes en-mass. I have select them all, one by one, and then select rezise. If I could use a selection box (as you select icons) that would be mitigated. Why do I want them to be small? Because I want to take a loot at all my tiles at once &#8211; by default, not behind a click &#8211; and then I can select (I find it easy to remember icon and relative position). Then my start screen would be like a hidden desktop with supper powers.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Or you can give me the Start Menu back.</p>

		<p>Actually I&#39;ll try to keep it on topic ;)</p>
<p>This reminds me of a phenomenom in fighting video games. The switch from 2D to 3D enabled the animators to provide 30/60 fps animations but the games felt wrong. They had to slow down the fps of the animation to match the one used in oldschool 2D games.</p>

<p>Did they? They evil Search Puppy (and Desktop Cleanup Wizard) is still there in SP3. They didn&#39;t even kill Desktop Cleanup in Windows 7, they just made it running behind your back, deleting your shortcuts to network shares every week or so.</p>
<p>&gt;Even if you had a 1000Hz refresh rate, the 60Hz flicker of the ambient lighting could still get you and trigger the visual effect</p>
<p>Last time I checked, LCD monitors don&#39;t work off the ambient light. And most fluorescents these days use electronic ballast which doesn&#39;t give you any flicker. Even the residual flicker would be 120 Hz then.</p>

		<p>Speaking of refresh rate, go see 48 fps Hobbit. It&#39;s VERY smooth. In the first movie, though, there seem to be a sequence shot in 24 fps (when they run across some plain), and you can see it&#39;s choppy.</p>

<p>Now try opening any non-Program item. You have to change the type of object you&#39;re searching for.</p>
<p>I can no longer hit Winkey and type &quot;Document 43827,&quot; then hit Enter. I have to hit the Winkey, type &quot;Document 43827,&quot; use the arrow keys or mouse to select the appropriate type of search, then open it.</p>

		<p>Anon: the default is to search everywhere (programs, settings, files) in Windows 8.1. I presume something important is keeping you from upgrading from Win8, else why wouldn&#39;t you?</p>

		<p>I hadn&#39;t actually noticed the solid color boxes before this. There appears to be a certain ramp-up time which scrolls past couple of screens already, then there&#39;s a noticeable jump in scrolling speed as the boxes turn single-colored and a fraction of a second later the screen is at the end. In practice the simulation doesn&#39;t capture different box sizes and extra space between groups of boxes and groups typically not being completely full which all work to break the uniformity.</p>
<p>This is on a desktop and a mouse with hyper-fast scrolling. No tablet needed for flick of a finger scrolling!</p>

		<p>&gt;So how do you turn off the colors in Windows 8.1? All the boxes were blue in Windows 8, but since I upgraded to 8.1 they&#39;re all different colors and the disco lights are on.</p>
<p>No. Microsoft KNOWS what&#39;s good for you, and DON&#39;T YOU EVER DARE TO QUESTION THAT.</p>

		<p>If people typically have so many tiles that they have to scroll through them like that why not implement a zoom feature? Either a zoom setting that scales all tiles or a SupCom style tactical zoom (zoom out, point cursor at desired tile group, zoom in on cursor).</p>
<p>There is a zoom button, but as far as I know (I don&#39;t use W8) it only enables the user to rearrange tiles, not to actually use them.</p>
<p>&#8230;I hope to god the answer isn&#39;t &quot;because phones don&#39;t have a scroll wheel&quot;.</p>

		<p>The stroboscopic effect reminds me of a project one of our teams worked on last year. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It was a .Net WinForms project. &nbsp;Part of the project showed a list of open orders in a very typical grid. &nbsp;The users wanted easily see at a glance the status of each order so they wanted them color-coded. &nbsp;The team working on it advised against, but you know how users are&#8230;.</p>
<p>The developers did what the users wanted. &nbsp;However, the list of orders could be very big and some of them were used to scrolling the list vertically to fins what they wanted even though they had filters where they could easily subset the list.</p>
<p>After this &quot;enhancement&quot; went production, the users were clamoring to have the added color removed because it was, in their words, &quot;hard to look at&quot; when scrolling. &nbsp;Fortunately, the team that built that put in a config option that would allow them to turn the color mess off is they wanted to and every single user did just that.</p>

		<p>I can&#39;t believe readers of this blog haven&#39;t heard of Semantic Zoom before (ok, certain readers :P). &nbsp;All of the early Silverlight demos were about support for it years ago. &nbsp;Same thing carried through to the start screen in an obvious fashion. &nbsp;As someone who&#39;s recently got an iPad at work (testing our internal web-based app) I much prefer the Win 8 start screen over iOS&#39;. &nbsp;I don&#39;t mind it on my desktop PC either. &nbsp;Those complaining about the search should either</p>
<p>a) Move back to Win 7 and stop complaining. &nbsp;Then, as someone else said about XP, in 5 years we can all want the glory days of Win 8 back because Win 10 sucks or something.</p>
<p>b) Get up to date (since you sound like early adopters) and move to Win 8.1 already!</p>

		<p>@Enai: Ctrl+Scroll wheel. If you&#39;re ever curious about zooming something, give it a go, because that usually always zooms the active program, and it has for a very long time.</p>
<p>If you don&#39;t have a scroll wheel, then the little &quot;-&quot; in the bottom-right corner does the same thing.</p>

		<p>&gt; But video displays are not continuous. They refresh at a particular frequency,</p>
<p>That is the main problem, in my opinion. Even after 25 years, we are still far away from *really* smooth scrolling or mouse pointer movement. If you move the mouse or another object across the screen in 1 second, a typical display with around 50Hz refresh rate will never do better than show you the object in 50 discrete positions.</p>

		<p>Here&#39;s my chance to complain that the lack of submenus takes you back to the glory days of 16-bit Windows.</p>
<p>Actually I tripped over this recently when I was using a Windows 8 tablet with two HP multifunction printers installed. Each one puts its icons into an appropriately named submenu of the HP start menu folder, but within each folder all of the icons are named identically, giving you apparently duplicate icons without an obvious way of distinguishing them.</p>

		<p>I am a developer and always try to be uptodate with applications/environments.</p>
<p>On my desktop I installed Windows 8 from the preview onwards and it rocks; the speed difference is enormous!</p>
<p>My machine starts up (= till moment that the login screen appears) in 5 seconds; the same machine with Windows 7 took like 20+seconds.</p>
<p>And in Windows 7; what did you use of the Start menu?</p>
<p>Just like SimonRev says:</p>
<p>On Win7 I tap Windows button and start typing, once results appear I use the arrow keys and press enter. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On Win8.1 I tap Windows button and start typing, once results appear I use the arrow keys and press enter.</p>
<p>One thing I don&#39;t use on my Windows 8 desktop is Metro apps; if there are desktop version I use them because on my desktop I don&#39;t need the metro-specific versions of the apps atm. But I personally have no problems regarding the Start screen/tiles/&#8230; and I love the speed improvments.</p>

		<p>This is a real-world effect too, not just affecting computer monitors&#8230;</p>
<p>When I was a kid I was always facinated by the way a car wheel appears to reverse direction when slowing down. It&#39;s the same thing, just its based on how fast your eye samples rather than computer refresh rates!</p>

		<p>Lot of comments on here so I may have missed someone pointing this out, but if you don&#39;t like having to Win+D when you log in, don&#39;t. &nbsp;Drag the desktop tile to the top left corner of the start screen and just hit Enter.</p>

		<p>@Mark</p>
<p>Your blind faith in some unknown usability and interface design experts is both naive and misguided. In the history of business, there have been numerous failed projects where millions had been spent and scores of experts has given their guidance. These failures are &nbsp;not just known as flops, but are known as expensive flops. Now, if there is someone who really know how to design a user interface, it must be Steve Jobs and his lieutenants at Apple. And as Steve Jobs once pointed out, the problem of Microsoft is that it has no taste. Without a good taste, it failed to judge if a user interface is better or worse than the others. Indeed, it would have been much better for the user if Microsoft skipped wasting these millions of dollar and simply copy what Apple does in providing separate user interfaces for desktop devices and handheld touch based devices.</p>
