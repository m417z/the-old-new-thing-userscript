		<p>It seems to me that junior high was the classic stuff-em-in-the-locker period, when one encountered 7th graders with muscles like a linebacker&#8217;s and a 5 o&#8217;clock shadow like Nixon&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Of course, kids are bigger in this generation, and with middle schools the 6th graders can be in with some giants.</p>

		<p>How do you rate a 12 year old as the state&#8217;s top safety patrol students?</p>
<p>Are there enough deaths and other accidents at other crossing that they can build a worthwhile list?</p>

		<p>To none north americans, the idea of a Safety monitor is so very, very bizarre.</p>

		<p>@Gossard &#8212; not safety monitor, just safety patrol. All they do is hold up flags to stop traffic.</p>
<p>As for rating &quot;top safety patrol student,&quot; I think it would have to be based on the least number of fellow-pupils killed or maimed [by traffic] during this kid&#8217;s shift.</p>

		<p>When I was coming up through high school I always wondered why movies and such showed lockers, kids getting stuffed into lockers, etc.</p>
<p>All the lockers in every high school I have ever been to (including those that I merely played an &quot;away game&quot; at) were sealed shut until the school could afford to rip them out, and several schools (particularly the newer ones) didn&#8217;t have lockers at all. The only lockers were in the P.E., and those were just drawers. So we never had locker stuffings, but the stated reason for no-lockers was because of the threat from school shootings.</p>
<p>Do high schools elsewhere in the country still have lockers?</p>

		<p>My little brother just graduated high school, and they still had lockers. &nbsp;School shootings is a pretty silly reason to ban lockers, considering no school shooter in history has ever stored his guns in his locker. &nbsp;Normally they are stored in the trunk of his car.</p>

<p>As far as I know, yes. I&#8217;ve never even heard of a high school (in the US) without lockers&#8230;</p>

		<p>All the High Schools I&#8217;ve been at in the US had lockers, but they were way too small to fit a human being inside (or even some of the books we had, for that matter)</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I never claimed the administrators of our school unions were intelligent. They do tend to&#8230; overreact. As do parents, admittedly.</p>
<blockquote><p>

<p>Well, now you have. Come on down to sunny San Diego, home of the Chargers, world famous San Diego Zoo, and crazy school administrators.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t aware that lockers were responsible for all the shootings. I would have thought we might have spotted some malcontent lockers smoking and using drugs, too.</p>
<p>Because clearly they didn&#8217;t mean they thought that by getting rid of lockers, they could actually stop any determined malicious students from hiding guns at all.</p>
<p>Or maybe they do. I keep a locker here in my home, in which I store all the contraband that I would not like the police to find if they were to raid my house. Hmm. Maybe they ARE genius!</p>

		<p>Gossard: We have this in Israel. They only work at times when school start and ends, and all the younger students go out to the street.</p>

		<p>Why was the safety patrol student walking behind the other student? &nbsp;Seems he should be in front. &nbsp;Or, have one safety patrol student with a flag in front, and one behind. &nbsp;:-)</p>
