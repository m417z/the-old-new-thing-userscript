		<p>This bit: &#8220;If she had wanted to sit bored during yet another rehearsal, I wouldn&#8217;t have blamed her.&#8221; seems to be lacking a ~ someplace in the conditional. Which may result in program behavior other than as the author intended.</p>

		<p>I interpret &#8220;sit bored during X&#8221; as the alternative to &#8220;participate in X&#8221;; I assume that social rules prohibit &#8220;do not attend X at all.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Was the prince&#8217;s name Phillip in that fairy tale? I thought it was Charming, but possibly his name was &#8220;Phillip Charming&#8221; in which case both of us could be correct!</p>

		<p>Prince Charming was from Cinderella. And yes, the prince in Sleeping Beauty was Prince Phillip. At least in the Disney version. He seems to have been nameless in earlier versions.<br />

		<p>Funny, because as a Brit whenever I see &#8220;Prince Phillip&#8221; I think of the husband of the present Queen.  He&#8217;s never really been mistaken for Prince Charming, as his basically-racist-old-man social gaffes are well-known in these parts.</p>

		<p>Oh, my, God! You might excel at C, Windows API and useless Micro-speak, but your blog posts so far have given the impression that you are downright awful at whatever is related to social interactions.</p>
<p>Did you, for one moment think what might happen if someone quoted this blog post to her or her parents? Or if she read it?</p>
<p>I still haven&#8217;t forgotten the time when you wrote about customers cases here and protected their privacy by calling them Anthony Appleyard. (I assume good faith: You meant well.) But all the while you failed to realize that you were actually ridiculing them, and then adding a literal insult to the injury by referring to them with the name the established symbol of goofiness and good-for-nothingness.</p>

		<p>I dunno, but this sounds to me like typical, adorable, little-kid behavior.  I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s uncommon for writers and media personalities to describe this kind of stuff to the public, and despite not having kids myself, I love it.</p>
<p>The other stuff you&#8217;re citing is quite different.  There&#8217;s an entire genre of ridiculing technically incompetent customers and/or managers, and that&#8217;s what Chen is writing in that context.  You should check out The Daily WTF for some examples by other authors.</p>

		<p>I am trying to think for one moment what would happen if the parents read the post, or heard it quoted, and what I come up with is &#8220;a chuckle&#8221;. Most flower girls are not yet reading, I think; by the time this one is, she may have a bit of distance on her earlier opinions.</p>
<p>In what realm of discourse is &#8220;Anthony Appleyard&#8221; an established symbol of ineptitude, by the way? I have never run across the name.</p>

		<p>:palmface: 😱<br />
You took the &#8220;Anthony Appleyard&#8221; part literally? Oh, God.</p>
<p>It is like talking about a time-saving trick in COMMAND.COM with someone who thinks the subject of talk is a domain name, as in <a href="http://command.com" rel="nofollow">http://command.com</a>!</p>
<p>And it appears almost no one here understood the Anthony Appleyard construct. But it isn&#8217;t as surprising as the fact that no one here knows that gossip and backbiting is a very poor social misdemeanor. (By the way, alert: &#8220;Backbiting&#8221; is not literally biting someone&#8217;s back with teeth.) And backbiting a child no less!</p>

		<p>Care to explain it? Googling for Anthony Appleyard all I find is people named Anthony Appleyard and no hints as to what you were referring too.</p>
<p>As for the article I think it falls under the category of &#8220;Kids say that darndest things&#8221;. If her or her parents ever read this they would probably just agree with the rest of us that it&#8217;s funny. I&#8217;m not sure how you see this as &#8220;gossip and backbiting&#8221;.</p>

		<p>&gt; I’m not sure how you see this as “gossip and backbiting”.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s exactly what the members of Heinous Backbiters club say in their initiation ceremony: The hold a copy of <i>The Most Heinous Instances of Backbiting in Human History</i> over their head and chant &#8220;We&#8217;re not sure how any of this is backbiting.&#8221; Kids say that darndest things, and adults say even more darndest things, but unless they are said in the public, writing about them without prior consent is backbiting. </p>
<p>&gt; Care to explain it? Googling for Anthony Appleyard&#8230;<br />
No. Explaining the simplest thing that everyone is expected to know is damned hard and time-taking. Learn proper social conduct instead. It benefits you more. Knowing about alliteration+folk metaphor isn&#8217;t that critical.</p>

		<p>Here is a hint Fleet Command:  Nobody here has any clue what you are talking about.  Shaming Raymond for talking about his family in a whimsical manner is beyond ridiculous.  Who made you the subject matter expert on how his family would feel about anything?  I&#8217;m sure Raymond has a better handle on that than you do.  Honestly, please just leave.  Your feigned distress over all this is really tiresome.</p>

		<p>According to Wiktionary backbiting is defined as &#8220;The action of slandering a person without that person&#8217;s knowledge&#8221; with slander being &#8220;A false or unsupported, malicious statement&#8221;. So you are worried that Raymond is making up this story about his niece and that her reputation will be damaged if people thought she liked Benjamin?</p>
<p>Also I believe it counts as proper social conduct to explain something if no one else in the group you are conversing with understands your reference. I asked out of friendly curiosity in an attempt to better understand your positon.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not bullying if you&#8217;re protecting vulnerable groups. Even if those vulnerable groups are purely hypothetical like Mr Anthony Appleyard or the future teenage version of Raymond&#8217;s niece. Rather than being a regular concern troll or bully you&#8217;re fighting for social justice!</p>
