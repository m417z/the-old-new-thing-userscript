		<p>I&#39;m pretty sure that either Disney Land Paris or Disney World Florida have run Space Mountain with the lights on (it&#39;s one or the other as I&#39;ve only been to those two).</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve been through space mountain at Disneyworld with the lights on. &nbsp;I thought it was creepier than with the lights off.</p>
<p>We&#39;d been waiting in line for like 40 minutes when the ride broke down. &nbsp;Cast members went through the line telling everyone, but said, &quot;we don&#39;t know how long it will be down, could be 10 minutes, could be hours. &nbsp;you can stay in line if you want&quot; &nbsp;So my family decided to stay in line for 15 more minutes, and then bail. &nbsp;Almost everyone vacated the line, so we were in the first car 10 minutes later when they&#39;d fixed the ride. They wanted to run it once with the lights on just in case, so we got to see it with the lights on. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>In one way, it wasn&#39;t as scary, because you could see things coming. &nbsp;But in another way, it was as scary, because you could see how close you got to other parts of the track, which you couldn&#39;t see in the dark!</p>
<p>after the ride with the lights on, they turned them off and we got to go 2 more times before they re-opened the ride and let others back on. &nbsp;It was a long wait, but not longer than super busy days, and we got to ride 3 straight times, so that was cool.</p>

		<p>I have no idea what sort of ride that is but presumably you could get a similar effect by closing your eyes tight as soon as you&#39;re &quot;seated&quot; and then opening them when you enter the dark area, no?</p>

		<p>@JustSomeGuy it&#39;s a pretty standard roller coaster, but entirely contained (except for the loading/unlodaing area) within a large dark (nearly black) room (with projections of stars and galaxies on the walls). The loading area is very well-lit, so you&#39;d need to be more aggressive than simply using your eyelids to get sufficient dark-acclimation.</p>
<p>As an extra measure to augment the darkness, the incline up which the car goes before the &quot;real part of the ride&quot; happens is in a brightly-lit tunnel with a light at the end shining straight at the riders. Without taking special measures, it&#39;s very much designed to make sure the riders&#39; night vision is obliterated before they enter the dark room.</p>

		<p>I think it was Disneyland Paris which had Space Mountain with lights on, I don&#39;t know if it was time limited but it was advertised like that. Not just due to maintenance. It wasn&#39;t full lights on, but you could see. They probably got complaints because of the dark.</p>
<p>I never liked space mountain, big thunder mountain and splash mountain is better.</p>
