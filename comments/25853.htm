		<p>Sounds like an interesting ride.</p>
<p>Here, in Ottawa, Ontario, we have a yearly ride called the Rideau Lakes Cycle Tour, From Ottawa, Ontario to Kingston Ontario on a Saturday in June, and back again on Sunday. &nbsp; There are four variations on the ride. &nbsp;The major one, &quot;The Classic&quot; fully supported, covers about 180 km each way, Ottawa-Perth-Kingston and back. &nbsp; A second route which is somewhat flatter is &quot;The Cruise&quot; Ottawa-Merrickville-Kingston, roughly the same distance. &nbsp;A third option has people leaving their luggage at Perth (halfway), and departing from there. &nbsp;A dedicated truck hauls luggage from Perth to Kingston (a Tractor Trailer serves for the people who leave from Carleton University in Ottawa).</p>
<p>The fourth option is &quot;the Challenge&quot;, unsupported, 225 km each way, swinging farther west before arriving at Queens University in Kingston.</p>
<p>The logistics of keeping 2000 riders safely on the road on four different routes has been developed by the Ottawa Bicycle Club since the early 1970&#8217;s</p>

		<p>Raymond, do you have any suggestions on where to look to buy a bike and trails to ride on around Redmond for someone who hasn&#8217;t done a lot of long-distance cycling before? &nbsp;I have been thinking about trying out cycling for a while, and your posts have tipped me over the edge!</p>
<div class=post>[<i>I&#8217;m not the expert here. You might try RiderX. King County and many municipalities produce bicycling maps; you can visit their web sites. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>A very interesting read, looking forward to the next two segments! Always refreshing to read something other than just technical stuff, and luckily I share the interest in biking. Not really many alternatives like this here in Norway, although we have Birkebeinerrittet (check out &quot;Birkebeiner&quot; on wikipedia). We also have the annual Trondheim &#8211; Oslo (somewhere around 600km) each year (nonstop), but this is however intendend for a much more professional audience.</p>
<p>Maybe a trip to the Seattle area would be a good idea for next year.</p>

		<p>Hey, nice writing! It&#8217;s nice to read an account of another person&#8217;s experience with the STP. I can&#8217;t wait to do it next year, too! Thanks for linking me, my traffic exploded. ;-P Have a great day!</p>

		<p>I am an spaniard and when I first read &#8216;Spanway to Toledo&#8217; I inmediately thought in &#8216;Toledo&#8217;, Spain (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&amp;hl=en&amp;geocode=&amp;q=toledo+spain&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;z=11&amp;iwloc=addr&amp;om=1" rel="nofollow">http://maps.google.com/maps?f=q&#038;hl=en&#038;geocode=&#038;q=toledo+spain&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;z=11&#038;iwloc=addr&#038;om=1</a>)</p>
<p>How about a Seattle-Toledo (Spain) tour, Raymond? ;)</p>
