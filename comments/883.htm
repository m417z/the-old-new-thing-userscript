		<p>I wonder what kind of tooltip people want to display for longer.</p>
<p>Advertisement? If you already have access to tooltips, you can just display them more often. That&#39;s probably more efficient.</p>
<p>Lengthy text that people need to copy by hand? (e.g.: A telephone number) &#8211; you would probably make it a link.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t think of a legitimate use case for this.</p>

<p>The balloon tooltip in the notification area are actionable when you click on them (or should be). People see them and when they&#39;re about to click on them they disapear.</p>

		<p>They stop disappearing as soon as you mouse over them though, so if you&#39;re about to click it you&#39;ve also just stopped it disappearing.</p>

		<p>@Chris Crowther</p>
<p>Maybe it&#39;s because the timing is just right to prevent clicking. I know it has happened often to me but I also remember clicking on that Clean Unused Icons balloon on the desktop too.</p>

		<p>Actually I think it&#39;s just the hit zone for the mouse over that isn&#39;t very precise because the balloon has an irregular shape.</p>

		<p>@Sven2, The kind that doesn&#39;t want the ugly style toast notifications to disappear when you are not around to read them. Since both ugly style and balloon style are controlled by the same setting.</p>

		<p>@Chris &#8212; that may technically be true. &nbsp;But I cannot count the number of times I have moved my mouse to interact with a tool tip and the instant the mouse enters the tip it disappears. &nbsp;It really does sometimes feel like it has an WM_MOUSEMOVE that hides the tip as soon as it receives one.</p>

		<p>&quot;A quick Web search suggests that that particular setting has reached cult status, with everybody saying that the setting controls balloon duration, and nobody actually testing it. It&#39;s just a matter of faith.&quot;</p>
<p>There are an awful lot of sample code snippets out there that are republished again and again without ever being tested, especially in VB-land. There is no escaping knowing what you are doing: even a cut and paste coder needs to be able to understand what&#39;s being attempted and be able to debug it.</p>
<p>And, I think the same can be said of traditional backup policies (Full, Incremental, Differential), because so many people have not yet twigged that you cannot possibly bare-metal restore the data in their original state with these methods. Knowing this allows you to tell the difference between someone who has only implemented data backups and someone who has actually tested that their backups can be recovered.</p>

		<p>We have a similar problem with the parameters in an application of ours. Two technicians swore that some parameter was there to control a certain timeout, saying they did tests and everything.</p>
<p>We checked the source, and it turned out that yes, that parameter *was* used &#8211; to initialize a static variable never referenced in any other place. </p>

		<p>@Henke37, On my Windows 8.x, that seems to be true only of balloon notifications. The toast notifications show up and disappear even if the PC is idle/user is away from keyboard. Not sure if its By Design or a bug.</p>

<p>&gt; The timer doesn&#39;t run when the system is idle. They will be there when the user gets back from the coffee break.</p>
<p>My problem with this is that I get back to my computer, move the mouse, and see the balloon fade out immediately. Happens regularly, and the balloon never waits a few seconds in this case.</p>

		<p>@ everyone</p>
<p>Tooltips do not stay when you hover over them or over the item triggering them. Indeed, they go away the moment you leave the item. But they don&#39;t stay as long as you hover over the item. That&#39;s why there is a duration. I think the default is five seconds. </p>
<p>@ Sven2.</p>
<p>First, don&#39;t assume they want to display it *longer*. The misguided tip (change TrayNotify) suggests, these people may actually want to make it display *shorter*. E.g. most of these balloon tips are just plain annoying.</p>
<p>Second, a typical case why people would want to increase duration of balloon tips in their &quot;incarnation&quot; as tooltips is IE. Many links to forum articles (or to news articles) use alt or title attributes to add a short summary or preview when hovering over the link. IE uses the Windows-native tooltip to display these. As it happens, five seconds may not be long enough to read that summary &#8230; and you may find that hovering over it again may not retrigger the tip. You may have to display another tooltip before you can redisplay the one you really want.</p>
