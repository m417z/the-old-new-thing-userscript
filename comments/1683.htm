		<p>A little known feature is that you can press CTRL+C to copy the text of dialog boxes.</p>
<p>Obviously it&#39;s bad form to hijack the clipboard and simulate key presses, so I wonder if there&#39;s a programmatic way to get the text that would be copied&#8230; or if you would just end up with approximately this little program anyway.</p>

		<p>We use the UIAutomation Framework very heavily in our in house wrapper around it. I&#39;m always happy to see Raymond give some input on it (the UIAutomation Library) we have a very similar function internally.</p>
<p>One thing to be on the lookout for is enumerating from the AutomationElement.RootElement and asking for Descendants is usually going to result in you having a bad time if you&#39;ve got a complex tree (it is remarked upon in the MSDN docs). Obviously this is a Toy program/Little Program so no real qualms there, just be on the look out for it.</p>
<p>Only tangentially related does anyone know if these guys have their own blog? I was able to find the MSDN forum and they are pretty responsive there, but it&#39;d be neat to know if they had a blog that showed best practices? We&#39;ve run into issues were we consume 100% CPU in the AutomationElement.FindFirst() call. The core problem I believe is that we rely on heavily on polling and the assumption that FindFirst() is reasonably cheap (bad bad bad assumption). I noticed on Raymond&#39;s last blog post that he was able to register for Window events (which is usually the preferred solution), but have not researched it further.</p>
<p>Long winded post/not the right forum, etc the tl;dr; I like seeing these programs as it exposes me to more real usage of the API, where can I find more?</p>

		<p>@John: there&#39;s <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/winuiautomation/">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/winuiautomation</a> but it&#39;s fairly low-traffic. The last post was in October.</p>

		<p>I imagine that this wouldn&#39;t work on crash dialog message boxes, because those are owned by csrss.exe.</p>

		<p>Message boxes can have more than OK/Cancel &#8211; there are several buttons they can display &#8211; so testing for buttons would need to be a little more sophisticated. And there&#39;s the optional icon.</p>
<p>Still, a little work, and it could be closer to correct :-)</p>

		<p>Just send the window a WM_COPY message. Works in Windows XP at least.</p>

		<p>How does this method compare with SetWinEventHook, as described here:</p>

		<p>@Neil: The clipboard belongs to the user. You have no business destroying it for them. Plus, this constitutes a Global Solution to a Local Problemâ„¢.</p>

		<p>@Michael: SetWinEventHook is part of the Active Accessibility API (MSAA). UI Automation was designed to replace MSAA, ideally fixing many of the shortcomings of the older framework along the way.</p>
<p>Practically speaking, anything that implements MSAA is proxied to UIA. The reverse is also generally true, but only to the extent that the conversion is possible &#8211; UIA has much richer information than MSAA.</p>
