		<p>It&#8217;s really something that at the time, the number of available games was low enough that to a first approximation, you could just test them all out and debug them all.</p>
<p>How much game (or other application) testing is done for new versions of Windows nowadays? Presumably major current titles get tested to some degree, but I imagine it can&#8217;t be anywhere near the percentage of titles that got tested for Windows 95.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not like the old days where patching the actual games was almost impossible, so I suspect the work is mostly left to the game publishers these days&#8230; they&#8217;re the ones with the buggy code, and if they *can* fix it, then Microsoft shouldn&#8217;t be cramming workarounds for buggy apps into Windows&#8230;</p>

		<p>These days aren&#8217;t much different than the old days.  Many games tend to be abandoned fairly quickly after the peak sales period ends.</p>

		<p>At the time, DOS/Windows was in the process of surpassing the Apple II as the platform with more software available. I&#8217;m not sure, but I recall a number in the low hundred of thousands of titles. In any case, it was definitely not possible to test them all.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Raymond has told this story of a program manager from the Windows 95 team who went to a computer store and bought one copy of each title they had. The idea was to make sure the most popular software titles for DOS and Windows 3.x ran without problem in Windows 95, debug the problems and try to make them work, and only discard them if the fix wasn&#8217;t possible or feasible. So I guess they faced this impossible task in a very pragmatic way.</p>

		<p>&gt;It’s really something that at the time, the number of available games was low enough that to a first approximation,<br />
&gt; you could just test them all out and debug them all.</p>
<p>Windows 95 betas were available to MSDN and TechNet subscribers back when it was called Chicago. Microsoft were not the only people testing it. I didn&#8217;t personally run any of the Windows 95 betas as I went from MSDOS to OS/2 Warp but I ran a Windows 98 beta for a short while.</p>
<p>&gt;How much game (or other application) testing is done for new versions of Windows nowadays?</p>
<p>Windows 7, 8 and 10 betas have all been made available to the public in one form or other. I&#8217;m not saying they&#8217;ve outsourced all their testing, but there is no way that they can test more internally than can be tested externally.</p>

		<p>Why couldn&#8217;t Windows 95 &#8220;suck the brains out&#8221; of the MS-DOS XMS driver like it did for the other stuff?</p>

		<p>No clue, but ψ debugging tells me that 31 handles were more than enough for anyone, so it was deemed to be more trouble than it&#8217;s worth, especially given that other applications would likely handle the 0 correctly.</p>

		<p>My psychic debugging skills tells me that at least one other XMS driver exists that Window didn&#8217;t learn about.</p>

		<p>What surprises me is that Windows 95 didn&#8217;t just ship with an XMS driver and demand that only its own be used to start. Oh well.</p>

		<p>Demanding a game uses the Windows 95 XMS driver rather than the one it was actually built to use isn&#8217;t going to be a good way of getting compatibility with existing software. Can you really see the company behind this game bothering to update and release a new version just to get Win95 compatibility when as far as they were concerned a boot-disk was a viable solution.</p>

		<p>He wasn&#8217;t demanding the game used the HIMEM.SYS bundled with Windows 95, rather that Windows 95 should have demanded that it run with the HIMEM.SYS that was bundled and then it could have worked round the issue of avoiding already allocated handles in a different way. So the user could run the game under Windows 95 if they chose to.</p>
<p>It may have been because other memory managers were popular at the time and Microsoft were really struggling with anti-trust lawsuits. Or it might have been because the designers came up with the solution and thought it was good enough and didn&#8217;t expect any problems. Personally I&#8217;d have hoped for more awesomeness, but there are always constraints.</p>

		<p>Was the boot disk the game publisher&#8217;s recommended fix? :D</p>

		<p>Yes, at that time, most game publishers recommended using a boot disk to run their games if you had memory problems. Many people had lots of drivers and TSRs installed in DOS, and didn&#8217;t use MemMaker or QEMM to move them above the 640 KB barrier, so many times they ended with a lot less than 600 KB of free RAM, sometimes near 500 KB. And many games didn&#8217;t run with less than 590 KB of free conventional memory. MemMaker and QEMM were relatively difficult to install or tune up (specially when you had an incompatible driver or TSR), but creating a boot disk with the SYS command was easy and fool-proof.</p>

		<p>It seems like this means that the game would have failed under MSDOS if any driver had allocated an XMS handle before the game was started, too.</p>

		<p>I bet the actual number of handles to set was 40.</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve never even heard of that game.  No wonder, with that kind of programming talent.</p>
<p>I looked at the I-Q list and found that Lemmings wouldn&#8217;t run under Windows 95.  I remember that I got it to work in OS/2.  Har har.</p>

		<p>I assume 40 is &#8220;the 32 it needs, plus the one that is already assigned, plus a safety margin in case some others were allocated before Windows started&#8221;. But a higher number would also work, of course.</p>

		<p>Thanks for that nostalgic link to the games list. I&#8217;ve never seen it before! I like how one of my favourite games of all time (R-Z list) doesn&#8217;t even bother with an explanation of why it doesn&#8217;t run in Windows 95. It just says &#8220;The  requires MS-DOS mode.&#8221;. Damn that guardian.</p>
