		<p>Hey Dave why on earth despise? MSFT should be grateful to have people like Raymond. If you haven&#8217;t notice, he&#8217;s the guy who rewrote the whole Dr. Watson even against his manager&#8217;s wishes &#8212; it really sounds like some Dilbert story (maybe I invent a little):</p>
<p>&quot;It&#8217;s impossible or it would take too much time from the whole teams&quot;, says manager; &quot;Actually I&#8217;ve already done it&quot; says Raymond and even gets punished.<br /></p>

		<p>Depends on your program, Dave.  Perhaps if Raymond had tested HAL, the whole 2001 thing wouldn&#8217;t have happened.</p>
<p>Ok, I&#8217;ve been reading too much Usenet&#8230;</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a big difference between &quot;many&quot; and &quot;every&quot;.  Sometimes the difference is huge.  I think it shouldn&#8217;t be necessary to repeat one that you didn&#8217;t sample, but seeing the word &quot;every&quot; there&#8230;  Windows 95 even has a built-in driver for the Adaptec 1460 card, so you don&#8217;t even have to test whether FDISK was equally broken when used with other manufacturers&#8217; cards too (which it is).  I know FDISK isn&#8217;t your department, but I also know you didn&#8217;t dogfood with it for things that were supposed to be your backups.</p>

		<p>Raymond, I wish they had someone like you working for the company that produces the (RT)OS we&#8217;re using. As it is today, too many bugs seep out of their drivers and sometimes the core&#8230;</p>

		<p>Well, It would appear all of Microsoft run the default theme with the taskbar in the default position.</p>
<p>Place it on the right of the screen, and the Start button isn&#8217;t in the corner (which is left unused, and is the space of the screen which is most easy to access).</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s paced on the bottom, and you make it more than one line tall, the start button will move up, generating the same problem, and leaving the corner empty.</p>
<p>While we are at it, the &#8216;fabulous&#8217; Luna theme will make the rightmost pixel on scroll bars on maximized windows unusable, so you actually have to aim horizontally.</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m sure NEARLY EVERY Windows XP user has hit this: thanks to the rounded corners and lack or borders around the title bar, you migh have a maximized window, and another one on top which isn&#8217;t maximized, but whose coordinates are (0, 0, maxx, maxy). So of you click the top-right corner pixel, and you&#8217;ll go through the hole that the rounded corner leaves, and close the maximized window that was behind.</p>
<p>This is all very obvious stuff, and makes one wonder why it got out. Putting a random idiot to use an OS and designing the interface around it is generally a very bad idea: you annoy people who actually have a clue, and the idiot will countinue to be one, so you can&#8217;t change anything afterwards because he&#8217;ll get lost again, having learned nothing.</p>
<p>Bah :)</p>

		<p>In defense of Raymond: He said every barnd of dogfood in the STORE.  I&#8217;m sure his metaphorical store does not have every brand ever made, but at HIS store he sampled what he could come up with.</p>
<p>And that, best I can tell, is the point.</p>

<br />&gt; here without somebody nitpicking it to death?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to answer.  Your posting looked like a serious and respectable effort to teach something to both your employer and readers&#8217; employers (maybe reminding your employer about something they&#8217;re starting to remember too).  Sure the word &quot;dogfood&quot; is colloquial but the usage and the topic are deathly serious.</p>
<p>If I could see what was intended to be humorous about the posting then I should withdraw the repetition of one of my most serious complaints.  But I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t quite see it.  The topic is serious, the posting is serious and respectable, the complaint fits it, there&#8217;s not even any parody involved&#8230;</p>

<br />&gt; Well, It would appear all of Microsoft run<br />
<br />&gt; the default theme with the taskbar in the<br />
<br />&gt; default position.</p>
<p>Only some parts of Microsoft.  Some parts of Microsoft do experiment with moving the taskbar but it looks like they don&#8217;t give feedback to the parts that forget to experiment.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m not sure whether to call those parts departments or teams or sections or whatever.  It is not intended to say that employees are parts.)</p>

		<p>Okay, fine. Perhaps I should have titled the article &quot;Attempting to sample as many flavors of dogfood that exist in the store, within the limits of practicality and with the understanding that I could not devote my entire day to the practice but rather took up the effort each time the opportunity naturally arose.&quot; But that would have been a rather cumbersome title and lose quite a bit of its snap. Writing with such pedantic precision is not fun, and if you insist that I write in such a manner, I&#8217;ll just stop.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  So of you click the top-right corner pixel,<br />
  <br />&gt; and you&#8217;ll go through the hole that the<br />
  <br />&gt; rounded corner leaves, and close the<br />
  <br />&gt; maximized window that was behind.</p>
<p>I do that so often, that I wrote an app that positions a transparent 3&#215;3 always-on-top window in the top right corner to save me from accidentally closing windows that way.
