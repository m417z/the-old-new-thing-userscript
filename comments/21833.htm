		<p>Nitpickers corner warning.</p>
<p>1)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m going to take extreme umbridge at a cycle ride up a hillside in Redmond being compared to what is pressumably the Cotsolds. &nbsp;Technically they are hills, and labelled as such on maps, &nbsp;but as anyone who has seen, walked or cycled the cotswolds will tell you they are distinctly more hilly then any hill in the Bellevue/Redmond area. &nbsp;Tush.</p>
<p>2) Reading to Wales 90mins. &nbsp;It really does depend on so many things because of the high density of traffic, &nbsp;the numberous alternative road routes and where-abouts in Wales you want to go. &nbsp;Reading-Wales on the M4 on a bank-holiday weekend in 90mins. &nbsp;I seriously doubt it. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve done that run at approximately that time when leaving in the evening at 11pm, &nbsp;virutally no traffic and the possibility of travelling at the speed limit (not recommended).</p>
<p>Now the bag-lady story, &nbsp;that is a hoot!</p>

		<p>Here&#8217;s a wikipedia link to the mountains nearest the M4. Note the glaciation on the northern corries. There is a track through the centre of the range that the romans built as part of their attempts &quot;to suppress the insurgency&quot;. 2000 years on it still hasn&#8217;t been tarmaced over and is an excellent MTB ride. If you head out from Reading onto &quot;The Ridgeway&quot; you have a pre-roman dirt track to take you all the way to wales. Now, where in the PNW do you have anything historic to compare with that?</p>

		<p>&quot;From Reading, you can get to the Welsh border in 90 minutes.&quot;</p>
<p>This is really bad information. The reason it is bad is because to start from Reading you have to *be* in Reading.</p>

		<p>This mountain/hill thing reminds me of the delicious film &quot;The Englishman who went up a hill but came down a mountain&quot;. Little known, but a small gem if you like period films or the really fine (and a bit ironic) English humor. And, of course, as its title implies, it treats about hills, mountains and their differences. In Wales.</p>

<p>Reading&#8217;s not so bad, if the only reason you&#8217;re there is in order to leave&#8230;</p>

		<p>That stuff about the memories is an interesting take on how the brain works.</p>
<p>The thing here, is that just because we live in a quaint little country, does not mean we don&#8217;t do satellite navigation. I mean you can get TomTom (to) Go with your groceries in Sainsburys.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s Kroger to you!</p>

<p>From the stories that make the news you certainly do have problems doing satnav if you drive through a ford without a snorkel, drive past the &quot;bridge out&quot; signs and off a bridge that&#8217;s out, take a bus under a bridge that&#8217;s marked to be lower than the top of your bus, or pick the treacherous low-speed goat path over a paved road. Just saying, since you brought it up.</p>

<p>Ohhh, just about any place you are standing. &nbsp;Dig into just about any hill, or pick through silt at any river, and you&#8217;l turn up Clovis points that are 10,000 to 15,000 years old.</p>
<p>But Steve, what does that have to do with anything? &nbsp;Or did you just need to let us know that the UK has an awful lot of history?</p>

		<p>I love that part of the country, but it certainly isn&#8217;t mountains. Talking of the Ridgeway reminds me of the deeply atmospheric (500 year old) Wayland&#8217;s Smithy, just by White Horse Hill. A place that lingers in the back of the mind forever.</p>
<p>btw, I&#8217;d have thought that the Severn bridge would be a fairly indicator that you were crossing into Wales?</p>

<p>Chaz, The Severn Bridge is entirely in England. The nearby Wye Bridge crosses the border, which goes up the river Wye at that point.</p>
<p>But these days you&#8217;ll only cross either of these if you turn off onto the M48. The M4 goes across the Second Severn Crossing, and this does indeed go across the border, as it&#8217;s further south than the point where the Wye flows into the Severn.</p>
<p>&lt;/pedant&gt;</p>
