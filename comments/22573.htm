		<p>What&#8217;s funny is the cognitive dissonance expressed by parents in the articles. There&#8217;s the ostrich head-in-the-sand response flatly denying the obvious quid pro quo, or the &quot;f everyone else, so long as my kid gets ahead&quot; response.. Wow. Just Wow.</p>

		<p>In other news, researchers discover that large political donors are more likely to benefit from later legislative or executive decisions than other people.</p>

		<p>Or IC&#8217;s who suck up to their managers&#8217; pet interests get better review feedback. &nbsp;I&#8217;m just speculating.</p>

		<p>I didn&#8217;t see any evidence of this at Caltech. &nbsp;The students all seemed legit. &nbsp;Everyone I knew there was a first generation Caltech student.</p>
<p>Signs of wealth were extremely rare. &nbsp;No links to celebrity of the usual sort, though I am aware of a very few students over the years whose parents are famous mathematicians or scientists. &nbsp;They seemed to have academic merit of their own.</p>
<p>Of course, physics boot camp has little or no social prestige. &nbsp;There might not be many wealthy people who dream of sending the kids there. &nbsp;Little Chadwick and Tiffany probably aren&#8217;t red hot on the idea either.</p>
<p>Quantum Hoops provides some clues about the situation. &nbsp;The poor basketball coach has been trying for years to find a basketball player he can get past the admissions committee. &nbsp;Any basketball player. &nbsp;Maybe someday.</p>

<p>My first thought on reading this is: In other words, &quot;You&#8217;re wrong, Y can do X.&quot;</p>

		<p>I was a contract developer on the admissions project at as ivy league university. &nbsp;In the admission database there&#8217;s a boolean called VIP, but no descriptor so they can &quot;cover their ass&quot; and not claim special treatment.</p>
<p>In a nutshell I&#8217;d say the sort order for top candidates are: VIP, race (according to affirmative action requirements) and then grades.</p>
<p>Nobody wants to admit to this stuff, but I&#8217;m guessing what toggles VIP is:</p>
<ol>
<li>parents donate lots of money</li>
<li>
<p>related to a college employee</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>sports scholarship</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I suspect most colleges work this way, but they will deny it to the bitter end.</p>

<p>This is the standard response for talking about your kids. As long as he&#8217;s not a complete screwup, you sort of expect that.</p>

<p>Now that&#8217;s irony &#8211; AA institutionalizes racism.</p>
