		<p>I have no idea if this was in a previous TweakUI release for Windows XP or not, but thank you for including the option for using the old version of search.  This way I can search for text in files without having to register each and every file type with a wacky search filter, just to do in Windows what Visual Studio does out of the box.</p>

		<p>Just a note for the &quot;Open Command Window Here&quot; program from the same &quot;Microsoft PowerToys for Windows XP&quot; page that TweakUI is located.  It seems to complain about directories with &#8216;&amp;&#8217; in them.  Although it gets to the proper directory, it appears to attempt to run a program by the name of whatever comes after &#8216;&amp;&#8217; in the directory name.  By chance, this could run some undesired program.  Be careful when using it.</p>

		<p>The X-Mouse behaviour in Tweak UI seems a little strange.  When dragging an icon onto a pile of windows, it seems like the left-most window will pop to the front (though autoraise is disabled).  Is this a bug or a feature?  And is it fixable from within Tweak UI?</p>

		<p>Raymond, somebody, anybody please tell me the ONLY way to install TweakUI 2.10 is not by manually running the .exe in an attended mode.  Command-line switches, extracting the actual executables, or even (gasp) packaging (and distributing it!) the thing in an .msi ALL would have been perfectly fine.  What do people have against .msi&#8217;s anyway?  I love the fact that it wrests the control from the setup author and gives it back to the administrator of the machine.</p>

		<p>You have lawyers to thank for that. The rules I was given was that there shall be no way of installing the program that bypasses the acceptance of the EULA.</p>

		<p>I guess we do as the lawyers say then.  Let me guess &#8211; they&#8217;re also the ones behind the travesty that resulted in KB article 281934.  But I digress.  My shot in the dark for today concerns the default folder view in Windows Explorer.  I want a way to change it without resorting to the UI.  I find the default Large Icon view (or worse, XP&#8217;s Tile view) very counter-productive and always switch to List view and Arrange by Type as soon as I install an OS.  I don&#8217;t know if a simple .reg file will do it as NO amount of registry tweaking will do what the magic Like Current Folder/Apply to All Folders button does.  It would be nice though.</p>

		<p>&quot;PowerToys will only work with US-English regional settings.&quot;</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t that embarrass you?</p>
<p>At least the previous version worked with any regional settings.  It only communicated in English but it communicated, and it acted even though the regional settings matched the OS&#8217;s language and matched the region where the OS was purchased.</p>
<p>This is not exactly trivial either.  PowerToys are necessary in order to correct at least one incredibly dumb thing in Windows XP.  When an external hard disk is connected via USB or SCSI (via a PCMCIA or Cardbus SCSI adapter) or surely other dynamic means, Windows XP scans the entire hard drive looking for files that it can autoplay.  The user can click Cancel, the user can select an option &quot;Do nothing&quot;, etc., but this does nothing to stop Windows XP repeating the same thing every time.  On very rare occasions the dialog where the user can select &quot;Do nothing&quot; also includes a checkbox with a false assertion that Windows XP will remember the selection, but even on these rare occasions, setting that checkbox also makes no difference.  Usually the checkbox isn&#8217;t displayed.  Windows XP always, always repeats the same nonsense every time an external hard disk is connected.</p>
<p>PowerToys can stop it.  Or at least the previous version of PowerToys could stop it, because it operated even when the regional settings weren&#8217;t US-English.</p>
<p>By the way, the on-line help for Windows XP says that autoplay can be turned on or off for optical drives but is always off for other kinds of drives.  That is half-true.  Autoplay can be turned on or off for optical drives.  But for hard drives autoplay is always on until PowerToys stops it.  (By the way, did you ever wonder why customers don&#8217;t take Windows on-line help very seriously?)</p>

		<p>The PowerToys are written by developers in their spare time for fun.  This means that a lot of laziness creeps in, like hard-coding English strings instead of using resources. (Tweak UI uses localizable resources though so shouldn&#8217;t have this problem.)</p>
<p>So go ahead and run Tweak UI on any language system you want. Note though that I had access only to English systems, so I don&#8217;t know if there might be some subtle difference between English and say Japanese that I didn&#8217;t account for.</p>
<p>I cannot speak for the other PowerToys, since I did not write them.</p>

		<p>&quot;So go ahead and run Tweak UI on any language system you want.&quot;</p>
<p>OK, thank you.  Obviously the use of a different language from the user&#8217;s language is a far lesser problem than the expected result of &quot;PowerToys will only work with US-English regional settings.&quot;  There are programs that overwrite DLLs with wrong language versions and cause problems for the entire Windows system.  There are programs that hunt down and destroy the registries of other Windows systems that are installed on other partitions which shouldn&#8217;t even get touched by the current installation.[*]  So you see why I was really worried about the likely results of installing these PowerToys.</p>
<p>But at least it is far better to provide a warning than to not provide a warning.  In the past, users learned about this kind of destruction after it happened.[*]</p>
<p>[* I know you don&#8217;t like to name names, but two really have to be named.  The Windows 98 installer and the Windows 2000 installer hunt down and destroy other Windows 98 installations on other partitions which shouldn&#8217;t even get touched.  But there are programs from other vendors that also cause varying degrees of destruction.]</p>
