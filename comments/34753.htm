		<p>Grab yourself some OKO. It&#8217;s a white substance that goes in the tires. It&#8217;s fairly light weight compared to others out there and it doesn&#8217;t get hard after a while. When you get a puncture it sloshes over the hole and fixes it. Worst case you lose a little air, but you keep on rolling</p>

		<p>Ha! A little while ago I wrote about swimming protocols. In a post about the Microsoft company picnic, Raymond Chen makes this little note about his experience with biking protocols:When I started out bicycling, I had a jersey but just wore plain short &#8230;</p>

		<p>Try solid tires: they are &quot;almost as good&quot; in the biking department and are thousands of times better in the &quot;never ever get a flat&quot; department.  I got mine from <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.greentyre.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.greentyre.com</a> and put them on myself with no trouble (and I&#8217;ve got the minimal upper body strenth of a standard programmer).</p>
<p>My story: I commute most days across Redmond through the same Marymoor park mentioned by Raymond &#8212; BTW, Microsoft, thanks for putting in a free wireless hot spot; I&#8217;ve never used it but it&#8217;s just a nice thing to have done.  After the first couple of flats I knew that flats were just a PITA: you want to go and ride, but there&#8217;s a flat, so you&#8217;re delayed.  PITA, PITA, PITA.  Worse are slow leaks: never fast enough to make it worthwhile to fix, but fast enough that you have to be pumping up your tires instead of riding.</p>
<p>Then I got tires from GreenTyre.  Put one on the back tire (which had a leak) and threatened the front tire with instant replacement if it ever got a leak.  The threat even worked for about a year :-)</p>
<p>They aren&#8217;t quite the &quot;same&quot; a regular tires &#8212; but then, I&#8217;ve also done a switch from off-road tires to road tires, and that switch was much bigger than the road-tires to solid-tires.</p>

		<p>For a moment there I thought you referred to &quot;Fat City Cycles&quot; (aka &quot;Fat Chance&quot;) when you said you were once a &quot;Fat Cyclist&quot;. :/</p>
<p>I dunno if it is good for Presta valves, but as you&#8217;re probably aware of there are some neat CO2-based pumping solutions. It sure beats a micropump! :) (although it won&#8217;t inflate more than 30 psi, but it gets me home)</p>

		<p>Thanks for the kind wishes, Raymond. If you&#8217;re ever in the mood for a ride, just let me know &#8212; I&#8217;ll do what I can to keep up.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve got lots of good suggestions for fixing flats. Here&#8217;s one for avoiding them altogether: Specialized Armadillo tires. I ride through glass, rocks, and all kinds of other crud with them and have never flatted once since I started riding with them about 1.5 years ago. They&#8217;re heavy and they don&#8217;t have good road feel, but they do seem to be bulletproof.</p>

		<p>I can sympathize with you Raymond, as I&#8217;ve had mountain bike rides on which I&#8217;ve collected 4+ flats (not to mention taco&#8217;d wheels and a broken frame:).  However, on my road bike I think I have had at most 4 flats that involved on-the-road patching.  I would recommend that you &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; use any of the self-sealing solutions or move to the Armadillo tires (yet).  Why?  Because one of the great joys of riding on the road is the quick acceleration and handling that a lightweight road bike affords and adding several ounces at the tire will make your bike feel more sluggish.  The best defense against flats is to actively scan the road ahead of you.</p>
<p>Just my $.02.</p>

		<p>&quot;The route was approximately 25 <em>miles</em> from Marymoor Park [&#8230;] What happened is that the patch didn&#8217;t hold and we pulled over in Fall City just a few hundred <em>meters</em> later.&quot;</p>
<p>So what will it be? Imperial or metric? ;-)</p>

		<p>For some reason my brain uses metric for short distances and imperial for long distances.</p>

		<p>I do quite a lot of road riding, on high-PSI tires.  The vast majority of flats that I get are from valve stem damage, especially from using pumps that do not have a flexible hose to the pump head.  Since my tires are fairly high PSI, they always leak at a very slow rate, so I have to add air frequently.  If I&#8217;m careful with the pumping, and don&#8217;t use somebody&#8217;s little emergency hand-pump without a flexible hose, then I have one, maybe two flats in a riding season.</p>
<p>The other main cause is simply pinch flats, from installing a new tube incorrectly &#8212; but the frequency of that has declined with time, and my increased ability not to screw things up.<br /></p>

		<p>Tire slime is good. Hard tires, never used them, sounds really odd for a road bike. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve used slime for several years on my mountain bike with success. Previously I used some thick plastic shield that didn&#8217;t work well. It lead to pinch flats and didnt stop the puncture vines either.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got a slime tube as a spare in my road bike pack, but thankfully haven&#8217;t had to use it yet.</p>
<p>I wish I could ride to work, but it&#8217;s not practical given the bridges and the distance. Even a combination of public transit and biking is damn near impossible.</p>

		<p>Flats always seem to come in groups.  I usually carry three spare tubes, of which at least are Brand New. (no &quot;damn, the patch didn&#8217;t hold scenarios).  Ride on patched tubes, but do it from home.</p>
<p>I ride on wired-on clinchers, but have a folding spare tire attached behind the seat, for emergencies. . .  mine or other people&#8217;s.</p>
<p>I use a full-length Zefal HP frame-fit pump. Mini pumps aren&#8217;t worth the powder to blow them to hell.   The Zefal can crank the tire up to 140 psi.</p>
<p>Valve stem failure is usually the result of the hole in the rim for the stem being oversize.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t get a lot of thorns around here in Eastern Ontario, but keeping the tires inflated above 100 psi helps prevent &quot;snake-bite&quot; punctures.</p>
<p>And, oh, yes, the shorts. . .</p>
<p>Your contact points are your feet, your hands, and your butt.  Therefore, good shoes, good shorts and good gloves are highly recommended.</p>
