		<p>Very interesting. &nbsp;Makes me want to go research the topic further&#8230; (family naming in different cultures).</p>
<p>So, would a geneology company be a cousin removal service?</p>

		<p>For the coding-minded among us, it might help to put the cousins and removal thing in terms of math:</p>
<ul>
<li>For two related people, A and B, find the closest common ancestor C.</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the number of ancestors between A and C; call that a. &nbsp;(Defined such that the number of ancestors between a father and son is zero. &nbsp;That is, it&#8217;s non-inclusive of the endpoints.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine the number of ancestors between B and C; call that b.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If min(a,b) &lt;= 0, abort. &nbsp;English has another term for this relationship, and it&#8217;s non-reflexive and sex-dependent.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If a == b, A and B are (min(a,b)) cousins.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Otherwise, A and B are &nbsp;(min(a,b)) cousins (abs(a-b)) removed. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This is complicated somewhat by the fact that many people believe &#8211; erroneously &#8211; that their parents&#8217; cousins are their second cousins.</p>

		<p>If my cousins are just cousins, and my mother&#8217;s cousins are once removed from me, what is the relationship between myself and the children of my mother&#8217;s cousins? &nbsp;That&#8217;s one generation &quot;up,&quot; then &quot;over,&quot; then a generation back &quot;down.&quot; &nbsp;Does that make them twice removed, or should I just stick with &quot;distant?&quot; &nbsp;Or is there no formally-named relationship to that at all?</p>

		<p>In almost all Indian languages we have very granular deified relationships.</p>
<p>We have a different name for brothers of your mother and father, their wives, their sisters and their kids. Though the exact name is different across languages once you know the name of the relationship in one you can easily figure it in other language.</p>
<p>And as with Chinese calling any one older than you by name is mostly considered disrespectful. And most languages solves that by using plural to refer to single person (kind of saying &nbsp;“they will join us”, while actually meaning “he will join us”)</p>

		<p>@mvadu &#8211; At one point English had the practice of using the second person plural pronoun (you) instead of the second person singular pronoun (thou) as a sign of deference. &nbsp;This became so widespread that we dropped the singular completely from everyday usage. &nbsp;The only common usage of it now is in books written in older english (like the Bible or Shakespeare), where the familiar singular pronoun was used in reference to God in the Bible, or as an insult in Shakespeare. &nbsp;Oddly enough, because of that use in the Bible, many people have come to think of &quot;thou&quot; as a pronoun of veneration, giving it the opposite meaning of what it originally had.</p>

		<p>I never considered addressing my parents by name as disrespectful.</p>
<p>It did, however, feel akward for some reason.</p>
<p>Perhaps it is moving from social faux-pas to just simple convention as time goes by.</p>
<p>More interesting is whether you address a person as Mr/Mrs/Ms lastname, or by the first name, or even just by their last name with no honorific.</p>
<p>Interestingly, it currently seems that last name with no honorific is reseverd for more intimate contacts than first name and even strangers can address you by your first name solely now.</p>
<p>In fact, Mr lastname almost automatically denotes that you are in trouble of some sort.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know any Chinese, but I&#8217;m still curious as to why 大姑丈 means uncle. &nbsp;Flickr has made it very clear that there&#8217;s no mistake here. &nbsp;(Sorry for doubting you Raymond!) &nbsp;Seems uncle is 大姑丈 and aunt is 大姑姑.</p>
<p>But, Microsoft Translator translates 姑丈 as aunt, 姑 means mother-in-law in Japanese, and I kinda figured that since 姑 contained 女 it should be feminine. &nbsp;Is its use here purely phonetic or something?</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>The relationship is symmetric. &nbsp;If I am the great-grandchild of your uncle, then you are the child of my great-granduncle.</p>
<p>In &quot;nth cousin m times removed&quot;, the &quot;m&quot; loses information via the symmetric tensor, but the &quot;n&quot; really is symmetric and no information is lost.</p>

		<p>The graphic that explained it best to me is the one at wikipedia: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CousinTree.svg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:CousinTree.svg</a></p>
<p>@Brian that makes your example cousins your second cousins (you go up *two* generations from your parents to find common ancestors, but you are on the *same* generational level of the family tree, so you are not &#8216;removed&#8217;).</p>

		<p>Fran Drescher (as Fran Fine): &quot;&#8230;and believe me, she was removed for a reason!&quot;</p>
<p>@Xepol:</p>
<p>I agree. Although I haven&#8217;t addressed my parents by name, I have referred to them in that way when talking to other people.</p>
<p>Regarding addressing people as Mr &lt;Surname&gt;, one thing that&#8217;s bugged me has been when telephone callers used such a reference and I had to ask &quot;Which one?&quot; And in some cases (I think it happened with telemarketers), they refused to provide the first name! I suppose that in that case, they may have been confused or caught off guard, which was mildly satisfying, but still very annoying.</p>

		<p>姑 in Chinese means sister of ones father (which is aunt)</p>
<p>大 means first, or great, just to denote the first son/daughter of the family</p>
<p>丈 is husband of someone.</p>
<p>so, 姑 and 丈 combined means husband of ones father&#8217;s sister. add a 大 in front gives you the rank of the aunt in the family.</p>

		<p>@tgrand</p>
<p>Uncle is 姑丈 and Aunt is 姑姑. Raymond&#8217;s wife&#8217;s nieces(his wife&#8217;s brother&#8217;s children) would call him 姑丈. They would have add a &quot;Great&quot; to 姑丈(aka 大姑丈) if his wife is the oldest sibling in her family. 姑丈 would mean Aunt&#8217;s hushand, that&#8217;s why is started with a word with 女（woman). If his nieces are his wife&#8217;s sister&#8217;s children, then they have to call him 大姨丈.</p>
<p>This is the reason I don&#8217;t like Chinese new year and Chinese gatherings: I always have a hard time to figure out how to address my elders on the spot, especially if the relationship is very complex.</p>
<p>Chinese and Japanese words cannot be used interchangeably, even though they are the same word or derived from the same word. For example, 大丈夫 in Chinese means &quot;great man&quot; but 大丈夫 in Japanese means &quot;no problem&quot;.</p>
<p>This Chinese phrase would make no sense in Japanese: 男子汉，大丈夫有所为，有所不为. It means there are some things real men should do and there are some things real men should never do.</p>

		<p>Danish distinguises between paternal and maternal uncles, if they&#8217;re blood relatives.</p>
<p>If maternal, it&#8217;s &quot;morbror&quot;, meaning &quot;mother&#8217;s brother&quot;, if paternal, it&#8217;s &quot;farbror&quot; &#8211; You can probably guess what it means. If it&#8217;s by marriage, it&#8217;s just &quot;onkel&quot;, which, as you&#8217;ve probably guessed, translates to &quot;uncle&quot;.</p>
<p>There are others like this, like we differentiate cousins based on gender, &quot;kusine&quot; being female and &quot;f&#230;tter&quot; being male.</p>
<p>You should really study Danish, Raymond, as a complimentary language to Swedish &#8211; They&#8217;re not *too* different. :)</p>

		<p>In South African Afrikaans culture, &quot;oom&quot; and &quot;tannie&quot; (uncle and auntie) are terms of respect towards an older person, not just a family thing. This has spilled over into the English speaking population too. A younger person meeting an older one, even a stranger, would typically address them as uncle or auntie rather than sir or madam. This extends to the third person where a parent might say to their child &quot;Don&#8217;t bother the uncle/auntie&quot; rather than &quot;Don&#8217;t bother the gentleman/lady.&quot;</p>
<p>Being a first-generation British immigrant I tend to prefer &quot;sir&quot; and &quot;madam&quot; and get mildly annoyed when I&#8217;m addressed as &quot;oom&quot; or &quot;uncle&quot;. As I recall I was only about fifteen years old the first time some strange kid called me &quot;oom&quot;.</p>

		<p>The English form of cousin always seemed limiting in expression. The &quot;removed&quot; thing doesn&#8217;t tell direction (up or down the family tree), does it?</p>
<p>Nearly all Sanskrit derived languages have distinct words for &quot;maternal uncle&quot;, &quot;maternal aunt&quot;, &quot;paternal uncle&quot; and &quot;paternal aunt&quot;</p>
<p>The word &quot;cousin&quot; has been adapted to mean ONLY for the &quot;person at same hierarchical level&quot; &#8230; so a cousin can only be a &quot;cousin sister&quot; or &quot;cousin brother&quot; :) :)</p>
<p>Anyone one level below is a nephew/niece, anyone above an uncle/aunt, no matter how far away that person is, in the family tree.</p>
<p>Just to elaborate &#8230;</p>
<p>My father&#8217;s brother&#8217;s son is my cousin.</p>
<p>My father&#8217;s brother&#8217;s son&#8217;s son is my nephew</p>
<p>@mvadu and @Josh</p>
<p>The pronoun to address &quot;You (respected form)&quot; and &quot;you (same aged person)&quot; is present in all Sanskrit derived languages.</p>
<p>e.g. Any German would know these as &quot;Sie&quot; and &quot;du&quot;.</p>

<p>&quot;Chinese and Japanese words cannot be used interchangeably, even though they are the same word or derived from the same word. For example, 大丈夫 in Chinese means &#8216;great man&#8217; but 大丈夫 in Japanese means &#8216;no problem&#8217;.&quot;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re half Chinese, half Japanese, you could say 大丈夫 大丈夫, meaning &quot;Great, man, no problem!&quot; ;)</p>

		<p>This is pretty cool &#8211; do the more complicated relations end up looking like path expressions?</p>

<p>I thought that Sanskrit was mostly a dead end and that most indian languages were dravidian &#8211; there&#8217;s a fair amount of info on wikipedia, but it conflicts in part with some of what I know regarding language evolution around india.</p>

<p>I dunno &#8211; english is a mushy mongrel. It&#8217;s easy to be understood since almost anything goes, but there are a lot of habits (not rules) you have to learn in order to get really good at it. Also, you can usually tell someone&#8217;s native tongue (or narrow it down) by observing which mistakes they make.</p>

		<p>me.Mother.Father.Brother.Daughter</p>
<p>me.Father.Sister.Son.Son</p>
<p>So these two persons would be calls cousins once removed in English? I learned to call them &quot;primo segundo&quot;, literally &quot;second cousin&quot; in (Puerto Rican) Spanish.</p>
<p>So what you call Nth removed is for me (N+1)th cousin, which then means something different to you? Confusing&#8230;</p>
<p>And @Cooney, I think that can be said of any language by their native speakers.</p>

		<p>While you&#8217;re at it, fix the whole grandmother/grandfather issue in English.</p>
<p>Seriously talking about your third cousin twice removed isn&#8217;t nearly as common as wanting to specify whether you talk about your maternal or paternal grandparents. For once Swedish has the ideal solution that English should adopt:</p>
<p>&quot;Farfar&quot; means father&#8217;s father (&quot;far&quot; is the word for father), &quot;Farmor&quot; father&#8217;s mother (&quot;mor&quot; is the word for mother), &quot;Mormor&quot; &#8211; mother&#8217;s mother and &quot;Morfar&quot; mother&#8217;s father. The nice thing is that (although not commonly used) these could in fact be stringed together for longer hierarchies: &quot;Farmorfar&quot; and so on.</p>
<p>This bug needs to be fixed ASAP.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Don&#8217;t forget the third pronoun to refer to a younger person or one of a lower status. For example, in Hindi, one would refer to an elder or one of a higher status with the pronoun &quot;aap&quot;, a person of the same age/status with &quot;tum&quot;, and a person of lesser age/status with &quot;tu&quot; (though &quot;tu&quot; can also be used in informal situations to refer to one&#8217;s close friends, irrespective of age/status).</p>

		<p>If it&#8217;s just plain Chinese, the list of &quot;Family-title&quot; in the link is sufficient.</p>
<p>If your family happens to use certain other dialects, the list of family goes twice to 3-times longer&#8230; (I have some relatives that I can only speck how to address them, but never know the words to write them out&#8230;)</p>
<p>Also note that because of one-child policy, for most families the hierarchy would be much much simpler.</p>

		<p>Using Google Translate (or Microsoft Translate) is the wrong tactic for Chinese. Using a Chinese-speaking person is good, but the explanations may be incomplete.</p>
<p>MDBG.net gives the following translation: eldest husband of paternal aunt.</p>

<p>If you explore that set of pages a bit, there&#8217;s talk about how different cultures title things.</p>

<p>This is the part that doesn&#8217;t jive. From reading some stuff on linguistics, it appears that the influence flowed the other way, and that the image of sanskrit as some holy tongue (well, it is) with dravidian being a common or degraded form of it was promulgated by a bunch of priests who happened to be the first guys that european anthropologists talked to back in the 19th ct.</p>
<p>Further, from looking at available information on the region, I would say that unbiased info is hard to come by and frequently unavailable; the best methods seem to be to regard all biased sources as liars until supported through what is basically linguistic archaeology.</p>
<p>It reminds me of trying to map out the history of japanese martial arts styles &#8211; you end up with a big hairball full of people claiming to be the one true master of some obscure style.</p>

		<p>I have yet to read this, but I SHALL! It is a question that has nagged at the depths of my mind for a long time &#8211; and it kind of fits into the conundrums I have when trying to understand relationships when talking with friends from other countries and cultures.</p>
<p>Thanks! (I think)</p>
