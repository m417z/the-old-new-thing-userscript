		<p>Heisenbug!</p>
<p>Seriously, when using async IO, read the documentation thoroughly. There may be edge cases you need to handle or things blow up in your face.</p>

		<p>Along a similar vein, could you also have an asynchronous read that completes instantly due to the data already being in the cache? &nbsp;Is there a way to determine how big the cache is?</p>

		<p>@Joshua</p>
<p>I think documentation on async IO (completion port) could have been much better. </p>
<p>For example, it may clearly state, that IO can be completed synchronously *and* that event/completion port will be signaled. I am not sure, that the case of synchronous completion *and* signaling is clearly stated anywhere at all.</p>
<p>List of function, that supports completion port (see GetQueuedCompletionStatus) is incomplete, but it is not mentioned, that is incomplete. Also I read somewhere (now can&#39;t remember where) that some async requests may return FALSE with GetLastError() == 0 (no error). All of the above is pretty important and could have been mentioned in once place somewhere (like in this article <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa365198(VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/aa365198(VS.85).aspx</a>)</p>

		<p>That was always one aspect of async I/O I was never quite sure I got right&#8230; good to know there&#39;s nothing special I need to do if the operation returns TRUE instead of an error and ERROR_IO_PENDING.</p>

		<p>Yeah, that helped too &#8211; even though Windows CE doesn&#39;t support async I/O, it does for sockets. All the code I saw (almost no one uses async I/O as it&#39;s probably flaky, though I had to simulate the behavior because one program did) checked to see if it returned TRUE (no error) or FALSE with GetLastError looking for WSA_IO_PENDING.</p>
<p>Didn&#39;t help that the documentation implies both were valid return values that the I/O was pending. Of course, it makes sense now (just that the return call took longer than the notification &#8211; it is asynchronous) given today&#39;s post.</p>

		<p>The most interesting question about async IO is &quot;why there&#39;s no async CreateFile?&quot; If you want a non-blocking GUI, you need worker threads to host CreateFile, so you can just skip all the async stuff anyway.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>How would an async CreateFile signal completion? The completion key is associated with the file handle, but until you have a handle you can&#39;t call CreateIoCompletionPort to create the association! (Okay, I guess it could return a &quot;placeholder handle&quot; that you could then use to create the association. Wait, now there&#39;s a race condition. Well, I guess you could do something about that too.) (Today, you can issue the synchronous CreateFile and use CancelSynchronousIo to cancel it.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>AFAIK, no, you can&#39;t. for CancelSynchronousIo to work, all drivers involved in a particular IO operation MUST support cancelable ARPs. Besides, this is a Windows 6 API, and all statistics I could find tells me that XP on the desktop and 2003 on the server have the major market share. After 3-5 years, maybe, but definitely not &quot;now&quot;. The whole point of existence of an OS is to make application developer life&#39;s easier. So I&#39;ll leave the race condition problem as an exercise to the kernel team. After all, they needed 20 years to create CancelSyncIo function, and I bet that before they do, there were many excuses like &quot;oh that would deadlock, we cannot do it&quot; </p>

		<p>Doh. I obviously meant IRPs (like the stuff drivers jiggle all the time), and not ARP (like the Add/Remove Programs)</p>

		<p>Hmmm, Async. CreateFile.</p>
<p>Taking a page from the Linux kernel (the use there is hard umount of active filesystem), have CreateFile return a real file handle immediately, and if the async operation fails, the io completion port signals that and afterwords all operations on that handle fail with ENODEV or its moral equivalent until the handle is closed.</p>
<p>Oh well, I don&#39;t bother with async IO. It&#39;s a lot less painful to spawn threads and with a thread pool the runtime cost of creating new threads doesn&#39;t outweigh the developer cost of async io anymore.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>The catch is if the async operation fails before you get a chance to call <code>Create&shy;Io&shy;Completion&shy;Port</code>. Then the operation completes with a null Completion&shy;Key, which means you don&#39;t know why you&#39;re being notified. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>@Adam Rosenfield: yes, it can, and (particularly) if the OS is doing read-ahead, it will. You can disable read-ahead with FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING, of course, and FILE_FLAG_RANDOM_ACCESS will reduce it. If you specify FILE_FLAG_SEQUENTIAL_SCAN it makes large read-aheads and aggressively removes data that&#39;s already been read from the cache, while not specifying either flag causes it to heuristically determine how much to read-ahead and where.</p>
<p>@Worf: all the examples for serial I/O on Win32 use asynchronous operations, but CE doesn&#39;t support it! It made emulating the DOS behaviour of serial ports, while supporting abort, pretty painful. WaitCommEvent can only be aborted by calling SetCommMask, which is particularly unintuitive.</p>
<p>@yuhong2: doc bugs should be reported on the MSDN page itself, using the feedback section at the bottom, not on Connect. I&#39;ve added an annotation to the page.</p>
