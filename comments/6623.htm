		<p>That&#39;s one feature I don&#39;t mind seeing maliciously deleted from Windows 7 &#8211; it&#39;s worthless if you can&#39;t turn off auto-sorting anyways. &lt;/xpclient&gt;</p>

		<p>The problem with dumbing things down to the lowest common denominator is that eventually your product ceases to be compelling. &nbsp;I know from firsthand experience; it&#39;s a tough balancing act.</p>

		<p>I remember using that feature back when Windows 2000 first came out &#8211; I made some sort of task-launching thing by tossing a bunch of shortcuts into a folder and docking it across the top of the screen. I think it lasted there for about five minutes (I then switched to putting it on the desktop as an Active Desktop panel &#8211; I think that stuck around for a couple days).</p>

		<p>and don&#39;t get how it is related. If you are dragging a window you want the snap if you are dragging a file or folder than you want your toolbar docked folder. I find the feature somewhat useful. I work on a corporate network with a lot of subfolders in a &quot;Departments&quot; folder that I access all the time. I&#39;d have my desktop full of shortcuts if I wanted a direct path to them but with them mounted I can dock the my computer to one of my sides and presto the folders are directly accessible saving me opening up my computer just to click on something else immediately afterwards.</p>

		<p>I believe it was introduced with the &quot;Windows Desktop Update&quot; or whatever the thing that shipped with Internet Explorer 4, that changed the shell in Windows 95 to something closer to what Windows 98 ended up getting. From what I recall, the desktop update introduced the taskbar being split into multiple toolbars (&quot;coolbars&quot;?), one of which was Quick Launch, and at the same time also let you dock those toolbars to other edges of the screen.</p>

		<p>Warning: Speculation ahead, proceed with caution</p>
<p>I suspect Raymond&#39;s lack of permission for history (which is a crime against humanity IMHO) is caused by lack of maintenance. Microsoft changed source control between Windows 2000 and Windows XP (SLM =&gt; Source Depot), and history migration probably didn&#39;t carry over pre-SD branches, especially since SLM had poor branch support. So if this feature was developed in some sub-branch, then Raymond can only see a giant &quot;merge&quot; check-in, and can&#39;t follow the code to the branch where the specific dev made his check-in.</p>
<p>As long as I&#39;m speculating, maybe this feature was introduced as part of the IE4 Desktop Update, which presumably was developed separately from Windows, and only merged later.</p>

		<p>Niels: Correct. The feature got added with IE4. I used it since then until Windows 7 (I didn&#39;t ever use Vista). But, alas, I&#39;m still using XP on my main workstation. So, I still have it on some machines. It&#39;s a pity it got removed.</p>

		<p>Regarding &quot;did so by mistake and couldn&#39;t figure out how to undo it&quot; &#8212; I still think that double-clicking near the top of task manager causes pretty much all UI elements to disappear is bad. &nbsp;I know about it now, but the first time it happened (almost 15 years ago) I had no idea what was going on and assumed it was a bug.</p>

		<p>@&quot;I noticed Aerosnap mentioned&quot;, I thought it was obvious&#8211;if the folder-docking feature were still present, how would it interact with Snap?</p>

		<p>@xpclient: &quot;these are not the features you&#39;re looking for&quot;.</p>
<p>I wonder, though, what was the reason for removing the clipboard ring from Visual Studio 2010. It was so handy. I guess telemetry. I also wander what was reasoning behind making the main menu in VS2012 all caps. It&#39;s like an eyesore.</p>
<p>OK, now for those who doesn&#39;t have a salt mine at their disposal, there is a new DVD archival media, called M-Disk, sold at major electronics stores. It&#39;s using inorganic record-once layer and is expected to last thousands years. But it requires a compatible DVD recorder, and so far there is only one brand. But the good news is that the recorder doesn&#39;t cost more than other brands.</p>

		<p>@pcooper: &nbsp;If you google* : Microsoft Montana</p>
<p>you&#39;ll see that Microsoft has an &quot;Accessibility Center&quot; in Montana. &nbsp;I now believe Raymond&#39;s claim, because it is funny to think that the source code is inaccessible because it is archived in an accessibility center.</p>
<p>* I know&#8230; &nbsp;but if you Bing : Microsoft Montana</p>
<p>it converts it to Microsoft MT &nbsp;and gives you lots of machine translation results.</p>

		<p>I came to know of this rogue feature by reading your blog even though I have been using Windows XP from 2001. It really seems to be a very very rarely used feature. After using this feature I could not find any specific use for it (I don&#39;t deem any folder so important as to have its contents displayed in a toolbar). Its good that the feature has now been deleted.</p>

		<p>I am one of the very few people who used the feature on purpose, and loved it. I did not whine when it went away though, as I understood it was a very niche features that easily could have caused more pain than it was worth. I would us eit like the QuickLaunch bar, but on a different edge than the taskbar so that I had a raft of quick access links, and still a full taskbar. It was really nice. :)</p>

		<p>With some experimentation, I determined that A) it <em>is</em> still possible to make a folder into a toolbar, by the rather more sane method of right-clicking the taskbar, selecting &quot;Toolbars &gt; New Toolbar&#8230;&quot; B) it is <em>not</em> still possible to separate toolbars (whether one of these, or built-in taskbar toolbars such as the address bar) from the taskbar, either to float or to be on a different edge of the screen, and C) it <em>is</em> still possible to dock the taskbar itself to the left, right, or top edge of the screen, which does not interfere with Aero Snap.</p>
<p>Point C somewhat invalidates the &quot;Furthermore, the design team was interested in a new way to use the edges of the screen&quot; argument, and it&#39;s not clear why A was left in when B was removed. Was the whole toolbars thing a rogue feature, or just the &quot;drag a folder window to the edge to create a toolbar&quot;?</p>
