		<p>Saying thank you to bus drivers, in my experience, is fairly common in Britain.</p>
<p>However, in York a new style of bus has been introduced in the last few years (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.goftr.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.goftr.com/</a>) which separates the driver (or &#8216;pilot&#8217; as he&#8217;s now called) in a sealed &#8216;cabin&#8217; at the front so it&#8217;s impossible to indulge in this bit of minor courtesy (or, more importantly ask for travel advice like where to get off).</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not just in Seattle. I observed the same custom in San Francisco buses and trams. I&#8217;ve always assumed it&#8217;s an American thing.</p>

		<p>I usually thank the driver when I get off. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve seen other people do the same, although it isn&#8217;t ubiquitous by any means. I live in Toronto.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t find it too uncommon to say &quot;thanks for the ride&quot;, or similar, to the bus driver in Norway. Especially on long-distance tours.</p>

		<p>Thanking the driver as you get off?</p>
<p>In Ottawa you&#8217;re supposed to get off at the BACK. Not much opportunity for thanking there unless you like shouting.</p>

		<p>David: I specifically sit in the front half of the bus so I can use the front entrance and thank the driver. It&#8217;s just one of those small things that makes the world a better place.</p>
<p>Of course, normally I commute on the train, and I never think of thanking the conductor. He&#8217;s not usually in the car I ride in, though&#8230;</p>

		<p>In your friendly neighbor to the south, Portland, it is pretty common to say thank you. &nbsp;Also if you are getting off in the back of the bus a friendly nod or wave is common.</p>

		<p>People in the Northeast of the US do not often thank the driver. &nbsp;People in &quot;friendly&quot; parts of the US do. &nbsp;I know I was very surprised when I noticed it happening in Seattle. &nbsp;A New Yorker (from the Bronx) told me of his surprise at being asked, &quot;Can I help you?&quot; at a Bellevue supermarket. &nbsp;He thought he was going to get thrown out of the store or something.</p>
<p>There are exceptions &#8212; transplants to the Northeast will often thank the driver out of habit. &nbsp;Happens a lot on college campus shuttles in the Northeast because of the mixture of people.</p>
<p>@Michael: You can thank the Washington State Constitution for not letting King County Metro expand outside King County. &nbsp;Or, if you live in Seattle, for not being able to put holds on books in the King County Library System.</p>

		<p>Whilst living in London I once got a bus from Oxford St to Paddington station on one of the old routemaster (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routemaster" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Routemaster</a>) buses with the open doors at the back. &nbsp;I was standing at the back, near where some tourists had put their suitcases. &nbsp;As we rounded Marble Arch the suitcases went flying out the door and right into the 6pm rush hour traffic. &nbsp;Naturally the tourists panicked and screamed loudly and were only able to get off the bus once it stopped on Edgware Road. &nbsp;When they got off the bus I&#8217;m pretty sure they didn&#8217;t say thank you to the driver or the conductor. &nbsp;The manners of some people eh?</p>

		<p>@Tom: Another solution would be for MS to put the Community Transit logo on the FlexPass. &nbsp;This evades all the political aspects of &quot;why can&#8217;t Metro go to Everett?&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, it costs more, but it would be helpful for those MS commuters like me, who don&#8217;t particularly enjoy driving ~4 miles to the Connector park-and-ride when a nice public one is within 15-mins walking distance away.</p>
<p>A reasonable price for this &quot;enhanced FlexPass&quot;, if Microsoft thinks they want to charge for it, would be about $120 per year. &nbsp;This is in line with what the UW charges students annually for its UPass (I think, I&#8217;d have to check with my sister).</p>

		<p>Up here in Edmonton, Alberta, I would say about 70% of riders say thank-you as they disembark, on the average. &nbsp;I make a point of it, although I never really listen for their reply, which made me feel guilty on the way to work this morning as the driver who drives the bus I take consistently has started to recognize me and said something more substantial back to me but I wasn&#8217;t listening. &nbsp;Oops</p>

		<p>Some of the drivers here in the Czech Republic have issues. Once, a bus driver (from the Prague Public Transit Company) came up to me and literally started pushing me out the doorway without explanation. Only after I asked a couple of incredulous questions did he clarify that he disliked the fact that I was chewing gum, and pointed to the instructions prohibiting eating on the bus.</p>
<p>Naturally, I had no intention of leaving the bus. The passengers collectively stared at me and one of them even asked me where I&#8217;m from, since as we all know, only foreigners have this kind of problem &#8211; no matter all the other &quot;foreigners&quot; I constantly see munching an entire box of ice-cream, for example, or the idiot drunks entering trams and chatting with passengers.</p>
<p>Thus I&#8217;m not particularly enthusiastic about the idea of saying &quot;thank you&quot; to bus drivers, since the incident does say something about the expected level of professionalism in the industry. However, nobody does that here anyway, so it doesn&#8217;t matter. I do see a related annoying habit of saying &quot;see you later&quot; to total strangers upon leaving the elevator in the building where I work.</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t speak for anywhere in the US, but in England it&#8217;s pretty common to thank the driver of a bus or coach, at least if you&#8217;re getting off in the front and can do so without shouting. (No point in upsetting someone who has you life in their hands on a regular basis, after all&#8230; or who could zoom on past the next time you&#8217;re standing at a bus top in the rain.)</p>

		<p>I think thanking the driver, is just a way of making his day a little lighter. There&#8217;s one driver on the King Count 245 route, that makes it a point to say Thank you to EACH and every passenger that gets on the bus and shows them their flexpass/ticket/whatever. Sometimes 10-15 people get on and this guy, thanks each one of them&#8230; what a guy :)</p>

		<p>In LA, some people will thank the driver if they leave through the front door. It&#8217;s not a rule really, people can say thanks if they want to, but it&#8217;s not considered rude if they don&#8217;t do it.</p>

		<p>Perhaps this habit is related to the level of necessary interaction between passengers and drivers?</p>
<p>Here in Prague, assuming the passenger doesn&#8217;t already have a yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, or a daily ticket, he normally buys a short-term version before entering the bus. The vast majority of buses have a map showing all the stops on the line, including automated voice and text announcements of the current and the next stop (those that aren&#8217;t mandatory are announced as such). If a stop isn&#8217;t mandatory, the passenger presses a button in order to signal the intention to exit.</p>
<p>Communication with the driver tends to be limited to quick questions about stops on the line (if the passenger needs to board the bus and there&#8217;s no time to check the schedule at the station) or the occasional ticket purchase if there is no machine outside. Tickets are checked by separate officials, who enter the bus from time to time and only cover a sample of the passengers.</p>

		<p>Saying &quot;thank you&quot; when getting off a bus is also common in Dallas. &nbsp;I&#8217;m starting to wonder if the list of places where it <em>isn&#8217;t</em> common would be shorter&#8230;</p>
<p>In addition to asking the driver to announce your stop (which wouldn&#8217;t make sense here, since every bus has automated announcements), our drivers will usually agree to drop you between stops if you ask them politely ahead of time and they&#8217;re not running late. &nbsp;They won&#8217;t pick you up between stops, though, unless they know you as a daily rider.</p>

		<p>The &quot;no conversation while driving&quot; rule applies in Prague also; in addition, one can&#8217;t ride the bus while standing to the right of the driver&#8217;s semi-cabin, thus blocking his view through the transparent door.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t recall seeing people exit between stops except when serious traffic congestion makes it more likely you&#8217;ll get where you want to be on foot.</p>

		<p>Growing up in Manhattan and I don’t remember anyone ever thanking the driver, including the express bus service that goes from the upper east side to the financial district. It wasn’t until I moved to Brooklyn near this neighborhood <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/12/6736302.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/12/6736302.aspx</a>. On the express bus that goes to the financial district it is customary to thank the driver on the way out, and took some getting used to.</p>
<p>I guess Brooklynites have better manners than Manhattenites.</p>
<p>Who knew?</p>

		<p>I lived in Pittsburgh for a while where one also thanks the bus driver, and I just assumed this was an American thing. In Istanbul, where I&#8217;m from, it would just be considered awkward.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;m curious to know which US cities it is not customary to do this.</p>

		<p>This is just common politeness. You&#8217;ll find a strong correlation between the normal politeness of countries/areas and whether people thank the bus driver when they get off. There&#8217;s no rule.</p>

		<p>In Washington, DC, passengers leaving by the front door do sometimes, perhaps often, thank the driver. Those leaving by the back door are more likely to communicate with a cry of &quot;back door!&quot;&#8211;when the buses is crowded enough, the driver can&#8217;t see that there&#8217;s someone waiting to leave that way. If one or two cries won&#8217;t do it, other passengers will join in.</p>
<p>Lately the buses here have been equipped with a system to announce the cross streets, at least the cross streets that have stops.</p>

		<p>Yeah, just to echo everyone else who has commented on this being common in the UK, it certainly is here in Glasgow.</p>
<p>I take the bus home from work every day and always say thank you when I reach my stop. Unless the bus driver is really grumpy and obnoxious, and there are a lot of those in Glasgow, but a lot of the time I guess that probably isn&#8217;t without good reason :).</p>
<p>In fact, there was a whole book written by a bus driver about his experiences driving a bus in Glasgow, which is a hilarious read.</p>

		<p>In Prague, next to each door there is a push-button that can be used to open it while the bus is at the stop, so there&#8217;s no need to yell.</p>
<p>(However, if the bus is so crowded you can&#8217;t reach the push-button in time, and nobody else is getting on or off at the stop, no amount of yelling is going to sway the driver until the bus reaches the following stop.)</p>

		<p>Quite common in the UK &#8211; &#8216;thanks&#8217;, &#8216;thank you&#8217;, &#8216;many thanks&#8217;, &#8216;boy, now that was close!&#8217;</p>
<p>How about holding doors open for women? &nbsp;I once got *castigated for opening a door for a &#8216;woman&#8217; &#8230; I think she may have been a feminist though ;-)</p>
<p>However, judging by the increase in comments like &#8216;ah, so nice to meet a gentleman&#8217; over the years, I&#8217;d say is dying out.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>*castigated &#8211; you were thinking of castrated.</p>

		<p>As for Manhattan, I always thanked the driver on the M86. &nbsp;Then again I&#8217;m a Long Islander. &nbsp;I always thanked the bus driver on the Nassau busses to, but that&#8217;s because quite frequently I&#8217;d be the only passenger, and I rode the N78/79 from end-to-end every Saturday.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d always thank the conductor who punched my ticket on the railroad, too. &nbsp;Every Monday morning and on the last weekday of the month.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;d never thank the subway conductors, or the Light Rail ticket inspectors down here in Baltimore. &nbsp;I guess it&#8217;s just a bus thing.</p>

		<p>That sounds a lot like pretend-politeness (I just coined that term).</p>
<p>You know, that sort of politeness where you thank someone, and he nods or replies and both of you know that the other one is doing it not because they really care but because it is &quot;unwritten rule&quot;.</p>
<p>I bet all drivers hate having to listen to all those &quot;thanks&quot; all day, I for one would go berserk if I had to endure that every day. I am glad its not the real rule.</p>

		<p>In Ithaca, NY, thanking the bus driver is common. I have not paid much attention to it in the NYC metro area, but I do thank the driver if I get off through the front door.</p>
<p>As for &lt;a href=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/12/8849520.aspx#8851708&quot;&gt;Mark" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/12/8849520.aspx#8851708&quot;&gt;Mark</a> Baker&#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; question above, people in Ankara and Istanbul in Turkey rarely thank the driver unless there was some other interaction involving giving directions etc.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is customary to thank the driver when getting off a dolmus (&lt;URL:<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_taxi#Dolmu.C5.9F_.28Turkey.29&gt;" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_taxi#Dolmu.C5.9F_.28Turkey.29&#038;gt" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Share_taxi#Dolmu.C5.9F_.28Turkey.29&#038;gt</a>;).</p>

		<p>Bus drivers are thanked at least 50% of the time here in Vancouver, BC. Optional, but people do it even when exiting out the back (in a normal indoor voice, not yelled). I do it, unless the bus is packed and you&#8217;re one of the millions exiting. But on routes where there aren&#8217;t as many,`the average is higher, and I always thank the driver.</p>
<p>As for the back door, no button here. Either a pressure pad on the step, or there&#8217;s a bar that you push to activate the door. Once open, it stays open for a few seconds when there&#8217;s no one triggering the door to stay open, just in case&#8230;</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever thanked a bus driver in Sweden, except, of course, under unusual circumstances. I mean, they do their job; and I do mine, which includes sitting very quietly on my seat and not looking at anyone, as per usual Swedish custom.</p>
<p>I did, however, thank the bus driver for the little airport shuttle bus in West Palm Beach, but failed to give him a dollar, which caused him to look rather angrily at us as he drove off. (He helped us with our bags, which I take it warrants a dollar or two.)</p>

		<p>The comments here suggest that people will thank the bus driver if that&#8217;s the convention, but there&#8217;s no agreement on why it&#8217;s done (and why not elsewhere). I suggest asking the &quot;thank you&quot; bus drivers for more information &#8211; perhaps there are subtle technical conditions that lead to this practice.</p>

		<p>&quot;I specifically sit in the front half of the bus so I can use the front entrance and thank the driver. It&#8217;s just one of those small things that makes the world a better place.&quot;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t like people who do that. Getting into the bus is difficult enough as it is without people trying to get out through the same door (when there are two doors).</p>

		<p>I used to drive buses in college. I would say that on an average day I&#8217;d get a &quot;thank you&quot; of some kind from 40 to 50 percent of the passengers.</p>
<p>In my experience, people are more likely to thank the driver if:</p>
<ul>
<li>the bus is sparsely populated,</li>
<li>
<p>it is sunny outside,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the bus is stopping at a non-mandatory stop,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the driver has announced the name of the current stop (required for certain stops with this bus company),</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the passenger is female,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the passenger is a college student,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the passenger is elderly, or</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>the passenger is carrying something large and/or heavy.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It may seem like I have put an unreasonable amount of thought into this, but bus driving is not the most intellectually challenging job in the world, and one must fill the time somehow.</p>

		<p>So what happens if you don&#8217;t do this? &nbsp;If it&#8217;s a rule, are there consequences for it being broken?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a transplant to the Northeast US from Southern California and I see people thanked about as much as I did anywhere else. &nbsp;I do some of the famous Northeast attitude now and then, but generally I don&#8217;t feel like people are any different from anywhere else I&#8217;ve been.</p>
<p>And yeah, I&#8217;ll thank a bus driver when I exit a bus. &nbsp;I usually thank a lot of people that maybe don&#8217;t expect it. &nbsp;They did something for me, even if they&#8217;re paid&#8230; seems like common courtesy.</p>
<p>Once at Disneyland I was stopped by a Cast Member who loaded ride vehicles (&quot;How many? &nbsp;4? Rows 1 and 2&#8230;&quot; &nbsp;This is the place where I always thank the Cast Member as we&#8217;re moving on.) &nbsp;That person said they&#8217;d never been thanked before and they wanted me to know it was appreciated. &nbsp;Now, this is once I was told this over how many hundreds or thousands of trips, so I suspect that CM was just having a bad day.</p>

		<p>peterchen: there&#8217;s no clapping if a train or a car arrives at its destination successfully, and there is a lot more that can go wrong on the ground.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt; What about the applause on transatlantic flights following a successful landing? Where did *that* come from?</p>

		<p>I live in the Boston area, and I almost always thank the driver when I get off. &nbsp;When I can&#8217;t, it&#8217;s usually because I&#8217;m leaving through the back, or it&#8217;s a Green Line trolley where the driver is in his cab.</p>
<p>Sometimes, I&#8217;ll thank the driver if he or she stops for me at a particularly chaotic stop (lots of traffic, or he barely sees me.)</p>
<p>Sometimes, MBTA drivers thank passengers when they pay or present their fare cards.</p>
<p>With respect to Igor, I don&#8217;t feign courtesy.</p>

		<p>Thanking the bus driver is quite common in Brisbane, Australia as well.</p>
<p>So is asking the bus driver to announce your required stop.</p>

<p>Courtesy by automatism or by some rule written or unwritten doesn&#8217;t have to be feigned but it still isn&#8217;t genuine.</p>
<p>Furthermore, those things that everyone does or can afford lose their true value.</p>

		<p>Or maybe it&#8217;s to acknowledge to the recipient that they aren&#8217;t some mindless drone, or a number, etc.</p>
<p>A lot of life goes by where we pass by millions of unnamed, faceless people. Sometimes thanking them is a small cheap way of recognizing them as human. Just like saying hello to someone &#8211; you&#8217;ve recognized them amongst throngs of other faceless beings.</p>
<p>Logically, it doesn&#8217;t make sense. But that&#8217;s reasonable &#8211; we aren&#8217;t computers that coldly calculate everything and spit out the result, after all.</p>

		<p>In Munich this occurs rarely. Most passengers get off at the back of the bus, so there&#8217;s not much opportunity. But I find most Munich bus drivers are not particularly friendly. Most of the time you have to hang on for dear life as they try and keep to their impossibly tight schedules.</p>

		<p>Raymond said : &quot;You must be a lot of fun at parties.&quot;</p>
<p>Parties don&#8217;t have anything to do with bus ride.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me wrong, I do say &quot;thanks&quot; to the bus driver if I have interacted with him in some way &#8212; for example if he sees me running to catch a bus and waits for me to get on even though he is ready to go, or if I ask him to announce my stop, or if he sells me a ticket. Otherwise it doesn&#8217;t make any sense &#8212; driver is just doing his job (driving) which he has been paid for.</p>
<p>Besides, nobody thanks me for each piece of code I write. Perhaps they do that for you?</p>
<p>All I am trying to say is that the unwritten rule you are mentioning made sense when a &quot;driver&quot; drove a chariot, helped you with your baggage, and helped you getting on and off the chariot which doesn&#8217;t happen anymore in modern transportation.</p>

		<p>I hadn&#8217;t really ridden buses before moving out to the Seattle metro area, and I thanked the driver instinctively when I got off. &nbsp;I was rather surprised in future trips when I saw other people doing it too.</p>
