		<p>Back in the 70&#39;s and 80&#39;s, sales people for IBM were very used to being transferred to new cities. &nbsp;It became so commonplace that the inside joke was that IBM stood for &quot;I&#39;ve Been Moved.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, the field fixit engineers said that IBM stood for &quot;Incredibly Big Machine.&quot;</p>

		<p>Went to see the link to that &quot;one manager.&quot; Nice page, but the phrase &quot;after the scientists&quot; made me want to throw a brick at the editor.</p>

		<p>Open plan offices are more normal for me &amp; I try to make sure that everybody has a desk they are comfortable with.</p>
<p>Normally this means the people face the door and the middle of the room, so you can&#39;t sneak up on them.</p>
<p>A lot of managers will lie to justify why the desks need to face the walls but it&#39;s only so they can monitor you.</p>

		<p>This is no longer the case in many divisions (eg C+E). The insane change to &quot;WPA&quot; (ie open offices) means seniority counts for literally nothing. And yes, I am bitter and twisted about this as a 20yr veteran at MS.</p>

		<p>@boogaloo: Ooooh yes. And from there on it&#39;s an all-win situation for the manager: &quot;Can&#39;t I switch the desk so it faces the door?&quot; &quot;Why? You have something to hide?&quot; &quot;No, but I don&#39;t like people silently sneaking up on me, it feels like I&#39;m being monitored&quot; &quot;Well, rest assured you&#39;re not being monitored, but since you have nothing to hide, why would you even care?&quot;. I most likely didn&#39;t invent that line of reasoning, but I used it, and I look back upon it with shame. It was my first managerial position. Too young and too green in the managerial aspects of the job. I&#39;ve come a long way since then. And most likely^H^H^H^H^H^H hopefully still a long way to go too :)</p>

		<p>&quot;that is done purely by seniority&quot; &#8212; in theory.</p>
<p>In practice, it turns out if you are in a small group (i.e. where the offices are not allocated by role: dev, test, PM, etc.) with a manager who cares about all the wrong things, that you may well have your office choice rejected by said manager, on the grounds that you are &quot;too far&quot; from the other devs.</p>
<p>This was 20 years ago, and was frankly a serious anomaly then. But I&#39;m sure things at Microsoft haven&#39;t gotten _better_ in the intervening years.</p>

		<p>You have proper offices, not just a farm of desks in a huge hall, like the open space bullshit religion promotes?</p>

		<p>A few years ago, the company I was at moved to a new building. &quot;My&quot; new cubicle seated four of us, though they sometimes squeezed in five. Turns out they never hooked up the power, so I moved myself into a tiny 4&#215;8 cubicle off to the side. I loved it. Ironically, at my current company we are about to move to a giant room with no cubicles; just desks on rollers.</p>

		<p>&quot;If you want my office, make me an offer.&quot;</p>

		<p>Off Topic &#8211; but contact is disabled: &nbsp;Raymond, in NT 3.51 file manager had long filenames*, and program manager could have groups within groups. &nbsp; It seems like later NT based Windows got the versions from Windows 9x, is this what happened, and why ?</p>
<p>*This version runs fine in other windows too, I haven&#39;t tried progman.exe.</p>

		<p>According to medical studies, sittings with your back against other people will increase your stress level.</p>
<p>Long time, increased stress level =&gt; shorter lifespan. It&#39;s undisputed.</p>
<p>How much is a few years of additional life expectancy worth to you? Nothing?</p>
