		<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;m not the only person who found the original story very interesting and entertaining. Personally I would encourage more content, not less. Some folk are just never happy!</p>

		<p>Wow. I can&#39;t decide whether this is sad or awesome. Probably a little bit of both. Sad that many people apparently felt the need to rip into what I thought was a nice writeup for an amusing story. Awesome that you actually took the time to do this in response. At any rate, having read your blog pretty much since the beginning I have found it consistently interesting and well-written throughout all of those 10 years and your book remains one of my favourites. Here&#39;s hoping you keep going and don&#39;t change your inimitable style.</p>

		<p>@Owen Rudge</p>
<p>I agree, this modified version just feels very dry. Almost textbook like, whereas the previous felt like an actual story told by a real person to another.</p>

		<p>Very few of those edits improved the story. None of them are marked fabrication. It would have been nice to know the addresses were not necessairily what was entered. I very nearly started an urban legend thinking the radioactive was real; but a much less drastic adjustment is better.</p>
<p>Some people complain without sufficient reason.</p>

		<p>The amount of snark/dry wit in this post is just ridiculous. &nbsp;I love it.</p>
<p>That said, people in comments make the worst editors. &nbsp;And people like to complain regardless of the fact that it&#39;s your blog and you can write however you dang want. &nbsp;In fact, your writing style is no small part of the appeal to this blog and probably why a lot of people started following it.</p>

		<p>I preferred the longer version, but not simply for entertainment purposes. I preferred the informed speculation that comes from an experienced developer and debugger. </p>
<p>And while i never assumed that Raymond was able to retroactively read minds, it&#39;s not difficult to look at some code and see what the person who made the mistake was thinking. It&#39;s something that comes from experience, and making the mistakes yourself.</p>

		<p>Anyone who finds Raymond&#39;s superbly entertaining write-ups &quot;too long&quot; should probably try something a bit more their speed. Like picture books, or the documentation for Linux applications.</p>

		<p>@Raymond, I would not read your blog if it were written in the style the haters want you to have. I&#39;m not even a Windows developer, I just love reading your stories. They&#39;re very entertaining. Don&#39;t change!</p>

		<p>Among my many issues with the all-volunteer buzzkill editor squad is that anyone saying they would or could write MFC-lookalike code in Notepad has never seen MFC code.</p>
<p>It would be worse than writing a simple webpage in Notepad that looks like the old FrontPage generated code.</p>
<p>Its TECHNICALLY POSSIBLE, but mind-bendingly insane.</p>

		<p>I am willing to bet that if you forced everyone who reads this blog to post a comment, 99% of those comments would look like &quot;Cool! Good read!&quot;. Since obviously these comments don&#39;t add to a discussion, they do not get posted.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this opens the flood gate to everyone else who does have criticism (valid or otherwise). This can have the unfortunate effect of making the majority of comments negative, even though most of them are posted by 5 or 6 individuals (I mean, really, xpclient can&#39;t be the only person reading this blog!)</p>

		<p>I understand that Raymond queues posts days/weeks/months in advance. This post (unless a complete fiction) jumped the queue.</p>
<p>Does Raymond&#39;s system permit insertion of a post, causing subsequent posts to automatically move forward one day?</p>

		<p>Raymond, I love your blog, and I&#39;m improved immeasurably as a developer over the years by reading it. &nbsp;However, I do think you&#39;re rather uncharitable when it comes to your customers. &nbsp;I often get the impression that you unfairly assume that your customers are idiots and that they do foolish things because they&#39;re stupid and lazy. &nbsp;For instance, it strikes me as eminently plausible that the exception handler came first and accidentally obscured the UI bug. &nbsp;(And while bad, it would certainly be a lot less idiotic than adding a handler in favour of debugging the code.)</p>

		<p>It&#39;s quite clear that you&#39;re the published author.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t often respond to your blog posts, usually because I&#39;d just be saying &quot;wow, another great blog post!&quot; But I appreciate that you have a thick skin and a snarky attitude and have no problem shrugging off the constant rain of negativity you get.

		<p>@Peter</p>
<p>Even if the exception handler came first, there&#39;s absolutely no reason to catch an exception just to hide it. &nbsp;There&#39;s no way to charitably respond to that except to call it either sheer ignorance or laziness. &nbsp;If you can&#39;t be bothered to know about the system you&#39;re coding for, then coding shouldn&#39;t be your job.</p>

		<p>The original story was fun to read, informative, and very Raymond-ish. &nbsp;As for the editor wannabe&#39;s, they can all go [expletitive] themselves. &nbsp;Their &quot;recommendations&quot; to Raymond&#39;s original story are stupid, take out the fun, and worst of all make the article sound not like Raymond at all. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Mr. Chen: &nbsp;Your blog is awesome. &nbsp;You are, am, and continue to be, my programming god. &nbsp;May your preferred Superior Deity continue to bless you.</p>

		<p>@Peter: Don&#39;t take everything Raymond says on this blog at face value. &nbsp;Just because a post makes the customer&#39;s intentions look idiotic or ignorant doesn&#39;t necessarily make that the case, it&#39;s mostly just for storytelling purposes. &nbsp;After all, the original team/programmer who designed the exception handler could&#39;ve moved on years ago, leaving everyone else high and dry, or maybe it was cobbled together by a self-proclaimed &quot;expert&quot; due to a high-impact bug. &nbsp;Microsoft&#39;s made plenty of silly choices too when implementing their own software, but to make the stories more engaging it&#39;s usually fun to play these things up.</p>
<p>After all, Raymond made it pretty clear in his post that he had no insight at all on what was going on on the customer side of things. &nbsp;The parentheticals should be more than enough hints that you should take those particular aspects of the post lightly.</p>

		<p>Still too much fat. The short, short version:</p>
<p>&gt; Windows 95 let applications call FreeLibrary(USER), FreeLibrary(GDI), and FreeLibrary(KERNEL) too many times. A major delivery service had a line-of-business application that did this accidentally sometimes. This bluescreened the system it ran on.</p>

		<p>In my world, one of the basic rules of complaining about someone&#39;s writing style is to also post link to one&#39;s own writing so it can be critiqued. &nbsp;Overall, this would lead to a much more polite world.</p>

		<p>Oh, my God! I&#39;m so excited! A Microsoft engineer took my advice. Yipeeeeeeeeeeee! From now on, I am going to write five detailed editorial reviews of all your blog posts, Raymond! And I will have it FedEx-ed. I&#39;M SUCH A BIG FAN!!!</p>
<p>Now, joke aside, the original article was mediocre while this one is plain awful and pointy; and since being awful is its objective, it is yet another success. But ironically, its flow is much better because of section headings.</p>

		<p>[You seemed to object to everything that made the article a story rather than a report.]</p>
<p>No, Raymond, I just objected the writing style, the undue length, the weird movie metaphors and lack of sufficient context about DS register. What you have written now eliminates topic sentences in the name brevity; eliminates all metaphors (not just the weird ones) and does not substitutes them with anything better; and although it adds something about DS registers, the addition is not adding more context about freeing said register. And let&#39;s not forget that the sole objective of this text is to prompt people like Chris Charabaruk call me an idiot. It is not a product of honestly taking my advice; it is a personal attack with improved flow because of the use of section headings!</p>
<p>This is how Microsoft ends up creating awful things like Internet Explorer 6 and Windows 8: Treating negative feedback like.</p>
<p>If you think you can write great articles, I challenge you to writing a Featured Article in Wikipedia. Oh, I warn you; doing that literally needs prescience.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>But it&#39;s the style, the length, and the weird metaphors that make it a story. (I acknowledge the DS mystery, but I thought I implied &quot;DS must always be valid&quot; in the description of how things went bad.) Maybe you can give an example of what you were looking for. (Mind you, I&#39;m still going to write articles with my own style, length, and weird metaphors, because that&#39;s my style. I just can&#39;t figure out what you want changed in the article while still keeping it entertaining.) -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@Fleet Command:</p>
<p>Personally I think it flows worse now.</p>
<p>The original version had each section flowing into each other smoothly. This edited version has the titles and that causes a break in the flow. Remember, preference of writing style is still an opinion.</p>
<p>Also, what does this have to do with IE6 or Windows 8? I fail to see that link besides of an attempted attack back. IE6 was a product of no real browser competition at the time which caused stagnation. Windows 8 was an attempt at a tablet operating system, with some bad choices. Either way that was very pointless to mention.</p>
<p>Also, I never have felt that Raymond thinks that he writes great articles. He was just writing an amusing story, which is totally different to what makes an article good.</p>

		<p>&quot;No, Raymond, I just objected the writing style, the undue length, the weird movie metaphors and lack of sufficient context about DS register.&quot;</p>
<p>undue length: 1584 words and rather diverting at that to me. Considering that it&#39;s a story to entertain I&#39;m not entirely sure how you define &quot;undue&quot; anyhow. Are you also going to complain about an author writing a 500 page book if they could&#39;ve cut it down to 300 pages, even if the 500 pages add flavor and are entertaining? </p>
<p>weird movie metaphors: By definition subjective. And Raymond likes to mix metaphors in weird ways &#8211; it&#39;s part of his style. De gustibus non est disputandum, so why read someone&#39;s writing if you don&#39;t like their style?</p>
<p>lack of sufficient context about DS register: Ok that one&#39;s particularly weird. Does that mean we can now no longer assume that Raymond&#39;s readership has at least some basic ideas about x86? If you don&#39;t want to research basic things, but instead want to read some technical triviality there are tons of blogs out there for that. What&#39;s next? Demand adding some explanation about what null pointer exceptions are and why they are bad? Or what dlls are? </p>

		<p>It&#39;s endlessly amusing that Raymond writes a blog for the education and entertainment of people not as smart as him[1], but actually takes their comments to heart.</p>
<p>[1] If you&#39;re reading this thinking &quot;wait! Perhaps I&#39;m smarter than Raymond!&quot;: you&#39;re not.</p>

		<p>That John Doe is another John Doe, it&#39;s not me, John Doe. &nbsp;Apparently, my name, or his name, is not that unique (who would say&#8230;) or real (really?)</p>
<p>BTW, I agree with him, although I wouldn&#39;t use the word &quot;manpage&quot; in this day and age. &nbsp;I love stories.</p>
<p>This has just gone too far&#8230; &nbsp;I guess no one is imune to troll bait&#8230;</p>

		<p>[But it&#39;s the style, the length, and the weird metaphors that make it a story. (I acknowledge the DS mystery, but I thought I implied &quot;DS must always be valid&quot; in the description of how things went bad.) Maybe you can give an example of what you were looking for. -Raymond]</p>
<p>Aha! Now that&#39;s more to the point. Yes, style makes story; I agree. Hence, it needs improvement, not removal. (Compare the style of Dale Brown with J.K. Rowling, for instance.) Metaphor is an image-making device that helps conjure up an image in the reader&#39;s mind. Now, here is where things get weird: In all your previous posts, you used metaphor to conjure up an image of the subject, or an analogous image. (e.g. this masterpiece: &quot;It&#39;s bad enough for a guest to demolish the host&#39;s house; demolishing an unrelated person&#39;s house is taking it to a whole new level&quot;) In this certain post, however, metaphor is used to conjure up images that serve no purpose beyond that of ad in the middle of the film: They distract.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>It sounds like you prefer a dry style that sticks to facts without embellishment or side-discussion. Sorry, you&#39;re not going to find that here. And the purpose of the metaphors is take the conventions of a summer blockbuster movie and apply them to a technical story, because it&#39;s funny. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>I giggled at this post.</p>
<p>And people need to remember, it&#39;s a blog. If you&#39;re coming here for 100% hard facts and technical book grade writing, you&#39;re barking up the wrong tree. It was an interesting and fun to read story as it was.</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command:</p>
<p>First and most important point: It&#39;s Raymonds blog. He&#39;s allowed to write in the style he wants. (And he&#39;s even allowed to SWITCH styles if he likes). If you didn&#39;t like the story: Tomorrow there may be a different entry you like more. If not: nobody forces you to read this blog.</p>
<p>@Raymond: I really liked the original version&#8230; Best part was the &quot;Bonus Chatter&quot;: So real-world&#8230;</p>

		<p>Sorry, but I couldn&#39;t resist this line: &quot;Compare the style of Dale Brown with J.K. Rowling, for instance.&quot;</p>
<p>I have absolutely no idea what comparison you expect us to make &#8211; the context makes it seem like you consider one obviously better than the other, and that &quot;improving&quot; the style of one to match the other would be a good thing. But these are authors that write in different genres and subjects to a different target audience, and each has a large fanbase that clearly appreciates their individual style.</p>

		<p>I think the story style and length of the original were perfect. Wish I could say something nice about the style and length of the sarcasm in your comparison of the two versions. Dead horses get old after, oh&#8230; four paragraphs? o.O</p>
<p>But who cares about jibes? Your original was brilliant.</p>

		<p>&quot;Some people complain without sufficient reason.&quot;</p>
<p>is the long form of the much more general &quot;Some people are idiots&quot;</p>
<p>I *liked* the original version. It has flavour and texture. Chapter headings I only expect in (usually quite dry) textbooks or childrens books. Everyone with a reading age above ten years old or so should be able to appreciate well-written(!) long texts where the only separations are paragraph whitespace. Perhaps with chapters (only numbered, nothing more) for easier &quot;jumping&quot; or when *really* changing the setting (like &quot;on the moon, fourty-fivee years later&quot;)</p>

		<p>Raymond, allow me to join the chorus praising the original article. &nbsp;It&#39;s a sterling example of the reason why legions read your blog every day. &nbsp;Please, ignore the two commenters who critiqued the original story; if they don&#39;t get your writing style, metaphors, or jokes, then that&#39;s they&#39;re problem, not yours.</p>

<p>I said quite the opposite.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>The original complaints were for undue length and metaphors that don&#39;t conjure up images.

		<p>I love the original story, and the &quot;weird movie metaphors&quot; make it feel just like an episode of the documentary Seconds from Disaster (NatGeo).

<p>How is it that people like Fleet Command can get under your skin? From what I can see his/her writing is nothing special and neither are the examples she/he is using to demonstrate good vs poor writing. With no valid evidence to critique your writing style why let &quot;I don&#39;t like how you write&quot; get to you? </p>
<p>You have a lot of &lt;censored&gt;&#39;s commenting on your blog, such as myself and Anon up there; I&#39;d ignore us all if I were you.</p>
