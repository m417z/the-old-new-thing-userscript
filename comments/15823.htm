		<p>This reminds me of a former co-worker of mine. &nbsp;I re-formatted his code to match our coding style conventions and he accused me of walking into his house and rearranging everything. &nbsp;At the time I had been working there for years and him months. &nbsp;Go figure he didn&#8217;t last very long.</p>

		<p>Developers with an attitude like the one presented in this article are the primary reason I try my hardest to keep my shell extensions as close to stock standard as I can. Inevitably when I come across someone complaining about Explorer&#8217;s stability they&#8217;ll have a million new entries in their context menus.</p>

		<p>Another very hard-to-grasp concept is that when shipping 64-bit product which has shell extension, you really want to ship both 32 and 64-bit shell extension dlls. After the third time I got the replay &quot;but on 64 bit Windows Explorer is 64-bit, so a 32-bit shell extension is useless&quot;, I stopped trying to educate people.</p>
<p>People do believe that Explorer is the only entity that has the holy right to touch shell extensions.</p>

		<p>I understand it was probably a good idea at the time, when programmers could be expected to actually know what they were doing and memory was limited, but wouldn&#8217;t it be time to move shell extensions outside Explorer again?</p>
<p>Some sort of &quot;ShellExtensionProvider.exe&quot; that would be started by explorer (sort of like MSN Messenger always starts ctfmon.exe or TortoiseSVN always starts TSVNCache.exe) and would answer to &quot;shell extension requests&quot; from explorer views hosted in all processes, 32 or 64-bits.</p>
<p>Of course, because of backwards compatibility, the current shell extension model would have to stick around for another 10 years, but slowly all major extensions would be migrated to the new model.</p>

		<p>@Koro: And maybe we&#8217;ll finally get to write managed-code shell extensions.</p>
<p>BTW, ctfmon.exe is a Windows process that has something to do with sound. It&#8217;s not a part of Messenger.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I can see the cycle. As you speed up the machines, you can then dumb down the programmers and still end up with the same responsiveness of machines twenty years ago. Then despite upgrading your machine every couple of years the machine still feels as slow. Brilliant!!!! That&#8217;ll keep us on the gravy train for life!</p>

		<p>@porter</p>
<p>Did you actually use a computer, say, 20 years ago? Those things were slow compared to an adequate machine running 7 or XP (I won&#8217;t touch Vista here &#8230;), if only because of I/O. Actually, that&#8217;s still the most limiting factor.</p>

		<p>Since MS pwns the house, they don&#8217;t care about whether changing the carpet could make the guests fall or not visit their house again. With this same mentality, I guess was why IColumnProvider was removed citing pseudo performance reasons. I have loyally stuck with XP because of this (Extensible column handlers are far too valuable to me than fancy Aero or Peek). How the hell can I display certain info like extension or size (especially folder size) thru extensions? Not possible with the Property system which only allows extracting static metadata from files. I hope Windows 8 or Windows 7 SP1 brings back IColumnProvider. Whatever happened to giving choice to users/developers?</p>

		<p>A problem is that not all shell extensions can be out of process. Notably icon handlers, the only type of shell extension I&#8217;ve written yet.</p>

		<p>@porter: I posit that having ONE copy of the shell extension running in a separate process, instead of having a copy of it loaded into each process that shows an Open/Save dialog box, would have net memory savings in the end, as it would not need to allocate its per-instance data for each process. It would also remove the need for shell extension helper processes like TSVNCache.exe.</p>
<p>It would also have the benefit of not &quot;polluting&quot; the list of DLLs loaded into a process as soon as an Open/Save dialog would be shown.</p>
<p>@Jonathan: Actually, ctfmon.exe is related to msctf.exe, which I *think* is related to IME&#8217;s and advanced text input&#8230; which MSN indirectly uses since it uses windowless RichEdit&#8217;s for its input.</p>

		<p>@Ken White, how exactly is a troll defined? One who complains about useful features lacking in Windows which were there in the past? My tone is because Microsoft doesn&#8217;t listen, this way or that way. The shell team and the Windows Media team at MS need to be crucified under a guillotine.</p>
