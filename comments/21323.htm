		<p>I&#8217;m sure this will come up again, but isn&#8217;t this new law just as &quot;in violation of the Constitution&quot; as the old one was? I&#8217;m pretty sure the legal system isn&#8217;t suppose to presume telepathy.</p>

		<p>Um, actually, that grace period approach is fairly commonplace in law &#8211; back in 1996, when Congress placed a one-year limit on prison inmates seeking collateral review of their convictions/sentences (a so-called Section 2254 habeas petition / Section 2255 motion), courts everywhere decided &#8211; a few years later &#8211; that you have one year since the enactment to file the petition, even though it might look barred at the time because you were convicted a long time before 1996&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>And sometimes when they did an extreme rewrite (there&#8217;s a case a few years ago when the Ninth Circuit interpreted &quot;not less than 7 days&quot; to be &quot;not more than 7 days&quot;), they did refuse to apply the interpretation to the parties in the case to be &quot;fair&quot;.</p>

		<p>And what it really means is that when congress says &#8220;As of 90 days from now, you have 30 days to file your petition&#8221; your lawyer better get the petition in sometime in the next 90 days. &nbsp; When congress passes laws they don&#8217;t usually go into effect for months.</p>

		<p>I just read the opinion in full. To be fair, the guy didn&#8217;t need a psychic, just a competent attorney.</p>
<p>The court held that although the act doesn&#8217;t say so explicitly, he could have applied for review during the first month after passage of the bill, given that all new deportees also only have a month to file their appeal. It&#8217;s a little unfair in that it suddenly puts attorneys under pressure to handle all their back deportees as well as any that walk in the door, but it&#8217;s not beyond the bounds of reason.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this is US immigration law, where &#8216;beyond the bounds of reason&#8217; is an everyday occurrence. Sigh.</p>

		<p>Reading the full decision is enlightening. The law changed to allow 30 days to appeal under a new procedure. The person in this case waited a year to appeal under the old procedure that allowed unlimited time.</p>
<p>Both old and new methods were apparently made unavailable to him by the law change.</p>
<p>So the court said that anyone who&#8217;d tried to follow the new law would be allowed to do so, giving him 30 days from the new law to do so.</p>
<p>No sign of a need for a psychic here: just notice the rule change and try to comply as best you can instead of completely ignoring it.</p>
<p>I am glad that, unlike a certain alternative OS vendor, Microsoft instead has the practice of trying to keep the old rules valid for a very long time for those who write programs that rely on them. This reflects a reality different from this immigration case: a program once distributed can&#8217;t rewrite itself to follow the new rules.</p>

		<p>[Okay, you follow it as best you can, but how do you convince the court to accept your filing which the new law says you aren&#8217;t allowed to file? -Raymond]</p>
<p>It appears that you get them to accept it the same way he did, but within the 30 day window of the enactment of the law, instead of waiting over a year to do so. &nbsp;The way I read the opinion, if he had filed suit, or appeal, or whatever it was that he actually filed, within the 30 days, the court would have allowed him to file his appeal of his deportation.</p>

		<p>English is a tricky language. &quot;The law&quot;, is that the collection of rules, or a reference to single individual rule ? &quot;The law which recategorizes&#8230;&quot; definitely is the latter.</p>
<p>The problem is with Raymond&#8217;s statement &quot;it&#8217;s the law&quot;. That seems to apply to the set of rules. You see, under the whole set of rules (including &quot;constitutional&quot; rules that trump others) the right to file a petition ends either 30 days after the action or 30 days after the new 2005 rule.</p>
<p>Hence, we can now reparse the statement. You should file a petition, even though the (regular) law says you can&#8217;t, because the (constitutional) law says you can.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really not different from MSDN documentation. You can&#8217;t take indiviudal statements in isolation. E.g. there&#8217;s the general notion that NULL pointers can cause an AV, you don&#8217;t spell that out everywhere.</p>

		<p>Am I the only one here under the impression that this, actually, is happening to Ray?</p>
