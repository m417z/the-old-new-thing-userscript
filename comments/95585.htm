		<p>It seems to me surprising that the new touchscreen features weren&#8217;t made to take advantage of the (admittedly few) existing things written for Tablet PC. I assume there&#8217;s a good reason for this (perhaps there were even fewer things written for it than I&#8217;m imagining so that it just wasn&#8217;t worth the time, or perhaps adding support caused more trouble than it&#8217;s worth)? Can anyone shed some light on this?</p>

		<p>Apps written for XP-era Tablet PC are backwards compatible.  The new APIs simply expose more functionality.  SetGestureConfig was a new API for Win7 that allowed you to block ALL gestures of certain types rather than having to respond to each attempt to make a gesture.  Similarly, Windows 8 introduced WM_POINTER to replace the older WM_TOUCH model (and whatever API XP Tablet Mode used &#8211; I&#8217;ve forgotten), but apps coded against those old models will still function.</p>

<p>Raymond appears to be suggesting that old Tablet PC apps will only successfully disable press-and-hold on XP &amp; not Windows 7. Which I wouldn&#8217;t consider very compatible.</p>
<p>&#8220;This successfully disables the press-and-hold gesture on Tablet PC (remember that?), allowing the left-button messages to be generated immediately upon contact. But it doesn&#8217;t help for Windows 7 and above. For that, we need something else:&#8221;</p>

		<p>It is a bit unclear, but I think what is happening is that the touch-and-hold gesture that existed in XP Tablet edition IS disabled.  However, other gestures remain enabled, so the decision that a touch is translated to a mouse event again has to be delayed to allow for gesture detection.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not &#8220;disabling touch-and-hold&#8221; that fails on 7 and later, it&#8217;s the consequent behavior of event generation on contact, that no longer happens.</p>

		<p>If SetGestureConfig was introduced in Windows 7 (and MSDN confirms that), then calling it won&#8217;t make the app compatible with Windows XP and up: it just won&#8217;t run on Windows XP and Vista.</p>
<p>(Unless you use GetProcAddress to get the function entry-point dynamically, of course.)</p>

		<p>As I recall, there&#8217;s also the option to set a window property named &#8220;MicrosoftTabletPenServiceProperty&#8221; calling SetProp, that supports the same flags as the WM_TABLET_QUERYSYSTEMGESTURESTATUS message. This seems to be undocumented, with occasional MSDN entries hinting at it (like <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms812373.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms812373.aspx</a>). Unless my memory betrays me, this did work for Windows 7 as well.<br />
I&#8217;m wondering what&#8217;s the historic background, and why it isn&#8217;t documented.</p>
