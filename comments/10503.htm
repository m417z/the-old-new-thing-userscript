		<p>Wait, so the callbacks on the same timer object are NOT serialized? That a single reason not to use this abomination. Use old good SetTimer on your own message loop thread instead.</p>
<p>And why does one need to repaint on every timer? Repaint as you can keep up, but use a new position during WM_PAINT. Also, ScrollWindow(Ex) is there for a reason. There is no need to invalidate and repaint the whole client region. Somebody PLEASE tell WinDbg developpers about this function FAST.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>(I thought I mentioned in the article that it was a custom timer queue, not a standard one.) And &quot;good old SetTimer&quot; runs on the UI thread, and the goal was to move processing <span style="text-decoration:underline;">off</span> the UI thread. As I recall, painting was fast. It was all the bookkeeping related to moving the viewport (layout) that was slow. Mind you, this story is from over a decade ago, so I don&#39;t remember the details. Of course, moving the viewport shouldn&#39;t trigger layout, but if that bugs you, just change the scenario: The scrollbar controls the magnification of a Mandelbrot set. Which is better, leaving some aspects of the original scenario intact (for realism) or changing the fundamentals of the scenario (so people won&#39;t get distracted by side issues)? -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Hmm&#8230;. &nbsp;When I am connected to another computer using any of the various VNC programs, I often find that a single click in the middle of the right-hand scroll bar of ANY document (where I am trying to page down by one page) results in multiple scroll-one-page-down commands getting executed. &nbsp;I wonder if that&#39;s what is happening here.</p>
<p>Most of the VNC programs have some code to rate-limit mouse events, but I don&#39;t think multiple mouse clicks are the cause of what I am seeing. &nbsp;What is described here might explain what I am seeing.</p>

		<p>@DW:</p>
<p>VNC-style remote access programs don&#39;t usually work like RDP. They mirror the screen state; a program&#39;s (re)drawing speed is limited by the program&#39;s host.</p>
<p>RDP, though, is sending actual drawing commands over the wire.</p>
<p>Also, Shift+Click on the scroll bar position will get you there at once.</p>

		<p>We used to see the same problem when using .NET&#39;s System.Threading.Timer. &nbsp;But, now in our code reviews we treat periodic timers as unsafe until proven otherwise. &nbsp;Using a one-shot timer and making the callback be responsible for rescheduling if and when appropriate forces the developer to think about what solution they want to the problem.</p>

		<p>I must be missing something here. If the heavy work is happening off-thread, then why doesn&#39;t this happen:</p>
<p>&quot;At T=200 ms, the mouse button is released, so the UI thread cancels the periodic timer, and the whole avalanche is prevented.&quot;</p>
<div class="post">[<i>I never did figure out that part. My guess is the attempt to cancel the periodic timer itself requires the document critical section. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>The best part of the article was the video. Had a good laugh. Nice analogy.</p>

		<p>This is again a &quot;can anyone please fix my sloppy code&quot;. Please tell them to write faster code. Even a mandelbrot can render in sub 400ms time if doing it right.</p>

		<p>@Faster code please</p>
<p>Okay, so now you&#39;re showing a 500MB document that&#39;s being dynamically streamed from a server on a different continent. Because the file is so huge, you only download the section of the document that you&#39;re currently showing, but because of all the embedded fonts and images and stuff, it still takes 500ms to download a single page.</p>
<p>Some things are slow. Dealing with it is a real engineering problem.</p>

		<p>@Mike D: Agreed. And let&#39;s not take a document that may not contain page label as an example.</p>
<p>Writing a good datagrid that can open a table containing millions of row, yet can scroll smoothly is a REAL engineering problem.</p>
