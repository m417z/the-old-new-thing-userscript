		<p>Doesn&#8217;t that make POR an entirely meaningless term, though?</p>
<p>I mean, if the plan for Milestone X is to get Features Y and Z to work, then surely the only plan worth considering is the plan for Milestone X.  This is, after all, the Agile (hawk, spit) Way.  YAGNI, and so on.</p>
<p>Leaving Agile to one side (please do), there seems to be little point to qualifying &#8220;the current plan&#8221; as &#8220;it&#8217;s not the POR, because we don&#8217;t actually have a plan for that, or indeed a record against which to measure the plan that we know we don&#8217;t have.&#8221;</p>
<p>Some MicroSpeaks have intrinsic (if occasionaly inscrutable) value.  This one just sounds like one that a particularly dense Program Manager (not one of mine &#8212; they were all Einsteins) would come out with.</p>

		<p>The term is useful because it denotes that the plan has been agreed to by all parties, as opposed to a proposed plan or an interim plan. (I don&#8217;t understand what your first paragraph is trying to say.)</p>

		<p>These Microspeak articles never fail to impress me.  The evolution of language, especially in such a small microcosm where, for the outside layman it appears everyone&#8217;s doing the same thing (&#8220;writing computer programs&#8221;), is fascinating.</p>
<p>For this one though, I&#8217;d never heard of this term and I hope I don&#8217;t allow it to infect my vocabulary :)</p>
