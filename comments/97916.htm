		<p>But <i>why</i> an &#8220;index?&#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a perfectly cromulent CS term that applies here: it&#8217;s called a &#8220;reference.&#8221;</p>
<p>You can have strong references, weak references,  phantom references, and I forget the other one but it&#8217;s a reference anyhow.  That&#8217;s, like, <b>four</b> uses of references in a Powerpoint presentation.</p>
<p>Beats indexing by a factor of two (if you include direct indexing and, say, Trie referencing).</p>

		<p>What meaning of the word &#8220;reference&#8221; do you mean? I can&#8217;t think of any that makes sense in this context in any way (for me from a more theoretical CS pov a reference is a piece of data that allows the retrieval of some other data &#8211; but we aren&#8217;t referencing anything here)</p>
<p>The word index on the other hand has a rather obvious connection. To quote the oxford dictionary:</p>
<p>2. A sign or measure of something.<br />
‘exam results may serve as an index of the teacher&#8217;s effectiveness’</p>
<p>I can see how you arrive at &#8220;overindex&#8221; from that.</p>

		<p>In a database, if you <i>over-index</i>, you end up a) wasting space, b) wasting machine cycles (inserts take longer), c) getting very little benefit (by definition, if something is over-indexed, you don&#8217;t need the index you just created) and finally d) make something seem more important than it really is.<br />
In the context of the Amazon HQ2 quote, that actually pretty closely matches the point of what Mr. Kelman is trying to say.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s probably from the economic term <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Index_(economics)" rel="nofollow">index</a> (it could also be from statistics, but is more likely the economic version.) Overindexing would be favouring one group of data over other groups.</p>
<p>Just in case the previous comment was in jest: :-)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m glad you added the clarification of the meaning. I initially read it the other way around, as saying that people were being given too much prominence by Amazon, which given the stories I&#8217;ve heard about the working conditions in the warehouses seems to indicate a race to the bottom in terms of treating people with a bit of basic respect.</p>

		<p>Based on your definition, it sounds like Amazon is the one that&#8217;s overindexed — not people. But that&#8217;s not what Kelman is saying.</p>
