		<p>Could Microsoft consider adding Unix style text file support to Longhorn version of Notepad?</p>
<p>Go on.</p>

		<p>Visual Studio gets this almost right: it has an Advanced Save Options dialog for choosing the character set &#8212; and the line terminator. It defaults to Current Setting but also has options for Windows, Mac and Unix.</p>
<p>However, I believe by &quot;Current Setting&quot;, it means &quot;Windows&quot;. If I want a text file to stay in Unix format, I have to choose Unix before each time I save it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d prefer it if the EDIT control (i.e. Notepad) just displayed LF lines properly. RichEdit (Wordpad) already handles this right.</p>

		<p>Notepad is just a glorified edit control. </p>
<p>What should happen if a file contains mixed line terminators? Say a third of the lines end in CR, a third in CRLF and a third in LF. Should each line preserve its own terminator? What terminator should be assigned to new lines? Does this triple the number of options in the &quot;Save as&quot; box?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have the numbers to prove it, but I suspect &quot;lack of support for files that use only LF as line terminator&quot; does not rank very high on the &quot;most frequently requested features&quot; list for Windows.</p>
<p>Besides, if you&#8217;re a unix geek you probably hate notepad anyway and use vi or emacs for all your editing anyway. (Personally I use vi.)</p>

		<p>Tim: In my experience, the Visual Studio editor preserves line endings and automatically decides what characters to use when adding new line breaks. Saving with &quot;Current Setting&quot; preserves these. Sometimes the automatic detection goes wrong and it uses plain CRs for line breaks even though we never choose to use these. Then I get weird error messages from the C++ compiler because doesn&#8217;t see the CR after a preprocessor directive as being a line break (it accepts LF or CR+LF but not plain CR).</p>

		<p>I think Tim has the right solution.  The data stays the same, the file written out to disk stays the same but the edit control starts a new line if it sees a CRLF or a LF (based on a window style so it doesn&#8217;t break other applications).</p>
<p>This might cause problems if the user were to load a file that only used LF line breaks and inserted a new line (should Notepad insert a CRLF or try and do something clever?).</p>
<p>As for it not being high on the list of requested features, I agree it isn&#8217;t that important but I am sure there are loads of new features in each version of Windows that would come further down most peopleâ€™s wish lists than this.  How many requests were there for an animated dog in the file finder window for XP?</p>

		<p>Greetings,</p>
<p>My question about two characters to represent newline revolves around random access files.</p>
<p>In comparison, suppose you are reading a file with read sequentially. In this case if the C Runtime converts those two characters to n for me, no big deal.</p>
<p>But what happens if I am using the file in random access mode, and absolute positioning matters, for example, I am using fseek or seek.</p>

		<p>I would definetely appreciate if notepad would read the unix files properly. A lot of useful GPL etc utilities can run on windows, and i can&#8217;t tell you how often i&#8217;m annoyed to find that reading the help files or whatever requires either getting a notepad replacement or loading it up in some too-heavy-app-for-the-task-at-hand.</p>

		<p>And, of course, just to be different, the Macintosh uses just CR. But then, on Mac OS X, with its unix roots, files either have the unix-style LF, or the old-Mac style CR. Or, maybe you have a file from Windows with CRLF. What a mess.</p>
<p>WordPad actually does a good job handling the different sorts of line endings.<br /></p>

<p>Hey I really like that animated dog office assistant (Rocky). I think most people don&#8217;t dislike the office assistant feature per se, but they dislike those assistants. The office team should to get rid of characters like clippy and Einstein, and put in more cute animals, flowers, swans, sexy babes, etc. Then people will use the help more often and may actually read some manuals.

		<p>A former teletype operator chimes in (only slightly relevant, I suppose, but what the hey!):</p>
<p>When I was in the army, they taught us to end lines &lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; so the teletypes actually had time to move the printhead back to the left side before beginning the new line.  The reason, apparently, was that the machines were tuned to operate at a higher speed than their design.</p>
<p>Strange what memories you trigger in folks, Raymond.</p>

		<p>Um the dog in windows is Rover (right click on him and select &quot;choose a different animated character&quot;), not Rocky.  And Microsoft can&#8217;t add sexy babes (or sexy guys for that matter).</p>
<p>Cute Animals, Flowers, Trees, Hot Rods, Motorcycles, NASCAR rigs would be fine, but you can&#8217;t do sexy people.<br /></p>

		<p>We just found a problem with some of our (C++) source files. It seems some of our VS.NET macros that inserted code into the active file (for coding-standards stuff) were using just &quot;vbLf&quot; and not &quot;vbCrLf&quot; (remember that VS.NET macros are VB.NET). So we had files with mixed line endings. We actually never noticed any problems (compling and editing worked just fine). I don&#8217;t know if &quot;cl.exe&quot; is tolerent to this or we just got &quot;lucky&quot; since lines with the UNIX style line endings were always on comment line&#8230;?</p>
<p>We only noticed this when converting from Visual Source Safe to ClearCase. ClearCase converted the line endings to CR LFs, which showed-up as differences when compairing the old VSS working directories to the new ClearCase &quot;Views&quot;.</p>

<br />It really sounds like nirvana if more people started using help/reading manuals. </p>
<p>World would become a lot of nicer place! People who are having problem accomplishing a task will sit down and read for ten-fifteen minutes and be able to accomplish their task. Instead of going angry downtown and start fights, before calling up some poor man/girl who have read the manual and ask for help. :)</p>

		<p>David: seek() is not a C standard function, and fseek() is supported on text files only if you seek to 0 or to a value previously returned by ftell().</p>
<p>If you want to do random seeking then you must open the file in binary mode if you intend to remain C-standards-compliant.</p>

		<p>The only annoying thing about Rover is when you select the &quot;Without an animated screen character&quot; option, he *animates* going away for about 5 seconds. If I don&#8217;t want the animation, why would I want animated feedback that the animation is off?</p>
<p>OT but: I read somewhere that Clippy originally used Bayesian analysis to decide when you needed help, but marketing decided to increase the frequency so the feature would be more visible. Thereby turning a useful feature into an annoying one. (Can&#8217;t cite the source, so I don&#8217;t know how accurate this is.)</p>

<p>I can think of two reasons:<br />
<br />1) When writing to a file, it&#8217;s easier to just print &quot;n&quot; after every line than to special-case the last line.<br />
<br />2) On Unix if you &quot;cat&quot; a text file whose last line does not end in &quot;n&quot;, the next prompt ends up being displayed on the same line, i.e.:</p>
<p>[user@localhost]$ cat filename<br />
<br />test[user@localhost]$ </p>

<p>Any conforming ANSI C compiler is required to treat all whitespace sequences as equivalent to a single space, where whitespace includes the characters &#8216;r&#8217;, &#8216;n&#8217;, &#8216;t&#8217;, and &#8216; &#8216; (it may include everything lower than 0x20 but I&#8217;m not sure about that).

		<p>That&#8217;s interesting because we have the opposite problem.</p>
<p>In one company that I worked at the standard development environment was Visual Studio 6. But the deployment environment became Solaris.</p>
<p>If we copied the files over verbatim to Unix the C++ compiler on the Solaris box would choke on the line termination.</p>
<p>What we used was an option in Source Safe which can &quot;get&quot; the files with the proper line termination for the appropriate platform.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>David</p>

		<p>Raymond, you wrote:</p>
<p>&gt; David: seek() is not a C standard function, &gt; and fseek() is supported on text files only &gt; if you seek to 0 or to a value previously<br />
<br />&gt; returned by ftell(). </p>
<p>You reminded me that there is a difference between standard C and some things that are standard UNIX C but almost standard C, for example some C runtime routines that are listed in the K&amp;R C book.</p>
<p>These routines are prefaced with an underscore under windows.</p>
<p>Is there a reason they were implemented with an underscore? In general I think Microsoft products are great, but in this case, it seems the only reason was to break compatibility.</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>David Kafrissen<br /></p>

		<p>Visual studio works just fine (basically) with UNIX line termination. Things get a bit messy when copying and pasting. I think the standard for text in the clipboard is the CR-NL line termination.</p>
<p>I suspect that NL (only) was used in UNIX because it was easier to write programs to process line-oriented data with a single line termination character. NL was chosen because it was the second char of the CR-NL standard (and the CR would be treated like trailing white space (typically, not a problem).</p>

		<p>David: Including the functions without the leading underscore by default would have been a violation of the C standard. (7.1.3.2: &quot;No other identifiers are reserved.&quot;)</p>
<p>You can link with oldnames.lib to get the old nonstandard names back.</p>

		<p>Unix didn&#8217;t differ from those RFCs, those RFCs differ from Unix in my opinion. Unix predates them. It&#8217;s hard to differ from something that hasn&#8217;t been invented yet!</p>

		<p>I guess that LF+CR should also terminate a line? Viewed in notepad (Win2k) it seems to put in two linefeeds? ;-) </p>

		<p>That wretched animated dog is intolerable for two reasons: </p>
<p>It&#8217;s distracting in the same way animated banner ads are. We evolved to pay attention to movement, and it&#8217;s not easy to focus on something *static* when there&#8217;s something *flashing* and *jumping* *around* right next to it. Our instincts say the animated dog is what we should be watching, but of course there&#8217;s no information there at all. It isn&#8217;t just harmlessly wasted screen real estate (like the bizarre &quot;web content&quot; white area I have to disable in explorer.exe, where it tells me that my text files contain text and .exes can be executed); it&#8217;s aggressively counterproductive. It&#8217;s an ANTI-feature. However benign the intent may have been, the effect is malignant. </p>
<p>Secondly, it adds another completely unnecessary step to searching for files. I hit F3 because I want to search. Instead, I get a cartoon desperately trying to draw my attention away from a list of irritatingly verbose options &#8212; and the only meaningful option on the list appears third. The text of the options is black on a dim background, too, which inhibits readability. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the interface scored well in usability tests with people who don&#8217;t use computers, but people who *do* use computers use them, too. However, nobody reads low-contrast text more easily than high-contrast. </p>
<p>You can turn off the stupid dog, at least, but you can&#8217;t turn off the list of stupid options. It&#8217;s a constant irritation.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got Server 2003 on my desktop, thank God, wherein they fixed that monstrosity. </p>

		<p>What I really like (sarcasm) is that when you disable the dog, you lose functionality. In particular, the context sensitive help in Excel&#8217;s function wizard (for Excel 2000 and earlier) seems to require the irritating animations. Anyway, how hard would it have been to include an unanimated animation (that was not an advertisment) in the choices?</p>
<p>(By the way, the dog is &quot;Rocky&quot; in Excel 2000.)</p>

		<p>CR-LF pairing permitted a fixed-element printer (IBM Selectric technology, for example) to make two passes for underlining and to accept commands for externally-controlled Bi-directional printing.<br /></p>

		<p>What I want to law is why so much documentation written on / for / about / by Unix-like OSes use double back-ticks and double apostrophes to get the equivalent of &quot;smart quotes.&quot; It might look OK on a dumb text terminal, but it just looks ugly in any modern web browser.</p>

		<p>3/18/2004 3:58 PM njkayaker:</p>
<p>&gt; I suspect that NL (only) was used in UNIX<br />
<br />&gt; because it was easier to write programs to<br />
<br />&gt; process line-oriented data with a single<br />
<br />&gt; line termination character.</p>
<p>Yes, but the same was true of CR (only) which was really pretty conventional by then.  By the way, remember that keyboards used to have a key labeled Return instead of Enter, and it was in the same place as a typewriter&#8217;s carriage return key?  If a Teletype was being used for communication with another Teletype then it was necessary to add a linefeed manually, but if it was being used for input to a computer then no one wanted the pedantic irritation of having to add a linefeed manually.  Even in Unix you can type a return (or Enter) which sends CR (only) to the computer, and the computer will echo it as CR-LF (unless you change it with stty) and provide the end-of-line indication to the program.</p>
<p>&gt; NL was chosen because it was the second char<br />
<br />&gt; of the CR-NL standard (and the CR would be<br />
<br />&gt; treated like trailing white space<br />
<br />&gt; (typically, not a problem). </p>
<p>Yeah, but anyone who used any other OS before Unix still hates that.  CR was more conventional and remains more intuitive.</p>
<p>3/18/2004 1:35 PM Raymond Chen:</p>
<p>&gt; I blame punchcards. </p>
<p>But that&#8217;s nonsense.  Punched cards have an end-of-line after column 80.  They don&#8217;t need a CR or LF or NL or EOL character at all.  Paper tape needed an EOL (end-of-line) character, and CR-LF was a common convention for Teletype paper tape.</p>
<p>3/18/2004 9:15 AM Joel Dinda:</p>
<p>&gt; A former teletype operator chimes in (only<br />
<br />&gt; slightly relevant,</p>
<p>Very relevant.</p>
<p>&gt; When I was in the army, they taught us to<br />
<br />&gt; end lines &lt;CR&gt;&lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; so the teletypes<br />
<br />&gt; actually had time to move the printhead back<br />
<br />&gt; to the left side before beginning the new<br />
<br />&gt; line.</p>
<p>And stty has options for the number of NUL characters to be output after a CR, for exactly the same reason.</p>
<p>3/18/2004 8:51 AM Raymond Chen:</p>
<p>&gt; There were requests that file searching be<br />
<br />&gt; made easier.</p>
<p>Fine.</p>
<p>&gt; The animated dog was one interpretation of<br />
<br />&gt; how that could be accomplished. </p>
<p>&lt;PUKE&gt;</p>
<p>By the way, in what way does the animated dog make searching easier?  Does it read the user&#8217;s mind and automatically fill in the appropriate fields in the search options?</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t your car thread, but it fits.  Suppose you&#8217;re driving in a country where the rules are the mirror image from what you&#8217;re used to.  The floor pedals are in the same order that you&#8217;re used to, but controls such as the turn signal and windshield wipers are mirrored.  Which of the following possibilities will make it easier for you to find controls when you need them?<br />
<br />1.  An animated dog display in the middle of the steering wheel.<br />
<br />2.  Labels on the controls.</p>

		<p> Anyone who&#8217;s ever done any string manipulations beyond the ones provided by an API library has probably wondered why is it that all the Windows files have 0x0d 0x0a internally as line terminators. Whereas if you download the stuff&#8230;</p>
