		<p>Many years ago now, my wife worked as a supermarket cashier and was working during the Superbowl. It was somewhat spooky just how empty everywhere was, both in the store and outside.</p>

		<p>The Grey Cup is played at the end of November, as it should be. It&#39;s you Americans who think that football is a winter game! :-)</p>
<p>I had to work a helpdesk doing telephone support and the Super Bowl was a perfect time to get routine maintenance work done. Blessed silence, only available then and (maybe) Easter and Christmas!</p>

		<p>Where I&#39;m at, many retailers (including Costco) have shorter hours on Sunday, and close before the game starts. &nbsp;Grocery stores and restaurants are open though.</p>

<p>&gt; The Grey Cup is played at the end of November, as it should be. It&#39;s you Americans who think that football is a winter game! :-)</p>
<p>I think the problem is that over in Canada the only available winter sport is snow-shoeing. :P (says the guy who used to live south of the tropic of Cancer)</p>

		<p>There were adverts for superbowl games at Wembley Stadium in London. They&#39;re even talking about a regular hosting event. (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://londonist.com/2015/01/could-wembley-host-the-super-bowl.php">londonist.com/&#8230;/could-wembley-host-the-super-bowl.php</a>).

		<p>I guess similar things happen in many places. &nbsp;In Melbourne, Australia, the main ones are the Australian Football League Grand Final and the Melbourne Cup. &nbsp;As a kid we used to often watch the first half at home and then drive to my grandmother&#39;s house during the half-time break. &nbsp;It was always the best run on the roads for the whole year. &nbsp;I imagine it would be a great opportunity to go cycling, except that I&#39;m watching! &nbsp;The Melbourne Cup has a similar effect, with varying impact across the nation, although being a horse race, it only has an impact for about 15 minutes.</p>

		<p>@John Ludlow &#8211; &#39;Why, I have no idea.&#39; Because (a) the NFL is always looking to expand into international territories and (b) there&#39;s a substantial fan-base for the NFL in the UK; they&#39;ve been playing games at Wembley for several years now, with three regular-season games in September &amp; October 2014 all full, and they&#39;re doing it again later this year, with the ultimate aim of hosting a team at Wembley. It may not interest you yourself, but there&#39;s a lot of people, myself included, who are into the game. xkcd covered this last week: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://xkcd.com/1480/">http://xkcd.com/1480/</a></p>

		<p>Not being _that_ immersed into American culture, I had to double-check that Super Bowl has something to do with American football. I recall no awareness of that name before the much-publicized &quot;wardrobe malfunction&quot;.</p>

		<p>Going shopping when you want customer service during the Super Bowl isn&#39;t a good idea. &nbsp;My wife went to Costco to pick up some reading glasses and the attendants at the optometry area couldn&#39;t take their eyes off the game and couldn&#39;t care less about actually serving customers.</p>

		<p>@Steve &#8211; Not sure what your point was. If it&#39;s that NFL is actually really popular in the UK, then [citation-needed]. Also, my comment would still stand, since I&#39;m not sure *why* it would be popular in the UK because it has no cultural ties to the UK. I&#39;m not saying people in the UK are wrong to enjoy the sport (hey, if you enjoy it, then I wish you all the best with your enjoyment of it).</p>
<p>Three games a year doesn&#39;t seem a lot compared to how many FIFA and UEFA football games are played in the UK.</p>
<p>If your point was that you&#39;re into the game so I should be too, then while I wish you all the best with your enjoyment of it, I don&#39;t see why I would be required to get the same enjoyment out of it.</p>
<p>If your point was that I should take xkcd&#39;s sentiment, then I agree it&#39;s a great sentiment, just with two flaws: a) Randall has probably had a lot more success talking to people about things he is interested in, and b) I am really not very good at pretending.</p>

<p>I think we&#39;re disagreeing unnecessarily here &#8211; I&#39;m not asking you to get into American football, I&#39;m just presenting a counter to your suggestion that there were no valid reasons why there might be NFL games played in the UK. </p>
<p>Anyway, with the Superbowl over it&#39;s now nothing but endless mock drafts from now until April; imagine those tedious Premier League &#39;Transfer Deadline Day&#39; programmes stretched out over the next three months and you&#39;ll get the general idea.</p>

		<p>@Steve &#8211; Yeah, I just really wasn&#39;t clear from your comment what you were saying, so I needed the clarification (thanks for that).</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m just presenting a counter to your suggestion that there were no valid reasons why there might be NFL games played in the UK.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps I didn&#39;t explain my point clearly. I wasn&#39;t saying there aren&#39;t valid reasons. I just weren&#39;t sure what they were. I think that&#39;s an important distinction. Sometimes people do weird things for reasons I don&#39;t understand.</p>
<p>In theory, there could be a valid reason to lock a bunch of Z-list celebrities in a building and watch them do nothing for a few weeks (and, for some reason, periodically let one of them out). I have no understanding of what that reason would be, but it must be there because we keep doing it. (Big Brother)</p>

		<p>Canada has also hosted NFL games. The Buffalo Bills played a few &quot;home&quot; games per year in Canada for the past few years, although the new owner of the Bills terminated the arrangement because fans in Buffalo hated it, so there won&#39;t be any games there in future seasons.</p>
<p>Also I think I remember that Mexico had a preseason game at one point.</p>
