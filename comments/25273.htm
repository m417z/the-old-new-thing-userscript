		<p>There&#8217;s a good explanation of why &quot;somebody didn&#8217;t think of this sooner&quot; in Steinbeck&#8217;s Grapes of Wrath.</p>

		<p>Odds are there is a reason no one has thought of it first. It may be different on the west coast, but most &#8216;home&#8217; fruit trees are poorly maintained. They aren&#8217;t pruned appropriately, aren&#8217;t treated for diseases and insects (nor are the fruit treated). Thus the resulting fruit is often full of worms, very seedy, sour/poorly developed, rarely ripe, undersized (pears the size of small walnuts?). Essentially poor fruit that no one wants in the first place.</p>
<p>Me ? I go to local orchards and support them. Sure I&#8217;d love a peach tree in my front yard (well, we&#8217;ve got the fig tree/shrub/bush growing, but it&#8217;ll be 2-3 more years before we can harvest). But I know what a headache it is to maintain one.</p>

		<p>Yes, it can be hard to maintain fruit trees, but in the southern US, it only takes a few tomato plants to overfeed a family. &nbsp;That&#8217;s provided they come in properly, of course, which is why you plant more than that. &nbsp;Then if ALL of them come in, you&#8217;re giving tomatoes to everybody you know just to get rid of them.</p>

		<p>When my grandparents were gardening more than they do now when I would water the plants I&#8217;d just grab tomatoes off the vine and devour them there. &nbsp;Didn&#8217;t work as well for the hot peppers though.</p>

		<p>They do this in Silicon Valley as well. &nbsp;I volunteered and it was a lot of fun. &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.villageharvest.org/harvesting.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.villageharvest.org/harvesting.htm</a></p>

		<p>In Serbia, plums are usually turned into a hard liquor similar to brandy. Doble-distilling is common here so expect 60% of alcohol in there:</p>

<p>So, what are you waiting for? Send them over, if they are good we will send you few bottles ;-)</p>

		<p>@Nathan,</p>
<p>I think they&#8217;re hoping that only people who care for their trees to get fruit will call. &nbsp;(i.e. if your tree is producing small fruit, you might just ignore it.) &nbsp;My great uncle grows tomatoes, but by season end he&#8217;s so full of them they crowd every counter in his basement (and he has a complete wrap around wet bar). &nbsp;Even a small well maintained plant can produce more food than most people want.</p>

		<p>But Ray, they say on the link you gave, &quot;We are interested in pesticide-free apples, pears and plums that are in good condition. Remember, if you wouldn&#8217;t want to eat it yourself, we can&#8217;t accept it. We can help you with fruit tree care as well.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m all for pesticide free, but I&#8217;d be really surprised/impressed if some joe-homeowner, even with their help, can produce apples/pears/plums I&#8217;d want to eat myself, with out those chemicals.</p>
<p>Our co-op/CSA (&quot;sustainable organic, but not certified&quot;) had apples last week, and there were worms in some. Sorry, that&#8217;s a turn off for me. I&#8217;ll take cancer and chemicals over worms in my apples. Bug scars on tomatoes don&#8217;t bother me, bad spots in peaches can be cut out, but worms. Ick.</p>
