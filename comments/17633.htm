		<p>The list of undesirable elements in the Wired article sounds like the attitude of global kool-aid drinkers with a disdain for strong connections to people, place, and tradition. &nbsp;No doubt, listening to a few measures, it was composed to grate on the ears.</p>

		<p>This song is just really great, definitely worth tracking it down. The paired &quot;Most Wanted Song&quot; is certainly less distinct&#8230;</p>
<p>Soldier has a number of other great records as well, if you&#8217;re interested in outside sounds.</p>

		<p>My 4 year old liked about half of it. My 2 year old liked the other half. So on average, there are only 199 slots left.</p>

		<p>So, have anyone else check out the The Most Wanted Paintings for the various countries? &nbsp;While they are different paintings, many are remarkably similar: &nbsp;A beach scene with a hill/mountain to the left.</p>

		<p>Ingrained in the human brain is the recognition of pleasant scene which has some hills, is green and has water. All desirable things for living off the land.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve always thought they had it backwards. The so-called unwanted song appeals to my absurd sense of humour, while the most wanted is just nauseating. Several of my friends agree. Although less than 200 of them&#8230;</p>

		<p>Jax184: Agreed, it sounds like the Bonzos or various sampled music. &nbsp;The levels are balanced, and it has a good rhythm and structure. &nbsp;Badly produced music is far less listenable.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know the others, but I think the &quot;China&#8217;s most wanted painting&quot; is wrong.</p>
<p>Most Chinese would want plenty of white color, plus a little bit red in the painting.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t know if there would be lots of people like a painting that only contains &quot;cold colors&quot;.</p>

		<p>But Mark, that&#8217;s the whole point &#8211; their &quot;worst song&quot; could have been a 3-year-old banging randomly on a piano or some other kind of discord or poor quality audio, but that wouldn&#8217;t really have demonstrated anything interesting. &nbsp;The idea was to put out something well-written and well-produced that people would hate anyway on the basis of the music itself.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s obviously satirical, and so I don&#8217;t think it should shock anybody that the &quot;most wanted&quot; song is annoying, but as for the &quot;least wanted&quot; song, even if it made you chuckle, would you really put it into your regular playlist?</p>

		<p>There was an episode of Numb3rs (S4E17 &#8211; &quot;Pay to Play&quot;) which featured a program that could &quot;process any song and predict its expected level of success.&quot;</p>
