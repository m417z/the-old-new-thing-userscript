		<p>The computers play for the first version of hearts was terrible. You could usually shoot the moon the first hand and I could often win and not take any points for the entire game. </p>
<p>The problem with this is that when you play with real people, you get the snot kicked out of you.</p>

		<p>In &#8217;97, I started working for Microsoft doing consumer technical support for Windows.</p>
<p>Not long after I started, I remember we received a handwritten letter from some woman complaining about a bug in Hearts. She had actually addressed her letter to Bill Gates, and I guess it had been forwarded to us by his secretary or something.</p>
<p>She had a long description of this supposed problem where the computer was cheating. She even included a screen shot, in the form of a blurry photograph of her computer monitor, to prove her point. She was horrified that Bill Gates would release a game where the computer cheated!</p>
<p>What had actually happened was that one of the computer players had shot the moon. Apparently this woman didn&#8217;t know about that rule.</p>
<p>We all got a good laugh out of that one.</p>

		<p>Ah, good old Hearts.  Between that and Doom that pretty much sums up my college years. :)</p>
<p>I can totally sympathize with the Space Cadet JimH and working on the computer logic.  I wrote a card game several years back which I give away for free on my web page, but getting the computer logic just right without cheating was no easy task.  To make it worse, I added 3 difficulty levels &#8211; but how do you make a computer play less intelligently?  Getting the computer player right was the single biggest problem.  I have a new found respect for people who write even more complex games like Chess.<br /></p>

		<p>What&#8217;s the difference between &quot;anniversary&quot; and &quot;commemoration&quot;? In other languages, you have an anniversary when an amount of time has happened from a happy event and you commemorate when an amount of time has passed from an unhappy event. Does English have the same connotation?</p>

		<p>To me:</p>
<p>anniversary = the day &lt;N&gt; years after an event. (annus = year, versus = turned)</p>
<p>commemoration = the celebration of a past event (com = together, memorare = to remind)</p>
<p>You can have an anniversary without a commemoration: How many unlucky husbands forget to commemorate their wedding anniversary?</p>
<p>You can have a commemoration without an anniversary if you hold it at a time not an integral number of years after the event.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s just me. Others may feel differently.</p>

		<p>I think in English the real difference is between celebrating and commemorating. Celebrating implies a joyous occasion, while commemoration is neutral. An anniversary is just a date.</p>

		<p>The default names of the Hearts opponents sure did change after Windows 95.  I don&#8217;t recall though if the change came in Windows NT4, 98, or XP.</p>
<p>Also I&#8217;ve occasionally seen a game of hearts in an English language Windows version and the opponents didn&#8217;t have Japanese names, so I don&#8217;t think everyone played against the same opponents.  I don&#8217;t recall if I&#8217;ve seen a game of hearts in any other foreign language version.</p>

		<p>By the way, it was stated that the Hearts game doesn&#8217;t cheat, i.e. each computerized player doesn&#8217;t look at other players&#8217; cards.  I agree, I&#8217;ve never seen anything in Hearts that looked like cheating.</p>
<p>Solitaire, however, cheats.  I didn&#8217;t see Solitaire cheat prior to Windows XP.  But it was rewritten for Windows XP.  I tried to move the 5 of Spades and owned cards[*] onto the 6 of Hearts, but the program put the 5 of Spades onto the 4 of Spades instead.  Unfortunately I already made more moves before figuring out what happened, so I couldn&#8217;t back up to retry it.  Even if you don&#8217;t know what was moved, you still know that there&#8217;s no legal way for the 5 of Spades to get on top of the 4 of Spades.</p>
<p>The following screenshot dates from April 2002.  Maybe this bug was fixed in SP1a?  But there&#8217;s an unrelated bug (one that isn&#8217;t cheating) that was also added for Windows XP and was never fixed.<br />

<p>[* Owned cards?  Well I didn&#8217;t know what else to call them.  Obviously they&#8217;re not child cards.]</p>
