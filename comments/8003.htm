		<p>&quot;Let&#39;s start by rewinding the clock to Windows 3.0.&quot;</p>
<p>I love posts that start like this. &nbsp;Maybe because that&#39;s the time period I first started using and learning about computers. &nbsp;Nice little reminders about the past from a simpler time. &nbsp;Keep them coming!</p>

		<p>The desktop window manager didn&#39;t fully solve the problem because it is incompatible with certain accessibility settings.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m running XP with two monitors, and I don&#39;t see a sliver on my second screen when I maximize something on my primary display, so now I&#39;m curious about how the border hiding was done before the Desktop Window Manager.</p>

		<p>Right, if we could do it over again, we might not &quot;hang the resizing borders off the edge of the screen&quot;, we might re-draw the client window to not have the resizing borders at all. &nbsp;But that might have been more work.</p>

		<p>This is related to an issue that you sometimes have to watch out for when developing your own applications. When your window has a client window that has a border, you may need special casing that turns off (some of) the border(s) or moves them out of sight when the window is maximised. This is especially important when the client window may have scroll bars.</p>

<p>Having the logical borders doesn&#39;t mean the default NCPAINT handler has to draw them.</p>

		<p>Another reason for hiding the resizing borders when maximizing is to allow controls (particularly the titlebar buttons) to be flush against the edges of the screen to take advantage of Fitt&#39;s Law.</p>
<p>Hopefully it&#39;s not true in Vista and later now, but an annoying side effect of the overhang is that in XP, maximized windows sometimes ended up with resizing borders anyway, such as when the window manager needs to move maximized windows off of a secondary monitor that&#39;s become disabled. &nbsp;And when enabling secondary monitors, sometimes the overhang from maximized windows on the primary monitor would appear on the secondary ones.</p>
<p>That raises a question, though: this article says that the DWM allowed the sliver problem to be solved, but wasn&#39;t it sort of solved already? &nbsp;In 2000/XP, the sliver wasn&#39;t normally visible (aside from unusual cases like I mentioned above), so the visual and logical characteristics already seemed somewhat decoupled. &nbsp;Is it that the DWM allows the decoupling to be done in a cleaner, more reliable way? &nbsp;How did it work before the DWM? &nbsp;I always figured that the window manager could just set a clipping rectangle for maximized windows.</p>

		<p>A certain major 3rd party photo-editing application trashes a strip of pixels on the side of one monitor when you maximize it on another, and also swallows clicks on that unpainted region.</p>
<p>People who re-invent the standard window-border code to provide their own &quot;cool&quot; (horrendous) alternatives almost always seem to miss several of the cases they are supposed to handle. I wish people would stop doing it.</p>

		<p>Hmmm, some applications that are pretending to reinvent window management on their own (I really hate you, Eclipse!) doing this not right, and in result fricking sliver is clearly present on my second monitor even on Windows 8.</p>

		<p>I often find myself thinking unfriendly things towards those who feel a &quot;need&quot; to replace chunks of standard functionality. I&#39;m sure you do think your music player is the most wonderful application in the world, and those flashing neon strips with animated LOLcats for window controls are much, much prettier than the standard Windows ones &#8211; but if I actually wanted windows that looked like that, I&#39;d have installed that theme. I didn&#39;t, so please don&#39;t assume it&#39;s an oversight and &quot;correct&quot; it for me!</p>
<p>@James Lin: back in the single-monitor days, &quot;drawing&quot; it off-screen would be harmless since it would be outside the clipping region. I don&#39;t recall ever seeing the resize border on the next monitor, I always assumed there was just a special case ensuring they didn&#39;t do that, as indeed we&#39;re told there is for DWM. I have a feeling my WinXP and Win2k test virtual machines support multiple virtual monitors, so I&#39;ll give it a try soon to be sure. Could the Themes mechanism in XP be doing something similar to DWM?</p>

		<p>@jas88: I&#39;ve seen it. It tends to sink below other windows in most cases so it&#39;s difficult to see unless the other monitor has no windows on it.</p>

		<p>Yeah, drawing outside of the screen buffer sure worked fine, if you were using an API that automatically performed clipping for you. Not all APIs do. It is mostly the ones that hand you a big pile of bytes and expect you to do everything yourself that lack this.</p>

<p>Sitting at a multi monitor XP machine right now that has never ever executed the visual styles code ;) I can attest that there must be some special handling, too, because there definitely is no sliver whatsoever. Anything else would be hugely annoying I guess.</p>

		<p>I used to be rabidly anti-Apple and OSX, for a long, long time, but I finally got over myself and crystallized my feelings into this one single gripe, which Raymond summarized perfectly and succinctly:</p>
<p>&quot;You want the client area to be as large as possible; that&#39;s why you maximized the window.&quot;</p>
<p>Thank you Raymond and Microsoft and the whole UI team for understanding such a basic concept and sticking with it.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: while I don&#39;t use lime green on black, my colour scheme is greyish green on black.</p>

<p>Hate to tell you this, but I have that problem on my two-month-old Windows 7 laptop. &nbsp;I notice it when plugging/unplugging an external HDMI TV. &nbsp;Keyboard combination Fn+F7 brings up a pop-up window offering to disconnect projector, disconnect internal display, or extend onto both displays. &nbsp;Changing between these options often triggers this exact problem, where the overhangs on maximized windows are no longer placed outside the visible area, exactly like you complain about. &nbsp;I have to restore and then maximize each window to to get rid of the unwanted borders. &nbsp;Really annoying bug.</p>
<p>My guess is the window manager detects that the screen resolution changed, so it resizes each window to fit within the visible areas of the screen, including the maximized ones. &nbsp;The code that does this probably doesn&#39;t provide the special handling needed for maximized windows. &nbsp;Oops.</p>
