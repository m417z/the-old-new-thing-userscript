		<p>For some reason the misspelling of &quot;Bank&quot; reminded me of this:</p>
<p>Homer: [gasps] Look at these low, low prices on famous brand-name electronics!</p>
<p>Bart: Don&#8217;t be a sap, Dad. &nbsp;These are just crappy knock-offs.</p>

		<p>UK/EU notes have a (c) notice to eliminate the &#8216;nobody told me I couldn&#8217;t copy it&#8217; defence. EU notes also have a funny speckled yellow pattern on it that photocopiers and color printers recognise and change the colour balance slightly on.

		<p>As far as I know, it was not the word “bank”, but the word “Kazakhstan” itself. The inscription “Қазақстан Ұлттық Банкi” (Qazaqstan Ulttıq Banki, The National Bank of Kazakhstan) had a typo: the second “қ” (“q”) in “Qazaqstan” lacked a descender and was rendered as “к” (“q”). This makes a significant change to the pronunciation.</p>

		<p>I still think Australia&#8217;s plastic notes with the clear window in them are the trickiest to copy. Of course, those designs are, as far as I know, original.</p>

<p>Yup. &nbsp;I think of this everytime I see some foolish job candidate leave the accents off of &quot;r&#233;sum&#233;&quot; (so I&#8217;m looking at their &quot;/rɪˈzum/&quot;)</p>

		<p>The one thing that gets me about the US and its money is that they keep releasing all these new banknotes with the anti-counterfeiting stuff in them but it doesn&#8217;t matter because the counterfeiters will just counterfeit the old notes (of which a large enough number remain to no be suspicious)</p>

		<p>Merus: Singapore also copied the plastic money concept from Australia &#8211; quite neat.</p>
<p>In the center it&#8217;s transparent, and there&#8217;s a hologram there. Given how hard it is to forge a polymer note, it&#8217;s a wonder why more countries don&#8217;t use it on their larger denominations. They&#8217;re also more durable (they can be washed safely).</p>
<p>As for the uncopyable notes &#8211; I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s a binary blob of code that looks for a peculiar pattern of 5 dots in yellow &#8211; one in the center plus 4 dots orbiting it &#8211; paired up. But that&#8217;s all I know about the technology of detecting banknotes. Supposedly if you look carefully, they all have &#8217;em.</p>

		<p>Israel also recently issued plastic notes. They&#8217;re laundry-machine proof and untearable by hand (You could probably cutwith scissors). Oddly, they only did that with the lowest-value ones &#8211; 20 NIS (~$6US).</p>
<p>The media &#8211; all of them &#8211; reported these notes as &#8216;made from a special material called &quot;Polymer&quot;&#8217;. Which is quite a strange thing to say &#8211; kind of like &quot;purely made of molecules!&quot;</p>

		<p>Apparently there was a Russian counterfeiting operation that was foiled because they misspelled &quot;Russia&quot; on their fake Rubles. Quite the opposite effect as here, but still funny (&quot;dumb criminal&quot; is the *original* &quot;dumb government&quot; for punchlines, and moreso now that they tend to behave about the same as each other).</p>
<p>I was quite sure that &#8211; in the US at least &#8211; currency could not be copyrighted because Copyright was intended to cover only what nothing else did, and there is clearly a Treasury law to cover money already. Not that I can find that ruling now… maybe I was thinking of something else.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see what happens in, say, Europe if they decide to change the money slightly and the original designer sues for breach of Moral Rights. I think we&#8217;ll find out then what the true status of Copyright on money is (Moral Rights cannot be waived or assigned and do not expire, so there&#8217;s no question that it could be an issue unless a specific piece of legislation excepts it or the subject is not Copyrightable). Won&#8217;t happen in the US, though &#8211; although agreed to per convention, there&#8217;s no implementation of Moral Rights in law except for selected video works.</p>

		<p>&gt;Steve Loughran:</p>
<p>UK/EU notes have a (c) notice to eliminate the &#8216;nobody told me I couldn&#8217;t copy it&#8217; defence. EU notes also have a funny speckled yellow pattern on it that photocopiers and color printers recognise and change the colour balance slightly on. They care a lot about people copying their artwork.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t really have much to do with artwork, the ECB has rules that *allow* copying of banknotes, including the copying of individual design elements, even for commercial gain.</p>
<p>(See pdf linked here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.ecb.int/bc/reproduction/html/index.en.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecb.int/bc/reproduction/html/index.en.html</a> )</p>
<p>What they do care about, however, is preventing the use of forged currency (which is why the general principle is &quot;Reproductions complying with [&#8230; criteria &#8230;] shall</p>
<p>be deemed lawful since there is no risk that the general public</p>
<p>might mistake them for genuine euro banknotes.&quot;</p>
<p>They use copyright as a tool to do this, but the intent is to prevent crime, not protect artwork.</p>

<p>Nope. The US government can&#8217;t own copyrights is why.</p>
