		<p>While certainly those who understand what the CPU is doing know that it&#39;s the COM system that need to do some kind of proxying, I don&#39;t think one should be surprised that when COM masks the complexity so that calling a remote object is just like calling a local object, that people start thinking that when they use COM that calling a remote object is just like calling a local object.</p>

		<p>@pcooper: Normally, it <em>is</em> (mostly) like calling a method on a local object. You can&#39;t tell whether a local pointer is good or not either.</p>
<p>It shouldn&#39;t require too much of a mental stretch to figure out that just passing a pointer to another process is a terrible idea.</p>

		<p>Maybe the customer thought that COM was implemented in shared memory? &nbsp;It seems plausible at first, but once you realize all COM objects have vtable pointers and that the shared memory would have to be mapped at the same virtual addresses in all processes, you can see that it&#39;s far from trivial to get working in shared memory.</p>

		<p>If your application needs to know as an application feature that the object is still there, that needs to be an application-level task handled at the application level, by the application.</p>
<p>For example, if you have a stock price monitor, which gets updates through some sort of callback interace, you want to know if the remote application has crashed, or forgotten you, and/or the network is down.</p>
<p>That&#39;s important information in your scenario &#8211; there is a difference between &quot;nobody has published a new price for the last 5 minutes&quot; (which could easily happen) and &quot;the router has severed your network connection five minutes ago without telling you&quot; (in which case you need to reconnect).</p>
<p>So if you want to know, at an application level, that the application is still there, you need to implement something at the application level, such as AreYouThere(){return S_OK;} or GetHealthStatus(__out PLONG plStatus){&#8230;} Or you can do it the other way with a &quot;NothingHappenedRecently()&quot; call.</p>
<p>And if you want to know within 5 seconds if the network is down or the server crashed, ask every five seconds. There is no other way.</p>
<p>That goes for TCP/IP, named pipes, DDE, database applications, and everything else.</p>

		<p>Seeing as he wanted to know when the remote object acting as a client died, this is handled by DCOM as it will drop a reference to your callback object if the client died. If you have one callback object per client problem is solved.</p>

		<p>The problem with COM is that it&#39;s at that level of complexity which makes it possible to use without understanding properly, but still fairly difficult to properly understand. Many topics fall into this range, (for example C vs a higher level language), and the circumstances often dictate that individuals with limited understanding are trying to produce something to a deadline. This leads to those maintenance nightmarish scenarios in all sorts of engineering disciplines (probably none more so than software). This is why I am a strong advocate of the higher level languages. Not because they are better in every case, but because it helps people choose the difficult tools only when they must.</p>

		<p>I can understand why the customer sometimes want that answer.</p>
<p>That InternetExplorer for example. After call to Navigate(), you put a loop to check IE is no longer busy (it&#39;s vbscript so no event checking here). After you checked the browser is not gone to some error page, you use HTMLDocument to try to access an object to attempt automated login. Unfortunately, at the time the browser is still no ready and error is thrown. So you attempt to start another browser object and retry a backup address.</p>
<p>No big deal here, except that when COM throw out the error and indicates the object underneath has been disconnected, the IE brwoser window in fact successfully reached the login page and sit there waiting. If you set the IE to be invisible to do the automation, you&#39;ll see lots of iexplorer.exe process stacks in background because you never have the chance to call InternetExploere.Quit() to close them.</p>
<p>Many times like in such cases, I&#39;d also want to know if the object being automated is still alive, or is there anyway to attempt reconnect the object.</p>

		<p>I think the COM people did the right thing here &#8211; if they&#39;d provided the inherently racy function, then many people would simply write programs with an inherent race condition.</p>

		<p>Why does the customer&#39;s ability to program COM, imply that he should understand lower-level details like: processes don&#39;t all share the same memory? I can drive a car, without understanding how the engine actually works &#8230;</p>

		<p>@TC: It&#39;s usually not a big problem that the customer doesn&#39;t understand the lower-level details. &nbsp;Except in the case where the customer makes wrong assumptions about them and then asks questions based on those assumptions.</p>
<p>If the customer had asked &quot;How can my program tell if the remote COM object is alive?&quot; this would&#39;ve been a pretty boring blog post.</p>
<p>Same thing with your car engine analogy. &nbsp;Not a problem until you start asking how to adjust your carburetor to keep the starter working (and it turns out your battery is going flat).</p>

		<p>@TC: Point is well noted. However my major complain is on the fact that sometimes when COM object dies, the actual object being automated is still alive and there&#39;s no way to know whether the caller should do the cleanup or not, and / or how to do the cleanup.</p>

		<p>I was surprised by the number of RPC error codes here, so I checked and there are a *bunch* of codes that you could get that cover the various causes for &quot;the object you had previously isn&#39;t there any more&quot;, which sounds like a pain to cover accurately in a &quot;IsAServerDownError(HRESULT)&quot; method, since you probably don&#39;t want to keep killing and restarting the server when you are just giving a bad parameter. In particular, I would never have thought to check for HRESULT_FROM_WIN32() codes.</p>

		<p>OT but:</p>
<p>@cheong00: After a call to Navigate(), *do not* wait until IE.BUSY is false. Busy can change state several times before the document has fully loaded. That explains the errors you&#39;re getting. Wait instead until IE.READYSTATE = 4.</p>

<p>ie.visible = true</p>

<p>wscript.quit</p>
<p>SUB blah_BeforeNavigate2 (pDisp, pURL, pFlags, pTargetFrameName, pPostData, pHeaders, pCancel)</p>
<p>msgbox &quot;GOING TO &quot; &amp; pURL</p>

		<p>@Jonathan: I take your points. But there&#39;s a difference between actively making assumptions, and just not knowing how things work.

		<p>@TC: It isn&#39;t just about COM in this case, the address space affects Win32 programming in general. When you start getting to the stage where you can create other processes, you start coming across terms like virtual address space and stuff. If you look into the memory management then you will find even more references there, even a whole bunch of functions to allocate pages in the address space. Whats more, COM explicitly calls out the difference by using the terms inprocess server, local server and remote server. So it would be more surprising to get to the point of using COM in Win32 without being aware of processes not sharing address spaces.</p>
<p>Since desktop and server operating systems on x86/x64 architectures run in protected mode these days, this is basic knowledge if you want to program for the platform.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m amazed that people want to check whether an object exists, and then do something based on that information. &nbsp;As you say, the object may not exist by the time you try to do something to it. &nbsp;There are no guarantees that it will exist one millisecond from now. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Which, I suppose, means that you can never assume anything is true by the time you want to act on some knowledge.</p>
