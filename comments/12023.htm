		<p>My first reading of your example phrase left me confused. If someone were speaking like that in a satirical way, I would be amused. If anyone were to take himself seriously while using this kind of phrase, I would quickly learn to avoid him. The world can wait 30 seconds for you to compose a clearly worded sentence. It is not right to simultaneously demolish the English language and to make oneself less understandable.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m sure that if the executive had just a few more seconds of precious time, it would have been &quot;Net net, what learnings can we get today to inform the release?&quot;</p>

		<p>Some things are never informed. Poor users have to discover them. I wish Microsoft did a better job of informing new and gone features.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m beginning to suspect that MS is heavily infiltrated by the cult created by a bad science fiction writer last century. I&#39;ve read some of their papers and they&#39;re similarily infected by strange neologisms to confound outsiders. Please tell me that this isn&#39;t so&#8230;? ;-)</p>

		<p>It&#39;s interesting to me that the tenor of any post about Microspeak is that a priori it&#39;s bad. Why is that? Is Microspeak &quot;ruining the language&quot;? Not. </p>

		<p>For extra amusement value, you could&#39;ve said &quot;First, you need to inform yourself of a less-used sense of the verb to inform, namely to guide or direct.&quot;</p>

		<p>Microspeak: It&#39;s almost, but not quite, entirely unlike English.</p>

		<p>Sounds like a redundant synonym for &quot;impact&quot;, in the relatively common meaning of &quot;have an effect on&quot;, to me.</p>
<p>e.g. &quot;This testing won&#39;t impact [the] RC, but it will impact an RTM release.&quot; or &quot;This data will impact the decision whether to continue with the original plan in Product Q.&quot; or &quot;This data will impact Product Q.&quot;</p>
<p>As I understand it, the last abomination could be written in English as follows: &quot;What can we learn today which will impact the release?&quot;. It even uses the same number of words.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>&quot;Impact&quot; is not quite the same here. &quot;Impact&quot; carries a negative connotation. &quot;Inform&quot; implies that this is an information-gathering exercise. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Removing words started in newspaper headlines. Fair enough &#8211; you have very limited space to convey a lot. Cutting out an &#39;and&#39; or &#39;does&#39; in this situation I can handle.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s done in spoken language though. How long does it take to say an extra word or two mid-sentence? Maybe a second. Maybe. It&#39;s ludicrous to take something understandable and make it confusing to save a second here and there.</p>
<p>As I grew up I noticed the local TV news reporters doing this. At first I found it amusing that people who&#39;s job it is to convey important information clearly started breaking grammar rules I learnt in grade 2. It&#39;s lost its lustre very quickly though. Now I can&#39;t stand to watch. Sometimes I have to sit and think hard, only to realise that they completely changed topic mid-sentence and were now talking about something totally different!</p>

		<p>&gt; If there is already a simple, easy-to-understand way of saying something, why substitute jargon that requires a special Microspeak dictionary to decode? </p>
<p>If that&#39;s your point of view, then why bother with this whole &quot;Modern English&quot; business? We already had &aelig;lt&aelig;we &aacute;wiht gewrit.</p>

		<p>In a way, yes, that is what I&#39;m arguing(although that&#39;s a bit of a leap from my post, in which I only meant to imply that it was of equal understanding): The jargon in question is understood by the people involved, and there isn&#39;t really a good word to describe this sense: as you point out, it&#39;s a shorthand for about 5 more words (quite a lot when it comes to discussion in a meeting).</p>
