		<p>I have to say the management should have had some share of being raked over hot coals for this.</p>
<p>You should never just accept that something is &quot;50% done&quot; or &quot;95% done&quot; without qualifying it in some way. How do you know what 50% is? In fact, how do you know what you&#8217;re aiming to in order to announce you&#8217;re 50% of the way there?</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t do this you end up with things like this, or the Brillant Paula Bean(<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://thedailywtf.com/forums/40043/ShowPost.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://thedailywtf.com/forums/40043/ShowPost.aspx</a>). Either way, nasty surprises.</p>

		<p>Ah, the old strategy of code everything, then test it in one big hunk.</p>
<p>Invariably when I do this, I find that I&#8217;ve made an incorrect assumption right at the beginning that invalidates my entire design and I&#8217;ve wasted a week (or however long it took to write the code).</p>
<p>Do your work in small increments and test them as you go.</p>

		<p>I think this almost makes sense. Let&#8217;s say your process is roughly &quot;design, implement, compile, link, test&quot;. Once you&#8217;ve gotten your code to link, you&#8217;re 80% done. Right?</p>

		<p>They probably meant &quot;we are 80% done with typing error corrections so the code finally compiles&quot;.</p>

		<p>I was recently involved in importing data from a former competitor&#8217;s database into our own database after we purchased them. &nbsp;We had a hard deadline that couldn&#8217;t be missed because the customer&#8217;s website was scheduled to be turned off on a certain date and the switchover to our site had to be finished by then. &nbsp;The night before we were supposed to import the data, my colleague, who until now had claimed that his import program was &quot;finished&quot;, stunned me with the question &quot;Should I be concerned that I haven&#8217;t tested my program yet?&quot;</p>
<p>He and I ended up staying until 3AM and I basically re-wrote every line of code before the program worked. &nbsp;Luckily the task wasn&#8217;t that complicated!</p>

		<p>% complete reporting is quite often finger-in-the-air stuff. A few places I&#8217;ve worked define what must be done before you can claim n% complete &#8212; this stops the headlong charge to 95% and the slow crawl towards 100%.</p>

		<p>The real problem is management, isn&#8217;t it? &nbsp;&#8211;And I&#8217;m saying that as a project manager. &nbsp;You can&#8217;t get any visibility or predictive power out of a bare &quot;percent complete&quot; number, except maybe to assume that 50% of the work remains to be done from the first time a project is billed as 80% or 90% &quot;complete.&quot; &nbsp;I lay down the following rules: 1. No task longer than 2 weeks, and 2 days is preferable. &nbsp;2. Tasks are either complete or not complete&#8211;never a percentage. &nbsp;If you have to do earned value or anything like that, you take credit for 50% the moment you begin a task. &nbsp;For all other purposes, it&#8217;s 0 or 100. 3. Once we have a list of properly decomposed tasks (i.e., not &quot;reporting module&quot;), we pick out the riskiest tasks in terms of meeting the schedule, and do those as early as possible&#8211;preferably right now (like Mark Twain said about the frogs). &nbsp;</p>
<p>These three principles have helped me a lot in making estimates and hitting them. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Hrm, I was about to say just that &#8211; 50% done means that half the deliverables are done or something like that. More useful is having a schedule with tasks marked as complete or not and some not given to expected unknowns.</p>
