		<p>I was struck by the misunderstandings in the first two pieces. First, the mall folks inability to disambiguate between Greek and Roman culture (okay the Romans did copy a lot of the earlier Greek culture). Second, Chana&#8217;s use of the &#8220;cool kids&#8221; was that she was making an analogy of cool kids with mall anchors. If the mall is to be successful it needs a &#8220;cool kid&#8221; or popular mall anchor such as Red Robin or Best Buy. People will go to where the cool kid is. The mall folks interpreted it to mean that they needed to attract cool kids (popular adolescents) themselves (as opposed to less desirable mall rats. This slow uptake by these mall folks probably demonstrates why then need to attend the convention.</p>

		<p>It didn&#8217;t help that the ATC director (&quot;the stuffy British judge&quot;) told listeners that Chana was the judges pick, and then he told everyone to go listen to the podcast and vote themselves.. That&#8217;s salting the vote..</p>
