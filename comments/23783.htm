		<p>Related trivia: Back in the Win16 days, the registry was called the &quot;registration database&quot;, and regedit.exe was the &quot;Registration Database Editor&quot;.</p>

		<p>Huh. I always assumed the 32-bit registry predated the 16-bit registry since so much of Windows NT&#8217;s configuration uses it, although of course the registry was released originally for Windows 3.1 in 1992 while NT 3.1 was released in 1993.</p>
<p>I suppose this is probably a case where NT&#8217;s implementation came first, in NtCreateKey, then the concept was backported (badly) to 16-bit Windows, leaving a compatibility mess for the Win32 API authors to deal with.</p>

		<p>Huh Mike? Windows 3.1 was released <em>before</em> Windows NT 3.1, and yet it was &quot;backported (badly)&quot;?</p>
<p>The registry was implemented as part of OLE 1 (i.e. before COM). This made its first appearance in Windows 3.1, and was then (presumably) ported forward into Win32.</p>

		<p>rlipscombe: Mike&#8217;s point was probably that the work on NT had been going on for quite some time (even predating the release of Windows 3.0), and, as the Registry now seems so prevalent in every aspect of NT configuration, it would make sense to assume that it was present in some form when the decision was made to include a similar concept in Win 3.1.</p>

		<p>Hmmm &#8230; trusting a programmer not to be stupid is one thing. Trusting him to never leak a handle is another.</p>

<p>Please understand that this was not a problem in the 80&#8217;s. &nbsp;Not everyone was a programmer. &nbsp;There were not even formalized computer science degrees (in the 70&#8217;s up to the 80&#8217;s people who entered the programming profession usually had a degree in mathematics). &nbsp;There were only a handful of programmers, most of whom were smart.</p>
<p>Jonathan Pryor is right in that Win16 was developed for woefully underpowered computers, as compared to the mainframes that VAX and/or UNIX ran. &nbsp;But please understand that another factor in deciding to trust developers is that most developers were sane. &nbsp;Remebmer, it&#8217;s the 80&#8217;s. &nbsp;This was before the time of &quot;Learn C++ in 21 Days&quot; and sub-par students that managed to graduate with a BS in computer science and entered the field.</p>

		<p>&#8220;The Win32 folks went for the second option: RegOpenKey on the same key returns the same numeric value back, which must not be closed (for doing so would close the original key as well). Personally, I would have gone for the first option (returning a new handle), but presumably the people who made this decision did so for a good reason. I suspect application compatibility played a major role.&#8221;</p>
<p>I would have thought that AppCompat would have led to the other decision &#8212; after all, it seems less likely that someone was relying on the same numeric value to be returned than the idea that two calls to RegCloseKey would be required. &nbsp;After all, the ported code would have those two calls, since they&#8217;re not allowed to leak handles (as you also pointed out)&#8230;</p>
<div class=post>[<i>That they went for preserving the behavior tells me that there is a strong likelihood that somebody <u>was</u> relying on the numerical value being the same. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>&gt; &gt; &quot;&#8230;trusted software developers not to be stupid.&quot;</p>
<p>&gt; Well, there&#8217;s your problem.</p>
<p>No, the problem was that Win16 was developed for a resource-contrained (minimal RAM, minimal CPU; 16-bit x86 didn&#8217;t support memory protection between processes, etc.), so to get *anything* decent done they had to go with a few &quot;simplifying assumptions.&quot; &nbsp;Sane/decent developers was one of those simplifying assumptions.</p>
<p>The same assumption is made for e.g. kernel-space device drivers, where if the author screws things up, the system crashes. </p>
<p>Notice that many of these were cleaned up in Win32, such as the aforementioned RegOpenKeyEx(), *real* process address space separation, etc., with a corresponding increase in machine requirements (32-bit CPU, more RAM, etc.).</p>

		<p>I remember the Win16 registry for a different reason. Back then, the computer music format that was the rage was MODs, and the best player was MOD4Win, a nice shareware (now freeware) app for Windows 3.1. Of course, it relied on a key code you got when you registered it, and it tracked the number of days that you used it.</p>
<p>The thing was, uninstalling and reinstalling never re-enabled the trial functionality, it was always hidden deep within the bowels of Windows. Actually, it was kept in the registry. Since no one knew about it (since a user had no need to ever go in there, unlike today) it was the perfect place to hide stuff. I found out about it when someone hinted that I should look there, and sure enough, deleting those keys reset the timer.</p>
<p>Fun times.</p>

		<p>This is going way off topic&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;There were only a handful of programmers, most of whom were smart.&quot;</p>
<p>And most users could be trusted.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny people are defending their CS degrees. From the point of view of engineering reliable systems, Computer Science is as worthless today as it was back then.</p>
<p>Having a CS degree does not make one a smart programmer. And it certainly does not confer any project management skills necessary to resist management&#8217;s push for more features in less time.</p>
<p>Remember it was a bunch of academics who designed the C library, with gets() that doesn&#8217;t specify the buffer length, the unbounded strxxx functions and printf that writes back to its arguments.</p>
