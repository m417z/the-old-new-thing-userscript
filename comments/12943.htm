		<p>Maybe it&#39;s because I&#39;m in the UK but that Bing Maps link just takes me to a zoomed out view of the UK, centred on London. (Tried Firefox and IE.)</p>

		<p>Still, Opera&#39;s years ahead in standard compliance, speed, safety and user experience. So they kind of have the right to fail at pranks.</p>

		<p>Actually, I&#39;ve been an Opera user for many many years, even paid for a few version while it was still payware. But by releasing 10.5 they lost a LOT of credibility with me. It was just released to meet the deadline for inclusion in the Windows browser selection screen, even through it was far from ready for prime-time. I hope 10.70 will finally be a stable browser again&#8230;</p>
<p>Apart from that, I like these little pranks. The IE ones, too, as it puts a more human face on the teams that develop these things.</p>

		<p>For a guy who clearly spends a lot of time reading between the lines of the questions that customers write you certainly put a lot of faith in the accuracy of Rod&#39;s description. If there&#39;s one I&#39;ve learnt about sales and marketing people is that they tend to get a little blustery with their descriptions when it suits their purpose. They rarely lie but they certainly exaggerate if they know it will help their cause, like say giving a journalist a juicy quote so that they can get some free advertising. You&#39;d wish that journalists would do a little more fact checking but that&#39;s a tough industry to be in right now and so corners get cut.</p>

		<p>The IE team sending cake to the Firefox guys is definitely classy. &nbsp;Even better is that they did it again for Firefox 3.</p>
<p>With FF4 on the horizon now, I wonder if they&#39;ll do it again. &nbsp;Of course IE9 is coming up pretty soon as well, it might be nice if Mozilla returned the gesture :)</p>

		<p>Marquess, thanks for that. &nbsp;Reading the Encyclopedia Brown section of <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ConvictionByContradiction" rel="nofollow">tvtropes.org/&#8230;/ConvictionByContradiction</a> brought back tons of memories. &nbsp;Thankfully, I&#39;ve already read enough of TV Tropes to be resistant to its addictive effects, so I stopped there. &nbsp;;)</p>

		<p>This reminds me of the Encyclopedia Brown stories that I used to read as a kid. &nbsp;One I remember is that he caught someone lying about something because she said that she remembered seeing the glint of a ring someone was wearing on his right hand as he turned the page of a Hebrew book. &nbsp;Aha, said the detective, Hebrew reads right-to-left, so he would have been turning it with a left hand! &nbsp;Liar! &nbsp;Which is absurd. &nbsp;Minor details of remembered stories will often be clearly wrong if you think about them, but that doesn&#39;t mean the overall account is wrong. &nbsp;(Which is why that sort of book always annoyed me as a kid and I never bothered thinking much before looking up the supposed answer in the back.)</p>
<p>Also, I read Hebrew books on a daily basis, and I turn the pages with my right hand, probably since I&#39;m a rightie. &nbsp;Oh well. &nbsp;Eventually I read Sherlock Holmes and discovered that you know what, it&#39;s possible to make detective stories that are actually *convincing*.</p>
<p>Link to another anti-Microsoft prank:</p>

<p>In case you don&#39;t get the joke (the vendor presumably didn&#39;t), the guy giving the thumbs-up is Linus Torvalds, attending a Linux conference in Japan. &nbsp;This one was widely reported.</p>

		<p>Encyclopedia Brown actually became the namesake of this kind of reasoning. Read here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/EncyclopediaBrowned" rel="nofollow">tvtropes.org/&#8230;/EncyclopediaBrowned</a> (in reference to Dan Browned, which is when you write scientic crap and claim to have done the research).</p>
<p>And what better advertisement than *Linus Torvalds* giving the thumbs-up to Windows 7?</p>

		<p>I love this story. &nbsp;Raymond brings on the full &quot;I&#39;m so much smarter than you I can prove you&#39;re a lying&quot; and blows hard through his &quot;logic&quot; to get to the POIDH &#8230; and is immediately trumped by reality, once again proving that your logic is only as good as your (implicit) assumptions.</p>

		<p>While I wouldn&#39;t defend the kind of exaggeration made by Mr. Hamlin in this case, I figured Opera Software would be a company you might generally share some mutual respect with at Microsoft. &nbsp;With the aforementioned 10.5 &quot;rush for Windows Inclusion&quot; aside, Opera tends to be efficient, low on bugs, and generally ahead of the curve on features (Tabs way back in the 90s, &quot;Speed Dial&quot; before any of the Safari/Chrome copycats, integrated debugging system that is essentially unrivaled in terms of built-in features &#8211; though FireBug is also pretty good), and of course their nearly always being the first to support whatever new Web Standard comes along).</p>
<p>I know some people had gripes with the interface (too hard to customize I guess, kind of required a unix-esque knowledge of exactly what settings to fiddle and exactly what files to fiddle in) and with the fact that it cost money in the past, but I think (as far as fully-featured graphical web-browsers go), Opera&#39;s track-record and current offering are pretty far ahead of the competition&#8230; &nbsp;their tiny market-share probably indicates that they&#39;re doing something wrong, but I can&#39;t really see what it is from a technical standpoint. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>TVTropes spells doom until you&#39;ve spent an age there.</p>
<p>Dan Brown stories are fine once you figure out what the science fiction is. &nbsp;I also read the Encyclopedia Brown books. &nbsp;As for rip-off conclusions, I submit Lillian Jackson Braun&#8211;in the climactic scene, the hero reaches out the window and pulls in a heretofore unmentioned character as the culprit. Now that&#39;s a cheat.</p>
