		<p>This reminds me of a place I used to work. One department started saving all their files to the &quot;backup&quot; folder. It seems they wanted to make sure the files would be backed up.</p>

		<p>We have a scratch server that suffers from the problem that it gets non-periodically deleted with no warning. More than a few times I&#39;ve seen situations where someone puts up a file on scratch and leaves for the night after sending an e-mail to say something is on your scratch and arrives the next morning to find it was deleted a mere hour later.</p>

		<p>The trouble is that it doesn&#39;t matter what your rules are &#8211; someone will get annoyed when the scratch server loses things.</p>
<p>I worked somewhere where the rules were simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Anything created more than 90 days ago will be deleted.</li>
<li>
<p>Anything not accessed in the last 30 days will be deleted.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the scratch server has less than 1GB space free, the oldest file will be deleted to make room. This will be repeated until the scratch server has at least 5GB free.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Nice and clear, and yet people struggled with the idea that something they put on the scratch server 6 months ago might not be there now &#8211; or worse, when someone puts a big file on the server, their 14 day old file might disappear. In the end, IT gave in and removed the scratch server completely &#8211; it was too much hassle to support the idiots, and cheaper to just expand the main filestores to have room for big files, so long as people cleaned up after themselves.</p>

		<p>We had the same problem with a network share named &#39;temp&#39;. &nbsp;After a couple of complaints about missing files, the share was renamed &#39;temp_DAMMIT&#39; and all was well. Just kidding&#8230; some people still didn&#39;t get it and complained bitterly when their files would disappear.</p>

		<p>I was curious to see what the overlay looked like so I wrote a trivial program to set the bit. &nbsp;On Win7, instead of a black clock, you get a gray X.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t intended to be any kind of nitpicking&#8211;I&#39;d never seen the overlay before, so I ran the program on Win7, and saw the X, so then I ran it on an XP machine to see the clock. &nbsp;The file properties dialog on XP does not have any way of showing the offline flag, so you can&#39;t find out what the overlay means, other than the file size being in parentheses (as mentioned) in a command prompt directory listing. &nbsp;In Windows 7, there&#39;s an Attributes tab on the dialog that shows the file has the O attribute. &nbsp;The dir command doesn&#39;t appear to have a switch that shows attributes.</p>
<p>Of course, as Raymond has pointed out, you wouldn&#39;t normally see the overlay so it wouldn&#39;t be an issue.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s a very common problem with editing attached files, too &#8211; the (non-MS) email client we use at work presently will stick an attachment in %TEMP% and open that file in the appropriate app. Make a load of changes, save, exit, go to send the updated file back &#8230; whoops, it was automatically deleted from %TEMP% as soon as the application exited, since you were no long using that temporary file. With a bit of luck, that should change with our switch to Office 365, saving my users some hair loss and wasted time.</p>

		<p>Do non-technical people understand what &quot;scratch&quot; means? &nbsp;&quot;Temp&quot; seems like it&#39;d be better, although obviously still not foolproof given some of the other comments.</p>

		<p>@Other James: It&#39;s not 1995 anymore, how about naming it &quot;temporary&quot;? &quot;temp&quot; could stand for a dozen things, most of which do not imply the files could disappear. &quot;Temperature?&quot; &quot;Temper?&quot; &quot;Temple?&quot; &quot;Tempura?&quot;</p>
<p>I still like the suggestion of &quot;these_files_could_be_deleted_at_any_time&quot; though, it&#39;s impossible to interpret that wrong.</p>

		<p>It does seem that with the cheapness of space now, it&#39;s cheaper to buy more space than spend anybody&#39;s time looking for files to delete or coming up with automated ways of deleting them. Perhaps sad, but probably true.</p>

		<p>&quot;scratch&quot; is an emacs term, but that would not have clued me to the fact that the server is regularly erased. Please rename it something like TMP, which people do associate with temporary storage. Microsoft has a legacy of bad naming conventions.</p>

		<p>We had this problem at the last place I worked. &nbsp;The design was a file server with various different shares, each with different permissions; fine so far.</p>
<p>Everybody had a personal share they could use for their stuff; no-one else could see it. &nbsp;This worked well.</p>
<p>Every department also had a share of their own; everybody in the department could see it, no-one else. &nbsp;This worked too.</p>
<p>Then there was a global share that everybody could see. &nbsp;This had the problem described above.</p>
<p>People had a tendency to put *everything* in the global share. &nbsp;Over time, things accumulated. &nbsp;No-one would know whether a given thing was still needed.</p>
<p>I solved the problem by enforcing /periodic/ (weekly) wipes of the global share. &nbsp;On the weekend, everything is moved into a .lastweek folder (stuff in the .lastweek folder from before is deleted.) &nbsp;The periodicity ensured that everyone abided by the intended usage for the share.</p>
<p>This had the side effect of shaking out a lot of legitimate needs for interdepartmental file sharing. &nbsp;&quot;Accounting and Sales need a long-lived share for budget files.&quot; &quot;What did you do before?&quot; &quot;We stuck the budget files on the global share and used Excel&#39;s &#39;Save with password&#39; feature.&quot; &nbsp;When these came up I would create a special-purpose share (in this case, a &quot;Budget&quot; share) and grant access only to the departments that needed it.</p>

		<p>Scratch of course means pocketing the white ball in pool! Which is a foul&#8230; and the white ball is gone&#8230; taking all files with it! It&#39;s obvious, isn&#39;t it :-)</p>

		<p>To clarify my earlier comment: this in no way stopped people from complaining that their files were deleted. &nbsp;People still occasionally complained.</p>
<p>I said this &quot;solved&quot; the problem because:</p>
<p>a) the global share took up a reasonably small amount of space now &#8211; so much so that we could back it up</p>
<p>b) the frequency of the purging ensured that everybody was aware of it, and they were able to self-medicate by dragging from the .lastweek folder to the main folder.</p>

		<p>My question is this: WHY is this machine being used for such disparate purposes? Surely the NTFS team could buy their own machine for testing new features. Surely the aggressively-stash-on-tape team can have their own server as well. What happens when the former bugger up the environment for the latter? I think the problem here is that this machine was tasked for multiple (and very much, potentially incompatible) things. Social engineering will damn well guarantee that someone will attempt to use it for source control at some point, simply because it&#39;s there :-)</p>

		<p>In my experience, when admins didn&#39;t get funds to their pet projects, they usually delete users&#39; files for fun, or to harass users. Or both. Admins always complain the isn&#39;t enough disk space. Come on! Disk is *cheap*. Often a magnitude or two more cheap than letting people spending hours on deleting small old files.</p>

		<p>@JustSomeRandomGuy &#8211; The NTFS team does have their own test servers (many of them). However, servers like \scratch are used in all sorts of ad-hoc scenarios that are more &#39;real-world&#39; than those in a lab. And there&#39;s value in testing systems in this way.</p>

		<p>@Drak: Huh? Why would it make any difference if your backup script/program/whatever copies from 5 servers or 10? Or backups 100gb instead of 80 per week? Sure the backup process may run a bit longer and you may need more backup storage but then space is cheap and I hope most network admins don&#39;t have to babysit something as regular as backing up data.</p>
<p>And I mean most user data we&#39;re talking about here is in the lower mb range I&#39;d wager (at least I don&#39;t see many valid reasons to store gb of videos/pictures for work) &#8211; so how much could this possibly be? One upper management guy wasting an hour searching/restoring his files will pay for a lot of 1TB disks. Not to think of the time wasted by supporting guys having lost their data &#8211; which I&#39;m sure will happen even if you give the server the most wonderful and plausible name ;)</p>

		<p>I think this whole disks are cheap debate is missing the point. This server was created as a temporary storage server to test NTFS changes, HSM etc. I would have to presume that MS employees have another server available to them for long term storage. If you going to make changes to the underlying NTFS file system there is a good chance that you could lose all data or may need to reformat the drives. The problem isn’t the MS can’t afford additional hard drives it that the IT warned employees that all their data could disappear at any time Then when it does the employees are stocked and angry. Maybe IT wasn’t clear enough about the purpose of this server, or maybe end users just never read the emails, but this has nothing to do with the price of storage.</p>
<p>Also</p>
<p>“Okay, well before we reformatted the hard drive, we copied the data to scratch2”</p>
<p>While I understand the logic behind this and as a sys admin I would have done this myself. You just removed all consequences from the user. They can now happy continue ignoring all of IT’s emails and using systems however they want knowing that they can get their files recovered with a simple email to IT.</p>

		<p>There&#39;s a compromise solution: back up the &quot;temporary&quot; storage, but tell the complaining users that the data MAY be archived somewhere, then retrieve it for them after a random period of a few weeks or months, or sometimes not at all. That way, there are still consequences for them, even if they ultimately get their files back &#8211; it&#39;s not just a &quot;simple email to IT&quot; any more!</p>

		<p>@Voo: It starts to matter when you backups start taking more than the time between the last person leaving the office and the first person entering the office. Some (smaller) companies just don&#39;t have the cash and personnel needed to &#39;simply&#39; upgrade from their current backup strategy to something faster.</p>

		<p>@Voo (addendum): At least, that&#39;s what IT keeps saying to us when we complain of too little disk space on our build server.</p>

		<p>Anyone realize that with Raymond&#39;s huge queue of posts (years long), if he suddenly quit and stays in Hawaii, we won&#39;t know?</p>
<p>If we take his Windows 2000 comment at that PDC2008 thing, it means he can disappear for 3 years before we&#39;d notice. Like the sun can blink out of existence and we&#39;d see everything as normal for 8 minutes&#8230;</p>

		<p>We have almost exactly the same setup &#8211; a share called &quot;scratch-1&quot; on our Linux Samba server.</p>
<p>We even put a file in the root directory called &quot;THIS_DISK_WILL_NOT_BE_BACKED_UP&quot; :-)</p>

		<p>@Drak:</p>
<p>&quot;It starts to matter when you backups start taking more than the time between the last person leaving the office and the first person entering the office&quot;</p>
<p>Not if you&#39;re using shadow copy (volume snapshot) backup. Which Windows backup was doing since XP.</p>

		<p>@Alex Grigoriev:</p>
<p>Even with shadow copy, it matters; while the server is backing up, it&#39;s using some resources to handle the backup. If backup takes so long that it&#39;s still running when people come in, the server appears &quot;slower&quot;.</p>
<p>The solution is to spend more on hardware so that the backup doesn&#39;t push you over the edge in terms of I/O performance; for example, use the LAN to copy across at high speed to a dedicated backup system, which does the slow copy to removable media or a service on the WAN (you do push your backups off-site, right?). At this point, you&#39;ve just turned $100 of new disk into $1,000 of server + disk + new procedures &#8211; not so cheap any more&#8230;</p>

		<p>Saying that disk space is cheap is like saying a feature is cheap. Sure you can buy a 2TB drive for under $100, but that doesn&#39;t pay for installing it, the downtime to install it, backing it up, etc.</p>
<p>In the same vein, some features take under an hour to code but that neglects the specs, the testing, fixing the bugs, the documentation, translating the documentation into 24 languages, supporting that feature for the next 15 years, and so on.</p>

		<p>You&#39;d also think that with a directory name like %TEMP%, Visual Studio wouldn&#39;t use it for persistent file storage, but it does.</p>
<p>(VS 2010, as part of its process of reinstalling half the OS on install, needs to reboot during the install process. &nbsp;It writes the install file that it needs in order to continue to %TEMP% rather than the VS 2010 install location. &nbsp;Since these are student machines that magically fill themselves up with crap, %TEMP% gets wiped on reboot. &nbsp;Result: A lab full of lobotomised machines stuck halfway through the VS 2010 install, can&#39;t move backwards, can&#39;t move forwards. &nbsp;ARGGHHH!).</p>
