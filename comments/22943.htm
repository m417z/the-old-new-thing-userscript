		<p>I was on a team in the grad school league there. &nbsp;We weren&#8217;t very good, but we liked to play. &nbsp;Some of the guys from the undergrad team got together and entered our league. &nbsp;We had heard about how long it had been since they won a game, and expected them to be pushovers. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t remember the score, but I don&#8217;t recall it being close; they beat us handily. &nbsp;They were actually pretty good players &#8211; much better than we expected.</p>

		<p>The SCIAC doesn&#8217;t appear to be up there with the PAC 10. But I do like the wrought-up poet on the Whittier College logo&#8211;not at all how I think of the author of &quot;When the Frost is on the Pumpkin&quot;&#8211;and sex-specific team names of a couple of the schools.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to Quantum Hoops, if only to see the gymn again. &nbsp;I played a lot of basketball in there, and recall at least one of the film&#8217;s characters.</p>
<p>One of my heroes from those days won the Abel Prize yesterday, so I&#8217;m having a double dose of nostalgia.</p>

		<p>Come on people, I was kidding! &nbsp;I&#8217;ve never heard of this movie, much less seen it. &nbsp;Get a sense of humor.</p>

		<p>I played in the Interhouse leagues and the Grad League as an undergrad during the 70&#8217;s. &nbsp;We used to win more league games in those days. &nbsp;Why, we even went 3-3 in football in the &#8217;73 &#8211; &#8217;74 season. &nbsp; Three bonfires in one year! &nbsp;I guess they need more games against Life College&#8230;</p>

<p>Here is an intresting discussion about the crapness of Win32 and Dot net, I have to say, looking at the arguments i have to agree that somewhere in the near future you will have to clean up shop. Otherwise it will all fall down.</p>

		<p>I played on the team in the mid 90&#8217;s and we couldn&#8217;t even beat the Alumni teams back then&#8230;</p>
<p>I never could confirm this, but at the time, the coach was Gene Victor, who according to the rumor mill was one of the winningest Coaches in the NCAA before coming to Tech. Apparently he had to leave his previous job because the stress was too much and he had a bad heart. I don&#8217;t know if never winning was more or less stressful than his previous coaching positions though.</p>
<p>Regarding the Caltech football teams: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.bookstore.caltech.edu/CALTECH/shop_product_detail.asp?mscssid=28KAPND5WQWE8H3DMS7590XRJP1ECE3A&amp;catalog_group_id=MzNcXCAzOQ&amp;catalog_group_name=R2lmdHMgJiBNZXJjaGFuZGlzZVxcIENsb3RoaW5n&amp;catalog_id=235&amp;catalog_name=Q2FsdGVjaCBUZWVz&amp;pf_id=9HU8P9GRP3FM0134CMN1&amp;product_name=QmVhdmVyICBVbmRlZmVhdGVkIEZvb3RiYWxsIFQgU2hpcnQ&amp;type=1&amp;target=shop_product_list.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookstore.caltech.edu/CALTECH/shop_product_detail.asp?mscssid=28KAPND5WQWE8H3DMS7590XRJP1ECE3A&#038;catalog_group_id=MzNcXCAzOQ&#038;catalog_group_name=R2lmdHMgJiBNZXJjaGFuZGlzZVxcIENsb3RoaW5n&#038;catalog_id=235&#038;catalog_name=Q2FsdGVjaCBUZWVz&#038;pf_id=9HU8P9GRP3FM0134CMN1&#038;product_name=QmVhdmVyICBVbmRlZmVhdGVkIEZvb3RiYWxsIFQgU2hpcnQ&#038;type=1&#038;target=shop_product_list.asp</a></p>
<p>A bit of Caltech football trivia: Caltech has played more games at the Rose Bowl than any other team &#8212; it was their stadium in the WW2 era.</p>

		<p>If anyone WANTS to know their 2007-08 record, it can be found here</p>

<p>The worst ranked schools are all called things like &#8216;Calvary Bible&#8217; (it seems you can win a game and finish above teams that lost them all)</p>

		<p>I saw Quantum Hoops tonight, and recognized a lot more people than I expected.</p>
<p>Good fun, I think.</p>
