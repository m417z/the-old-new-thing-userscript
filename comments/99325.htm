		<p>&#8220;I cannot run the algorithm on numbers that large on my laptop.&#8221; &#8211; I guess that also means that their laptop is incapable of verifying any digital signatures generated by such certificates. They, personally, have bigger problems with their machine if that&#8217;s true.</p>

		<p>No; VERYIFYING digital signatures is not as hard a problem as factoring the large numbers used in cryptography.  It is kind of amazing that the product of two &#8220;sufficiently large&#8221; primes is so hard to factor, but it is.</p>

		<p>But factoring <i>was</i> easy, so this person claimed, if only they had a machine capable of dealing with such numbers. That&#8217;s the point I was trying to make.</p>
<p>I spent a long time lurking on sci.crypt in the past. I&#8217;m well aware of the levels of crack-pottery that is out there, thanks.</p>

		<p>Given the realities of trying to factor very large numbers, the finder would likely have much better success in obeying the #1 law of encryption &#8211; &#8220;Encryption is easy.  Key management is very hard.&#8221;  In today&#8217;s world, every programming framework has all of the latest methods built in.  One merely needs to call a few routines and, Bingo!  High quality encryption is yours.  The truly difficult part is managing keys.  Keys can be easily compromised by malware.  Easier yet, is the fact that humans are easily tricked.  Social engineering works very well within the arena of penetrating a system.</p>
<p>I give the finder credit for trying because we can learn quite a bit from our failures.  The finder would be better off trying to take the easier path.</p>

		<p>My general understanding of most crypto vulns at the moment is that they fall into several categories: Implementation mistakes, side channel attacks, and if you&#8217;re dependent on larger primes quantum computers as soon as they can figure out how to entangle more qbits to be useful (this gets stupid complicated quickly). The first two are patchable, the latter is something that is being worked on right now with a goal of getting a good and common solution in place long before quantum computers get to the point of being a problem. That said the line in the sand is usually what sort of computer you can afford to buy with a couple million dollars (e.g. what organized crime would have). You should always assume that governments can break any sort of crypto&#8230; they have the money and the resource to break it, or to execute the infamous knee-cap attack that works against almost every encryption scheme. Because people forget that they are the weakest link in the chain.</p>

		<p>Local organized crime yes, more &#8220;International&#8221; organizations have more resources and execute more sophisticated attacks. In fact some groups are hard to separate from some Advanced Persistent Threats and may be intertwined with them.</p>

		<p>&gt; &#8220;I have contacted the media about this discovery, but fortunately for you, they don&#8217;t seem to be interested, which gives you more time to address the problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pleasantly surprised that the more hysterical and less careful &#8220;news&#8221; agencies were not fooled by this.  Perhaps they&#8217;ve got a spam folder filled with crackpots claiming to have broken RSA?</p>

		<p>Either that or the person wrote their &#8220;proof&#8221; so opaquely that nobody in the newsroom could understand what they said (or, ironically, they sent it as a Word document, and it had a macro virus!) :-)</p>

		<p>My immediate thought upon reading the first sentence was &#8220;Wait, this is the plot to &#8216;Sneakers&#8217;.&#8221;  (I happened to watch it on Prime a couple of days ago)<br />
It also reminds me of a 3d algorithm I had brainstormed ages ago, before consumer-grade hardware acceleration. I would precalculate all possible triangles on the assumption/hope that rotation frames could be derived from some kind of simple equation to tell you which &#8220;cell&#8221; to hop to. I figured it would revolutionalize 3D rendering if it worked, but I didn&#8217;t even get to the algorithm because it took some crazy amount of (90s-era) memory to store them all; I optimized it to something like a third of that size, but it was still something like 100 MB, and I was still looking at the strong possibility of major computational expenses that probably wouldn&#8217;t even work.<br />
Those rabbit holes are so damn enticing that I can see where the finder is coming from, but you always have to listen at least a little to that voice of doubt telling you that reality is still there.</p>

		<p>@Keith: Now that 100MB RAM is easily acquired, try implementing your algorithm again (either in software or in your brain).  If 100MB had been feasible, would your algorithm have helped?</p>

		<p>I wonder, you have to take care of security report on cryptographic algorithms today? I thought Microsoft would assign it to some &#8220;cryptography expert&#8221; to do the analysis and report back to whoever CS assigned to decipher their output to human readable language and send it back.</p>
