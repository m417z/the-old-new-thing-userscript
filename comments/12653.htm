		<p>Apparently crossing through a zero vertically to avoid confusion with the letter &#39;O&#39; has a whole new level of ambiguity if you happen to live in Northern Europe&#8230;</p>

		<p>@h.attila</p>
<p>Which is why you generally just put a dot in the zero if you need to disambiguate it from letter O in Danish.</p>
<p>@Raymond</p>
<p>I&#39;m surprised there weren&#39;t any English or even German brochures about the ferries; travel-related companies over here tend to know the value of putting out at least key information in foreign languages. (Even if it might be badly mangled at times&#8230;)</p>
<div class="post">[<i>I wasn&#39;t the one who grabbed the schedule, but my guess is that all the different language schedules look sufficiently similar that unless you paid close attention you wouldn&#39;t realize that they were in different languages.

		<p>h.attila: Strangely enough, that practice has never taken hold here. We meet it mostly in the form of slashed zeroes in console fonts. But it&#39;s not a real ambiguity because (in all of the console fonts I&#39;ve met) the slash in a slashed zero stops inside the round outline, whereas the slash in a capital Ø must protude beyond the O-oval. Monospaced fonts often make it descend a bit below the baseline (and ascend above the other capitals).</p>
<p>It does give new opportunites for hexspeak. If you ever find yourself debugging a corrupted heap on a 24-bit machine you can fill the memory with 0xD0DB0F&#8230;</p>
<p>(In fact, most of the console fonts I encounter in my daily life use dotted zeroes rather than slashed ones).</p>
<p>It&#39;s a larger problem that øØ was not included in code page 437 when IBM launched the PC in 1981, despite many other special letters for Western European languages being there. Once in a while you still come across legacy systems that pass, say, customer addresses through a CP437 conversion. Then the ø&#39;s may either disappear or become Greek phis, whereas æ and å (the two other non-English letters usid in Danish and Norwegian) survive fine.</p>

		<p>I had a similar thought to Niels: when I was in Denmark, every Dane I met spoke better English than half the English I meet. They also have the common feature of being almost achingly polite. After all, that seems to have been the case with the car&#39;s owners. Wasn&#39;t there a passing streetsweeper or urchin who could have helped you translate?</p>

		<p>@DWalker59 &#8211; it did indeed and is still part of the brand name for Encyclopædia Britannica &#8211; þ ð ƿ ȝ and œ are obsolete letters which used to be in the English language.</p>

		<p>Actually, it&#39;s lördag (with diaeresis) in Swedish. Sort of the Swedish equivalent of lørdag though. If you want bonus points you should know that lördag is short för lögardagen, a very old way of saying &quot;bathing day&quot;, the day of the week you should take a bath. However, most Swedish people wash more often these days.</p>

		<p>I recently moved to Denmark and was surprised by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>almost everyone (at least in cities) speaks decent English;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it pretty easy to decipher basic written Danish (and I was told that is even simpler if you know German);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it is impossible to decipher spoken Danish :-)</p>
</li>
</ul>

		<p>Talking of coincidences, when me and my wife were in Argentina last March, one day we decided to stop for lunch in a mom-and-pop restaurant in the middle of nowhere. We met a very friendly older Canadian couple there and while chatting over the desserts, after doing the excellent steak and pasta the appropriate honors, we found out we were both going to travel to Ushuaia (deceivingly called &#39;the town at the end of the world&#39;) the following week. We also found out we were using the same airway to go there so, jokingly, they asked me what day we were going because &quot;we might be on the same flight&quot;, and I said &quot;oh, I doubt it! We depart at some ungodly hour because we had to get our tickets at the last moment and those were the last remaining cheap tickets&quot;, and the woman says &quot;oh, really? our plane departs at 5.15, I doubt you can beat *that*!&quot;. </p>
<p>To make a long story short: of the millions of people in Buenos Aires we get to know a couple, in the middle of nowhere, who are travelling in the same exact plane, and sitting on the row right in front of us. What are the chances of that happening?</p>

		<p>Perhaps this is a *trifle* naive, but didn&#39;t someone have an Internet-connected phone they could type these phrases into a translation engine? &nbsp;I realize that machine translation is not a solved problem, but wouldn&#39;t it be &quot;good enough&quot; to divine which ferry to take?</p>

		<p>I was going to say the same thing, obviously the car was full of guys because no-one stopped to ask a convenient Dane for help&#8230; even on the Autobahn, a Plattduutsch speaker at a rest stop should have been able to have a go at translating.</p>

		<p>Magnus Hult &amp; Andreas Rejbrand:</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure Raymond knows that much Swedish, i.e. that the Swedish word for that day is lördag and that the Danish word is lørdag. It isn&#39;t exactly a completely new, different, word, as, say, uhm, Saturday. So one could say that it is pretty much the same word.</p>
<p>But, of course, not all his readers know this, so it&#39;s worth mentioning.</p>

		<p>Probably the biggest coincidence that I&#39;ve heard of was when a friend from xyz.edu of mine was traveling Europe. He was in a German nightclub and started a conversation with some local girls. Naturally small talk included asking where he was from, and the conversation went something like this: &quot;So where are you from?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m from America.&quot; &quot;Oh, I know an American. Do you know Chad Abc?&quot; &quot;Actually, yes! Chad Abc is a friend of mine.&quot;</p>
<p>Then a week or so later he ran into these girls again, only in England.</p>

		<p>&quot;Cool thing about taking the train from Denmark to Germany. The Ferry sits and waits for the train. The train pulls on board the ferry, and the ferry takes off.&quot;</p>
<p>These days it seems to be more common that the ferry takes off without the train, whereupon the train arrives 5 minutes late and has to wait for the next ferry. Always add 30 minutes when planning your onwards connection!</p>
<p>It was different in the old days when the railways actually operated the ferry line. But it was sold off later, and the current management seems to consider it more important to get their motorists get across in time than to help the railways keep their timetables. (This probably makes sound business sense).</p>
