		<p>Woha! Mark this date, 28/5/2012, in your calendars. It&#39;s historical: the first time Raymond has posted a picture in his blog!</p>
<p>To stay in topic, most of what is told in this post is common sense, and it&#39;s summed up in the last paragraph: if you don&#39;t use the window manager, you can&#39;t use it (welcome to Tautology Club!). I understand there are places where windowless controls are needed (i.e.: when you have to show controls inside other application&#39;s documents, or when you can&#39;t create windows for some other reason), but I have never understood using them as primary controls, given the extra work needed for them to work (and the possible incompatibilities with accessibility software).</p>

		<p>@Antonio Rodr√≠guez, Raymond has posted several pictures to date.</p>
<p>Btw, he has hotlinked something hosted in other server. They may replace it with a Goatse. I&#39;d do it. And it would be very funny. ;)</p>

		<p>@Marcos: that&#39;s just juvenile. Replacing it with Ubuntu screenshots would be better. Actually, replacing it with screenshots of Ubuntu hosting Wordpad hosting Paint would be even better &#8212; but I don&#39;t know if Wine can make it that far yet.</p>

		<p>i guess the confusion in the documentation is that you don&#39;t give the &quot;Active in-place object&quot; first chance to translate accelerators, you give the &quot;active in-place object&quot; first chance.</p>
<p>Someone (e.g. me) might might be read documentation as , &quot;ActiveX in-place objects must always&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Active&quot; doesn&#39;t mean &quot;ActiveX/COM&quot;, it means &quot;has input focus&quot;.</p>

		<p>8 years isn&#39;t long enough :P Raymond has indeed posted pictures before: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/10/54831.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/54831.aspx</a></p>
<p>Back on topic: in-place active objects were always touted as a pretty big deal and I could see how they would be useful, but I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever truly encountered any real life situation where OLE/COM was used to truly host an application, UI and all, in another. As much as they seem useful, they also seem confusing. Are there many people who used this functionality? Or are there many, less obvious ways in which this was used? Browser plugins seem the closest to me.</p>

		<p>@Steven Damn I also couldn&#39;t remember that post, my memory is getting hazy :p</p>
<p>Wrt in-pace active objects: Doesn&#39;t word support this for excel tables? I dimly remember this, although I didn&#39;t find it ever especially useful</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve used OLE many-a-time to make small changes to Visio documents embedded in Word documents, but for real editing I reckon it&#39;s easier to launch full-blown Visio (Visio Object-&gt;Open) and then have the changes applied back to the document when exiting). ps: This language, &#39;Dylan&#39;, sounds like the way of the future :)</p>

		<p>@Steven Don</p>
<p>The biggest one that I know of is Internet Explorer. I&#39;m not talking about the ActiveX controls here, but these are examples of an inplace object and having their complete ui hosted. But Internet Explorer is one very big host around the Web Browser control. Office too supports OLE in that you can embed other Office application&#39;s document types (it has been so long since I had to do it myself since I usually only use Word for typing documentation these days). Not only that, it should be possible to embed other document types into it, like PDF.</p>
<p>As far as people using this functionality. Well, I think these days it has dropped off, but I&#39;m not sure how much support OLE had in the first place. OLE could be rather awkward to use from C++ anyway. However, there are still lots of places in Windows that relies on it.</p>
<p>Anyway, just remember that embeding could be rather seamless depending on how much work was put into the host application, so it is actually rather difficult to know exactly how many applications fully use it, but every time you see someone use the web browser control, then that is one more at least.</p>

		<p>@Steven Don</p>
<p>Thanks for linking to that other post. i&#39;m gonna at it to my mental collection of Raymond Quotes.</p>
<p>Why do some people call the taskbar the &quot;tray&quot;?</p>
<p>Because they&#39;re wrong.</p>

		<p>The problem is, the documentation that exists for OLE sometimes uses the phrase &quot;the windowless object with the keyboard focus&quot; and sometimes refers to the &quot;Active object&quot; &#8211; without ever making it explicit that the in-place-active-object is defined as the object-with-keyboard-focus.</p>

		<p>@Marcel: Raymond didn&#39;t use the standard SVG, he used VML, which is one of the deprecated non-standard technologies IE6 became infamous for.</p>

		<p>VML was originally supposed to be standard and directly competed with SVG (which was missing many things back then). Result is known&#8230; So it wasn&#39;t nonstandard technology, but was made so by W3C.</p>
