		<p>&quot;The memory manager folks tell me that locked memory remains locked even if the application is suspended. But I don&#39;t know whether that&#39;s an implementation detail or contractual, so I wouldn&#39;t run around relying on it.&quot;</p>
<p>Bet you someone wrote a program which relies on just this detail.</p>

		<p>Grzechooo: If you are locking pages, it&#39;s likely that you&#39;re doing so in order to maintain a fast response time. If your memory cache gets paged out to disk while you&#39;re sitting there waiting for a request, what is the point of having the cache in the first place?</p>
<p>In other words, probably everybody who uses VirtualLock expects that their locked pages don&#39;t get paged out while blocked.</p>

		<p>[Wait, are you saying that you have to VirtualLock all asynchronous I/O buffers? -Raymond]</p>
<p>No. If your AIO is hard real-time (e.g. CD burner), the fact that they remain locked when your threads are all waiting is vital.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Oh, I see. I thought you were talking about locking memory for asynchronous I/O requests that are currently active.

<p>[I wonder how unix debuggers work if they can&#39;t read the memory of the process being debugged. -Raymond]</p>
<p>In the intervening years, there is now a policy added to *nix systems that only allows a process to be attached by its parents (parent, grandparent, etc). For not very obvious reasons, this policy has to be turned off when running Windows programs under wine.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: &quot;For not very obvious reasons, this policy has to be turned off when running Windows programs under wine.&quot;</p>
<p>Or plenty of other common debugging scenarios. In my current work for example, I virtually always attach to existing processes from a non-parent rather than start the program under a debugger. (There are too many layers on top of the process I eventually want to debug.)</p>

		<p>Is VirtualLock safe to use for cryptographic purposes &#8211; that is, to avoid sensitive memory being written to disk?</p>
<p>In addition to that, it would be nice to have a way to tell Windows, &quot;Please decommit this memory block if this machine hibernates&quot;. You could just handle the exception if somehow you were frozen at an inopportune time.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>There does not appear to be any guarantee that the memory won&#39;t be written to disk while locked. As you noted, the machine may be hibernated, or it may be running in a VM that gets snapshotted. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@Joshua: I may be misunderstanding you, but I used gdb before to debug running processes without any problems under Linux. So do common distributions just disable that policy by default or how does that work?</p>

		<p>It seems to be contractual now, the VirtualLock manpage says that &quot;pages are guaranteed not to be written to the pagefile while they are locked&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Dave: They may still be written to the hibernation file or a VM snapshot.</p>

		<p>@Myria. No. If you care about memory being written to disk you either need it to be in non-paged kernel mode memory, or you need to remember that Bitlocker stops people who aren&#39;t logged in from reading data in your pagefile, and hence rendering the question as to whether it was written to disk completely moot.</p>
