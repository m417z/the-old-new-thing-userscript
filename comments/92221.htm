		<p>Based on the 3-in-ten-thousand who responded to that magazine card a few days ago, I suppose &quot;no-one at all tried to respond&quot; is at least as plausible as &quot;no-one at all was able to respond&quot;.</p>

		<p>I guess even if you filled the survey, you&#39;ll still receive the email. There&#39;s no constraint that any survey have to be conducted exactly once only.</p>
<p>See if there will be more email on Dec 16.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of the progressively more and more silly E-Mails I sent round my firm as we approached &quot;strong password enforcement day&quot;. And of course, plenty still ignored them!</p>

		<p>(this is many years ago so when some Internet stuff for the general public was very new). I owned the domain for my late brother&#39;s company. There was a marketing company with almost the same name (2 Ls instead of one) &#8211; and they did a major marketing campaign with the web form set up to send things to the wrong domain i.e. mine. IIRC correctly I sent an email and didn&#39;t get any response so I found out the name of the MD and phoned him up. He was very exasperated with his staff. </p>

		<p>Our place has away days (essentially team building days, but mostly full of boring speeches) and your emails remind me of the ones they sent around for that, though not for exactly the same reason. We had a string of &quot;this is a mandatory staff activity, all staff are required to attend&quot; and then eventually &quot;we have filled up all the places, apologies to any staff who hadn&#39;t yet confirmed their attendance&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Benjy</p>
<p>I bet &quot;strong password enforcement&quot; decreased security measurably across the entire company, too.</p>
<p>Now everyone just uses !p4ssword as their password, instead of mary100179spotnewjersey</p>
<p>Which is why smart people don&#39;t send those emails in the first place.</p>

		<p>@Kemp</p>
<p>&quot;This is a mandatory activity. Sign up by COB X/Y/ZZZZ&quot;</p>
<p>COB X/Y/ZZZZ:</p>
<p>&quot;Any staff who haven&#39;t yet confirmed their attendance should clean out their desks by the end of the day tomorrow.&quot;</p>

		<p>Doing the survey won&#39;t save you from getting all the subsequent reminders. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>@Kemp: Weird: &quot;We had a string of &quot;this is a mandatory staff activity, all staff are required to attend&quot; and then eventually &quot;we have filled up all the places, apologies to any staff who hadn&#39;t yet confirmed their attendance&quot;.&quot;</p>
<p>Which means 1) that the company can&#39;t count, and 2) if you don&#39;t want to attend, you are rewarded for not confirming your attendance!</p>
