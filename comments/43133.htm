		<p>&quot;What&#39;s more, since the Value class has an odd number of total bytes, if you create an array of Values, you are guaranteed that three quarters of the elements will be misaligned.&quot;</p>
<p>Won&#39;t all Values be equally aligned? I thought struct/class values were padded/aligned to at least 4 byte boundaries? Doesn&#39;t that result in the following</p>
<p> &nbsp;struct s {</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;float f;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;char c;</p>
<p> &nbsp;};</p>
<p> &nbsp;struct s a[4];</p>
<p>causing misaligned float access on a[1].f &#8211; a[3].f?</p>

		<p>@Karellen: A struct has the alignment of the member with the highest alignment requirement. In your example, the float member pushes the alignment for the entire struct to a multiple of sizeof(float) == 4. If the struct contains a double, the struct will get sizeof(double) == 8 alignment, etc.</p>

		<p>Besides what Anonymous noted (SetType already pages in the Value):</p>
<p>For a page fault to occur, Value needs to be paged out. Assuming the system isn&#39;t trashing from external load (that would cause everything to suffer about uniformly, not just the SetInt32 call), that means some other part of CalculateTheValue causes a page fault that discards Value&#39;s page.</p>
<p>Thus, if I&#39;m not mistaken, at most 50% can be spend on a page fault for SetInt32.</p>

		<p>&gt; In Windows, the decision how to respond to the alignment exception depends on whether the process asked for alignment faults to be forgiven.</p>
<p>I wanted to see if my application was experiencing any alignment faults (in the same way i would use Application Verifier to check for other issues, i wanted to test disabling Window&#39;s built-in fixups when it catches the `EXCEPTION_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT` exception). So the question became how do i opt-out of Window&#39;s fixups of alignment faults. </p>
<p>I consulted the MSDN page &quot;Windows Data Alignment on IPF, x86, and x64&quot;.</p>
<p>It seems that there is no way to opt-out of Windows performing alignment fixups for 32-bit processes:</p>
<p>&gt; On the x86 architecture, the operating system does not make the alignment fault visible to the application. On these two platforms, you will also suffer performance degradation on the alignment fault, but it will be significantly less severe than on the Itanium, because the hardware will make the multiple accesses of memory to retrieve the unaligned data.</p>
<p>For 64-bit processes, alignment errors are fixed up by the hardware, but MSDN mentions a way to change it:</p>
<p>&gt; On the x64 architecture, the alignment exceptions are disabled by default, and the fix-ups are done by the hardware. The application can enable alignment exceptions by setting a couple of register bits, in which case the exceptions will be raised unless the user has the operating system mask the exceptions with SEM_NOALIGNMENTFAULTEXCEPT. (For details, see the AMD Architecture Programmer&#39;s Manual Volume 2: System Programming.)</p>
<p>Bit 18 of RFLAGS (Alignment Check) controls throwing of exceptions. Using PUSHFQ/POPFQ (the 64-bit RFLAGS version of PUSHFD/POPFD for EFLAGS) allows changing the bits, but it doesn&#39;t seem to have any effect.</p>
<p>The documentation of SetErrorMode and SEM_NOALIGNMENTFAULTEXCEPT say that the option is always on for x86/x64, and only has an effect for Itanium.</p>
<p>So I asked the question on Stackoverflow &quot;How to enable alignment exceptions for my process on x64?&quot; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26919269">stackoverflow.com/&#8230;/26919269</a>).</p>
<p>The general consensus is that there is no way for a user-mode x86 or x64 process to be able to experience EXCEPTION_DATATYPE_MISALIGNMENT exceptions. </p>
<p>Bonus Reading. Larry Osterman once said:</p>
<p>&gt; We actually built a version of NT with alignment exceptions turned on for x86 (you can do that as Skywing mentioned). We quickly turned it off, because of the number of apps that broke :)</p>

		<p>@IanBoyd: Fascinating, thanks for posting that! &nbsp;I suppose you already know this as well, but for anyone else who doesn&#39;t: You can at least view the total number of alignment faults the system is fixing up by viewing the SystemAlignment Fixups/sec performance counter in perfmon.</p>

		<p>@Anonymous: true. Furthermore, the stack has been just touched a few bytes away when setting the stack frame, and in the object itself when getting the vtable pointer. All three accesses are a few bytes away from each other, so they probably are in the same page. And it&#39;s extremely unlikely for a page with three recent accesses to be swapped out.</p>

		<p>Damien: I suppose I ought to be helpful rather than just sarcastic, sorry. In case you&#39;re not aware, ranges in C and especially C++ are usually specified as a pointer to the first element and a pointer to one past the final element. This works out surprisingly better than pointers to the first and last elements for a number of reasons, especially in how confusing representing a zero-length range would be. For this reason, when you declare an array in C (and C++) the standard specifically guarantees that you&#39;re allowed to set a pointer to one past the last element (but not dereference it).</p>

		<p>My first task after graduating from college was using C++ to write a compiler for a custom programming language. &nbsp;My code was completely littered with these types of casts (except I used C-Style instead of reinterpret_cast* with nary a care for alignment. &nbsp;Fortunately the target architecture was a MIPS platform that didn&#39;t like unaligned access, so I suspect in most cases I didn&#39;t have a major performance issue.</p>
<p>*After supporting that compiler for 10 years, I deeply regretted using C-Style casts due to several cases where I accidentally cast away a const and then trying to deal with &quot;impossible&quot; changes to variables </p>

		<p>@Antonio: There is no vtable. The class is not derived, and lack of a virtual d&#39;tor inhibits that it will (should) be derived from. The type is always known at compiletime, and no vtable indirection is required or generated by the compiler. However, as you note, since the stack has just been touched, and all objects used in the assignment are on the stack. This does make it extremely unlikely for this part of the stack to get paged out.</p>

		<p>In addition to be super-costly, misaligned accesses also turn atomic fetch and store operations into non-atomic ones, in particular in the software-based workaround case. This may have serious implications regarding correctness, or at the very last add to the total cost (lock) and introduce a machine-wide bottleneck in a very insidious way&#8230; Additionally, I wonder how well InterlockedIncrement et al. would work when force-fed with an unaligned pointer?</p>

		<p>This is an excellent example of where old-school knowing-how-things-actually-work has important practical application to contemporary HLL programming. Time was when every programmer learned about alignment as part-and-parcel of learning to program or, at worstt, early in his first project. </p>
<p>On the other hand, I&#39;d expect any compiler worth its salt to default to aligned data, &nbsp;and unaligned to be the exception&#8211;not the other way around, simply because that&#39;s the right/sane thing to do, from the sensible-engineering point of view: it would make for fewer errors/crashes, with less programmer effort, overall. &nbsp;A basic principle of engineering is that buggy systems should &quot;fail safe,&quot; and if your description is correct these compilers are implemented backwards in that respect. </p>
<p>The fact that &quot;the compiler isn&#39;t constrained to [do this]&quot; is no excuse; AT BEST that&#39;s a bug in the specs/standards themselves, period. </p>

		<p>Chris Chiesa: I don&#39;t see a problem with the compiler. The user is using a char array which gets 1-byte aligned. Are you saying that the compiler should detect that the user is at some point reinterpreting the chars as ints and change the alignment of the struct? What alignment should the compiler choose? Or are you saying that all char arrays should have more coarse alignment?</p>
<p>I&#39;m curious how you think the specs/standards could be improved in this respect.</p>

		<p>@Chris Chiesa: I would agree with your observation, that this is an excellent example where under-the-hood knowledge is applicable to HLL programming. I do not agree with your conclusion, though: Compilers should not make up for programmer mistakes. The solution is given in the article: &quot;[&#8230;] Use a discriminated union. That is, after all, what you are trying to emulate in the first place.&quot;</p>
