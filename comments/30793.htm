  Clearly, something is going wrong when<br />
  <br />&gt; Explorer attempts the second DDE conversation<br />
  <br />&gt; to open the document.</p>
<p>OK, I&#8217;ll accept that this much is clear to a programmer with a<br />
  moderate amount of psychic powers and a moderate understanding of DDE.<br />
  &nbsp;But let&#8217;s rewind a bit.</p>
<p>&gt; you get the error message &#8220;Windows cannot<br />
  <br />&gt; find &#8216;abc.lit&#8217;. Make sure you typed the name<br />
  <br />&gt; correctly, and then try again.&#8221;</p>
<p>With a maybe moderate or maybe lesser amount of psychic powers and<br />
  maybe with or without moderate understandings of what Windows might be<br />
  thinking at various times, I&#8217;ve had enough experiences with Windows<br />
  saying that Windows can&#8217;t find files that explorer is showing me, and<br />
  have had Windows tell me to make sure I typed a double-click correctly.<br />
  &nbsp;I am well aware of my frequent typos, but I know how to<br />
  distinguish whether I typed a name correctly or not from whether<br />
  Windows blames my typing for Windows&#8217; inability to find what I<br />
  double-clicked on. &nbsp;And you complain about my cynicism.</p>
<p>No, I do not think my psychic powers are enough to debug this kind<br />
  of bug from the kind of s*it messages that Windows displays. &nbsp;And<br />
  you complain about my cynicism. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t you think there&#8217;s just a<br />
  wee possibility that this error message from Windows leaves something<br />
  to be desired?</p>

  It so happens that the numerical value -1<br />

<p>Yup. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s what MSDN says:</p>
<p>&gt; To initiate a Dynamic Data Exchange (DDE)<br />
  <br />&gt; conversation, the client sends a<br />
  <br />&gt; WM_DDE_INITIATE message. Usually, the client<br />
  <br />&gt; broadcasts this message by calling<br />
  <br />&gt; SendMessage, with &#194;â€“1 as the first parameter.</p>

<p>So you really really think that the ultra-ungeeky &#8220;Windows cannot<br />
  find &#8216;abc.lit&#8217;. Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try<br />
  again&#8221; makes people say &#8220;Computers are easy to use! &nbsp;I just<br />
  mistyped my double-click, and I&#8217;d better learn to type my double-clicks<br />
  without misspelling!&#8221;? &nbsp;And when people do correct the<br />
  misspellings of their double-clicks, Windows starts working and people<br />
  find Windows easy to use?</p>
<p>I do think &#8220;The program responsible for opening this document was<br />
  run, but it did not accept the document&#8221; would be better than your<br />
  favourite wording. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t think it would make computers easier<br />

<p>You&#8217;re welcome. &nbsp;An error message from Windows wouldn&#8217;t be<br />
  complete without an insult, which is why I figured out why your<br />
  objection to your hypothetical proposed message was really such a valid<br />
  objection.</p>
<p>By the way, remember how many times you&#8217;ve complained about people<br />
  blaming Windows when the fault is really an application or driver or<br />
  whatever? &nbsp;Well here&#8217;s Windows TELLING people to blame Windows<br />
  (&#8220;Windows cannot find &#8216;abc.lit'&#8221;) even when you&#8217;ve diagnosed that the<br />
  application is at fault, and you want Windows to continue persuading<br />
  people to blame Windows. &nbsp;Plus Windows is going to continue with<br />
  its insulting &#8220;Make sure you typed the name correctly, and then try<br />
  again.&#8221; &nbsp;When people meet you at parties and say they hate you,<br />
  it&#8217;s not because I asked them to, it&#8217;s because your company asked them<br />
  to, and here you are supporting your company&#8217;s production of these<br />
  insults.</p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>I didn&#8217;t say it was a good error message. But the alternative wasn&#8217;t very good either. The real problem is that the ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND lost its context. When generated, its context was the DDE target window that couldn&#8217;t be found, but when the error percolated out to the caller of ShellExecute, it got interpreted as referring to the file being launched. Yes, it sucks. But suckage is not the same as insulting. -Raymond</i>]</div>

<p>OK, I agree and maybe others will too. &nbsp;Nonetheless the alternative is tons better than the actual message.</p>
<p>&gt; The real problem is that the<br />
  <br />&gt; ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND lost its context.</p>
<p>Actually for some reason my psychic powers weren&#8217;t enough to guess that the failure to find a window resulted in the error leaking out this way. &nbsp;I do see now that this might not be easy to fix.</p>
<p>&gt; But suckage is not the same as insulting.</p>
<p>True. &nbsp;Windows&#8217;s instruction to a double-clicker to check their typing is both sucky and insulting, and the reason isn&#8217;t because suckage is the same as insulting (they&#8217;re not the same), the reason is simply because that instruction is both. &nbsp;Some of us get used to these insults when we&#8217;ve seen them for 10 years, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that new users will be less insulted by them. &nbsp;I do see that a fix might not be easy, and for the foreseeable future you can&#8217;t avoid teaching new users to hate Microsoft. &nbsp;I can&#8217;t help it either, sorry.

<p>Raymond, the problem people have with this message is that what Windows is saying at the moment is just confusing. &nbsp;The file &#8216;abc.lit&#8217; clearly exists, the user will say, it&#8217;s right here. &nbsp;Why can&#8217;t Windows find it?</p>
<p>Windows should definitely distinguish the case that the document can&#8217;t be found and its associated application can&#8217;t. &nbsp;Perhaps &quot;Windows was unable to open &#8216;abc.lit&#8217; because of an application error.&quot; or something similar. &nbsp;It doesn&#8217;t have to be complicated, it just has to represent the truth of what happened, rather than the current message which is blatantly misleading and is likely to have the user barking up the wrong tree for ages trying to figure out what&#8217;s wrong.</p>
<p>This is one of the problems a lot of people have with Windows: it spends too much time trying to protect the user and not enough making sure they have enough information to fix whatever&#8217;s wrong. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Error messages that say one thing&#8217;s wrong when it&#8217;s actually something entirely different that&#8217;s wrong don&#8217;t help anyone. &nbsp;It would be as useful to pop up a box that says, &quot;I&#8217;m sorry, I can&#8217;t do that Dave&quot; or something.<br /></p>

		<p>&lt;i&gt;True. &nbsp;Windows&#8217;s instruction to a double-clicker to check their typing is both sucky and insulting, and the reason isn&#8217;t because suckage is the same as insulting (they&#8217;re not the same), the reason is simply because that instruction is both. &nbsp;Some of us get used to these insults when we&#8217;ve seen them for 10 years, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that new users will be less insulted by them.&lt;/i&gt;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m reminded of my work colleague who, once every couple of weeks or so, yells at the top of his voice, &quot;No! I didn&#8217;t forget my ****ing password!&quot;. &nbsp;The XP &quot;Welcome&quot; screen isn&#8217;t just insulting, it&#8217;s condescending.<br /></p>

<br />&gt; What step should I follow, as a user, to fix<br />
<br />&gt; this error?</p>
<p>Complain to the maker of the application?</p>
<p>Historically some makers occasionally fixed bugs when informed about them, though that&#8217;s rare today.</p>
<p>Some makers still don&#8217;t require upfront fees before letting victims complain about bugs.</p>
<p>Maybe the user can also discover that in the future they wish to buy a competing application instead of the buggy application. &nbsp;If the buggy application doesn&#8217;t come from a monopoly, they might even have the power to follow through on this wish.</p>
<p>Maybe eventually people will stop blaming Windows when the bug belongs to an application. &nbsp;There&#8217;s a long row to hoe before this message can sink in, but every journey starts with a single step. &nbsp;Hypothetically this could be such a step.</p>

		<p>I totally agree with Norman. As long as bugs aren&#8217;t revealed correctly, users don&#8217;t learn who&#8217;s really at fault and vendors don&#8217;t feel they need to fix things.</p>
<p>Raymond, I&#8217;ve heard programmers argue against fixing something because they think the user will blame Windows! I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve submitted website bug reports, only to be told by a 1st-level tech support weenie that I should upgrade IE, or update Windows, or go read some MS KB. Even after I tell them I&#8217;ve done all those things!</p>
<p>Remember that long Samba bug discussion&#8230; make the users pissed at Linksys or Netgear or whoever sold them the box &#8211; that&#8217;s the only way to make the vendor fix things.<br /></p>

<p>The KB article is more often never read before than already read, however.</p>
<p>And yes, the NAS manufactor is the only that can be blamed for not updating Samba.</p>
