		<p>&quot;It says it has lifetime warranty, how do you mean?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Plain and simple: you break it, we kill you&quot;</p>

		<p>You know I haven&#8217;t had a land line in well over 10 years. At first it was difficult, go to get a car loan and they want your land line not your cell number. You try explaining to them that you do not need a land line your a computer programmer you travel and are never home if they wanted to call you then cell was the best. I did get a land line 5 years ago for 1 month because they required it to hook up DSL, another fallacy, because after they hooked up DSL I called and canceled the phone service. If your wondering I had AT&amp;T cable television then, which didn&#8217;t do cable modems, because they pushed their DSL service. Anyway I seriously have trouble even envisioning why anyone would have a land line in 50 years. Corporations going VOIP, fiber to the house and so on.</p>

		<p>Presumably these definitions are in place to spare them the expense of buying an annuity in case of extreme long life. &nbsp;With a defined cutoff, they can put it on their own balance sheet and amortize it over time.</p>

		<p>You understand of course that dial up for AOL simply won&#8217;t just disappear, it&#8217;ll be bought by someone else. &nbsp;I think there was something on BetaNews about this (yes, not the most reliable source of news, I know)</p>

		<p>That contest sounds like the &quot;Free Gas for Life*&quot; contest that&#8217;s being advertised around here.</p>

		<p>I have heard of people here (in the UK) who have cancelled phone service and their ADSL (on BT Wholesale DSLAMs, not necessarily with BT Retail as the ISP) kept working, but I&#8217;m pretty sure this is a mistake by BT, and they normally don&#8217;t let you have ADSL unless you also have phone service.</p>
<p>I can see no reason why you shouldn&#8217;t be able to have ADSL from an LLU provider, but in practice they all seem to require that you either have phone service from BT or that you unbundle your phone service to them as well. ADSL only still doesn&#8217;t seem to be an option.</p>
<p>I do actually use my landline occasionally, for two reasons. Firstly, to call 0800 (supposedly free) and 0845 (supposedly cheap) numbers, which are comparatively expensive on mobiles. Secondly, it&#8217;s expensive to call to mobiles so for the few people like my parents who I might actually have a long conversation with I give them my landline number.</p>

		<p>You can buy ADSL on its own in the UK, but the people who sell it (e.g. A&amp;A) are all telecoms providers aimed at businesses, and so their prices are higher (service is better too) &#8211; you won&#8217;t save any money.</p>
<p>If you think about it that makes sense. BT&#8217;s line rental covers the (by no means trivial) cost of actually maintaining the final mile copper and assorted infrastructure. So a provider that doesn&#8217;t make you buy a BT line has to pay BT&#8217;s engineers for this same service anyway or else hire all their own engineers at each location they serve.</p>
<p>The core costs are network infrastructure and the final mile. The final mile cost is fixed, because it consists of trained men in the rain and cold rewiring things in coffins under the street or climbing up poles and trying to make stuff work. If you cut that budget, the service becomes unreliable. The network infrastructure cost is determined by peak load on the network, which explains why &quot;unlimited usage&quot; plans have the same bogus small print as &quot;lifetime&quot; offers. Every customer making above average use is costing the provider money and making service worse for the other users.</p>

		<p>Oh, and 0845 and 0870 numbers haven&#8217;t been cheap for years. They&#8217;re pinned to the &quot;standard&quot; local and national UK rate for calls, but no-one pays standard rate any more due to discounts. Once upon a time 0845 numbers came at a premium to cover the lost revenue compared to a national call, but today&#8217;s telcos actually /pay you/ to run an 0845 number because they make so much money at the &quot;standard&quot; rate.</p>
<p>The watchdog has been slowly working out a plan to get rid of all 08 prefixes except 0800 &#8211; in favour of new pseudo-geographic numbers. These numbers (prefix 03) are already available and will have to be treated like ordinary geographic (01 02) numbers by providers e.g. for discount and billing purposes, but like 08 series numbers they won&#8217;t have an area code and will be portable across the entire network.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a web site saynoto0870.com which can tell you an ordinary geographic number that will connect the same call cheaper (and from your mobile too). Not every number has a geographic equivalent but most do because you can&#8217;t call 08 series numbers from outside the UK normally, so customers abroad need a number.</p>

		<p>aol simply disables the dial-up service without notice. If any customer complains loudly enough they put a dialup service online for a few months and tries to disables it again later. Some time the customer stops complaining because he gets tired.</p>
