		<p>Speaking as a part-owner of a company that specialises in web content management software, I can only say one thing: if only our customers would realise this, instead of expecting us to fix <em>all</em> of their problems, life would be so much easier.</p>

		<p>I must disagree to some extent. Back in the day I&#8217;d fire up vi to edit a page on my server. Of course I really never had much to say. But I had a server and could use vi.</p>
<p>But look what happened when blog software appeared? Suddenly people who did have something to say had an easy way to say it. </p>
<div class=post>[<i>That&#8217;s my point. You have a &#8220;they&#8221; (people who had something to say). If there is no &#8220;they&#8221;, then building a system for &#8220;them&#8221; won&#8217;t accomplish anything. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Excellent point. &nbsp;Good content in a reasonably accessable way will get you lots of readers. &nbsp;(Some big company has content that&#8217;s not easily accessible&#8211;and it&#8217;s a selling point for their service.)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve heard some managers or the like say that &quot;all we need to do is create a wiki, and all our in-house tools will be documented.&quot; Same principle, I suspect. Good content won&#8217;t magically happen, even if barriers to creating it lessen.</p>

		<p>Good points, and good pair of posts. If only more managers from all lines of business paid attention to such advice.</p>
<p>I would like to point out, however, that in the example situation described there is a deficient process and unpublished content. The trick lies in identifying existing processes and infrastructure that would serve the purpose.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to scoff at the buzzwords, but it&#8217;s not like &quot;processes&quot; and &quot;infrastructure&quot; are inherantly useless. These words have attained the status they have by meaning something useful.</p>

		<p>Good one, Nathan! &nbsp;</p>
<p>Creating an in-house wiki doesn&#8217;t cause documentation to happen unless somebody actually has time (or has been ordered to magically find time) to write documentation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d imagine that, when faced with getting Project X done or having the engineers tied up trying to document Project X (or explain Project X well enough so it can be documented by somebody else), most managers will favor finishing the project and forget about documentation until somebody raises a fuss.</p>

		<p>Thanks Raymond. My CTO needs to read this so much that I will have to forward it anonymously.</p>

		<p>+1 to Nathan.</p>
<p>Just a couple of days ago I found a technical documentation page on a corporate wiki which said, in its entirety, &quot;I don&#8217;t really understand this. Maybe somebody else could edit this page and add some useful information?&quot; :-)</p>

		<p>[You have a &quot;they&quot; (people who had something to say).]</p>
<p>Ah, now the title makes more sense. &nbsp;I was thinking you meant that &quot;they&quot; were the people that would read the content that got put into whatever process. &nbsp;You meant the people that would create the content.</p>
<p>It makes sense the way you put it (where &quot;they&quot; is the people that create the content); it&#8217;s just not what I expected when I heard the saying. &nbsp;But I get it now. &nbsp;:-)</p>

		<p>Seems to me this is too often a chicken or egg thing. &nbsp;Rush to build a site to display content that isn&#8217;t available anyway or rush to hack together a site to display content that&#8217;s been ready and waiting with no means of sharing it.</p>

		<p>There is one good reason to build (as a company) a site for your users to exchange content. That sign is that your users are trying to do so themselves.</p>
<p>If they&#8217;re good developers, skip the first steps of your own internal plans and just hire those guys outright. If not, but they still manage to build a community, at least buy their community and give them some official status.</p>

		<p>As far as the build a tool thing goes, you can always make a display widget that shows whether any high priority bugs are open on the operational bug DB (assuming you have one). I favor automatic solutions like this one &#8211; low maintenance and allows people to see when something is busted.</p>
