		<p>@Raymond Unrelated questions:</p>
<p>1. Will you be at //Build 2014? If so can I find you and get you to sign a copy of your Book?</p>
<p>2. What is your favorite season of the Simpsons? Favorite Episode?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>I don&#39;t know whether I will be at //build 2014, but assume I won&#39;t. (I don&#39;t expect to be selected to attend.) I stopped watching The Simpsons so long ago I don&#39;t even remember what episodes I liked most. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@Raymond</p>
<p>You may have answered this in the past, but how do you remember your dreams with such clarity? Do you have a very regular sleep pattern? Do you plan to catalogue your dreams in this way, keep pen and paper near the bed (or surface pro 2 ;-) )? Have you always remembered dreams or did you make a conscious decision to learn a technique? Any tips for someone who can never remember a dream? Sorry for all the questions, feel free to ignore any and all!</p>
<div class="post">[<em>As soon as you realize that you are awake, start recapping the dream in your head as fast as you can. If you get stuck on a scene, just skip it and go on to the next scene. Dreams fade from memory within seconds, so you need to grab as much information while it&#39;s still there. I didn&#39;t study any particular technique. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Thanks for the response Raymond I&#39;ll still bring along my book on the oft chance you are selected! You are a bit of a personal hero, and I enjoy your blog.</p>
<p>I asked because as I was looking at an older episode capsule I was surprised to see &nbsp;&quot;Raymond Chen&quot; credited, and wondered if it was the same Raymond!</p>
