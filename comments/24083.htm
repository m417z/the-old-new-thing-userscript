		<p>&quot;In the story, c|net comes off looking good, standing their ethical ground against marketers looking for an endorsement.&quot;</p>
<p>Which is terribly ironic seeing as they&#8217;ve just fired their editor-in-chief of the Gamespot division for daring to give a bad review to the game that had advertising plastered all over the site. (c|net maintains that he was fired for &#8216;concerns about tone&#8217;, even though the timking is suspicious and his staff are all making noises suggesting that the rumours surrounding the reason for his departure are true.)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not sure marketers drool over getting on every list, I know of atleast one I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d prefer to not be on:</p>

<p>You have to wonder if Duke Nukem Forever isn&#8217;t just an elaborate joke like History of the World Part II.</p>

		<p>Wait until a toy with a rabid fanbase gets onto the #1 of the top-10 toys.</p>
<p>Yes, I&#8217;m talking about Transformers, which is big this year (no doubt due to the $700M grossing film (box office, world wide)). #1 is an expensive toy to get a kid (Transformers Ultimate Bumblebee), which nudged out the Nintendo Wii (now #2).</p>
<p>End result is that said toy is now ultra-hard to find everywhere except eBay. For a toyline that already suffers from scalping and such, it &nbsp;just makes it all that much harder to buy (especially since both adults *and* kids want it).</p>
<p>Honestly, I&#8217;ve seen a few, then the instant I saw the list come out, they disappear pretty darned quick.</p>
<p>So besides being the company&#8217;s best dream to get on these lists, it apparently is also the scalper&#8217;s dream list as well&#8230;</p>

<p>nah, HOTW2 wasn&#8217;t all that elaborate, although I <em>did</em> like the spaceballs flamethrower (kid at heart)</p>
