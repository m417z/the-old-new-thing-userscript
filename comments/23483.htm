		<p>I&#8217;m glad to know that such people don&#8217;t just hang around the movie theaters. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I probably would have said something mocking in return, like &quot;what&#8217;s he doing with that stick?&quot; or &quot;really, how many instruments do they even need?&quot;</p>

		<p>What I find is that it&#8217;s usually older and/or partially-deaf people doing this. &nbsp;They just have no clue that everyone else can hear their &#8216;whispers&#8217;</p>
<p>Same thing applies with teens, cellphones &amp; movies. :-(</p>

		<p>Im not sure what is worse. In Dallas, going to events at the symphony or opera is like a trip to to a tuberculosis ward. The constant coughing and hacking really ruins the event. I suggested they have a &quot;pulminary disease night&quot; on thursdays, but they did not think that would go over too well.</p>

		<p>one of my dream is listing a live interpretation of The first Concerto for Piano and orquest of Liszt .</p>
<p>If anyone made some comment like &#8216;the music is loud&#8217; , i will start kicking some rude ass</p>

		<p>I went to a rock show. The people in front of us were taking turns looking through binoculars. We couldn&#8217;t see through their arms. The stage was clearly visible. It was weird.</p>

		<p>Civility even at a world-class orchestra performance seems to be on the decline, along with civility in many other areas. Were these people wearing worn flannel shirts and jeans &#8212; which I&#8217;ve seen at these performances also? No need to wear long black dresses and tuxedoes like the orchestra members &#8212; but decent clothes, say at least business casual level? These would go along with decent manners &#8212; say business casual level also?</p>
<p>On the inane explanation &#8212; conductors are usually more animated during fast passages; the speed of the conductor&#8217;s motion is to guide the beat rather than the volume. Some loud passages such as the conclusion of the Overture to Tannhauser are also fairly slow and majestic, and I would expect the conductor to make large, expressive but slow movements to guide the players to both the expected volume and speed.</p>

		<p>I was at that Simon Rattle Prom! (Not the Firebird but the Rite of Spring). Not only did he stop the piece, but gave the person responsible &#8211; who was sitting in the most expensive seats &#8211; a loud telling-off. Very funny.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the talkative bunch would like to attend a performance of Tchaikovsky, especially the one where they use a cannon. &nbsp;Just add some grapeshot and aim appropriately&#8230;</p>

		<p>My latest movie gripe isn&#8217;t the guy who talks during the movie, but the guy who can&#8217;t put his cell phone away for even a millisecond.</p>
<p>Yes, guy, we realize you&#8217;re not making noise, and therefore you think it&#8217;s Ok. But what you do not, apparently, realize is that the backlight on your mobile communications device is something like 4-5 times brighter and closer than the movie screen, and thus draws the eyes of EVERYBODY BEHIND YOU!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re not going to pay attention to the movie, just leave. How hard is that? Cripes.</p>

		<p>The solution to this type of thing in regards to movie theaters is the home theater. &nbsp;(These days a good home theater can beat the quality of the typical poorly-maintained movie theater.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder what the comparable solution would be for concerts. &nbsp;CDs seem to miss too much.</p>

		<p>I think you misspelled &quot;ruining commentary&quot; there :P</p>
<p>I have had many experiences where people &quot;over-sing&quot; the performers at a concert, while not being able to keep a decent note.</p>

		<p>I definitely would have given them the extended turn around + stare. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You know what my favorite thing about going to the symphony is? &nbsp;Every damn performance <em>has</em> to get a standing ovation. &nbsp;Its the default reaction (accompanied by the shouts of &quot;Bravo&quot;) no matter how well it went.</p>
<p>I was just glad, when I saw Yundi Li debut with the Indianapolis Symphony a couple weekend ago, that the audience knew enough not to clap between movements. &nbsp;Even inter-movement silence hard to come by at most performances these days.</p>
<p>At any rate Li WAS AWESOME!</p>

		<p>Reading this post and comments remembered me of an interesting post by Patti LuPone about her experience doing &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; on Broadway:</p>
<p>&quot;&#8230; One guy popping peanuts in his mouth without missing a beat&#8230; from the top of the second act to &quot;By The Sea.&quot; That&#8217;s a good 15 minutes. He didn&#8217;t miss his mouth and I never saw him chew&#8230; Why would you spend a hundred bucks to eat in the theatre?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>The other guy pulled out a bottle of Bud and was swigging it during the second act. He was drunk in the curtain call and made Michael Cerveris high five him. I felt like &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot; had become some sort of sporting event. In the curtain call I told him to remember to take his bottle with him.&quot;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m with you on the standing ovations Patrick. Even worse is when they seem to race to be the first person to clap and stand up. I recently saw one guy stand up on his own half way through a performanc &#8211; his poor wife was holding her head in shame.</p>

		<p>As Sartre said: &quot;L&#8217;enfer c&#8217;est les autres&quot;</p>

		<p>I remember the effort it took as a kid, not to cough during performances. &nbsp;Lots of people don&#8217;t even try to stop coughing. &nbsp;And then, what&#8217;s worse, they take out and unwrap cough drops!! &nbsp;I can&#8217;t adequately say how mad that makes me. &nbsp;If you know you&#8217;ll need it, get it out before the music starts!! &nbsp;I&#8217;m a musician, and I know precisely how much work it takes to put such a concert together. &nbsp;It&#8217;s disrespectful to the musicians, and to those in the audience who actually want to hear the music. &nbsp;The worst ever, though, was a concert I played in where a woman answered her cell phone when it rang, and then said, &quot;I can&#8217;t talk, I can&#8217;t talk, I&#8217;m in a concert!&quot; several times before hanging up. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t get why people can&#8217;t seem to think of others, no matter their age or circumstance.</p>

		<p>@Nawak: Sartre said &quot;Hell is other people&quot;, but then most of the other people he knew WERE French, after all. &nbsp;(Not my comment; I read it from an Englishman, so it&#8217;s exempt from racial vilification laws because hating the French is the English national pastime.)</p>

		<p>@Mary: I sang in a choral concert where one of the choir members took out cough lozenges during one of the quiet bits. &nbsp;It was boggling; she was an alto, too, and they&#8217;re usually so sensible (and cute &#8211; she wasn&#8217;t that either).</p>

		<p>A couple of years ago during the Henry Wood Promenade concerts in London, Sir Simon Rattle restarted a performance of Stravinsky&#8217;s Firebird after a mobile phone went off in the audience during the introductory bassoon solo.</p>
<p>The audiences for the proms are usually *very* well behaved, and I think the person responsible for this incident would have been suitably humiliated.</p>
<p>But I think it is perfectly fair if someone near you is disturbing the performance to lean over and ask them to be quiet or to leave.</p>

		<p>This is where it helps if you look somewhat intimidating. A friend of mine (father of two young kids, very nice guy) who happens to be built like something from the WWF once silenced an annoyingly and persistently loud stoned girl behind him at a concert by turning to her BF, saying &quot;Muzzle the bitch!&quot;, and turning around again. Instant silence :-).</p>

		<p>And the verbal guide didn&#8217;t even get it right. &nbsp;I&#8217;m fairly certain the music got louder because the conductor was more animated, not the other way around. &nbsp;Hence the title, conductor.</p>

		<p>During a televised snooker match, a mobile phone went off in the audience. The referee turned towards the culprit and said:</p>

		<p>&quot;Same thing applies with teens&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>Sadly, a lot of teens are as deaf as 70 year olds: they have been ruining their hearing with loud stereos, rock concerts (which typically cause permananent damage within 15 minutes without ear protection) and MP3 players.</p>
<p>&quot;&#8230;but the guy who can&#8217;t put his cell phone away for even a millisecond.&quot;</p>
<p>I am having this trouble with Taxi drivers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Not content with the danger of merely talking while driving (illegal as well as dangerous): I have had to seize a mobile phone from one of these &quot;professional&quot; drivers for attempting to &quot;text message&quot; with both hands off the wheel on a freeway at 100kmph. &nbsp;I guess it &quot;wouldn&#8217;t kill them&quot; to wait until they were between fares&#8230;</p>

<p>They won&#8217;t mind me driving a six inch nail in one ear and out the other, then.</p>

		<p>This post is spot on for classical concerts anywhere. It even seems to me, the better the concert, the worse it gets. Maybe that&#8217;s because people with hardly any interest in the music will only go to the famous performances.</p>
<p>About the deaf teens: in the 70s a lot of countries made up regulations about music volume, because it was getting out of hand. There&#8217;s a large chance that anyone attending a concert before these regulations were implemented suffered more hearing loss.</p>
<p>Especially Deep Purple and Van Halen fans I guess.</p>

		<p>My favorite audience member was the woman who sat in front of me at the opera. She was wearing sandals, and during the interval she picked her toes. Very edifying.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s any comfort, things are probably a lot better now than they were a century or two ago, when performances were often treated as background music for the party going on in the audience.</p>

		<p>I went to see the premiere of Tomb Raider and since I am short-sighted I sat in the middle of a front row.</p>
<p>On my left there was a moron who answered a cell-phone call and talked for at least two minutes (and loud!) &#8212; luckily he stopped because I was on my way to take his cell-phone and smash it into the wall.</p>
<p>On the right there were an older man and a girl (perhaps his daughter or niece or who knows perhaps the girlfriend?) &#8212; she was telling him in advance what will happen in the next scene!!! She was so loud that I couldn&#8217;t ignore and politely asked him to shut her up.</p>
<p>He said that if I don&#8217;t like it I can sit elsewhere and I said &quot;No way, I am short-sighted and I stay here and your bitch either shuts up or you both move your ass to the last row and then keep talking as much as you want&quot;.</p>
<p>He was so pissed off because I didn&#8217;t leave and he sat there for a minute while she was still quacking and then much to my surprise he turned to her and told her to shut up. So she finally did shut up but I lost 15 minutes of movie or so.</p>
<p>People are so inconsiderate. They always forget the simple premise which goes &quot;don&#8217;t do to others what you wouldn&#8217;t want them to do to you.&quot;</p>

		<p>J: &quot;How else are people supposed to see him over all that noise?&quot;</p>
<p>Most interesting comment I have read in a long time! &nbsp;Oliver Sacks would be proud. &nbsp;As well as anyone with synesthesia.</p>
