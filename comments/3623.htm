		<p>I&#39;ll disagree with the assertion &quot;almost certain&quot; in the Bonus Reading section (after having duly read the linked article).</p>
<p>It is common in our multi-processor embedded systems that one of them is big-endian while the others are little-endian. Several years ago I did an FPGA that implemented a communications pipe between them using the 16-bit native data busses, connecting them bit-for-bit through a 1K-deep FIFO. The BE processor wrote it&#39;s 16-bit words one way, and the LE processor the other way.</p>
<p>That project had a heated argument over who was going to do byte-swapping (SW or HW).</p>
<p>Byte order doesn&#39;t matter&#8230;. only if you 1) send data only as 8-bit bytes, and 2) agree ahead of time on the order in which bytes are transferred.</p>

		<p>I would have assumed that this is property is exposing an intrinsic constant of the runtime engine, so there is no need to run a static constructor to get this value. (At least, the runtime engine should know the endianess of the processor it emits machine instructions for.)</p>
<p>In pseudo-VB.NET:</p>
<p>ReadOnly Class Property IsLittleEndian as Boolean</p>
<p>Get</p>
<p> &nbsp;return Environment.IsLittleEndian</p>
<p>End Get</p>
<p>This is still trivially inlinable, und would work also in the Debugger. </p>

		<p>@Karellen</p>
<p>You want a debugger to run all static constructors each time? The number of static constructors is theoretically infinite. Maybe what you want is just a certain subset of them? If that&#39;s the case, put those in program startup.</p>

		<p>@Karellen, adding to what McKay said, this also opens things up for some interesting Heisenbugs, where the program you&#39;re debugging behaves differently in the debugger than in the normal runtime. Yeah, it should not actually behave differently in that case, but if your program would not have any bugs you probably would not run it in the debugger in the first place&#8230;</p>

		<p>Java also has a similar stipulation, where class static constructors are run before the first instance is created or before the first static method is called. &nbsp;If the class static constructor throws an exception, then it terminates the program, since it&#39;s impossible to catch that exception anywhere &#8212; you&#39;d have to put a try/catch block around every usage of the class, which would be totally insane.</p>

		<p>@McKay, by the way, why are you saying that the number is theoretically infinite? While it is theoretically unbounded (meaning that there may be arbitrary many static constructors, practical considerations like available resources aside), I&#39;m (genuinely!) curious when a program may have infinitely many static constructors. Generics/templates maybe?</p>

		<p>I totally agree with rob on this one. Management think it&#39;s trivial to detect bit endianness, architecture, os version, dot net framework version etc&#8230; But my experience has shown that this type of code will invariably fail in different environnements.</p>

		<p>Glad to see CLR week make a return.</p>
<p>It would be remiss not to mention the great series on static constructors that Eric Lippert did earlier this year: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://ericlippert.com/2013/02/06/static-constructors-part-one/">ericlippert.com/&#8230;/static-constructors-part-one</a> &nbsp;It helped me clarify how and when static initialization happens in .NET.</p>

		<p>Next best thing after byte-order is alignment.</p>
<p>Curiously, many (most? all?) binary RPC formats have been devised with specific machine performance in mind. They must all be wrong, somehow.</p>
<p>XDR-style RPC message formats will always be a waste of time for little-endian machines. It will also be a waste of time for other-than-4 aligned machines (these were rare back in 2006 (?), see for yourself: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4506#page-16">tools.ietf.org/&#8230;/rfc4506</a> )</p>
<p>NDR-style RPC message formats seem to take the best and worst of both worlds. When encoding the message, indicate whatever endianess and alignment/packing the message was built with, allowing C/C++ structs be sent directly to the network. The receiving end must have all the code necessary to decode the message in a generic way, but when the architectural configuration (again, endianess and alignment/packing) are the same as the message&#39;s, it can again just read from the network. This makes reads and writes across the network may be the most efficient when possible, and it still allows for cases where something is common e.g. same-alignment-different-endianess to be a bit optimized. One might think that the worst case of decoding is server-side only, but that&#39;s not true, as the messages from the server to the client are done exactly the same way, so both have to have generic decoders.</p>
<p>But NDR in MSRPC might just mean little-endian, depending if type serialization is version 1 ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc243890.aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/cc243890.aspx</a> ) or 2 ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc243889.aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/cc243889.aspx</a> ).

		<p>Or the debugger could take a third option and somehow indicate that it is displaying a static member of a class whose static constructor has not yet run.</p>

		<p>I can&#39;t tell for certain from that link, but do the static constructors have to run *immediately before* the first instance is created or any static members are referenced, or can they run *any time before* the first instance is created or any static members are referenced? Bullet point 4 (&quot;The user has no control on when the static constructor is executed in the program.&quot;) suggests the latter.</p>
<p>If it is the case, it seems it would be permissible for the debugger to run all static constructors immediately on program startup/library load time/attach time. Yes, it could slow start-up time somewhat, but *you&#39;re in the debugger*, and can probably afford the hit in that situation. Or, it could be an optional behaviour, or a command you could give the debugger at any time (&quot;run all un-executed static initialisers now&quot;)</p>
<p>Is there a reason that this is not done? (Other than &quot;the default state of all possible features is &quot;not implemented&quot;, and they start with -100 points&quot;)</p>
<p>(@Joshua &#8211; did you read the linked article? Also, Rob Pike may well have *written* the [hn]to[nh][lsq](3) family of calls :-))</p>

		<p>&quot;For C#, static constructors are run before the first instance is created or any static members are referenced&quot;</p>
<p>Note though that as usual the as-if rule applies. </p>
<p>class Foo {</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;public static int x;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;public static int y = 5;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;static { // Java syntax because I&#39;m way too lazy to look up how that worked again in C#</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;x = 1;</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;}</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>If the only thing you&#39;re doing is read y, the compiler/JIT are perfectly fine to *not* call the static constructor (as a matter of fact at least javac will inline Foo.y &#8211; a really stupid decision by the spec &#8211; so this is not even as theoretic as you&#39;d think). Which makes this whole thing potentially even more surprising to people.</p>

		<p>The declaration in Rotor (Shared Source CLI) 2.0 has a #if BIGENDIAN and sets &#39;public static readonly bool IsLittleEndian&#39; to true or false as appropriate. The CLR rules say to initialise static members in the static constructor.</p>
<p>You can&#39;t use &#39;const&#39; because the CLR rules say that the compiler must replace uses of that symbolic constant with that value. This means that if the declaration *had* used const, you would get different results depending on whether you compiled your C# program to IL on a big- or little-endian machine. And that would be bad.</p>

		<p>From embedded software side I totally disagree with Rob: In fact he presents the two lines you would enclose in #ifdef BIGENDIAN and says you won&#39;t need more than that. But it is important to know the encoding of the byte stream (or whatever) and the encoding of the machine your code is running on. Otherwise you&#39;ll never get usable values out of the stream. And for the most time it is not sufficient just to say &quot;whoohoo I&#39;ve got an int, what matters the content?&quot;</p>
<p>Also the point of being able to address a single byte of an int or not: this is point the compiler has to take care of. Maybe it will produce massive overhead, but the compiler will get the job done.</p>

		<p>@ErikF, then guess again.</p>
<p>First, this is not a getter, it&#39;s a public static field: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.bitconverter.islittleendian.aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/system.bitconverter.islittleendian.aspx</a></p>
<p>Second, CLR&#39;s rules of static class constructor invocation are very clear, any access to a static or instance member (field, method) will trigger it. But remember that we&#39;re inspecting this static field in the debugger which probably uses reflection or a lower level mechanism, not in normal evaluation.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also a slight difference between having a static constructor or not, even if there are field initializers: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/csharp/beforefieldinit.html">http://www.yoda.arachsys.com/&#8230;/beforefieldinit.html</a></p>

		<p>Lots of people here have misunderstood Rob Pike&#39;s article. What he is essentially saying is that endianness is only an issue when you&#39;re doing I/O. After you&#39;ve done your I/O, you do not need to care about endianness. So yes, the stream you&#39;re reading must have defined an order of the bytes coming in. You can read these bytes with 100% portable code (as he demonstrates) without knowing the machine&#39;s byte order. #ifdef&#39;s are not necessary.</p>
<p>If you find yourself disagreeing with Rob, you really, really need to go back and re-read the post and understand what he&#39;s saying.</p>

		<p>#Carsten:: Amen.</p>
<p>I thought it was brilliant. &quot;//Computer// byte order&quot; should never matter to you.</p>

		<p>And to whomever didn&#39;t agree with the assertion of &quot;almost certain,&quot; that &quot;assertion&quot; wasn&#39;t an &quot;assertion,&quot; that&#39;s why he says &quot;almost.&quot; &quot;Almost&quot; is the opposite of assertion. Assertion is definite, he states &quot;almost certain&quot; _because_ there are exceptions and, in that statement of &quot;almost,&quot; he is qualifying that. A qualifying statement is quite the opposite of an asserted statement. Most programmers being in their right minds would refrain from making solid, blanket or definitive statements.</p>

		<p>It would have been nice if the hton? and ntoh? family took char * and dealt with all the machine alignment problems as well as byte order.</p>
