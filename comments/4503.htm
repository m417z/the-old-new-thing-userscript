		<p>I kept looking for footnote 3 (even after you&#39;d explained it was cubed)</p>

		<p>I thought Forms^3 was the forms package used by Office of that era. Perhaps it was designed for Access, but also used in Excel and Word. Are you saying that there was an effort to take that and use it as a browser rendering engine? Or something else I didn&#39;t get?</p>

		<p>@Gabe, I think the forms for Office was Forms2, and Forms3 is actually Trident.</p>
<p>If you run MSHTMPAD in WACK, its titlebar says &quot;Forms3 Trident&quot;</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve worked on three different projects at MS with the codename &#39;Trident&#39; it&#39;s pretty popular for some reason.</p>

		<p>I was expecting some convoluted story about how you spent thousands of dollars to acquire some product or company and the only thing of salvageable value was the notepads. Perhaps you should make that a stretch goal.</p>

		<p>Forms^3 was designed for Sterling, the follow-on to Access. &nbsp;I thought it did ship in the MS Query designer and some of the Office for Mac stuff. &nbsp;It rolled pretty directly into Trident but at one point I was working on a prototype of adding Forms3 support to msdev c++ designers and switched to Trident since they were more up to date than what we could get for Forms^3. &nbsp;I think it was Forms3 because it merged three technologies that were under development; there was a Windows layout engine, Forms^2 and another one in Office and Forms^3 was going to be the one single unified presentation technology that everyone was committed to moving to&#8230; oh wait&#8230; maybe it&#39;s just another layout/presentation technology in addition the ones before and the ones that come after&#8230; &nbsp;Only Adam Bosworth really knows and maybe he&#39;s blocking it.</p>
