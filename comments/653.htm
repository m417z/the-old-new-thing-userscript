		<p>What I find surprising, that a corporation which can escalate its question to such level, still relies on Notepad and Paint in their business process.</p>

		<p>Wouldn&#39;t it read from X to initialise the dialog, and write to Y-&gt;X to save the most recently chosen preference(s)? And maybe just writing (the whole chain) always was deemed (right or wrong) easier than testing for changes before committing?</p>

		<p>&quot;That&#39;s a pretty elitist statement.&quot;</p>
<p>Given that the solution was to use Group Policy, I&#39;d say not. If your use of Windows is on a large enough scale that you&#39;ve got a domain and an administrator putting GPOs together, I don&#39;t think it is elitist to hope that they might understand about the perils of hacking random registry keys.</p>

		<p>@Ken Hagan</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t think it is elitist to hope that they might understand about the perils of hacking random registry keys.&quot;</p>
<p>To be fair, they didn&#39;t exactly do that, did they? They asked for more information about how those keys were used.</p>
<p>On a more general note, based on the &quot;solve the customer&#39;s problem&quot; principle, this isn&#39;t the end of the story. There&#39;s another level here &#8211; why did the customer want to redirect the Pictures and Documents folders? My guess is that they wanted these locations to be on a network share, but that can cause no end of trouble, not least a pause every time you launch a new Explorer.exe while it enumerates these folders.</p>

		<p>&lt;snarky mode&gt;How does Microsoft dare changing the format of a registry key other developers may be relying on? It&#39;s a clear case of keeping competitors out!&lt;/snarky mode&gt;</p>

		<p>@T. West: I once had the opposite of this problem. I tried to install patch 1.21 on WarCraft III but it kept giving me a strange error; something about failure to build some sort of tree. I contacted Blizzard Support and asked &quot;what does this error message mean?&quot;. Instead they started rambling about how to defrag my hard disk and how to run a chkdsk. Eventually, I got tired of their rambling and run Process Explorer and found out that CRC check had failed; the downloaded patch was corrupt. If only they hadn&#39;t been wasting my time and answered my question&#8230; I logged onto Battle.net and re-downloaded manually.</p>

		<p>A clear example of the fact that asking &quot;why&quot; repeatedly is a good idea. The real problem is often not what is first being discussed.</p>

		<p>&lt;i&gt;Today is another example where the right thing to do is not to answer the customer&#39;s question but rather to solve the customer&#39;s problem. &lt;/i&gt;</p>
<p>I have to say that that approach is *exceedingly* rare in tech support (at least non-MS tech support). &nbsp;If I ask tech support about my general problem, I&#39;ll usually get no reply, but if I ask a question that has an unambiguous, *short* answer, there&#39;s at least some chance that I can get an answer.</p>
<p>Thus, we&#39;re trained by the industry *not* to ask a question about our problem. &nbsp;</p>
<p>People like yourself who provide tech support at your level are rare indeed.</p>

		<p>Of course, the real question is why this kind of thing escalates to Raymond&#39;s level. Why isn&#39;t it the liaison who&#39;s going back to the customer and asking &quot;what problem are you actually trying to solve?&quot;? This kind of thing should never be reaching the technical experts without at least basic filtering&#8230;</p>

		<p>Kinda like what Marcus said, it seems that a good tech supporter is like that annoying little kid that asks &quot;why?&quot; to every answer given. Unlike that kid, I suppose the real trick is knowing when to stop&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve had a mixed bag with this on Microsoft support &#8212; and I&#39;ve had managers that insist I ask &quot;their&quot; questions instead of the questions that actually need to be asked as well, in the past.</p>
<p>Raymond can correct me on this if I&#39;m way off base.</p>
<p>I get this impression that his day is a lot of interruptions, with a few minutes of blissful flow here and there. &nbsp;I think he&#39;s got 10 minutes between the last person leaving his office, and his next meeting &#8212; and so he&#39;s going to the Microsoft newsgroups, mailing lists, etc. &#8212; the internal ones &#8212; and finding problems he thinks are going to train wreck, or that are simply something he can resolve in that 10 minute block, and acting on that.</p>
<p>Generally, he strikes me as that sort of a person. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>I think the customer possibly have said something like &quot;The customer wants to change the default save location for &lt;ul&gt;programs like&lt;/ul&gt; Paint and Notepad.&quot; The effect that changing paths pointed by Documents and Pictures affects all other application fixes it all.</p>
<p>Notepad&#8230; maybe. Paint&#8230; I can&#39;t think of a case companies actually automate it to create files at all. People would usually use something that provides automation interface or macro support. That&#39;s why I think it&#39;s a nice coincidence that it solves user problem.</p>

		<p>@Alex Cohn: My reading of Raymond&#39;s post is the following:</p>
<p>&gt; the customer wanted to redirect saves that normally go to Pictures and Documents (and possibly the other user locations too);</p>
<p>&gt; they noticed that Paint defaults to save to Pictures and Notepad defaults to save to Documents</p>
<p>&gt; they continued their investigation by looking at registry keys accessed by these applications when activating the standard file dialogs.</p>
<p>So I doubt Paint and Notepad were core to their workflow &#8212; instead they were just mentioned because they are common and reproduce the scenario they wish to change.</p>

<p>I believe that&#39;s true. I also believe that suchmn liaisons cause more hassle than they resolve. Not that everybody &nbsp; be technical, and I must confess that I was often blessed to have very helpful coworkers who had no programming education at all, but I also experienced more than once these middle men, most of them with some &nbsp;managerial badge or at least ambition, who could double the work load on the team, out of pure arrogant ignorance.</p>

(I get the impression that customer liaisons are not technical, so they don&#39;t know how to dig into a customer&#39;s question to figure out what the problem is. They are just middle men who protect the engineering team from direct customer contact.) -Raymond]</p>
<p>I&#39;d think it would be more productive had Microsoft provide training to them on &quot;how to ask questions the smart way&quot;. At least it&#39;ll reduce the time lost on back-and-forwards.</p>
<p>Many of my colleagues did have frustration on contacting with Microsoft supports.</p>

		<p>How is this solution not another case of using a global setting to solve a local problem? Sure, now Paint and Notepad point to your intended directory, but so does everything else.</p>

		<p>@vtsj because the customer liaison was reporting only a small part of the customer&#39;s actual problem.</p>

		<p>I faced this exact problem and the solution was setting the default folder for my EXE in the registry key &quot;ComDlg32LastVisitedPidlMRU&quot; or &quot;ComDlg32LastVisitedMRU&quot; if &nbsp;&lt;= XP. My program was hosting the Web Browser Control and for web page &lt;INPUT TYPE=File&gt; controls I wanted the to set the default folder. The code was from Vb6 days and worked as VB.Net so it remains, maybe there is another way?</p>
<p>The moral remains an excellent one. I think of it as &quot;don&#39;t just give the customer what he asks for, try to figure out what he needs&quot;.</p>
