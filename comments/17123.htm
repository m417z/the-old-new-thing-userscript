		<p>My favorite: &quot;People who still live with their parents when they&#8217;re 30 years old are not really adults.&quot;</p>
<p>I think that really kind of nails it. &nbsp;Being an adult is being self-supportive.</p>

		<p>I guess I&#8217;m only sort of an adult (I have my own apartment, but still spend a lot of time with my parents and have a dedicated room there, not to mention rely a lot on their help). Then again maybe the criteria is different when you&#8217;re 29?</p>

		<p>To be very honest, though, the living by themselves when in 30&#8217;s may only apply in western societies or wealthy countries. In many Asian countries for example, many singles (and sometimes even married couples!) still live with their parents. The reasons are not outside imaginations:</p>
<ol>
<li>In some Eastern cultures, living in family settings is a better virtue than living by themselves.</li>
<li>
<p>Cost-saving. Take Hong Kong, my birth-place, as an example. A 300-feet unit can cost about HK$2mil (round that to about US$250K), while a friend of mine being a teacher (considered good paid in HK) had an income equivalent to US$30K/yr. Rentals are pretty expensive too. It is far cheaper to live with your parents. (By the same argument, buying a car in HK, even when translated to US currency, still costs 3-4 times more than the exact same model in USA.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Even when living with parents, many young people (singles or couples) bear the financial responsibilities, because they are better paid (or their parents have retired). I&#8217;ve even seen 3-generation families living under the same unit way smaller than 1000 sq. fts.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>So, while the &quot;Being an adult is being self-supportive&quot; argument may be true in USA, I consider this as culture-specific, as in Eastern cultures, being an adult takes further as &quot;taking responsibilities of supporting your family members&quot;, from financial suitations to daily lives, because quite some singles and couples choose to live with their parents as their elderly parents need physical help.</p>

<p>I think that&#8217;s my favorite. &nbsp;Good sentence, oddly enlightened. :)</p>

		<p>This post was a great way to start a day. Thanks!</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Is this an adult or an anime character?</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>By the way, would you mind posting on this topic? I.e. do you watch any, your impressions etc. I believe quite a few readers here would be interested.</p>

<p>I dunno about that. Lots of people in Taiwan live with or near their parents, but they do seem to me to be (hunts for a tactful way to put it) &#8230; younger emotionally &#8230; than people of the same age/background would be if they&#8217;d spent more time in the US or Europe. I.e. their parents basically tell them what to do. I still think that being self supportive is part of being an adult. Not to say that the Western model where people leave home earlier and never return is better, just that it enforces self sufficiency and independence better. Of course in terms of caring for elderly relatives it is worse.</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8230; a great person that reflex what a real adult should be like&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think this is a misspelling. I think they&#8217;re just a Duran Duran fan &#8230; :-)</p>

		<p>&quot;The truth of it all is your house is the central gravitational force, pulling bits of your life together.&quot;</p>
<p>As opposed to the non-central gravitational force, that pulls everything apart. So, if you don&#8217;t have central gravity, only use one window gravitational unit at a time.</p>

		<p>An an adult I would say that: being an adult is having conservative political views</p>
<p>As an old (turn of the 20th century) Jewish saying goes: If you weren&#8217;t a communist before you were 20 you have no heart. But if you are a communist after you&#8217;re 20 you have no brains.</p>
