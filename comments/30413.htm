		<p>Speaking of drivers trying to kill you:<br />
<br />Back in the &#8217;60s, while training for the Rice beer-bike race, we used to work out at night on the one mile loop around the Herman Park Zoo (no roads from the inside of the loop). I had some guy pull up next to me, point a gun at me and say something on the order of &quot;I could shoot you&quot;. Fortunately, he did not. Another rider had a car pull up next to him and a passenger stab him in the stomach. Not too seriously. A short distance ahead, he came upon a police car. On telling them about it, they obligingly took off to look for the perpetrators leaving the cyclist to get himself to the hospital. After that we rode in large groups.</p>

		<p>Not all drivers are <em>trying</em> to kill cyclists. Sometimes a driver will experience sensory overload, and then the brain filters out stuff it deems unimportant &#8212; like bicycles and motorcycles. If someone could just figure out how to reprogram the filter&#8230;</p>

		<p>The drivers should have certainly have waited, but this is also why bicyclists should not be using the sidewalks pedestrian crosswalks. &nbsp;You&#8217;re supposed to wait at the red light along with all the other vehicles. </p>
<p>As a pedestrian I&#8217;ve had cyclists nearly run me over on the sidewalk, and as a car driver in the Redmond area I&#8217;ve often seen cyclists zip along doing 20+ mph on the sidewalk and suddenly dart across an intersection where. &nbsp;Every time I see it I think, wow, that&#8217;s a very serious accident just waiting to happen. </p>

		<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Just wanted to say that ten days ago I broke my wrist while I was biking around. Split second, just one moment of July 13. Now, I&#8217;ll be using mouse with my left hand until August. So&#8230;</p>
<p>Raymond, do take care.</p>

		<p>Once, while living in Indiana, I was biking on the narrow shoulder of the road I biked on twice daily, to and from school. &nbsp;One day, a rusty pickup truck pulled up right alongside me, and then honked at me. &nbsp;Scared the *bleep* out of me. &nbsp;I veered off into the rough grass on the side of the road, but managed to stay on my bike.</p>
<p>I think biking not only teaches you to determine the drivers who are going to try to kill you, it also heightens your awareness when you yourself are driving.</p>

		<p>I walk to work, and the traffic light scheme amazes me. You are a pedestrian waiting to cross the road, and cars are immediately to your left. The light goes green for the cars and the &quot;walk&quot; light goes green for the pedestrians to walk right in front of the cars. Considering that the general idea of traffic lights is to prevent collisions, the fact that pedestrians and cars both simultaneously get the &quot;go&quot; signal so that they can collide seems stupendously ridiculous.</p>

		<p>Sometimes I think the bicyclists are trying to get killed. &nbsp;Yesterday, a bicyclist at the crosswalk at 148th, near RedWest, decided that traffic signals didn&#8217;t apply to him and tried to cut out into traffic. &nbsp;The light was green for the cars, so I don&#8217;t think he had right of way.</p>

		<p>Phil, I frequently walk a route where parallel pedestrian and car lanes receive a green at the same time, but it&#8217;s safe because the pedestrians are protected by a filter behind them. Cars which would otherwise turn across the pedestrian crossing have already been filtered and a late turn is prohibited. Obviously if you&#8217;ve never seen this junction before it can be surprising to step off the curb and see the cars next to you accelerate away at the same time, but they aren&#8217;t going to hit you.</p>
<p>In other words, are you sure that the junction you&#8217;re talking about is configured to encourage a collison, or did you just never look carefully at the signs?</p>

		<p>they&#8217;re rebuilding the bike/horse trail along 140th from 40th north. I know this won&#8217;t help you, but it&#8217;s nice to see some effort going into rebuilding the bike/horse trail there. Right now it is a single bike-tire wide rut along the edge of the road with a ditch to the right and traffic left.</p>

		<p>The general bike-as-pedestrian rule is:</p>
<p>If you are on your bike, you&#8217;re a vehicle and have to be in the road and follow traffic lights. &nbsp;This makes intersections difficult as cars can cut right in front of you, but works very well on long roads where cars won&#8217;t be turning right often or you can dodge that situation.</p>
<p>If you are off your bike, you&#8217;re a pedestrian and have to be on the sidewalk and follow pedestrian crossing lights. &nbsp;This makes intersections quite nice as the walk light and other pedestrians around make it harder to kill you.</p>
<p>As a result, what you can do is ride up to a busy intersection, hop off, pulling the bike on to the side walk, then wait for the walk light, cross, then hop back on. &nbsp;Seems to work just fine as far as I&#8217;ve seen.</p>

		<p>In response to Nick: Yes, most intersections with lights are configured that way, so perhaps I mis-described it. I&#8217;m walking in the same direction as the traffic, in parallel with it. When the lights go green, the vehicles to my left get the go-ahead to turn right (as well as go straight) crossing the walkway where the pedestrians have just been given a go signal. </p>
