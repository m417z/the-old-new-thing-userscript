		<p>The whole concept of injecting is just horrible.</p>
<p>With this around you can never be sure your application works as expected, because any random bug could appear caused by 3rd party injected DLLs.</p>

		<p>Really? Even if I am a freaking malware non-elevated I can watch the all mighty admin windows creation? OAW!!! That&#39;s awesome, now I can take over the world (heh, or only about 85% of it since rest is non-Windows). And you mean I can be notified also about the UAC asking user window creation? Or when the Antivirus is starting to hunt me by creating it&#39;s scheduler windows? Uber-super, lemme start creating the next Stuxnet :D:D.</p>

		<p>One of the things I like about this blog, indeed Raymond in general, is that he shows developers how useful the accessibility-related technology can be outside of traditional uses. &nbsp;Raymond and the original MSAA developers were key to ensuring that WinEvents has uses beyond empowering accessibility aids.</p>
<p>@Danny, while you can get information about window creation, you can&#39;t really do much with the information. &nbsp;You are still bound by the rules of uiAccess privilege do to anything meaningful.</p>

		<p>Doesn&#39;t injection require administrative rights to occur? If your giving a 3rd party program administrative rights, you better be darn sure what that 3rd party program does or just not care.</p>
<p>And if you&#39;re running in an environment as the administrator, or disabling UAC, you are just asking for this behavior.</p>
<p>There are plenty of valid scenarios for injection, debugging comes to mind, fixing others broken code in a product that is no longer supported, intrusive monitoring applications, etc. Just because a concept has been abused or used poorly doesn&#39;t mean its horrible, it just means that those programmers did not take great care with a powerful tool (and should be named and shamed in my opinion).</p>
<p>@ChuckOp I think Danny was joking, mocking those that think this ability is some type of security exploit.</p>

		<p>@@AC the &quot;:D:D&quot; I put at the end of my statement was precisely for that purpose but I think ChuckOp was too busy to read them :).</p>

		<p>Danny, your jokes may have been just a little too close to the truth, too. Or at least a little too close to the truth as perceived by the pinheads who write some antimalware software.</p>
<p>People who write accessibility software NEED these interfaces. But people in the &quot;security&quot; industry go off half-cocked and regularly flag accessibility software as malware because they make similar wrong assumptions about what these interfaces can and can&#39;t do. The problem is, they don&#39;t think they&#39;re joking.</p>

		<p>They actually have an &quot;Internet Law&quot; for that: Poe&#39;s Law.</p>
<p>From TOW:</p>
<p>[Poe&#39;s Law] is an Internet adage reflecting the idea that without a clear indication of the author&#39;s intent, it is difficult or impossible to tell the difference between sincere extremism and an exaggerated parody of extremism</p>
<p>I agree with you, my job requires me to maintain an Automation Framework that relies heavily on these Interfaces (and some other dark-evil-magic that I prefer not to mention such as Injection) and I am a huge fan of any Raymond Chen posts which dive into anything remotely related to what I&#39;m working on.</p>

		<p>@Danny, apologies, I did not pick up on the sarcasm. &nbsp;TIL today: &nbsp;Poe&#39;s Law. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>The downside of this approach is the context switching from being out-of-process. It turns out that that extra cost can be meaningful in some regards. Also, with winevents, the payload isn&#39;t usually helpful. You have to make another roundtrip talk to the application (via AccessibleObjectFromEvent) to get anything useful (and deal with reentrancy if you&#39;re on an STA).</p>
