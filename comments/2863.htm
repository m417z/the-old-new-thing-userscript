		<p>The default value for a configuration value is just a really complicated CONST value across the entire application.</p>
<p>Off-by-default === Off for 99.99% of users</p>
<p>On-by-default === On for 99.99% of users</p>

		<p>But why not make the reset and recovery a part of the presentation? It would be original.</p>

		<p>That&#39;s why default values should be selected such as they work for 99.99% of users. I spend much time, maybe too much, analyzing user scenarios to select default values in my applications (as a small firm, we don&#39;t have budget for formal usability testing, so informally polling coworkers and best guesses must make for it).</p>

		<p>I am afraid to ask what kind of feature it was and whether it still exists/widely used. Thank goodness Raymond doesn&#39;t share such sensitive information, so I can sleep relatively well.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s unfortunate the VP&#39;s response wasn&#39;t recorded. I&#39;d like to think it was something along the lines of &quot;OK, I can live with that&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Boris</p>
<p>Because it would take ages and, in the end, no one would care, especially not the VP.</p>

		<p>Anon: but the VP wants to see you&#39;ve got a handle on the application.</p>
<p>Absolutely agree on default values, whenever it is possible to run with them without mandatory user input.</p>

		<p>@Boris: VPs don&#39;t really care if you have a handle on the application or not &#8211; all they want to see is &#39;ooh, shiny&#39; and &#39;how many of these can we sell?&#39;.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of my first BillG review in Office. &nbsp; I was new to the group, and was allowed to sit in with the 5 teams in a small-ish conference room. &nbsp;My manager did the presentation, and carefully took notes of Bill&#39;s questions and feedback. &nbsp;At one point, he even had to answer a question with &quot;I don&#39;t know, but we&#39;ll get back to you tomorrow or sooner if you need it.&quot; &nbsp; The presentation then moved to the next team &#8211; their presenter was in the chair next to me. At one point Bill had to forcefully interrupt the guy (he wasn&#39;t taking hints) to ask a question, to which the presenter replied: &quot;Mmmm, I don&#39;t know but that&#39;s not important&quot; and then kept going. &nbsp; The presenter didn&#39;t notice the look of shock of everyone else in the room, and my manager quietly reached over and pulled my rolling chair closer to him and away from the presenter&#8230; &nbsp; </p>
<p>Bill had some seriously creative ☁☆⚕☄ when he was pissed. &nbsp; And I vowed never to be that guy on the other end&#8230; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

		<p>@RaceProUK that&#39;s true of companies where VPs have come in from sales rather than being promoted from development, as they were at Microsoft in years past.</p>

		<p>Raymond there seems to be something wrong with your blog software. Random words are appearing as weird symbols. Worst of all its happening in the sentence that contains your colleges reply. I&#39;ve tried this in multiple browser and its the same result. Now i&#39;ll never know how customers are supposed to recover when they get into that state?</p>
