		<p>Hasn&#39;t this just been reduced to a problem of using global state to manage a local problem (<a target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/12/11/9193695.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/9193695.aspx</a>)? &nbsp;I feel like Vista took a step backwards here, making it much more difficult for different programs to display balloons with different timeouts.</p>

		<p>So does that mean the solution is to have poor programs affect /every/ balloon tip instead of just their &quot;super-important-critical-look-at-me&quot; one?</p>

		<p>Meh. The misbehaving developer might go nuclear anyway (by building his own balloon and displaying it as long as he wants).</p>

<p>As I understand, applications are still allowed to specify what they want, it&#39;s just that Vista and W7 (and probably W8) ignore it. If this is fixed in a future version of Windows, then the sentence will be plain wrong.</p>

		<p>When I read about this change on MSDN I was somewhat surprised. &nbsp;I know that &quot;bad software&quot; can abuse a long timeout value, but isn&#39;t it the user, after all, that installed the bad software? &nbsp;A few little utilities I&#39;ve written to help with debugging used balloons to indicate that something would happen (in lieu of actually doing it), and now those disappear pretty quickly.</p>
<p>If the program gets to decide when to show a notification, the text on the notification and the icon, and the user can dismiss it with a click, why not also give the software control over the duration?</p>

		<p>One of my happiest days in recent memory was when I discovered, through a bit of Googling, that you can enter a value in the registry to disable those goddamn balloons entirely.</p>

		<p>I think Miff&#39;s point is: Bad software developer decides his balloon tip is super important, so he calls your SetMessageDuration to make sure that everyone has to see his balloon tip. </p>
<p>Now end user is afflicted super long balloons for *every* balloon. </p>
<p>To phrase it in terms frequently seen on this blog: &quot;User thinks computers are random and stupid. &nbsp;Blames Microsoft for their stupid balloons. &nbsp;Bad programmer collects a nice bonus for his mis-feature.&quot;</p>

		<p>Isn&#39;t this also user configurable in Vista and later (I don&#39;t say Vista spoiled everything). Type &quot;Use the computer without a display&quot; in search or from Ease of Access Center and set the time under &quot;How long should Windows notification dialog boxes stay open&quot;? although why it says &quot;Notification *dialog boxes*&quot; is beyond me.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the better answer was to not let programs set it or get it, and keep the setting in the control panel. Then idiotic crap users install won&#39;t set it to be forever system-wide (and the user won&#39;t think something broke windows since all the balloons seem to not go away).</p>
<p>I can tell you it&#39;s a strange behavoir when balloons don&#39;t disappear quite so speedily.</p>

		<p>So previously a rogue program could display a notification ballooon for an annoyingly long time. Now a rogue program can make all notification ballooons display for an annoyingly long time.</p>
<p>Surely a better solution would have been to still respect the uTimeout member and have a non-programmatically accessible maximum display time as a user setting (e.g. User can specifiy a max display time in the range of 9 to 60 seconds (based off the system range you mention previously applied to uTimeout)).</p>
<p>That way good applications with detailed balloons still get the time they need, and the user can still limit the display time without a rogue app being able to stomp all over the settings just to force their balloon to display longer.</p>

		<p>I clearly remember that I used a third party tool to deactivate all balloons in XP. Not because they were individually an issue, but because too many processes threw out too many of them, especially those that re-appear every few hours. Windows Genuine Advantage (DRM) anyone?</p>

		<p>[The setting is an end-user setting. The end-user interface to it is clearly not writing a C program.]</p>
<p>So what <em>is</em> the end-user interface to it? For about half of the SPI settings, the end-user interface is the control panel &#8211; the problem is the other half. When you have complained in the past about people using the registry editor to mess with these settings (other SPI settings; I don&#39;t know if/where this one is in the registry) it certainly <em>seems</em> like you are saying the end-user interface is to write a C program, since the reason people edit the undocumented registry keys for these is that regedit.exe is a marginally usable end-user interface.</p>

		<p>@Leif Strand, you are kidding right? I *LOVE* notification balloons. They are the best way to display any message without obstructing what&#39;s on the screen, or making the user click to close them. I loved the pop balloon sound they made as well in Windows XP. Unfortunately, the notification balloon sound has been broken since the broken Vista/7 OSes came along. Even if you set the sound for &quot;System notification&quot; in Sounds control panel, it won&#39;t play. Larry Osterman confirmed it to me. One can fix it by editing the registry.</p>

<p>Jon never mentioned C&#8230; I sense a &#39;C reality distortion field&#39;.</p>
<p>@zilla:</p>
<p>About the end-user setting in Control Panel. It is very well hidden. How would you know to look under &quot;Use computer without Display, optimize for blindness&quot; for this setting? I&#39;m not blind and I am using a display&#8230; The next item in the Ease of Access Center (in my copy of W7) is &quot;Make the computer easier to see, optimize visual display&quot;. Isn&#39;t this the more appropriate category?</p>
<p>And how would you know the setting is for balloons when they are referred to as &#39;notification dialog boxes&#39;?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>I assume Jon was referring to the code sample I wrote, which was in C. If my code sample were in C# I would have written &quot;not writing a C# program.&quot; (The &quot;optimize for visual display&quot; is more about changing colors and fonts, not for adjusting timeouts. But I don&#39;t know why &quot;Adjust timeouts&#39; got dumped into the &quot;Use a computer without a display&quot; category. Maybe because that category had some extra room?) And the value applies to all notifications, not just balloons. (Though balloons are where you&#39;re most likely to see them.) If the title were &quot;How long should balloons stay open?&quot; then that would unintentionally exclude non-balloon notifications.

		<p>@burak</p>
<p>You&#39;re argument is a strawman. Who cares how you find it? Random said it doesn&#39;t exist, it does&#8230; end of story.</p>
<p>But I&#39;ll bite anyway. Do you really think an uninformed end user would know the difference between a dialog box and a balloon? My end users call it &quot;that popup thing&quot;. They would have a hard time finding that setting if it was on the desktop. Then again it was never anyone&#39;s argument that the setting was hard to find, it was that it didn&#39;t exist and it clearly does. If you want to argue that it&#39;s hard to find, no disagreement from me. But how visible does a setting like that need to be? I&#39;ve never had an end user complain, to me at least, that &quot;gee wiz I wish I could make that balloon last longer&#8230;&quot;</p>

		<p>Maybe a little link added by Explorer that says &quot;Adjust how long these notifications appear&#8230;&quot; to every balloon would make it easier? All it would do is open the control panel to that page would make it easier to find.</p>
<p>Or Explorer could monitor user frustration levels by seeing how often they click the X &#8211; too many times and it shortens the delay a bit&#8230;</p>

		<p>&quot;And the value applies to all notifications, not just balloons.&quot;</p>
<p>I am sure the value applies only to balloon notifications. Other types of notification like message boxes don&#39;t go away automatically, do they? If they do, then it&#39;s broken because they should not.</p>

		<p>[Since this is an Accessibility setting, it needs to be programmatically accessible to accessibility tools. -Raymond]</p>
<p>I can&#39;t see why this would be needed by accessibility tools, but I&#39;m willing to admit I&#39;m not really in the audience that such a tool would target.</p>

		<p>Off-topic, but related: This is a very old pet peeve, but this article reminded me of it.</p>
<p>How long do tootips appear on the screen?</p>
<p>The answer is.. wait for it.. based on your mouse&#39;s double-click speed setting! Really? Yes!</p>
<p>So if you want tooltips to disappear faster, you need to increase your double-click speed. That means your double-clicks will have to be really fast. If you want tooltips to stay on screen longer, you have to decrease your double-click speed. That means getting a lot of double-clicks where you meant to single-click.</p>
<p>No matter what speed setting you have, moving the mouse makes a tooltip go away. What if, like me, you want your tooltips to remain on screen indefinately (until you move the mouse)? You&#39;re out of luck. There is no such option.</p>
<p>Would it be possible to separate double-click speed from a new &quot;tooltip timeout&quot; setting? One that has &#39;infinite&#39; included. What are the issues involved?</p>

		<p>I started to write a comment and it got way too long and decided to make my own blog post:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://weblogs.asp.net/chuckop/archive/2011/05/20/balloon-timeout-and-notification-duration.aspx" rel="nofollow">weblogs.asp.net/&#8230;/balloon-timeout-and-notification-duration.aspx</a></p>
<p>My posting is mostly on the accessibility aspects of the message duration value and why it&#39;s better to have a global setting.</p>
