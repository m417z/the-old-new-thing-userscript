		<p>And of course, since you&#8217;re neither curious nor logical, you didn&#8217;t wonder where they put the hills ! I&#8217;ll tell you: Yesterday, I went for some biking in my neighborhood. And guess what : They put hills where it used to be fairly flat !</p>
<p>I was wondering but now I know: These are your hills ! Please come and take them back !</p>

		<p>And guess what, the planes probably run QNX, but definitely not Windows, otherwise the Blue Angels would Blue Screen! Windows shell team is rubbish so LongWait realtime capabilities will be rubbish anyway.</p>

<p>  It&#8217;s sad when the high point of your day is posting some insulting drivel on someone&#8217;s blog.  I would say the guy is just jealous because he has never produced anything noteworthy in his entire life, and most likely never will.  However jealousy is probably too high of an emotion for this person to experience, he is probably just an angry bitter loser sitting in some crappy flat somewhere telling himself how clever he is and cursing the rest of the world for not acknowledging it.  To the OP I would suggest you make your way back over to /. before you miss the daily circle jerk, don&#8217;t forget your picture of Linus Torvalds.
