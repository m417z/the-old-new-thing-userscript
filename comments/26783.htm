		<p>One might add that the MFC Reference (help) for the CDialog class states, &quot;A modal dialog box closes automatically when the user presses the OK or Cancel buttons or when your code calls the EndDialog member function.&quot;</p>

		<p>Oops, point being that reading the help answers the question without the need to dive into the source code. &nbsp;It not only tells you to call EndDialog but also directs you toward the OnOk and OnCancel member functions with a whack from a pretty strong cluestick.</p>

		<p>It illustrates the point well &#8211; so many people just act helpless and immediately want help without even doing the basics to research the problem. People seem to think I have a psychic ability to solve problems and find out the cause of error messages, when in fact a lot of the time I simply have a non-psychic ability to copy and paste the error message into google then read the top few most likely looking results.</p>

		<p>Ok, this is totally unrelated to the topic at hand, but I was wondering: Why &quot;for (;;)&quot; instead of &quot;while (true)&quot;? Because it&#8217;s less characters to type? Optimizes differently? Personal preference?</p>
<p>I see it a fair bit in the code referenced here, and google isn&#8217;t exactly helpful in this arena (all the search engines I tried appear to strip out non-alphanumeric text)</p>

		<p>while(true) is a constant expression. How is it ever supposed to get out???????? It is a mystery (to the compiler).</p>

<p>I, for one, just acted helpless back &nbsp;in the day. I also often &nbsp;&quot;cargo-culted&quot; (something didn&#8217;t work for some bug I didn&#8217;t understood, so I don&#8217;t use that something anymore because I believe it&#8217;s something which simply doesn&#8217;t work or things like that).</p>
<p>What changed me was a sum of experience and gained self-esteem.</p>
<p>Help from colleagues and boss was a key factor in this, between other factors.</p>

		<p>johnf: Reflector gives you Windows Forms (the Microsoft-supplied .NET Framework DLLs are _not_ obfuscated), while for the BCL and the runtime, there&#8217;s the Shared Source CLI (Rotor). You can use Reflector on the BCL as well, of course, but SSCLI has the original comments in.</p>
<p>You cannot of course copy that code yourself, but you can understand what it&#8217;s doing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure the subject of this article is dealt with in every MFC text *ever*. If you&#8217;re not comfortable just grepping (or other tool of your choice) the MFC source, there&#8217;s a book called &quot;MFC Internals&quot; by Scot Wingo and George Shepherd which will guide you through it. It&#8217;s &#8216;out of date&#8217; in that it targets MFC 4.0, but the architecture hasn&#8217;t actually changed all that much in 10 years.</p>
<p>MFC&#8217;s dialogs are actually a little odd in that an MFC &#8216;modal&#8217; dialog is actually a modeless Win32 dialog. There&#8217;s some very good reason for this which I&#8217;ve forgotten (and I can&#8217;t be bothered to dig out the book I mentioned above to look it up).</p>

<p>Nish half-agrees. &nbsp;CDialog::DoModal calls CWnd::RunModalLoop to run the dialog loop, and there are conditions under which it will exit this NON-MODAL dialog loop.</p>

<p>I haven&#8217;t done enough testing, but have the impression that the non-modality of MFC pseudo-modal dialogs is the reason why WM_CLOSE can be received by an MFC application where a corresponding plain Win32 application never gets the WM_CLOSE (turning the Win32 app into a &quot;not responding&quot; app).</p>

<p>Maybe that, or maybe he didn&#8217;t know that there&#8217;s an option to install it during Visual Studio installation. &nbsp;Meanwhile there are other people who well could be bothered, who have found some parts of the source readable, who agree with johnf&#8217;s opinion.</p>

<p>Source code to Windows Forms would be nice, if only so Go To Definition went somewhere interesting. The documentation tends to be good enough for .NET while the source for MFC is basically required to solve many issues. I prefer plain old Win32 API calls to MFC.</p>

<p>Not to slag the person who posted the question, I&#8217;ve made similar mistakes and I suspect most of us have.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree with you, but I&#8217;d have thought that an API where you are called, is always going to be way more complex to program, than one where you do all the calling. It&#8217;s all part of the idea of encapsulation, and black vs white boxes.</p>
<p>Clearly there are practical constraints in what can be achieved if one goes bonkers and says, &quot;I&#8217;ll only implement a call based API&quot; or vice versa.</p>
<p>At the end of the day, you&#8217;re a very lucky person, if you never write code that is called in somebody elses context.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never used .NET, what is it? :)</p>
<p>I never liked MFC, because it led me up the path to nowhere so, so, many times. Win32 never, ever, has.</p>

		<p>&gt; The information is there &#8211; have you not tried Reflector?</p>
<p>Part of the information is there, but with all the comments and local variable names gone, it&#8217;s a lot harder to understand than it has to be.</p>
<p>Take the Dialog example above: In MFC, you could just put a breakpoint on DoModal, step into it, and see what it does, in your program, look at the values of all local variables, you can see which branch it takes, see values of local variables and everything. All you have to do is hit F11 a few times. With .NET, this is _a lot_ harder, especially if you have to look into ROTOR.</p>
<p>BTW: I&#8217;d really like to understand why MS *didn&#8217;t* release the .NET source code. They&#8217;ve released MFC, ATL in the past, so what&#8217;s the big deal about .NET? Are they afraid someone might steal their intellectual property? Then why didn&#8217;t they obfuscate?</p>

		<p>My instinct tells me the answer is so simple&#8230;. it&#8217;s a dialog, send a message that dismisses a dialog the way a user would, like WM_COMMAND and IDOK/IDCANCEL or WM_CLOSE.</p>
<p>why indeed would DestroyWindow be used to dismiss a modal dialog</p>

		<p>Jumping into source is a last resort for figuring out why something doesn&#8217;t work, but I&#8217;ll agree it&#8217;s a useful approach. &nbsp; The only way I figured out why my window creation code was crashing and burning when I called CreateWindowEx with an extended style of WS_EX_MDICHILD was by reading the Wine source code, for instance. &nbsp;I note that the strange behaviour is documented now. &nbsp;It definitely wasn&#8217;t when I was working on this.</p>
