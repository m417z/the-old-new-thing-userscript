		<p>After you&#8217;re done with the screening, buy / rent the DVD. Bruce Campbell does his entire commentary as Elvis.</p>

		<p>Please, No! I&#8217;ll never get that 1 1/2 hours of my life back.  I don&#8217;t care about the 4 buck to rent the DVD, but time is precious.  A friend at work recommended it to me and i&#8217;ll never forgive him for it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a cool concept but in reality i don&#8217;t think i lauged the entire time.  Perhaps if i had been a masochist and tried the commentary i would have  felt better about my choices.  As it is now, my wife doubts my judgement in DVD rentals.</p>

		<p>Different strokes for different folks I guess. My friends and I had a hoot watching Bubba Ho-Tep laughing throughout the movie.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s also showing at the Cambridge Film Festival (<a target="_new" href="http://www.cambridgefilmfestival.org.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.cambridgefilmfestival.org.uk</a>) on the same day, coincidentally. I must decide which films to book for before the good ones sell out.</p>
<p>alfons: No-one plays JFK. Ossie Davis plays a character who thinks he&#8217;s JFK.</p>

		<p>Ben: Or maybe Ossie Davis&#8217;s character really is JFK.  Just like maybe Bruce Campbell&#8217;s character only thinks he&#8217;s Elvis or maybe he really is Elvis.  It&#8217;s part of the tinfoil hat mystery of the story.</p>
<p>Since seeng the movie, I&#8217;ve been meaning to check out some of &quot;champion mojo storyteller&quot; Joe R. Lansdale&#8217;s other writing:<br />

		<p>At BioWare we had a small movie night.  We saw Bubba Ho-Tep and Storm Troupers 2.  To say the least, Bubba Ho-Tep was MUCH better. :)</p>

		<p>Well, I was disappointed.  It realy was kinda crappy.  Though, I&#8217;m not a total loser fanboy who would service Bruce Campbell orally.  The whole segment about how Ho-Tep got to where he is, the toilet hieroglyphics, the pimp outfit on the zombie, the incessant penis jokes that weren&#8217;t funny&#8230;  It was realy sad.  You can shoot it so that it looks like shit, but for chrissakes have a good goddamn script.  And as for that night at BioWare, sounds like a real hum dinger.  A screening of &quot;Storm Troupers 2&quot;?  I guess that is probably retard-speak for Starship Troopers 2.  Whoever chooses the pics to watch at that company should be fired immediately.  I&#8217;d rather watch Devine eat hot fresh steamy dog shit over and over while force-fed fudge than watch one more minute of that POS movie, ST2.  If you want more shitty movies to watch, I&#8217;d suggest the whole Troma video catalog, anything released &quot;straight to video,&quot; and any movie starring Eric Roberts.</p>
