		<p>OK, that was confusing. I just got the following error &#8211;</p>
<p>brain:3: Parse error at paragraph 3 &#8211; &quot;it was abandoned six weeks after roll-out&quot;. Ambiguous phrasing &quot;process&quot;. Try &quot;process (business)&quot; instead of &quot;process (computing)&quot; and redo from start.</p>

		<p>Everywhere I&#8217;ve worked, the normal response to the recall issue is &quot;Do not talk to the press; refer the person to PR&quot;. &nbsp;In such a case, the employee gets to hear the response at the same time as the rest of the public.</p>
<p>Not to get too far off topic, though, the &quot;let&#8217;s create a process&quot; can be a problem. &nbsp;Usually it results from someone not understanding or not knowing about the current process. &nbsp;In your second example, submitting a bug report is a modification of an existing process that I can agree with. &nbsp;But that only works if the first team knows all of their users. &nbsp;It may still be necessary for the first team to &quot;advertise&quot; &#8212; that is, have a public location (or mailing list) so that people can be notified of changes to the interface. &nbsp;Yes, this is more work, but it could just be a simple distribution list in Outlook or a page in SharePoint or a blog entry that people can check on to be notified of updates to the interface.</p>

		<p>Don&#8217;t forget to create the new process by committee. &nbsp;A new steering committee, created just for the purpose of solving this one specific issue, which will be disbanded once they&#8217;ve put that process in place. &nbsp;Of course, that&#8217;s part of why the process dies in six weeks&#8211;the people who came up with it aren&#8217;t around as a body any more. &nbsp;Yes, they&#8217;ve all been volunteered for some other panel that will be working on some other issue.</p>

		<p>heh &#8211; been there, done that, sat on the panel. This entry really made me smile, thank you.</p>
<p>One method I like (yes, it doesn&#8217;t work in all situations) for the last scenario described is where team1 says something like:</p>
<p>Interface 2.0 is now available</p>
<p>Interface 1.0 will be removed on today + N weeks/days</p>
<p>Some variations of that are to have messages inserted into the various methods of Interface 1.0 that print things like &quot;Using obsolete interface method. You should be using Interface 2.0::foo. This interface will expire and be removed on $date&quot;</p>
<p>A bit of work upfront, that done the proper way can provide some incentive to team2 to update to the new interface.</p>

		<p>Well said. &nbsp;In my experience, Continuous Improvement tends to transfer the burden to where it&#8217;s least visible. &nbsp;This apparently is a &quot;big win&quot; for management who now don&#8217;t have to be aware of the failing process, since it&#8217;s failing out of sight.</p>

		<p>This is not an insightful process, its the ramblings of a very frustrated worker. &nbsp;One problem is that Microsoft is it is full of workers grumbling about process. &nbsp;Few of those grumblers will progress beyond victimhood, and thats really holding the company back.</p>
<p>I agree with some of the points (ie, people shouldn&#8217;t be rewarded just for creating process&#8211; thats not &quot;Results Oriented&quot;). &nbsp;But there&#8217;s no real conclusion on how to fix the problem- you can&#8217;t just blame process and call it done.</p>

		<p>This is nothing compared to national politics. &nbsp;All the Democrat* candidates are announcing solutions to the &quot;subprime mortgage crisis&quot;. &nbsp;None of which would do anything except cause more problems.</p>
<p>*The Republicans are probably just slower on the uptake because the big bankers haven&#8217;t told them what they can propose yet.</p>

		<p>Looks like you&#8217;ve just described public office.</p>
<p>In the uk at least, the job ads for public sector staff look like jobs ads for people to handle such processes.</p>
<p>The number co-ordinators jobs which seem to be advertised for is immense. What is worse my reading of is it make matter worse not better.</p>
<p>Instead of n parties arguing over the problem-space you now have n+1.</p>
<p>Like a previous poster I thought you were going to ranting about bad program design &#8211; have you seen the analogous problem at Microsoft or anywhere you may have worked?</p>

		<p>I used to work at a company that was going through a long term bad spot of missed deadlines due to some poor decisions. &nbsp;Every week a new process was introduced to fix a problem that was identified last week. &nbsp;Of course, no process could fix the over-arching problem, only time and hard work.</p>
<p>The constant introduction of processes was a big distraction and frankly an insult to the people who were working hard to get out of the situation. &nbsp;Half those people eventually left.</p>
<p>None of the processes sounded like a bad idea that could be argued against, but taken in whole it was a mess that wasted precious time.</p>

		<p>victim, that sounds familiar. &nbsp;&quot;Your project is behind schedule. &nbsp;Let&#8217;s hold daily status meetings until we&#8217;re back on schedule.&quot;</p>
<p>Today&#8217;s meeting topic: how all these meetings are preventing us from catching up to the schedule.</p>

		<p>So, what is the right thing to do in these cases?</p>

		<p>&#8220;Let the safety team do their job.&#8221;</p>
<p>How do I know they are doing their job? I have no information from them, and I have customers screaming for information.</p>
<p>Possibly the other team is up to its eyeballs in alligators. Possibly they are all playing Tetris. I&#8217;m not sure which.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know of a good universal solution to this problem, apart from hire good people, hire good managers, etc.</p>

		<p>it does make sense to have this the &#8216;safety&#8217; team update internal staff though.</p>
<p>at our company it would be done in the weekly meeting. at larger companies it makes sense to use technology to express the status. it of course doesn&#8217;t make a great deal of sense to stop progress on the fix just to get it done, but the concept in general is appropriate. perhaps many companies get the implementation wrong; but that is bad management for you.</p>

		<p>&lt;i&gt;&quot;I agree with some of the points (ie, people shouldn&#8217;t be rewarded just for creating process&#8211; thats not &quot;Results Oriented&quot;). &nbsp;But there&#8217;s no real conclusion on how to fix the problem- you can&#8217;t just blame process and call it done.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;</p>
<p>Yep, bad processes are bad. But that doesn&#8217;t mean coordination problems don&#8217;t need to be fixed.</p>
<p>The problem is that, as an organization, we don&#8217;t construct ways to meet the ongoing coordination and communication needs of a business where interface between departments and with the public is crucial to getting the work done well. So the coordination snafu seems to take everyone by surprise. Dumb, yes. But building the organizational infrastructure never seems like a top priority, especially when the leaders&#8217; talents are primarily technical rather than strategic.</p>
<p>So set up the wiki and start using it. Run the liability issues through legal before there&#8217;s a legal issue putting pressure on the situation. Think ahead about what to do in a crisis. Is it important for the people who might get the calls to have good information? If not, then don&#8217;t spend time on it, but if it is, then recognize it and put something in place that&#8217;s self-maintaining and does the job.</p>

		<p>I thought the implication here was that a wiki-like structure would fail, since the relevant departments will be far more interested in dealing with the problem than actually telling other people about how they are dealing with the problem.</p>

		<p>I worked in a company and they were implementing some standard and there was HUGE discussion on processes and processes and processes.. So standard instructor asked.. what&#8217;s the advantage of processes? I said &quot;Processes are indpendent of people&quot; And then standard instructor asked &quot;what&#8217;s the disadvantage of processes?&quot; I shouted as much possible &quot;Processes are indpendent of people&quot;&#8230;</p>
<p>Jeez, let me do my job!! Provide me an assistant who will process all processses..</p>
