		<p>(3) has a real potential difference. Both (1) and (2) mean a simple version check is enough for which version to expect. (3) requires checking for the presence or absence of a hotfix.</p>

		<p>suppose they have an support agreement that entitles them to unlimited support cases, or more support cases then they would ever use in a given period. Why not ask questions for the sake of asking questions, What do they care if it took your hours to find the answer.</p>

		<p>Possible answer: &quot;We want to document the behavior for OUR customers.&quot; &nbsp;As mentioned above, this puts the hotfix case in a separate category from the XP-vs-Win7 case.</p>

		<p>More then likely the answer is &quot;Because my manager wants to know and is breathing down my neck about it. He isn&#39;t going to DO anything with it, but he&#39;s demanding to get an &#39;authoritative&#39; answer&quot;</p>

		<p>Seems to me they&#39;re asking so that they will know if the change was on purpose or perhaps an unintentional change that would be fixed later. Knowing that information would potentially keep them from having to re-engineer something when it&#39;s going to be just a transient issue.</p>
<p>No offense, Raymond&#8230; and perhaps the situation would have been helped if they actually replied to the last question you asked&#8230; but, the answer you gave really wasn&#39;t helpful and I&#39;d have been rather put off if that was the response I was given. &nbsp;(Then again, I would have explained why I need to know better than that person).</p>

		<p>@VIMH, Raymond&#39;s time (as is people&#39;s in general) is not free. &nbsp;If the customer doesn&#39;t have a reason for him to spend hours answering better than &quot;because I was curious,&quot; it&#39;s a waste of Raymond&#39;s time to figure it out.</p>
<p>@Tyler Reddun, then the Microsoft response can be &quot;file a support incident and we&#39;ll be glad to charge you for an answer.&quot;</p>

		<p>One possible answer: the customer wanted to deploy their app to Windows XP and Windows 7, and wanted to pass the Awesome flag to the XYZ function. This would entail backporting the fix to Windows XP (assuming the answer was 2), and giving the customer a hotpatch they could distribute with their app&#39;s installer.</p>

		<p>@arghhhhhhhhhhh: &nbsp;You could get all pouty about it, or take it as a life lesson to be direct and say what you mean. &nbsp;&quot;This behavior is different. &nbsp;Is this a bug or expected? &nbsp;Are there specific conditions that cause the difference so we can work around it?&quot;</p>

		<p>How is it unreasonable to ask for an explanation of the goal before taking on a time consuming task to answer a question, especially when it&#39;s couched vaguely? &nbsp;Chances are that if the asker can&#39;t articulate a coherent reason or goal, they didn&#39;t have a genuine need for the information anyway. &nbsp;(Not that it ever stops that type from asking.)</p>

		<p>The Windows 8 compatibility/compliance test program noticed that my employer&#39;s application is in the AppCompat list with a custom shim (i.e., not a standard shim). &nbsp;I figured out what exactly the shim does, but we don&#39;t know why it&#39;s in place, because what the shim is fixing we don&#39;t know. &nbsp;Who could we contact about this to get more information?</p>

		<p>@Myria: I believe Product Support Services should be your first port of call, unless anyone else knows better. However shims are applied only to a very specific version of an executable, so even a rebuild with a bumped version should remove any shims. Certainly a manifest declaring compatibility with a specific version of Windows should automatically disable all AppCompat functionality.</p>

		<p>I think Asdbsd is right. Hence it wouldn&#39;t have been useful for Raymond to fire up his VM, since he would have done more or less (but maybe with some more detail) what the questioner had already done. Then you see that the behaviour is different, but that was already known.</p>
<p>What the questioner wants to know is whether the change was intentional and if so, what the reason was, and if not, what the implications are.</p>
<p>The reason the questioner stopped asking was because he couldn&#39;t get a sensible answer.</p>

		<p>Hi, this BLOG post and the other you link to at the end is perfect. I have been supporting SDKs for Crystal Reports and related products for about 16 years now and we get these types of questions more often than you would think. Would you mind if myself or a colleague linked to this blog posting from on of our own blogs?</p>
