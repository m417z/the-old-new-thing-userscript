		<p>Scripting Internet Explorer this way has been very useful to me in the past when some data that you need to scrape is hidden behind some web interface.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure there are &quot;better&quot; ways to automate posting a few html forms and scraping the results, but the Internet Explorer API is very convenient and accessible to scripting (VBScript/JScript or PowerShell).</p>
<p>It seems to get a little more fiddly with every release of IE, because they shut down bits of the API as security vulnerabilities are addressed.</p>

		<p>Is there any particular reason, why one would use</p>
<p>new System.Threading.EventWaitHandle(false, System.Threading.EventResetMode.ManualReset);</p>
<p>to create the exit event instead of</p>
<p>new System.Threading.ManualResetEvent(false);</p>
<p>or is it personal preference?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Neither. It was due to ignorance. Manual&shy;Reset&shy;Event would have been much better. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Manipulating IE programmatically has been very helpful in the past for automating some thing (I had a class-registration program that was fairly popular for a while when I was in college). &nbsp;I especially enjoyed getting in and messing with the DOM and calling (!) Javascript functions on the page from my C# code.</p>
<p>The only thing I found frustrating was navigating the documentation for the myriad of COM interfaces that represent all the different versions and iterations of IE. &nbsp;IHTMLDocument, IHTMLDocument2, IHTMLDocument3, etc. &nbsp;Though I imagine my frustration there probably just shows my inexperience with COM in general.</p>

		<p>I wish there was an option in Windows to prevent programmatically / automatically opening the default browser without user consent. Too many installers or apps use that to spam the user with their website links. Besides being annoying, I have lost my saved IE session so many times because the browser window automatically opened and I quickly closed it not realizing I needed to restore my saved tabs from the last session first and then close it again. Or when such an IE session is opened, it should be separate private session for that program only that doesn&#39;t affect the user&#39;s saved session.</p>

		<p>Does this mechanism create a new IE process, use an existing one if available, or does it all work in-process?</p>

		<p>If you combine the two examples you probably want to close the windows as they navigate to the finished page rather than waiting for them all to navigate.</p>
<p>[Obligatory blog software gripe: the Post button is no longer in the tab order. Please refer to the accessibility guidelines. Thank you for your consideration.]</p>

		<p>@Neil: The reason for it &#8211; in case anyone is wondering &#8211; is because the POST text is inside an A tag which does not have a HREF attribute, and hence is not tab-stop-able.</p>
<p>The fix is simple. HREF=&quot;javascript:void(0)&quot; will provide exactly the same effect as current, but will introduce a tab-stop on the POST button.</p>

		<p>@xpclient, @Fleet Command: &nbsp;If you are using Internet Explorer (at least v8 since that is what I have), this option can be found under Tools -&gt; Options, General, Tabs section, Settings button. &nbsp;There is an option group in the resulting popup dialog that specifies how IE should behave when opening links from external programs.</p>

		<p>@Chris R &#8211; @xpclient&#39;s situation presumably is when the browser isn&#39;t running. &nbsp;You have IE closed (your session is now saved), you install some stuff, it opens IE, and because you didn&#39;t reopen the previous session, when you close it again, that single page is now the saved session.</p>
<p>@xpclient &#8211; but there is relief though:</p>
<p>1) Start IE and kill it. &nbsp;That will trigger crash recovery of tabs next time.</p>
<p>2) Go to %localappdata%microsoftInternet ExplorerRecovery</p>
<p>3) Use &quot;Restore previous versions&quot; to restore a copy of this, just copy over what&#39;s already there</p>
<p>4) Inside .Active you&#39;ll see RecoveryStore.{Guid}, several of them</p>
<p>5) Open Registry Editor, go to HKCUSoftwareMicrosoftInternet ExplorerRecoveryActive</p>
<p>6) You&#39;ll probably see at least one of the GUIDs there. &nbsp;In any event, for each of those RecoveryStore.{Guid}, add a REG_DWORD value with the name {GUID}. &nbsp;For example, {32716C92-3987-11E3-988A-00163839A1D3} with value 0</p>
<p>7) Next time you start IE, it will prompt you to restore your previous session because it &quot;crashed&quot;. &nbsp;It will use the RecoveryStore guids from the registry to determine what to restore, and voila. &nbsp;If IE was not running when the shadow copy was taken, you may need to do the usual &quot;restore previous session&quot; also. &nbsp;But some combo should get your session back.</p>
<p>The removal of shadow copies is one significant reason why I refuse to touch Windows 8.</p>

		<p>@xpclient:</p>
<p>This is one of many reasons I use Firefox and the Session Manager addon. I know, now you have two (or three) problems, but sometimes long-term improvements have a greater upfront cost.</p>
<p>@Mark:</p>
<p>I had no idea Windows 8 removed Shadow Copies (&quot;Previous versions&quot;). &nbsp;Microsoft says (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh848072%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/hh848072%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a>):</p>
<p>&gt; Previous Versions were rarely used and negatively impacted the overall Windows performance; as a result the feature was removed. In Windows 8, these features are no longer available</p>
<p>Just wow. Previous Versions were one of the killer features that pushed me away from XP. That&#39;s an astoundingly stupid decision.</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command, @ChrisR &nbsp;It seems you don&#39;t get what the issue is. @Mark Sowul, you get it, but your solution is not &quot;simplified&quot;. @Nick, yeah but for me, Firefox&#39;s usability is light years behind Internet Explorer.</p>
