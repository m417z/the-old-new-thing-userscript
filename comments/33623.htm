		<p>Well, I doubt Raymond has any control over the content of the microsoft.sitestream.com site, but maybe he knows someone that does.  It&#8217;s broken in FF 1.0.7.  None of the menu items do anything helpful (they sometimes bring up an interesting little sub-window thingy, but it&#8217;s blank), and none of them are really links (although they look like it).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s apparently all javascript (clicking the &quot;fundamentals&quot; menu item, for instance, registers a JS error: &quot;SessionText is not defined&quot;; from the markup, SessionText is the id of a span element, but according to the DOM standard, you can&#8217;t refer to an element by just its id, you have to use document.getElementById(&#8230;) to get at it), when IMO it should have been some real links and a server side script or two for the searches.  (Or at least, all of that would be cross browser.)</p>
<p>(Plus the server&#8217;s slow, but that may be because a lot of people are downloading stuff.  Or it may be because it&#8217;s lunchtime here, and our outgoing connection sometimes gets pretty busy around lunch.  I&#8217;m pulling the full zip file of Raymond&#8217;s session, and it&#8217;s going at about 13K/s.  Whee, only 2 and a half hours left!)</p>

		<p>Bryan, we&#8217;re working on both issues.  Perf is indeed slow, our vendor reports that they&#8217;re at max bandwidth right now but are trying to add more capacity</p>
<p>As for FFox, we are going to ask them about that as well.  I think what happened was that they developed the UI for the DVD set first, as an .hta wrapper, and then they tweaked those files to host on the web site.</p>

		<p>You mentioned that the video content can be downloaded. I looked for it, but didn&#8217;t find the possibility to do this. Am I missing something?</p>

		<p>Ah, OK, I see.  I wouldn&#8217;t have chosen the .hta stuff myself, but I can see why they would have.  And I can see why that would make it hard.  Not a huge deal, I suppose (I can always look at the page source and try to figure other URLs out from that); it&#8217;d just be nice to use my main browser.</p>
<p>I did get a download going using IE (which I realize isn&#8217;t as obvious as I thought it was when I wrote that), which is how I &quot;measured&quot; the speed.  It actually slowed down to about 7K/s by the time I left (4 or 5 hours into the supposed 2.5-hour download), and it still had about an hour left at that time.</p>
<p>And I just checked it again; after pulling down 129MB of 136MB, it actually *timed out*, and IE canceled the download.  (AAAAAUUUUGGGGHHHH!)  The speed at the time that it died was about 5K/s.</p>
<p>From what you said about the vendor, it does sound like they&#8217;re getting saturated (and the more people that find out about that URL, the worse it&#8217;s going to get, unfortunately).  Maybe I&#8217;ll just wait a while before trying it again, or something.  It is supposed to be good for 6 months, after all.  ;-)</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

		<p>I noticed something wierd about Raymond&#8217;s PPT: Almost all words got the spelling-squiglies. When I right-clicked one of them, PowerPoint complained that I don&#8217;t have Swedish proofing tools. I guess PowerPoint marked the text as Swedish&#8230;</p>

		<p>Jonathan: Raymond runs his software in several different languages.  His OS is apparently in Swedish(<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/10/17/481810.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/10/17/481810.aspx</a>).</p>
