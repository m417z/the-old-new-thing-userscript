		<p>So, from what I see here, the way Windows API treats its handles is the way a trigger-happy person fires a gun: He or she fires, regardless of the identity of the target: Foe, friendly or self. Thus, an additional function is put there to do the trigger-happy shooting and getting shot.</p>
<p>Why can&#39;t it just verify target ID before trying to kill it?</p>

		<p>It does verify the target ID. &nbsp;The handle is the ID.</p>
<p>For kernel handles, there is no race condition, because the handle can&#39;t be reused until you release your reference. &nbsp;USER and GDI handles are more problematic, because non-owners using the handle have no way to prevent reuse. &nbsp;Trouble arises, of course, when external code acts on these handles in a way that the code which owns them did not anticipate or permit. &nbsp;But if you don&#39;t have permission to dig into resources of another component, it&#39;s really not surprising if things go awry. &nbsp;And if you do have permission, then you can coordinate with the owning code to control the lifetime.</p>
<p>Note that steps to correct this have already been taken. &nbsp;USER and GDI have been replaced by a &quot;Modern&quot; API that is object-oriented and reference counted, so your concept of identity doesn&#39;t disappear if someone else closes the resource (you&#39;re left with a valid handle to a closed resource). &nbsp;Unfortunately there&#39;s no equivalent for desktop apps&#8230; it isn&#39;t clear to me whether it would be possible to make one, but I think so. &nbsp;There could be reference counted objects with one reference on behalf of (the user + all apps using the legacy handle) and that would disappear with DestroyWindow (for HWND) or DeleteObject (for GDI handles). &nbsp;But the underlying object would still exist, in a closed state, until all consumers of the new object API released their references.</p>

		<p>@Ben Voigt:</p>
<p>&quot;The handle is the ID&quot;. Actually, it is the person that gets killed. It&#39;s like giving the picture of person to a hitman to kill. Now, sometimes, C++ programs give the picture of themselves. So, they use FreeLibraryAndExitThread to give the picture, so that the mistake would be FreeLibraryAndExitThread giving a picture of itself and getting killed.</p>
<p>&quot;USER and GDI have been replaced&quot;. Nice, unless of course, you mean .NET Framework, which technically does not replace them. But can I have the name of this modern API, please? Or, of course, an MSDN link would be much better.</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command</p>
<p>It&#39;s more like an undertaker making arrangements for their own funeral with another undertaker.</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command:</p>
<p>Object oriented and no equivalent for desktop apps means the Windows 8 UI applications, or Windows Store applications is what I would guess at.</p>

		<p>Oh! I see! Ben Voigt was referring to &quot;Windows Runtime&quot;! I guess I got excited for nothing&#8230;</p>
