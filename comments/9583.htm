		<p>If you used JMP $+2 as a two-byte NOP, then the patch would require changing just one byte instead of two. This may be essential if the hot-patch point isn&#39;t DWORD-aligned.</p>

		<p>@A. Skrobov: I&#39;m guessing that JMP $+2 wasn&#39;t used because it messes up the cache (at least it did in 486s, which is when I stopped regularly doing assembly language); as well, a quick look could possibly miss that the function was patched (MOV looks quite different from JMP).</p>
<p>I&#39;m truly impressed by how far the operating system has improved in its ability to fix things up on the fly. IMO, this is way better than shimming in patches in the export table and orders of magnitude better than what had to be done in DOS (playing with the interrupt table or looking for magic sequences)!</p>
<p>Has this affected the working sets of the DLLs any? It probably hasn&#39;t, seeing as the alignment requirements have increased over time, but it would be interesting to know.</p>

		<p>From what I could tell, this behavior has changed in x64 versions of Windows. What&#39;s the best way to hotpatch a function on this architecture?</p>

		<p>How often do Windows DLLs actually get hot-patched? &nbsp;I feel like this is one of those features that you never notice when it&#39;s working properly, but you do notice when it&#39;s not &#8212; people get mighty grumpy when they have to reboot to install a patch.</p>

		<p>Well I would imagine this changed with vista and 7 as well on both platforms, mostly because of Data Execution Prevention (on by default on server, and turned on by security nuts like me on desktop) which would require that the entire page be taken offline, marked as not executable and writable, edited, and then marked non-writable and executable again and moved back into service.</p>

		<p>Why not a two-byte &quot;long NOP&quot; (0x66 0x90) instead? AFAIK, it would use even less resources (IIRC, the instruction decoder can recognize it as a two-byte NOP).</p>

		<p>@MGetz: good question &#8211; I wonder how they do it with DEP? &nbsp;To do what you describe sounds like you&#39;d have to suspend the threads anyway, which doesn&#39;t work according to this post&#8230; &nbsp;I must be missing something obvious.</p>
<p>(It&#39;s a cool-sounding feature; too bad there always seems to be some patch in the monthly patch release that makes me reboot anyway &#8211; it only takes one patch out of the group of 10 to cause a reboot&#8230; &nbsp;I guess the only advantage is that I&#39;m protected by some of the patches before I actually reboot.)</p>

		<p>@MGetz: Windows is not (in the general case) a w^x operating system &#8212; DEP merely enforces execution access control bits &#8212; there&#39;s nothing stopping a page from being marked both writable and executable.</p>

		<p>@Raymond: &quot;Who are these people who keep trying to patch code they didn&#39;t write?&quot;</p>
<p>Well, from following the Wine project, it seems they are mostly copy protection vendors (the Wine project, which is mostly written in C, had to add assembly stubs to a few functions to make them look more like what these broken programs expect).</p>

<p>My question was probably inaccurate to receive such a rude answer. Here&#39;s another attempt:</p>
<p>If you gave up that method on x64, is it because the whole hotpatching context is no longer relevant there, or because a better approach has been chosen? If so, which one is it?</p>

		<p>[Who are these people who keep trying to patch code they didn&#39;t write?! -Raymond]</p>
<p>I am one of them. Because Microsoft implemented POSIX.1 support by checkbox for each requirement without really understanding it, the brunt of dealing with it has fallen on application programmers. I disable my patching on Wine because it inherits a true POSIX.1 from the underlying architecture and so does not need to be patched.</p>
<p>It&#39;s always the same things that come up. User or applicaiton need to delete file in use: Unlocker (yes I know how dangerous) is popular because it allows it. Application needs a common storage area for all users on the PC: Raymond says use service. Setgid would be cheaper and more appropriate for most cases.</p>

		<p>Some applications which aren&#39;t yet installed do seem to get security patches downloaded and added to some list of updates somewhere. &nbsp;I am pretty sure that I have seen security updates for MS Works and some other, popular, non-MS programs which I didn&#39;t actually have installed, downloaded. &nbsp;I figured that the updates were downloaded so that if and when I installed those programs, the patches would be there. &nbsp;(Although somehow those patches have to actually get installed. &nbsp;Maybe I&#39;m confusing this with shims, which are listed in the registry whether those programs exist on the target system yet or not.)</p>
<p>Updates for Office programs are (mostly) not downloaded until after you install Office. &nbsp;At least, I know that once you install Office and check Microsoft Update, you&#39;ll see a bunch of updates for Office. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It&#39;s an interesting area, and I&#39;m sure it&#39;s tricky to manage.</p>

		<p>This is why the multi-byte NOP instruction was invented. Unfortunately, new general-purpose instructions like multi-byte NOP are most likely to be desired by those who can&#39;t use them for backwards compatibility. A shame!</p>

		<p>@Raymond Chen,</p>
<p>Great article as usual &#8211; thanks very much for the insight!</p>
<p>To your question about &quot;who are these people hooking other people&#39;s code?!&quot; &#8211; in our case, we hook other people&#39;s software to monitor its behavior and to layer &quot;modern&quot; functionality on top. Our target market is a large, established install base of a number of applications developed by other ISVs for particular vertical markets in the early 90&#39;s (!!) which are still in wide use today in industry.</p>
<p>We carefully study them and then do things like, for example, hooking TextOutA to observe what they&#39;re writing to the screen&#8230;combined with some relative positioning code it&#39;s pretty straightforward to know that &quot;Oh, he&#39;s in state X because the app&#39;s hand-drawn status bar says Y&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s definitely not the &quot;best&quot; way to approach this (wouldn&#39;t it be nice if everyone re-wrote their legacy apps with APIs and then re-deployed them to the hundreds of thousands of installed sites?!) but if you want to add value to existing installations which are going nowhere fast (these setups typically cost $20-$30K each), hooking is the way.</p>
<p>Another canonical example is a pokerbot &#8211; see <a href="http://www.codingthewheel.com/archives/how-i-built-a-working-online-poker-bot-7" target="_new" rel="nofollow">http://www.codingthewheel.com/&#8230;/how-i-built-a-working-online-poker-bot-7</a></p>
<div class="post">[<i>I was kind of jaded by seeing all the questions on stackoverflow of the form &quot;I&#39;m having trouble hooking this API / injecting code / patching this running application&quot;. It looks like 25% of all Windows applications exist in order to hook other Windows applications&#8230; -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>What would be way more interesting is to know, why &quot;mov edi, edi&quot; and not &quot;lea esi, [esi]&quot; or any of the other &quot;well known&quot; two-byte NOPs?</p>

<p>Now that&#39;s good to know.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>It&#39;s your app &#8211; you can compile it any way you like. Put 50 nops at the start of each function if you like.

		<p>&quot;Hot-patching is not an application feature. It&#39;s an OS internal feature for servicing. Who are these people who keep trying to patch code they didn&#39;t write?!&quot; &#8211; I agree wrt. applications trying to patch the OS, but it would&#39;ve been nice if we could use it for our *own* applications.</p>

		<p>How often (or under what circumstances) does hotpatching actually occur? I am wondering how likely it is for a rogue hotpatcher to be affected by a legitimate OS hotpatch.</p>

		<p>Rather than MOV EDI, EDI or LEA ESI, [ESI], I would have personally picked XCHG AX, AX (66h 90h). I can only guess that Microsoft must have had their own reasons for picking MOV EDI, EDI after lots of testing; do some CPUs perhaps choke on XCHG r/m16, r16 perhaps? Its easily plausible it would cause older CPUs to jump into microcode.</p>

		<p>&quot;Was hotpatching actually ever used in any update?&quot;</p>
<p>According to these guys, since Server 2003 SP2 it has not been used.</p>

		<p>In addition to the /hotpatch compiler option, you need the /functionpadmin linker option in order to insert the 5 (x86-32) or 8 (x86-64) bytes before the mov edi, edi of each function.</p>
<p>My question is, how does Windows handle the case where the &quot;mov edi, edi&quot; crosses a quadword boundary, or even worse, a page boundary?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Presumably the linker knows not to do that. (See: ALIGN directive.) -Raymond</i>]</div>
