		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>I&#39;m in IT but not programming, but I always tune in because of your great writing style, ability to say things as they are, and wisdom to keep away from slanting opinions most of the time. &nbsp;Everyone has an opinion, but there has to be a place you can go just to hear about the way things are. &nbsp;Thanks for that.</p>

		<p>From what I understand, SMART is quite poor at actually catching problems before they happen, or even noticing when they do (the latter is more my observation, the former is from some articles I read recently). &nbsp;So although I can understand frustration at &quot;healthy&quot; when SMART is indicating &quot;imminent failure&quot;, the reality is that HDDs don&#39;t have much self-reporting capabilities and any diagnosis from software is likely bogus.</p>

		<p>Raymond, don&#39;t change your objective writing style. &nbsp;Yes, there are trolls out there who will deliberately misinterpret what you say, but giving more subjective opinions will just give them more to feed off of. &nbsp;Keep up the good work.</p>

		<p>S.M.A.R.T existed since late 1990s. In 2000s, I heard MS&#39;s excuse that there are too many incompatible SMART implementations in the hardware, to add support to Windows. But even thaat time, this was very lame excuse. AT that time, there&#39;s been no more than 10 PC-class HDD vendors. Still exist: Seagate, WD, Tohiba, Samsung, Hitachi. Defunct: IBM (now Hitachi HDD business), Fujitsu, Maxtor, Quantum, Connor, Micropolis.</p>
<p>Soon it will be down to 3.</p>
<p>Luckily, WIndows 7 watches SMART data and warns the user of an impending doom. I wish MS were less half-assed this time, and allowed the user to see what&#39;s actually going on.</p>

		<p>&quot;because we hadn&#39;t bothered implementing a SMART reader&quot; is a pretty poor excuse. Still, at least there is one now.</p>

		<p>Interesting &#8211; never noticed missing support for SMART. Tools I used apparentl used their own drivers to talk to hardware. Not that I used it too much. At best manufacture specific tool can tell you something usefull like about SSD running out of sectors&#8230;</p>

		<p>Raymond, I agree 100% with what Drewster2000 said. &nbsp;And I admit to also being DWalker59. &nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>I understand now what Disk Management is saying. &nbsp;I suppose hindsight helps, but after a few releases of Windows, changing &quot;Healthy&quot; to something more neutral would help lessen misunderstandings. &nbsp;But I suppose it&#39;s not the most critical issue to worry about.</p>
<p>Thanks for all the insight over the years.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve found SMART to be pretty much completely useless. My daughter&#39;s laptop hard disk has major issues. SeaTools states it would be eligible for warranty replacement were it under warranty, but SMART reports that the drive is perfect. We&#39;ve run into the same thing with our embedded systems at my job. The engineer who deals with RMAs reports that in his experience, at best SMART tells you what you already know.</p>

		<p>&gt; I never said that this was a good situation, and commenter Dog interpreted that since I didn&#39;t say whether this was a good situation or a bad situation, I must be saying that it&#39;s a good situation.</p>
<p>&gt; Dog also assumes that Microsoft&#39;s PR department has told me not to opinionate on things. In fact, they haven&#39;t told me anything one way or the other (yet, and I hope it stays that way).</p>
<p>Microsoft&#39;s PR department never said that not opinionating is good, and blogger Raymond interpreted that since they didn&#39;t say whether this was good or bad, they must be saying that it&#39;s good.</p>

		<p>SMART is telling me that right now the drive in my laptop is running pretty hot&#8230; about 2,241,428 degrees F. I think the photosphere of the sun runs somewhere around 10,000 degrees F so the way I see it, we&#39;re all doomed.</p>

		<p>I sort of agree with DWalker59 on the loaded meaning of the word &quot;Healthy&quot;. &nbsp;This isn&#39;t quite like the war reporting scenario that Raymond mentions; rather, it&#39;s like reporting on Libya, and saying &quot;everything is OK&quot;, because you&#39;re only monitoring the traffic in Benghazi, and &quot;everything&quot; is cool there in your view. People read more meaning into that than they should.</p>

		<p>If it&#39;s all so very easy then why does HDTune not know anything at all about my Western Digital 500gb harddisk (doesn&#39;t even know if it has SMART), and reports the temperature of my Corsair Force 3 120gb harddisk as 128 degrees C? Probably because the interfaces are not as standard as you might think&#8230;</p>

		<p>@@Alex:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>If Windows contained some basic S.M.A.R.T. monitor, the HDD vendors would be at least testing their disks against it. Now that there are quite a few third party S.M.A.R.T programs, the HDD vendors are only testing their disks against just a few major implementations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Corsair doesn&#39;t have enough experience in emulating disk behavior. This is why their implementation is screwed. I guess, their programmers don&#39;t know difference between Celcius and Fahrenheit.</p>

		<p>@640k:</p>
<p>For quite long time (&quot;forever&quot; in technology time) the bad sectors has been silently redirected by the drive firmware to the spare locations. The OS doesn&#39;t see it. If the OS start to see them, that usually means the remapping area is exausted. Your drive produced too many bad block and is about to die.</p>

		<p>By this time, Disk Management should have evolved into a full blown advanced disk partitioning tool without many limitations (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_Management#Compatibility_problems" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Disk_Management</a>) and just basic features. Like Partition Magic or Veritas Volume Manager so we wouldn&#39;t need third party partition managers. Diskpart.exe is quite advanced but the storage team apparently thinks command line is cooler than GUI and doesn&#39;t build a full equivalent GUI in Disk Management for diskpart.</p>

		<p>@xpclient: But then all of those third-party vendors would cry &quot;Foul!&quot; over Microsoft&#39;s over-reaching.

		<p>@Raymond: &quot;Disk Management snap-in is concerned with volume partitioning&quot;. Why wasn&#39;t it called Volume Partitioning Manager then? By calling it *disk* manager, it&#39;s developer takes responsibility for *disk* managment. And that includes updating it when smart information became available.</p>
<p>@Alex Grigoriev: Disk manager doesn&#39;t report bad sectors if those doesn&#39;t disrupt partitioning. And when disks started using smart, features was actually removed because drives then hide information from the OS. Disk manager become non-smart when SMART was added.</p>
