		<p>I never thought the trench run took place along the equatorial trench. Figured it would be some random trench. The movie showed quite clearly what that equatorial trench was and the trench run looked nothing like that.</p>

		<p>Really? I recall the graphics in the briefing scene clearly showing a ship dropping a torpedo onto the top of the exhaust port, and then pulling up and flying away. The torpedo either travels down the port into the core, or explodes inside the top of the port and the explosion ripples down the port into the core.</p>
<p>Still, RotJ has a final dive into the core, so you only had to wait 6 years to eventually see it.</p>

		<p>I didn&#8217;t even know you can think it was the equatorial trench&#8230; it quite obviously wasn&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>Does the Death Star even have an equator? It only would have one if it spun along some axis. I don&#8217;t remember much spinning going on.</p>

		<p>It has to be able to spin because its superlaser only has a limited arc of fire. For instance, if it&#8217;s been attacking the rebel fleet, it would need to rotate 180° in order to destroy the moon of Endor. I don&#8217;t know how many axes of spin it&#8217;s capable of but at the very least it&#8217;s capable of the one necessary to name the equatorial trench.</p>

		<p>Well, it has to be able to orient itself in any direction in space, necessitating rotation around all 3 dimensions. That doesn&#8217;t mean that &#8220;it spins&#8221; &#8211; i.e. has a preferred non-zero angular momentum around a well-defined axis. In fact, if it did spin, the angular momentum would be an impediment to orienting itself in a given direction.</p>
<p>(Although, this is the Star Wars universe we&#8217;re talking about, so &#8220;conservation of momentum&#8221; and &#8220;in space&#8221; do not necessarily work the same way as they do in ours ;-)</p>

		<p>I was half expecting for you to have created that Death Star wireframe using HTML and CSS.</p>

		<p>Cool links to background material!<br />
I always thought the trench run was a random trench, rather than the equator. But I also wondered why the Empire would have had heavy cannons facing <b>down</b> the trench. Did they really anticipate enemies slithering through random alleys on the Death Star surface? Cannons everywhere would have been expensive! Maybe the filmmakers added cannons for dramatic effect. 8-&gt;</p>

		<p>Star Wars is full of inconsistencies, what is more important is whether it was supposed to be the equatorial trench. It looks like a lucky coincidence that the wireframe animation (that we know is wrong) gives a plausible explanation.</p>
