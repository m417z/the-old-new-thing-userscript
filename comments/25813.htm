		<p>&quot;I&#8217;m told that, contrary to stereotype, the men are taking longer showers than the women&quot;</p>
<p>And the women appreciate it. Really.</p>

		<p>I think the person you saw with the flat tire (on the last hill (4:23) was me. &nbsp;I was on that hill approximately that time, and recall someone saying something (I couldn&#8217;t define the actual phrase) as I crouched &#8211; hand pumping my tire back to a reasonable PSI.</p>
<p>I ended up riding the last mile on that flat and carried by bike across the finish.</p>
<p>Congratulations on the STP!</p>

		<p>The adult video store was having a sale &#8211; something like $7.95/dvd, which is actually a pretty good deal. &nbsp;I&#8217;m surprised no one stopped when I was going past it.</p>

		<p>What sort of training regimen did you use? I ask because I&#8217;m trying to get in shape, and the prospect of a big, fun, long-distance ride might be the sort of fitness project I could tackle. Given that I&#8217;m in no great shape now, how easily could I get into shape given that I have most of a year to prepare?</p>
<p>Additionally, how would I go about finding a group to ride/train with?</p>

		<p>Ray,</p>
<p>Very nicely written.</p>
<p>If you liked STP but aren&#8217;t sure if you want to do it again, I highly recommend doing RSVP next year. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s</p>
<p>1) Waaaay smaller (perhaps 1200 riders)</p>
<p>2) A bit shorter (178 miles or so in two days)</p>
<p>3) Far prettier (the first day ends riding on Chuckanut drive, which is one of the nicest views of Puget Sound anywhere)</p>
<p>4) Populated mostly by more experienced cyclists, so a) you aren&#8217;t worried about getting taken out as much b) *far* fewer personal support vehicles and c) easier to find a informal group of people to ride with.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s *slightly* hillier than STP, but not a lot. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you *do* want to do it, decide to do it in September. If you don&#8217;t, you might end up riding to your hotel at the end of the day. It also typically sells out around March or so.</p>
<p>Just don&#8217;t do it in the rain&#8230;</p>
<p>If you have questions, feel free to ask me&#8230;</p>
<p>EricGu</p>

		<p>&quot;thanks to the energy boost from the Coke&quot;</p>
<p>Yea, I always look for a coke machine 80 miles into a century. &nbsp;It really clears the mind for that last leg.</p>

		<p>Step 1 &#8211; turn your friends into bikers: &nbsp;Raymond, J and I eat lunch together almost every day. &nbsp;After two or three years of hearing about their bike commuting I started riding into work.</p>
<p>Step 2 &#8211; when you hang out with your newly minted biker friends these things just happen: &nbsp;How we all got roped into doing the STP was not particularly well thought out. &nbsp;It went down at lunch something like this. &nbsp;</p>
<p>me: &quot;I&#8217;d do the STP if I had time to train&quot;</p>
<p>J: &quot;you ride &nbsp;your bike 8 miles a day &#8211; you don&#8217;t need to train any more than that&quot;</p>
<p>me: &quot;um, but I don&#8217;t want to do it alone&quot;</p>
<p>J: &quot;I&#8217;ll come too&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Raymond: &quot;why not, I&#8217;ll come too&quot;</p>
<p>And then we were all signed up&#8230;</p>

		<p>A trick I use on organised multi-day rides (typically this one which picks a different bit of NSW each year <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.thbigride.com.au/" rel="nofollow">http://www.thbigride.com.au/</a>) is to (whispers) use the ladies facilities.</p>
<p>Now it doesn&#8217;t actually work when there&#8217;s a queue for the ladies (I don&#8217;t have quite enough gumption to queue, but I&#8217;m happy to sneak in). Nobody seems to mind, although I make a point of ducking in and out as quickly as possible and not being creepy (more creepy, I suppose some might say).</p>
<p>If you had female friend you could queue with it would probably work, too. I&#8217;ve escorted female friends into the male facilities at concerts (generally they get to queue jump to the cubicles, too).</p>
<p>The other option is to forgo the shower. I do not recommend this. Why it reminds me of the time I went 4 days without showering while cycling in the summer&#8230;</p>
