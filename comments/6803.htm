		<p>We have a conference phone in our office that does this fairly regularly, even when it is not in use. &nbsp;You can be having a meeting in the room and suddenly the phone will beep (with a distinctive sound) and reboot. &nbsp;It&#39;s amusing when you are not using the phone, but annoying when you are having a conference call. &nbsp;As a result, people rarely hold conference calls in that room anymore or simply use the regular IP phone that is also located in the room.</p>
<p>Our IT guy has looked at it and he cannot recreate the problem. He apparently left it connected to a conferencing service for well over an hour and it never rebooted. &nbsp;Oh well.</p>

		<p>We recently had a major internal network outage at my work and the entire building couldn&#39;t access anything on the network. &nbsp;Since I couldn&#39;t email the IT Helpdesk to let them know, I picked up my phone to call them. &nbsp;Unfortunately, it is an IP phone and it said &quot;Service unavailable&quot;. &nbsp;So I had to walk to the next building and report the outage in person to the helpdesk. &nbsp;I liked the old days of simple phones.</p>

		<p>That sounds like the work of a BOFH sysadmin.</p>
<p>&quot;I do not care if any of these phones are in use (and given how many they are in this network, some probably are in use), I want them to apply this important cosmetic software upgrade RIGHT NOW!&quot;</p>

		<p>On the bright side, this does make you appreciate the level of warning Windows gives you before an auto-reboot!</p>
<p>Over-complicating simple things is far too widespread now. My oven has some sort of built-in clock-timer. I have no use for it &#8211; I have a watch, phone and kitchen timer anyway which all work perfectly well &#8211; but periodically, the timer will decide it&#39;s nap-time and cut power to the oven. Other times it randomly starts beeping. (It was supplied by a large kitchen fitting company which has deservedly gone bankrupt already, so no help there.) One day I&#39;ll either replace it with a less obfuscated model, or break out the power tools and remove this non-feature permanently.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve never had a call disrupted by the handset rebooting, though for a while the clock was wrong by several minutes, and being a university, I occasionally get debt collectors calling looking for long-gone students who had put that number (which was used by a shared research lab, 3-4 years before becoming mine) as theirs. The built-in directory IS actually quite useful, though: it used to cost a fortune printing, distributing and updating paper directories for the old system.</p>

		<p>I held onto my non-IP phone until I was told they would no longer function. &nbsp;The Polycom phones we have now are a waste of money. &nbsp;Sure, they integrate with Lync, but only if I have Lync running on the desktop, in which case everything that is visible on the phone is already visible on my desktop. &nbsp;What&#39;s the point?</p>

		<p>My wife&#39;s &quot;smart&quot; phone reboots itself periodically. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s ever happened during a call, but it&#39;s annoying because it plays a little song (like the Windows startup song, only for her phone carrier). Apparently this happens even if the phone was &quot;off&quot; and the ringer off, meaning that if you&#39;re some place where you need to be quiet (class, a courtroom, a theater, a room with a sleeping baby), you should just not bring the phone.</p>
<p>We also have a cable box (the kind with a DVR) that likes to reboot (admittedly, sometimes due to crashing) in the middle of watching a show. And, unlike a phone that can reboot in under a minute, this cable box takes several minutes to reboot. You just have to hope that it doesn&#39;t reboot during something good.</p>

		<p>Think it is a great example of giving customers features they don&#39;t want. My phone has a directory, &quot;services&quot; button which I have no idea what it does, a quit button (again isn&#39;t that what hanging up is for?), a copy button (copy what to where?) etc. All I want is a phone. The only feature I think I&#39;d like is if the thing had a button for &quot;outside line&quot; so you didn&#39;t have to remember what code they set to get an outside call, even then it is usually trivial since most times it is 9. There is exactly 0 benefit to the end user for IP phones that I&#39;ve found, all the benefit is for the back office.</p>

		<p>We were having a whole-company meeting where the CEO was off-site. He dialed-in over Lync and we listened over some speakers the IT team set up. Suddenly, the audio cut out. The IT team starts scrambling. IMs are working, but no audio&#8230; I guess turning up the volume seemed like a good idea. A minute or 2 later, the speakers blast &quot;DROID!!!&quot;</p>

		<p>I worked at a company where we produced an office IP phone whose speaker &quot;popped&quot; during boot when it initialized the DSP. &nbsp;I&#39;m sure it didn&#39;t seem like such a big deal during development. &nbsp;I mean, so it &quot;pops&quot; once when the phone powers on, how often does that happen?</p>
<p>Well, it turned out that the pop pretty much became the phone screaming &quot;LOOK AT ME! &nbsp;I JUST CRASHED!&quot;</p>
<p>We fixed it in the 2nd generation hardware with a physical mux that muted the audio path. &nbsp;Fixed it because it was an imperfection, not to try to hide that the phone crashed. &nbsp;But it was certainly a nice side effect that the phone no longer advertised when it spontaneously rebooted.</p>

		<p>@Mike</p>
<p>There&#39;s a nice benefit to IP Phones for users. &nbsp;You can take your phone, plug it in anywhere (within your employer&#39;s network), and it has the same number. &nbsp;For those who get moved around a lot, this is great! &nbsp;It means your work number doesn&#39;t change or have to be reassigned to a new port when the Office Manager decides it&#39;s time for a game of Musical Cubes. &nbsp;You can also bring your phone to a conference room and wait for that private phone call to come in.</p>

		<p>@Avi &#8211; that&#39;s not a benefit, it&#39;s a feature.</p>
<p>For us it means that when a phone doesn&#39;t just reboot but completely dies (as has happened) you can&#39;t just pick up a spare handset or take on from a desk where someone happens not to be in today, and use that.</p>

		<p>@Ens I&#39;m guessing from the rest of his post the Jalyon Smith is saying that the feature that the phone number is tied to the IP phone has pros and cons, it&#39;s not a pure benefit (advantage).</p>
<p>It has the benefit that you can move that physical phone anywhere on the same LAN and the number still works. &nbsp;It has the downside that if that physical phone breaks you can&#39;t just plug another handset into the same jack; you have to have to reprogram another IP phone with your information.</p>

		<p>&quot;a quit button (again isn&#39;t that what hanging up is for?)&quot;</p>
<p>That assumes you&#39;re using the handset. &nbsp;If you&#39;re using the speakerphone or a headset, you can&#39;t hang up the handset without picking it up first.</p>
