		<p>@John</p>
<p>It could always be a kid just learning to program by playing around on his own that doesn&#39;t really understand the basic concepts of how function calls work and how expressions are evaluated. After discovering this &quot;exploit&quot; and not understanding what is really going on, he can tell his friends about all how he is an amazing hacker finding all sorts of flaws in Windows. His exploits are so advanced that the Microsoft employees he reported them to couldn&#39;t even figure out how they work!</p>

		<p>No, wait, it&#39;s worst.</p>
<p>Every operator, including comma also has the vulnerability. And even just (). Oh wait even if you don&#39;t write anything at all. It must be a vulnerability due to ending the lines with ;</p>
<p>Maybe the JS guys were right after all.</p>

		<p>The actual vulnerability is apparently that LoadKeyboardLayout() can be called after executing arbitrary code &#8212; and by extension every API function has this problem. The solution is to make LoadKeyboardLayout() return an error if it detects it was executed after arbitrary code. We can&#39;t know what the code was, so we have to be conservative.</p>

		<p>@JM: I agree! &nbsp;This &quot;arbitrary code&quot; thing is such a plague. &nbsp;We really just need to stop attackers from being able to use &quot;arbitrary code&quot; and all the security vulnerabilities would go away, amirite? &nbsp;Can we get that implemented in Windows 8 &#8212; a security feature that turns off &quot;arbitrary code execution&quot;?</p>

		<p>I&#39;m glad that Microsoft takes security seriously, but I&#39;m surprised that you allowed this particular incident to consume so many resources. Programmers worth their salt would be able to recognize the flaw in the logic of this report very quickly. At that point, I can understand going back to the original submitter for clarification. After the reply you were given, you can conclude that the submitter is either profoundly confused or so poor of a communicator that it will be nearly impossible to get to the meat of the issue.</p>
<p>This sounds like a very expensive Denial of Service attack. Find a few hundred people to each file a vague but concerning vulnerability report. Now sit back and watch while Microsoft wastes several developer years following false leads.</p>

		<p>In the same vane, disabling the signature verifying code in the bootloader (this can only be done by modifying the bootloader) to load a modified kernel is not a security vulnerability.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  &gt; As I recall, this entire investigation took five days to complete, plus another day or two to complete the necessary paperwork. &lt;&lt;

<p>So the real vulnerability that was exposed was a denial-of-service attack on Microsoft&#39;s security vulnerability investigation team. &nbsp;Anybody can send in a knucklehead security defect description and tie up those resources for a whole week!</p>

		<p>I think I&#39;ve seen all these comments before, but they have today&#39;s date. &nbsp;It appears that Raymond has found a way to DoS his blog readers, by repeating themes from past posts. &nbsp;The theme event triggers a predictable cascade of rants against Microsoft by the readers&#39; installed handlers&#8230;.</p>

		<p>&gt;They live in the shadowy ground between the reports that are clearly crackpot and the reports which are clear enough that you can evaluate them with confidence.</p>
<p>&gt;Oh, we recognized it immediately. But it was so obviously wrong that we began to fear that we were missing something.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t see how these two statements fit together. If this report didn&#39;t hit the &quot;crackpot&quot; bar then what does??? Or did you mean it overflowed the scale and came out negative? You said yourself it&#39;s obviously from someone who doesn&#39;t know how computers work.</p>
<p>@AC: Wrong on all accounts, IMO. Not worth wading through with the kernel debugger, but the article was definitely worth a read.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>That is not crackpot. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/07/10035143.aspx" rel="nofollow">This</a> is crackpot. While the initial reaction is that it&#39;s obviously from somebody who doesn&#39;t know how computers work, it could be that the problem was actually more subtle. (For example, maybe the <code>system</code> call left the system in just the right state that an uninitialized variable in <code>Load&shy;Keyboard&shy;Layout</code> caused a second copy of Notepad to run.) Think of the news articles where somebody finds a real exploit and adds, &quot;I reported this to Microsoft, and they said there was no security vulnerability.&quot; -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I like how you take the time to personally contact an anonymous crackpot wasting your time, but you don&#39;t contact paying customers who report non-security bugs that affect their ability to actually use their computers. It&#39;s like you care 100X more about your company&#39;s security reputation than the well-being of customers whose cash eventually becomes your salary.</p>

		<p>You should have gone back to the customer and chastised him for writing such insecure code:</p>
<p>main(system(&quot;notepad.exe&quot;), NULL); // Launches notepad!</p>
<p>Joking aside, although you might fault Microsoft for wasting (in hindsight) 5 days investigating this issue, you can&#39;t fault them for taking security seriously.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: you&#39;re right, that *is* a serious concern. You should file a meta-vulnerability report.</p>

		<p>@No One: actually, Windows already has a feature like that &#8212; kernel drivers need signing and the same move is being made towards BIOSes. And, of course, console hardware tries its best to prevent arbitrary code from being executed, though most such schemes have been circumvented.</p>
<p>An OS that utilizes &quot;default deny&quot; for all code would be a severe pain to administer, but you could certainly make it more secure than OSes that will run any old executable. Of course, on such an OS a function like &quot;system&quot; probably should not exist &#8212; makes it too hard to keep an overview of what code is calling what, even if both caller and callee are trusted. If it did exist, its use would be regulated so that not just any old application could start Notepad, but only those authorized to do so. And that is *before* checking user permissions.</p>
<p>Now, one problem this leaves is that the security doesn&#39;t really properly percolate to all levels. What if the processor contains malicious microcode? Could have slipped in during an update. Not just any process should be able to add two numbers together, is all I&#39;m saying&#8230;</p>

<p>And how on earth is &quot;caring about security&quot; supposed to be the opposite of caring about the well-being of customers who are harmed when people exploit security holes?</p>
<p>Some people just love to complain.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t think he was complaining about caring too much about security. &nbsp;I think he was complaining about being overly sensitive to the point of wasting a few days on something that is obviously not an issue. &nbsp;If this came across my desk I would not even bother to test it, let alone kernel debug a number of Windows versions. &nbsp;On the flip side, perhaps this report is so dumb that it just shuts your brain down and forces you to validate your very existence.</p>

		<p>Great read. Good to know Microsoft keeps a good eye out on security and listens to reports. &nbsp;It may not have been the best idea to inform the masses that your time can be abused with frivolous reports, but then again, any bug submission system is susceptible to abuse, it&#39;s not just Microsoft. &nbsp;To criticize Microsoft as being the center of fault for not skipping over the issue is rather short-sighted as some critics are relaying. &nbsp;Some people just want to watch the world burn. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Maybe all those who would immediately dismiss this as crackpot don&#39;t realize that real bugs that seem as impossible as this do in fact occur. &nbsp;I&#39;ve no doubt that some of those result in security vulnerabilities. &nbsp;Spend some time thinking about Raymond&#39;s example of an uninitialized variable in LoadKeyboardLayout() containg some remnant of the execution of that call to system() and it&#39;s not hard to imagine that bizzare linkages involving calling a particular sequence of otherwise benign APIs could in fact result in a security loophole.</p>

		<p>How about kernel memory exaustion by opening COM port, setting infinite timeouts, queueing a READ request, and then queuing a bunch of IOCTL_SERIAL_SET_QUEUE_SIZE with big buffer size requested (over a page, like 1 MB). Is it bogus or not?</p>

		<p>@algerl: Why bother? Until the system is no longer susceptible to forkbomb-like techniques this is pointless.</p>

		<p>This is great: Mike says &quot;It&#39;s like you care 100X more about your company&#39;s security reputation than the well-being of customers whose cash eventually becomes your salary.&quot;</p>
<p>Could this be the first time that Microsoft has been criticized for caring too much about security at the expense of raking in more cash ? &nbsp;I find this heartwarming.</p>
<p>Raymond, your blog (which I love) used to have a clever sub-heading, something along the lines of &quot;enriching our learns etc&quot;. &nbsp;Maybe the new sub-heading should be &quot;haters gonna hate&quot;. &nbsp;Or &quot;they see me codin&#39;, they hatin&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>Also, I&#39;m impressed you&#39;ve kept this blog up in spite of all the pointless knee-jerk criticism and nit-picking.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m actually fairly impressed at the attention bug reports are paid. Definitely a change in opinion about how serious I think microsoft take security issues. Fair play for investigating this even if you did suspect it was a waste of time.</p>

		<p>I remember when this one came in. &nbsp;There was a surprising amount of investigation done on this on &#8211; what Raymond left out was that the investigation was done in parallel on every version of Windows that is supported, even those under a custom support agreement (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://download.microsoft.com/download/3/a/5/3a5b342b-2f1b-4ebe-9261-98205902a74f/custom_support_agreement.pdf" rel="nofollow">download.microsoft.com/&#8230;/custom_support_agreement.pdf</a>)</p>

		<p>&quot;Apparently, the submitter didn&#39;t quite understand what we were after, because the response was just more of the same.&quot;</p>
<p>Attention a-holes: When a support contact asks you a question, before you do anything else, ANSWER THE G**-D*** QUESTION. Or at least acknowledge that there was a question and you&#39;re not sure what it means.</p>

		<p>Yep, FYI CSAs for Windows cost $50,000 per quarter for the first year after end of support, and increases every year thereafter.</p>
