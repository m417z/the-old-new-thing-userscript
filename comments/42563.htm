		<p>Brings up some interesting points about Microsoft culture. I was telling people for quite a while that Microsoft was reportedly a fantastic place to work . . . then they tried to hire me.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it was just a problem with the guy who was headhunting me, or if it&#8217;s a problem with all of Microsoft, but he made it very clear that my opinions about what I wanted to do meant nothing to him. I&#8217;m a gamer, see &#8211; I want to make games. End of story. I told him this, and his response was &quot;Well, I don&#8217;t think games are very important, and so I&#8217;m going to suggest that you work for our research department.&quot;</p>
<p>Gee. Thanks for invalidating my entire life.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I&#8217;m not working at Microsoft, don&#8217;t plan to, and no longer tell people that Microsoft is a good place to work. Even a practically doubled paycheck (which is what they were offering me), plus all the non-inconsequential perks of working at MS over working at a 15-employee company in Bellevue, isn&#8217;t worth giving up my plans for the future.</p>
<p>So it goes.</p>

		<p>Yup, blue blazer and tie. I&#8217;ve since explored other colors, though.  Still wearing the hat, John?</p>
<p>Zorba: Whoever headhunted you was a dork. Sorry you got soured on the whole idea by that recruiter. (I wonder what the recruiter&#8217;s reaction was once they discovered that Microsoft has an entire division devoted to writing games&#8230;)</p>
<p>Gary: Not sure what you&#8217;re getting at. Do you want DOS stories?</p>

		<p>Last month or so, Raymond showed up in shorts to pop in while on vacation.  People actually came by to see because they&#8217;d heard rumors about it.</p>
<p>Gotta second the opinion on Zorba&#8217;s experience &#8211; someone&#8217;s an idiot.  It doesn&#8217;t make sense to tell someone that they can&#8217;t do what they love &#8211; people do better work when they love it.  You can&#8217;t just shoehorn people like that.  I honestly think you got a bad one, Zorba, but I hope you&#8217;ve got something good these days.  ;)</p>

		<p>I lost that hat, but I have a new one just like it&#8230;</p>

		<p>I missed the Dress Like Raymond Day (AKA &quot;Make Raymond Wear Normal Clothes Day&quot;), but if I recall, you set it up as a charity fund raiser for your school, right?</p>
<p>The picture of Raymond in the blue suit in back of David C&#8217;s pickup truck covered in ice and Dom Perignon is a favorite.</p>

		<p>Apologies for bumping an old entry.</p>
<p>Did the DLRD occur or after before your success on the t-shirt competiton circuit?</p>
<p>One year, you had boasted on winning the MS &#8216;Most Unique T-Shirt&#8217; award (or was it the &#8216;Most Sexy T-Shirt&#8217;..) After reading Kraig&#8217;s account of your reputation, one must ponder the motivations of the judges.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Raymond made a special effort today.. Let&#8217;s give him a n-i-c-e reward to encourage him&#8230;&quot;</p>
