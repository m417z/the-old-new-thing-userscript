		<p>As far as I remember there is a specific problem with SRW locks. You cannot re-acquire lock recursively, but you are likely to succeed if you try. Because they are lightweight, there is no error indication on re-acquire. You will only notice the problem when there is a real concurrent thread which is waiting for the lock and the original thread tries to acquire again. In this scenario, the statement &quot;For now, you can also ignore the threads that are waiting for the lock, since they are the victims not the cause.&quot; is not true.</p>

		<p>I remember deliberately passing slim locks around like cigarettes in a manner that broke lock validators.</p>
<p>The code was provably deadlock free but the automated routines couldn&#39;t handle it.</p>
