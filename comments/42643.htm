		<p>Raymond, I am no expert in Unicode, but from a seminar I attended a few years ago and from <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#French_Accents" rel="nofollow">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#French_Accents</a> it would appear that your example 4 is incorrect (ie no in France). This is an oddity of the French language that I do not remember having learnt at school in France, but discovered while living in England!</p>

		<p>It is my recollection that French rules for capitalization is that when an accented character is converted to uppercase, it loses its accent mark. Therefore, a capital E compares equal to any accented lowercase e, because there is no such thing as an accented capital E.  (However, an unaccented e does not compare equal to an accented e.)  French Canadian, however, preserves the accent mark on capitalization.  That was the rule I was trying to exhibit (and failed).</p>
