		<p>One of the first uses for the content indexing system was in fact a MIPS machine (this was 1995) indexing the Windows source code. I&#8217;m not sure if it was actually running on OFS or just using the indexing engine from it. I am pretty sure that the current indexing engine is a direct relation to that one, though.</p>

		<p>Admit it, you guys just use that room to play classic mid-&#8217;90s Origin games which never, ever worked under Windows. (Not a compatibility slam; much as I might wish otherwise, Crusader especially used so many low-level hardware tricks it would never run without a program like VMware or DOSBox.)</p>

		<p>Man! I would have loved a machine like that. Back in the 90s I had a screaming 486DX running at 100Mhz, later replaced with a Pentium 133.</p>
<p>I still remember how blazingly fast my new Pentium Pro 200Mhz was. But I still wanted an Alpha machine â€“ they were screamingly fast.</p>

		<p>This brings up a question I always wondered about. &nbsp;How close was the Windows 2000 AXP version to being done? &nbsp;The decision to end the support for it seemed to happen about the RC1 time. &nbsp;I wonder if there is anyone out there still plugging away with Windows 2000 on an AXP machine. &nbsp;Fastest Exchange servers one could get at the time.</p>

		<p>The Alpha was serving one function there at the end of its life &#8211; keeping Raymond&#8217;s office warm. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That sucker sure put out the heat &#8211; so much so that the A/C worked extra hard to keep our part of the building cool. &nbsp;The offices around Raymond&#8217;s (including mine) were extra cold because of this so I got a retired Itanium and plugged it into the wall to fight back.</p>

		<p>My college was a beta site for DEC. &nbsp;I remember when we got a rawhide. &nbsp;We normally only had 1 of each model to start with, so the machines were given the name of the computer model. &nbsp;It was running OSF/1 or Digital Unix, whatever it was called at the time, not Windows, but I remember it being a very powerful machine for the time.</p>

		<p>We continue to ship Alphas! While Microsoft might have aided the demise of the Alpha, by eliminating any hope that Alpha volume would ever grow to that of the x86, it didn&#8217;t stop users who needed to run their VMS applications on hardware more modern than a VAX from buying Alphas. Folks like the US and British Navies, whose warships continue to rely on OpenVMS continue to buy 833 MHz 264DP&#8217;s from Microway,and we have enough components to support them for at least another 20 years. Looking for a new Alpha?</p>

		<p>&quot;(I can&#8217;t even say &quot;an expensive table&quot; since the value of the computer was probably nil by this point.)&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, man, it must only have been about 18 months ago I bought an AlphaServer on eBay; it now runs VMS, Tru64, Linux, NetBSD and NT 4.0 &#8212; lovely piece of kit. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t think I paid more than 100 UKP though. &nbsp;It&#8217;s one of a dozen test machines in my office &#8212; we target various flavours of Unix, plus VMS and Windows.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t get me started on Itaniums &#8212; we ended up buying a refurbished HP rackmount for an eyewatering amount of money, to support OpenVMS/I64, HP-UX and Linux. &nbsp;Couldn&#8217;t find a machine being thrown out for love nor money!</p>
<p>[And another lament that Windows 2000 for Alpha never saw the light of day here; would have been nice to have tried the beta/RC/whichever version did make it out.]</p>

		<p>Why do you need an Alpha to compile to Alpha binaries? Surely there are cross-compilers &#8211; my 32-bit machine can compile AMD64 binaries just fine.</p>
<p>Or maybe I&#8217;m just reading it wrong?</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Well, try it sometime. &nbsp;Cross-compilers are fragile beasts to start with, and it gets more complicated if you are trying to cross-compile for a different operating system (mainly because you need the header files from that OS, which might not even be legal to copy them).</p>
<p>And after all that, do you trust the cross-compiled code to run bug free if you don&#8217;t have an actual machine to test it on? &nbsp;Especially if it&#8217;s mission critical software, you better have native hardware to give it a test on&#8230;</p>

		<p>&quot;Cross-compilers are fragile beasts to start with,&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>vince, why would they be inherently fragile?</p>
<p>I remember using the GNU compiler on SunOS, it was a multi-stage process. &nbsp;The first stage being compiled with the *nix native compiler, the second stage being produced by that compiler, etc.</p>
<p>I also remember that the GNU cross compilers tended to be a little flaky and had a shaky reputation.</p>
<p>However, I don&#8217;t think there is any natural reason for this.</p>

		<p>This really hurts, I had Win2000 RC1 running on a 4 way AXP 2100 by the time Compaq came in and took away all the hard work we had done to make this the best platform for Windows for the future.</p>
<p>I still remember David Cutler in all his excitement, sent us a mail at Digital, when his team first booted a (basic without windows stuff) 64 bit version of W2K, a couple of weeks later came the bad news.</p>

		<p>Keep in mind that the Alpha was probably the fastest machine to compile on, period. Regardless of what architecture you were compiling to, you probably wanted to run the actual compilation on the Alpha.</p>

		<p>Wow &#8211; Alphas!</p>
<p>I had three of them &#8211; I paid about $140 for the lot. &nbsp;I ran FreeBSD on mine, because I couldn&#8217;t find a copy of the Alpha build of Windows 2000. &nbsp;Mine were hugely fast, and I was very disappointed when I had to replace them with an Intel machine (when the electricity bill arrived).</p>
<p>A place where I used to work took over another company, and we found their entire AD running on an Alpha server with a late beta of Windows 2000, so it must have got quite a long way.</p>
<p>Rhys</p>
<p>p.s.: Raymond, the book is awesome! &nbsp;I&#8217;m about a third of the way through, and it&#8217;s definitely well worth reading! &nbsp;Well done!</p>
