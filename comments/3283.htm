		<p>I wonder if a child&#39;s first day at school is about as confusing and non-sequential as your dream? &nbsp;I bet it&#39;s a bit of a trip for little ones to suddenly be dumped into this very different power and time structure. :)</p>

		<p>So it was essentially an intentional Tacoma Narrows bridge?</p>

		<p>Sounds like one of those days when you drink alcohol but it have a longer than normal delayed before taking effect which makes you drink more and the after math you get more drunk than you planned to.</p>
<p>World is spinning like a badly written physics game. Your thoughts gets more and more strange. You suddenly develop extreme multitasking having the ability to talk while thinking on other things at the same time. Your limited short-term memory having a hard time keeping track of both tasks while also trying to keep the world from spinning +90 to -90 than it jumps back to +90 and repeats while having a wobbly, sort of water shader effect on.</p>
<p>The next day you feel sick the whole day and do not return to feeling normal until the day after that.</p>
<p>I bet it is the sulfites in the wine that cause the longer than normal delay before you feel the alcohol.</p>
<p>The trick is to drink lots of water and not sleep until the spinning have stopped but when it is spinning all you want to do is lay down or sit down.</p>
<p>Recording yourself is even more fun, you wonder the next day who took over my body, is that really me or an inferior genetic copy lookalike?</p>
<p>According to quantum physics the world is always wobbling, like that bridge, well more like a very fast vibrator, we just do not notice it. That&#39;s the theory anyway.</p>

		<p>You have some weird dreams!</p>
<p>I used to come here to read about the Windows programming topics, now I&#39;m mainly here for the dreams.</p>
