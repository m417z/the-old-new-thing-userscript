		<p>Is there a similar compatibility shim for DirectX? &nbsp;It wouldn&#39;t surprise me at all if there were lots of programs that assumed DirectX was always installed.</p>

		<p>The compatibility team is stuck in a lose/lose situation. They must add this sort of functionality in order to ensure compatibility. Doing this, however, just encourages future developers to continue to be sloppy. &quot;No need to pay attention to prerequisites &#8212; Microsoft will do that for us&quot;. It must be depressing to work on the compatibility team :(</p>

		<p>@Stuart &#8211; I expect that they don&#39;t promise to bake .NET into the OS because .NET changes a LOT faster than the OS does! So if you&#39;re going to have to get everyone to upgrade anyway, why worry about baking it in?</p>
<p>Also, it should be noted that XP (which existed before .NET) is STILL in wide use around the world (mostly because it works just fine for a lot of what people want to do).</p>

		<p>@Stuart: Because it&#39;s a slippery slope. &nbsp;If .NET gets included with the OS, then people would instead be griping about some other SDK/platform/what-have-you that&#39;s an optional component. &nbsp;Then people start complaining that Windows is so bloated, it comes with these 400 different DLLs I don&#39;t need. &nbsp;Oh wait, they already do that.</p>

		<p>By the way: it is perfectly possible (and not too hard) to create an installer that checks for the required .NET version (and other prerequisites), and downloads it if missing. That way you do not have to create a huge installer or multiple versions for people who already have the .NET framework.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s the worst of all worlds to ship a .NET Framework version with Windows and then have it be an optional (but default) component: Application developers can&#39;t rely on it being installed (it&#39;s optional!), but Microsoft has to service it with updates as part of the OS (it is after all part of the OS install, even if optional).</p>
<p>My guess as to why it&#39;s not just always installed? Secure computing initiative. It&#39;s optional so you can choose to not install it and thus reduce your attack surface. However, since only major corporations (and computer geeks) would ever bother practically everybody does have it installed anyway.</p>
<p>The end result is that we can&#39;t rely on it being installed, Microsoft still has to treat it as being part of the OS with all the support commitments that entails, and (almost) everybody still has the same exposure to any critical .NET flaws that might be uncovered.</p>

		<p>It seems strange to think that the .NET Framework isn&#39;t really part of Windows, given that Microsoft has been pushing it hard for a decade. At least Microsoft Update will recommend new versions, although not that insistently. Marc Lucovsky summarized the problem in his blog &quot;Shipping Software&quot; back in 2005 (Bing for it).</p>

		<p>The reason is the sales documentation made the claim that .NET was part of Windows Vista.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve learned the hard way that anything sales says is not to be trusted. Windows XP 32 bit only supporting 4GB RAM is not a limitation of the hardware. And they still told that lie with Vista despite the fact that Windows Server 2003 EE 32 bit already had support for more than 4GB.</p>

		<p>Microsoft gets heckled for shipping IE and Media Player with Windows from vendors of similar apps. If they ship .NET as a core OS component, I guarantee some other company would start complaining of anti-competitive practises.</p>

		<p>Talk to the windows update people. They seem to think that new .NET runtimes are pretty high priority updates and that makes me think that Windows IS a .NET delivery channel. As is the &quot;bing toolbar&quot; by the way. Dilluting the &quot;important&quot; in &quot;important windows updates&quot; is not a good idea. But I digress&#8230;</p>

		<p>The normal thing to do is to test your program&#39;s installer on a clean Windows setup. This even goes for the development environment. All of a sudden you realize your Visual Studio solution has dependencies for the packages installed on the local machine, and will not build on another one.</p>
<p>This also goes for Office (+ its fonts) as well.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>No, it&#39;s a limitation of the drivers. They have to be compatible with PAE. If the aren&#39;t, the system bluescreens. You can do that for the server platform with its more limited install base, specialized hardware and (normally) support contracts. You don&#39;t want that on the clients. &quot;Hey, I just installed 8 GB of RAM and now my system doesn&#39;t boot anymore! Windows suxx!&quot;</p>

		<p>I ran across the opposite of this, the other day. An application insisted that it HAD to have .NET framework 1.1, before it even installed. It didn&#39;t matter to this application that I had .NET Framework 4 installed. (Aren&#39;t the frameworks backward compatible?)</p>

		<p>I had the impression that .NET was always advertised to be the &quot;new&quot; WinAPI (with the bonus that it can partially be run under free reimplementations like Mono). To be honest, the only time I used .NET so far was trying vb.NET on a Linux-Machine, so in fact I do not know much about it, but as I had that impression, maybe many other people that do not know much about it have it, too?</p>

		<p>Really, how&#39;s this any different from Web designers who rely on Flash/Silverlight/Java? &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t matter what component is missing; developers should assume that components are missing and have some sort of method for the end user to install those components, or have a workaround for the lack of an optional one. &nbsp;Anything less is just laziness on the part of the developers (particularly since the installers that come with Visual Studio already look for dependencies and allow you to add those redistributables to the MSI package!)</p>

		<p>I&#39;m actually interested in whether you have any inside knowledge on the reason *why* the decision was made to not make Windows a .NET framework delivery channel &#8211; or whether you can make one of those inspired psychic guesses on the question.</p>
<p>Not making .NET a built in Windows component has several obvious consequences: .NET developers have to take extra steps to ensure the framework is present, adding to the costs of choosing .NET as your development platform; Microsoft developers working on Windows itself cannot do their development on .NET; and so on.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a .NET developer because I feel that those extra costs are worth bearing. But obviously Microsoft, as an organization, feels that .NET is a platform that offers some compelling features to developers. They think it&#39;s worth putting some large amount of effort into creating and promoting this development platform. Why *not* make it a built in OS component so that you can (a) aid with the promotion of the platform by reducing the costs external developers have to bear when choosing to develop on it, and (b) make those advantages available to your own internal OS developers also?</p>

		<p>Stuart, your convenience as a developer is not sufficient reason to inconvenience all other Windows users by making them have larger install images and larger backup disk images for junk that they never use. Junk not referring only to .NET but to whatever arbitrary things might be installed on the off chance that they could be used by something the user/console/embedded application server might install someday. Junk isn&#39;t an opinion on whether .NET actually is junk, just that it certainly is to those who don&#39;t use anything that needs it.</p>
<p>It also broadens the attack area and introduces risks with respect to competition regulators that might dislike favouring one toolset over another.</p>

		<p>Some versions of Windows *are* a delivery channel for the .NET Framework. In fact the version 3.5.1 included in Windows 7 can only be installed as a Windows feature. You cannot install the .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 redistributable on Windows 7 (and 2008 R2). Also the .exe hotfixes for .NET Framework 3.5 SP1 cannot be installed on 3.5.1. You need the Windows Update mechanism via .msu to do that. And to top it of .NET 3.5.1 is compiled in a separate branch for Windows. It means some hotfixes that were developed for .NET 3.5 SP1 were not even automatically available for 3.5.1 since the fixes were yet to be merged into the Windows branch and to be compiled and tested. </p>

		<p>@gkdada</p>
<p>No, they are not. Versions of .NET framework could live on your computer side-by-side perfectly. To be precise, there&#39;re 3 crucially different versions in general:</p>
<p>* .NET 1.1</p>
<p>* .NET 2.0 (3.0 and 3.5 are just packs of libraries on top of 2.0)</p>
<p>* .NET 4.0</p>
<p>So if you have only 4.0 &#8211; it can&#39;t help the program which depends on 1.1 &#8211; you should install 1.1. Or search for newer version of course :)</p>

		<p>If it&#39;s not a deliverable, then like Erwyn van der Meer said, it should include the MSI-based version. A single update should install on whatever OS the .NET Framework supports. MSI is the best and most robust installer technology Microsoft has created and MSU is the worst and most bloated disk eating crash-pone unreliable slow I/O intensive update installer technology Microsoft has ever created.</p>

		<p>@Medinoc: Create a Setup project, I think&#8230;</p>
<p>Regarding .NET framework versions that come with OSs, I think WinXP SP1 come with .NET Framework v1.0 runtime installed by default. My PC has this version of runtime installed but I don&#39;t think I ever installed anything that needs .NET v1.0.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m having trouble following the logic here. .NET Framework 2.0 ships with Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 as a mandatory component that cannot be uninstalled. Only the .NET 3.5.1 library components are optional. Only Server Core makes .NET 2.0 optional. It seems like the key technology that depends on .NET 2.0 is Windows PowerShell which is itself a mandatory system component of NT 6.2 (except Server Core where it is optional). It&#39;s also my understanding that other mandatory components like the Win7 troubleshooters are themselves dependent on PowerShell.</p>
<p>I get that if these dependencies did not exist, then Windows wouldn&#39;t need to ship .NET 2.0 to work but it does. Windows 7 is a ship vehicle for .NET 2.0. That&#39;s just a fact. It may be &nbsp;a true statement that there is no guarantee that .NET 2.0 will exist in all future versions of Windows but it seems distinctly unlikely that future versions of Windows will not ship a mandatory version of .NET for the foreseeable future unless and until Microsoft has some form of static linking for .NET or starts shipping a private .NET runtime to service system components the way that Windows has its own private C runtime library.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>I think you&#39;re confusing &quot;Windows includes X&quot; with &quot;Windows is a delivery vehicle for X.&quot; One is how things happen to be (e.g., because of internal dependencies).

<p>@Ivan</p>
<p>While what Ivan says is true, but it is possible to run older .Net apps under newer versions of the framework via an application config file. &nbsp;This is not the default behavior and might cause unexpected behavior if the app relies on an idiosyncrasy specific to the older version of the framework/</p>

		<p>&quot;MSI is the best and most robust installer technology Microsoft has created&quot;. Though the msiexe.exe programmers have never learned to use WaitFor functions instead of polling in a tight loop. I suspect this is why msiexec basically takes the whole processor.

		<p>It would help if the Visual Studio 2010 setup project type was bug free. Supposedly, you can create a setup project in VS, which will handle installing your app on a client&#39;s machine, including installing the correct version of the .NET Framework from microsoft.com if necessary. Unfortunately, I&#39;ve found it sometimes goes off and downloads the .NET 4.0 client framework when your app actually requires the full .NET 4.0 framework. Gives very nasty runtime errors on the client&#39;s machine! &nbsp;(Luckily in my case, the features my app used that wouldn&#39;t work with only the client framework were minor and easily replaceable, so in the end I was able to just remove them).</p>

<p>I must have missed where you defined &quot;delivery vehicle/channel&quot; to be a contract. That&#39;s an idiosyncratic usage on your part. I read it to simply mean the method by which your product is delivered to consumers. Honestly, I&#39;m not at all sure we are speaking the same language and maybe this is an example of &quot;Microspeak&quot;.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not at all clear to me that there is a meaningful difference between &quot;Windows includes X&quot; and &quot;Windows is a delivery vehicle/channel for X&quot;. On the face of it, the latter formulation is simply a more abstruse construction of the former. </p>
<p>I understand that you are saying installer developers need to take ownership of their dependencies but I&#39;m afraid that point is being obliterated by the cognitive dissonance of arguing an obscure point of reasoning that somehow Windows is not a vehicle by which Microsoft ships .NET to customers when it clearly is.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>To me, a &quot;delivery vehicle for X&quot; is &quot;a thing which is contractually obligated to provide X&quot;.
