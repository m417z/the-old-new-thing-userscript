		<p>Interesting. I was wondering why attempting to use the Windows key as part of a hotkey shortcut didn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>One (hopefully) interesting note: the OSS clipboard extender Ditto allows you to use the Windows key in its hotkey. I currently have it mapped to Windows + ` (grave accent mark), and this works just fine. Maybe the restriction you mention only applies to alphanumeric keys? Or maybe Ditto just listens for the keypresses itself without using the Windows API.</p>

		<p>One of the very first thing I install on a new computer is the good ol&#8217; WinKey utility that allows to map commands to Win+&lt;key&gt; combinations.</p>
<p>For me, it totally replaces all sorts of quick launch bars and other similar utilities.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it no longer works well on Vista. I miss it much.</p>
<p>(And since you assign hotkeys yourself, it&#8217;s simply up to you not to use combinations used by Windows)</p>

		<p>Any reasonable application allows hotkeys &#8211; especially system-wide ones &#8211; to be configured, including disabling them. &nbsp;Why should the shell be any different?</p>
<p>I would be rather upset if Windows+I became forcibly mapped to &#8220;Launch IE&#8221;, since I almost never use IE and have been using Windows+I to display my Inbox for almost as long as keyboards have had a Windows key.</p>

		<p>&quot;I currently have it mapped to Windows + ` (grave accent mark), and this works just fine. Maybe the restriction you mention only applies to alphanumeric keys?&quot;</p>
<p>May I suggest that you re-read the article?</p>
<p>The whole point of this article was to explain that it&#8217;s not impossible to use the Windows key as a modifier, but that doing so is a bad decision because all those keys are reserved for future Windows use. &nbsp;So if the shell in the future wants to use Windows+` for something, then your program&#8217;s binding likely won&#8217;t work anymore.</p>

		<p>Are the Windows hotkeys localized? &nbsp;The mneumonics make sense in English (Windows+E -&gt; Explorer, Windows+L -&gt; Lock workstation, etc.). &nbsp;Do people who use other languages get different combinations? &nbsp;Or are the mneumonics simply less meaningful for them?</p>
<p>I learned about Windows hotkeys only a couple years ago. &nbsp;I had no idea they were actually being used as far back as Windows 98 (and I&#8217;m a heavy keyboard user).</p>
<p>I notice the newer keyboard now label the windows key with &quot;Start&quot;.</p>

		<p>That these are reserved is in MSDN online now, but wasn&#8217;t there as of the library included in the January 2006 MSDN shipment (the last one with VS2003 documentation in it).</p>

		<p>Good Point:</p>
<p>Not exactly sure, but at least on my system Winkey-M doesn&#8217;t minimize every window: Google Talk doesn&#8217;t minimize. Winkey-D seems to minimize all the windows, not sure what the actual difference is. Also you can push Winkey-D a second time to restore all the windows.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

<p>No, they seem to be standard. (At least on all local windows version I have seen &#8211; mainly danish, but also polish, german and a few other)</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>And thanks for that. When you work with different local Windows version it is nice to know that i.e. Win-E brings up the explorer&#8230;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I will never understand why ctrl-F in danish wordpad/winword etc. means &quot;Format bold&quot; and ctrl-B is Find. (The danish words are Fed=Fat/Bold and Find=Find &#8211; so the reason seems to be that &quot;Format bold&quot; is a more used/important function then &quot;Find&quot;&#8230;)</p>

		<p>&#8220;Keyboard shortcuts that involve the WINDOWS key are reserved for use by the operating system.&#8221;</p>
<p>That feels really wrong!</p>
<p>Long time ago Apple had the idea to put it&#8217;s logo on the keyboard. Microsoft missed the train.</p>
<p>Later on, bad design in created a &#8220;Start&#8221; button (and other areas) that could not be reached using the keyboard. Instead of seeing it as a bug to fix, that was regarded as a opportunity to catch up. And we ended up with the &#8220;Windows keyboard,&#8221; with an extra &#8220;Menu&#8221; button and (finally) a &#8220;Windows&#8221; button. I guess marketing was really happy.</p>
<p>But we go beyond that. That key is reserved for Microsoft. &nbsp;Apple did not have the guts to say &#8220;don&#8217;t use the Apple key in your applications&#8221;</p>

		<p>&gt; After all, the CreateFile documentation doesn&#8217;t say &#8220;Do not create application data in the My Documents folder.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Anyone else come across the issue where Intel&#8217;s laptop software registers system wide hotkeys CTRL+ALT+arrow key. &nbsp;These clash with my companies apps short cuts and so my app doesn&#8217;t get them. &nbsp;What&#8217;s worse is that they change the screen orientation so our users have upside down screens!</p>
<p>One client worked out that the Intel software was involved but still e-mailed me asking me to change my app to sort out the problem. &nbsp;Why didn&#8217;t he e-mail Intel I mused. &nbsp;As Larry Osterman has recently said, these &quot;applets&quot; that take over your computer are the modern day viruses.</p>
<p>Now I&#8217;ve just read that I&#8217;m meant to avoid CTRL+ALT combinations, oh dear. &nbsp;But isn&#8217;t it a greater sin for Intel to register a system wide hot key that the user finds very hard to disable (or even work out what app is handling it?) and that overrides the app with the focus?</p>

		<p>My favorite Windows hot key is</p>
<p>{Winkey}+{Pause Break} to bring up System Properties. &nbsp;When I did server and scsi card installs at the beginning of my career, I would always get cred from the sysadmins, who invariably had to watch my every move, with that little trick.</p>

		<p>&quot;Show the desktop&quot; and &quot;Minimize all windows&quot; ARE the same.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just that the &quot;Minimize all windows&quot; has a bug that it doesn&#8217;t, um, minimize all the windows. &nbsp;It just minimizes the minimize-able windows. &nbsp;Which is probably why there&#8217;s no UI for that command anymore (Show the Desktop has &quot;won&quot;.)</p>

		<p>Nathan, since Ditto is OSS, you could find that out yourself. However, if I read Raymond&#8217;s post correctly, he does not mention that it is impossible to use the Win-key with RegisterHotkey, just that, as the hotkeys are reserved for the system, it *should not* be done.</p>

		<p>But Raymond, if the function documentation team were to specify intended usage, context constraints, etc. (i.e. the semantic web that makes all the bits and pieces into an operating &quot;system&quot;) then you would have nothing left to write about except people who don&#8217;t read or follow links. And half the WIN API coders would loose their jobs &#8211; hopefully the half that doesn&#8217;t read The Old New Thing.</p>

		<p>Win + I, I think, would stand for &quot;Internet&quot;, not just &quot;Internet Explorer&quot;.</p>
<p>And yes, /me &lt;3 MSDN online :D It covers almost everything one needs to know about Windows programming. Though I haven&#8217;t programmed for Windows in ages, probably &#8216;cos I&#8217;m too lazy to install MinGW.</p>

		<p>I think that many of these shortcuts are not clearly documented. This is because I discovered some of them after trial and error. For example, when I was using XP win+v used to activate voice recognition, win+h hand-writing recognition, win+c to help you complete a word during speech recognition and win+b to place focus on the notification area. These shortcuts where nowhere documented in Windows help. I guess the win+v, win+h and win+c were added by Office 2003 because they are listed on the Office website but you need to specifically search for them, i.e. the information is not readily available to someone that does not know that it exists. Also, win+b was nowhere listed even though it is clearly a Windows shortcut. Even if win+v, win+h and win+c were Office extentions, then it is strange since the language features they support sound like Windows Tablet features and not Office feature and they are also accessible from the Regional and Language Options in Control Panel. And even if they are only Office &nbsp;then they should not be using the Windows key I guess they are not following Microsoft practices.</p>
<p>In addition, Windows Desktop Search uses win+shift+f, so if Microsoft products can make such mistakes in using the Windows key then perhaps other similar application like Google Desktop may do they same? Google uses win+g.</p>
<p>But my main problem is with Vista documentation. I don&#8217;t think that again it is complete. Win+b for example is not listed and neither are the win+1 to win+&#8230; for activating Quick Launch shortcuts. I don&#8217;t think that win+v for voice recognition or win+h for hand-writing still work but again you never know.</p>
<p>Overall, if you go to gnome.org and you look for their accessibility features, you find a much better guide for using every, repeat every, aspect of the Gnome Desktop from the keyboard. Whilst on Vista some shortcuts are thrown here and there and no complete guide that would describe every little detail of accessing the interface from keyboard as in Gnome. For example, how do I bring up the context menu for a container like a folder or the desktop in Windows? In the Gnome documentation it explicitly says: &quot;Press ctrl+f10&quot;. But in Windows you have to find out by yourself. It turns out that you have to first unselect the currently selected item by pressing ctrl+space and then press the application key or shift+f10 for get to the context menu.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s little things like this that make a lot of difference. How to I resize grid columns from the keyboard? How to I short using a specific column header from the keyboard? How do I select multiple objects? Etc, etc. On Gnome everything is described. On Windows you have to find out yourself and in some cases no care for accessibility has been provided. For example, on Gnome you can press f7 and get a virtual cursor in a help document and browse it with the cursors. In Windowsm the HTML help viewer has no such feature and screen-readers were force to comes up with their own implementations of a virtual cursor.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re already staring at the documentation for RegisterHotKey or CreateFile, it&#8217;s too late to link to articles on good design. &nbsp;You won&#8217;t read them, because you already think you know how to do it best (or you wouldn&#8217;t be staring at the function documentation!).</p>
<p>Better, read the introductions and usage docs first; then move on to the function reference. &nbsp;Coincidentally, this is exactly how the MSDN library organizes docs in each topic: About, Using, and Reference.</p>

		<p>I totally agree that if Microsoft has reserved the Windows key for its own use, then apps should stay clear away from it. Because, as we all know, once it&#8217;s hardcoded in an closed-source app, all sorts of backwards-compatibility issues come into play.</p>
<p>But the *user* should not be prevented from assigning any hotkey they wish. Most apps that allow global hotkeys are configurable, and if I want to assign Ctrl-C or Wnd-D to in favoriate utility, I should be allowed to do so. Which, thankfully, is the case today.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d just point out that it goes without saying that this isn&#8217;t something really that should be blocked. After all, there are handy utilities that one can install with the idea of adding to or overriding Windows keys on purpose. eg, I use an app that overrides the Windows Flip3D view (Win+tab) with a custom one. They generally also include the ability to customize the keyboard shortcuts anyway so its not so much of an issue with them.</p>

		<p>Seriously Raymond, do you actually read people&#8217;s comments before replying?</p>
<p>Tom said:</p>
<p>Any reasonable application allows hotkeys &#8211; especially system-wide ones &#8211; to be configured, including disabling them. &nbsp;Why should the shell be any different?</p>
<p>You said:</p>
<p>There are group policies to disable the shell Windows hotkeys. (It&#8217;s always frustrating when people complain about things that aren&#8217;t even true.) -Raymond]</p>
<p>So basically, Tom asks for a configuration UI for hotkeys and you say &quot;You can turn them off in group policy&quot;.</p>
<p>Thats like responding to &quot;How do I repaint my garden shed?&quot; with &quot;You can demolish it with a hammer. (I hate it when people ask stupid questions.)&quot;</p>
<p>Not only did you not answer the question, you attacked him for even asking.</p>
<p>Have you considered a career in politics?</p>
<p>This is a good blog, Raymond. You are clearly a clever guy who has lots of useful insight, but your attitide to people asking honest questions leaves a lot to be desired.</p>

		<p>So&#8230; the Windows key is &quot;reserved&quot; by Microsoft to be used for only what they think is best. Yet&#8230; in this case, &quot;reserved&quot; means, &quot;hope you read everything published on MSDN&quot;, because it isn&#8217;t enforced. &nbsp;Until some time in the future that they see fit to add yet another barely-documented shortcut and disable any existing use.</p>
<p>Nice. &nbsp;Can&#8217;t imagine why there&#8217;s ever any compatibility problems.</p>

		<p>Thinking about it, this is going to make the forthcoming port of the Amarok music player to Windows a pain to use; it uses global shortcuts involving the Windows key for play, skip track, etc.</p>
<p>This is fine under Linux (in fact, it&#8217;s about the only way you can safely have a global keyboard shortcut without affecting some app), but an issue under Windows. Unfortunately, as far as I know there aren&#8217;t really any safe choices for global keyboard shortcuts.</p>

		<p>&quot;&quot;Show the desktop&quot; and &quot;Minimize all windows&quot; ARE the same.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just that the &quot;Minimize all windows&quot; has a bug that it doesn&#8217;t, um, minimize all the windows. &nbsp;It just minimizes the minimize-able windows. &nbsp;Which is probably why there&#8217;s no UI for that command anymore (Show the Desktop has &quot;won&quot;.)&quot;</p>
<p>No &#8211; they are very different; and I, for one, am glad of that difference. I use several applets that aren&#8217;t minimizable in some configurations, and the fact that they *don&#8217;t* get &quot;put away&quot; by Win+M is very handly.</p>
<p>Actually &#8211; it&#8217;s not even that Win+M skips over items that can&#8217;t be minimized; it skips over items that don&#8217;t have a taskbar eentry &#8211; such as Winamp or my chat program while I have told them to not create task bar entries.</p>

		<p>It seems no one has posted the CORRECT definitions of Win+D and Win+M.</p>
<p>At the risk of being redundantly redundant to Raymond&#8217;s link, I will point out the differences (although his link only indirectly references Win+D&#8217;s &quot;undo&quot; feature).</p>
<p>Win+D focuses the desktop, minimizes all minimizable windows, and temporarily hides all non-minimizable windows (except the taskbar). &nbsp;Once you change focus from the desktop to another app, the hidden windows are reshown. &nbsp;Pressing Win+D a second time undoes it&#8217;s effects, including unminimizing windows it minimized.</p>
<p>Win+M has NO effect on windows which cannot be minimized normally (IE no WS_MINIMIZEBOX style, and there are probably other rules too such as not being a tool window) and only minimizes windows which can be minimized. &nbsp;Win+M also doesn&#8217;t have the second-press-undo functionality of Win+D.</p>
<p>Lastly, Win+D has a taskbar context menu item: &quot;Show the Desktop&quot;/&quot;Show Open Windows&quot; and Win+M does not (at least in XP). &nbsp;So there.</p>
<p>I think if I found another app using a non-configurable Windows+key I would be a bit irked. &nbsp;Get your own key! &nbsp;Now on the other hand, users who know what they&#8217;re doing can happily make Windows+key bindings in their favorite media players and know what&#8217;s going on if they run into a conflict. &nbsp;On the other hand, ANY user can also make such key bindings and they might not know what&#8217;s going on if they get a conflict. &nbsp;On the other other hand, this isn&#8217;t very likely to happen since those users tend to upgrade Windows by, well, buying a new computer, and reassigning hotkeys would make the application warn the user the hotkey was now already in use. &nbsp;On the other other other hand, it still is possible Joe Average does an in-place upgrade to Vista and finds his favorite Win+X shortcut key no longer works and opens Windows Mobility Center instead, so perhaps apps should display a warning dialog when a Win+key is attempted to be bound? &nbsp;On the other other other OTHER hand, since this will only serve to confuse the 99.9% of users who will never have to worry about such a problem, it is probably best left out for simplicity&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>And this brings me to my point: I plan to avoid coding for an OS if I can help it. :) &nbsp;Now that I&#8217;ve said that, I&#8217;ll probably either end up at Microsoft working on Windows someday, or be a Linux contributor.</p>

		<p>I think global shortcuts ought to be ultimately chosen by the users rather than the vendors anyway. It&#8217;s nice to provide default ones, but rather than worry about what is safe just let the user reassign them if the defaults are not so good. Then if two programs collide, it&#8217;s possible for it to be resolved.</p>

		<p>&gt; Lastly, Win+D has a taskbar context menu item: &quot;Show the Desktop&quot;/&quot;Show Open Windows&quot; and Win+M does not (at least in XP). </p>
<p>Exactly. &nbsp;Windows 98 has &quot;Minimize All Windows&quot; and &quot;Undo Minimize All&quot; in the context menu (even though Win+D works;) XP (and Vista) have &quot;Show the Desktop&quot;/&quot;Show Open Windows&quot; (even though Win+M works.)</p>
<p>&quot;Minimize All Windows&quot; was v1; &quot;Show the Desktop&quot; was v2. &nbsp;v1 still exists but purely for backcompat and for geeks. &nbsp;(I use the pejorative freely because I consider myself a geek.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m afraid they&#8217;re not. &nbsp;One of them brings the desktop to the front of the Z order, the other doesn&#8217;t. &nbsp;Even in the guts of the OS, this means that they&#8217;re coded differently. &nbsp;It&#8217;s the same as the difference between one window being higher than another in the Z order, and a window being minimized, and the desktop is just a window like any other.</p>

<p>* DO NOT create files in &quot;My Documents&quot; that the user did not specifically ask you to.</p>
<p>* DO put such files in the AppData folder.</p>
<p>* DO NOT try to write to &quot;Program Files&quot; or &quot;Windows&quot; folders without administrator privileges.</p>
<p>* Even with Administrator privileges, think twice before you write to Program Files or Windows.</p>
<p>* Ensure that files you create have the correct ACLs.</p>

		<p>yep that link in the blog article, <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnacc/html/ATG_KeyboardShortcuts.asp" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnacc/html/ATG_KeyboardShortcuts.asp</a></p>
<p>indeed does not work. &nbsp;Or at least it doesn&#8217;t in FireFox, from Canada. &nbsp;It redirect to a 404 page.</p>

		<p>If the shell wishes to reserve a hot key, it could actually register it and bind it to no action. Applications then wouldn&#8217;t be able to violate the UI guidelines.</p>
<p>The shell, after all, has the benefit of getting in first. (Likewise, WinLogon gets to own Ctrl+Alt+Del and the operating system gets to own pagefile.sys. Neither is specifically protected.)</p>
<p>It could even offer some UI, so that end-users could re-assign the key but, in the absense of &quot;automating the UI by simulating input&quot;, applications still couldn&#8217;t.</p>

<p>But it doesn&#8217;t wish.</p>
<p>Not using system hot key is a guideline, not an absolute rule.</p>
<p>An application that provides ways for the user to configure global hotkeys (e.g. a hotkey to show/hide an the settings panel of a background application) should allow the user to choose Win+? keys.</p>

		<p>I can see why Microsoft wanted to reserve it for their future use &#8211; after all, what is a key with a Windows logo on it supposed to be used by?</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m not happy about this because it appears that nVidia have read this documentation (presumably it&#8217;s not a 404 for them?) and won&#8217;t let me allocate any hotkeys using it in their desktop manager thingy. Pity, because Win+1, Win+2 could have been &quot;move window to desktop 2&quot; or &quot;move window to monitor 1&quot; etc.</p>
<p>I do find it a bit irritating that Microsoft have managed to persuade almost every keyboard manufacturer in the known universe to add this key to every keyboard made (along with the even less useful right-click key), but wants it to remain useful for only a small set of predefined shortcuts which neatly avoid any useful window management features.</p>
<p>Question for someone who can read the documentation link: is a user &quot;allowed&quot; to configure hotkeys using the windows key? ie. does the restriction only apply to programs predefining hotkeys, or are they supposed to prevent users from doing so like in the example I gave above?</p>

		<p>Um, for people who can&#8217;t (or don&#8217;t) read the comments, the correct link is: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms971323.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms971323.aspx</a></p>
<p>I assume the old link worked when Raymond first wrote the article.</p>
<p>The actual guideline in that link says:</p>
<p>&quot;Do not use the Windows logo key as a modifier key for non-system-level functions.&quot;</p>
<p>Raymond&#8217;s post is the logical extension of that. If you assign a shortcut to Win+something, and a newer version of Windows comes along, it might override your setting. Seems perfectly simple to me.</p>

		<p>Raymond, how does this sound?</p>
<p>(somewhere in the CreateFile entry, PSDK or MSDN the following could be placed)</p>
<p>Relevant Design Guidelines (which is a url to <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://guide.msdn.com/?func=CreateFile" rel="nofollow">http://guide.msdn.com/?func=CreateFile</a>)</p>
<p>The database would pull up all relative info and display it, stuff like AppData, My Documents and all that stuff.</p>
<p>Obviously I feel sorry for the database aka guide team having to set up these matches/search index rules but the benefit for the developer is the addition of only one single link in the documentation for a function leading to all related info nicely displayed, something I&#8217;ve always wished for each time I have to Google or browse the PSDK or MSDN.</p>

		<p>Roger: The problem is not the number of links, it&#8217;s the number of guidelines. Whether you have 1,500 pages with one guideline each, or one page with 1,500 guidelines, it doesn&#8217;t make much difference&#8230;</p>
<p>If a developer doesn&#8217;t read the relevent &quot;overview&quot; chapters of MSDN and just jumps straight to the function reference, he&#8217;s not going to read your guideline page either, no matter how many times you link to it.</p>

		<p>Just an example how how tucked away such info is currently, take a look at where the guidelines for Windows Vista user experience is located:</p>
<p>MSDN&gt;MSDN Library&gt;.NET Development&gt;Articles and Overviews&gt;Windows Vista&gt;Windows Vista User Experience Guide&#8230;&gt;Guidelines</p>
<p>&#8230;ugh!</p>
<p>Progress Bars is under:</p>
<p>MSDN&gt;MSDN Library&gt;.NET Development&gt;Articles and Overviews&gt;Windows Vista&gt;Windows Vista User Experience Guide&#8230;&gt;Guidelines&gt;Controls&gt;Common Controls&gt;Progress Bars</p>
<p>Why isn&#8217;t that for example under:</p>
<p>MSDN&gt;Guidelines&gt;Windows Vista&gt;Controls&gt;Progress Bars</p>
<p>And good luck trying to search for:</p>
<p>progress bar guideline</p>
<p>the first result is about check boxes</p>
<p>searching for: progress bar guidelines</p>
<p>is better though and luckily first result brings you to the right page.</p>
<p>Having a MSDN &quot;Guidelines&quot; sub-search that prioritize and filter for this would be a dream, I know that I would be a extensive user of such a specific search.</p>
<p>Which reminds me&#8230;I&#8217;d better bookmark that vista guidelines page.</p>

		<p>&quot;But it doesn&#8217;t wish. Not using system hot key is a guideline, not an absolute rule.&quot;</p>
<p>Fair enough, but the title of this post uses the word &quot;reserved&quot; rather than &quot;guideline&quot;. There&#8217;s clearly a spectrum of how badly you don&#8217;t want apps to do something. My point was simply that *if* the shell feels that the logo key is reserved, then there are ways in which it could enforce that. If they only feel it is a guideline, then they have to accept that there are plenty of rude programs that will simply ignore the guideline. I guess that&#8217;s the downside of Windows being so successful &#8212; you get all the bad programmers targetting the platform as well as the good ones.</p>

		<p>You know, there&#8217;s something about one of these that has always bugged me. I seem to recall that the very original Windows 95 release mapped Win-C to the Control Panel. I remember doing it on my home computer at the time, as well as a school computer later. I noticed it stopped working in Win98, and I haven&#8217;t been able to make it do anything in later releases of Win95. Does anyone know if I&#8217;m crazy, or did it used to work? :)</p>
