		<p>And to think, I thought my nice backpacking tent, mummy bag and backpack was extravagent. &nbsp;While there are nights I just don&#8217;t want to cook (and I confess, I own a camp stove, because you can&#8217;t have Bar-B-Que all night for a week, and cleaning cookware used on wood is a pain.) I can&#8217;t imagine going camping and eating at an onsite resturant every night.</p>

		<p>All jaw-dropping except for the last bit about being driven to the first portion of a hike &amp; from the last portion&#8230;it sounds like an Appalachian Trail through-hike to me.</p>

		<p>And I thought camping at a place with an outhouse was luxurious!</p>

		<p>&quot;it sounds like an Appalachian Trail through-hike to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&#8230; except the Appalachian Trail goes between cities, and these hikes are maybe 5 miles long.</p>

		<p>Well, he&#8217;s right about driving to and from the termini of the A.T. &nbsp;Springer Mountain&#8217;s 75 miles or so from Atlanta (probably the most likely starting or ending point for travel to/from Springer), and there&#8217;s also about an hour drive from the nearest parking lot to Springer just to get to paved roads; Katahdin is six miles from the entrance to the state park where it resides plus a further 28 or so miles to Millinocket, the nearest town. &nbsp;The problem of &quot;getting somewhere&quot; while on the trail, other than further down it, is pretty much non-existent outside of starting and ending travel; hitchhiking or a little extra walking suffice to get most places off-trail that one would have much need to visit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too bad the kid&#8217;s not a few years older or so, else I&#8217;d suggest Boy Scouts instead, which would be far better in any number of ways. &nbsp;At that age Cub Scouts is the other option, but truth be told you do much less camping as a Cub Scout than as a Boy Scout (or at least that&#8217;s how it was for me) due to the younger age. &nbsp;Still, Cub Scouts wouldn&#8217;t be a bad thing either for him even if it didn&#8217;t mean too much camping. &nbsp;Another, less time-consuming option would be to just find some nearby hiking trails with good views and go for some walks; hopefully these people can stomach a modicum of physical exertion.</p>
