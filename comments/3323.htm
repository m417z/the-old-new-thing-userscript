		<p>This doesn&#39;t seem to be the case on Windows 7. I had Calculator somewhere in the middle of my list, then I selected &quot;Remove from this list&quot;. Of course it disappeared. But after I started Calculator just once, it re-appeared again in the middle of the list. Shouldn&#39;t it take a few launches to get back, or at least show at the bottom? Looks like the program got all of its points back.</p>

		<p>The order or position on the list isn&#39;t affected, once it &quot;makes the list&quot;, it&#39;s displayed there. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t move ever higher with rank until it&#39;s the top of the list (or would you prefer most-frequent be at the bottom to support Fritt&#39;s law?).</p>

		<p>I agree with George. I like to remove document-driven programs (like Word) from the MRU list, because I only launch them by opening documents. In XP, when I removed an icon, it took some time to reappear, and when it did, it slowly crawled from the bottom. In Windows 7, sometimes (maybe after launching the program from the Start menu?) the program instantly reappears in the former position. I use the small icons view, which gives space for about 20 icons in both OSes, and that allows the effect to be clearly seen.</p>

		<p>@LtCmdrKeene: what you proposes about Fritt&#39;s law is interesting. I also thought for some time about inverting the Start menu MRU list. After all, it made a lot of sense after moving the &quot;All programs&quot; item to the bottom for the very same reason. Then I realized that we scan a list top-bottom, so the first items we read are the top ones. The time and cognitive load of having to scan all the list to find the most recent programs (which would be in the last positions) would negate any benefit gained by Fritt&#39;s law.</p>

		<p>Have you verified this on Windows 7, Raymond? Because as others have said, Windows 7 MFU list behaves differently than what you described in the article. Also the NoStartPage trick doesn&#39;t work.</p>

		<p>Curiously, when you get to the support.microsoft.com link for the &quot;How To Prevent a Program from Being Displayed in the Most Frequently Used Programs List in Windows XP&quot; article, there is a System Tip:</p>
<p>This article applies to a different version of Windows than the one you are using. Content in this article may not be relevant to you. </p>
<p>Visit the Windows 7 Solution Center</p>
<p>That visit link takes you to the Support for Windows 7 home page. Good luck finding the equivalent article for Windows 7 there.</p>

		<p>NoStartPage does not work for the Windows 7 menu. I first thought it didn&#39;t work only for shortcuts that used AppUserModelIDs but it doesn&#39;t work at all. NoAppUserModelIDs works but it was easier to just add NoStartPage for the EXE than finding the shortcut&#39;s AppUserModelID.</p>
<p>TweakUI which could add NoStartPage worked on Windows Vista/7 x64 via a compatibility shim but the shim broke on Windows 8 x64 and MS is denying the shim broke. :(</p>

		<p>Lots of companies have such a policy where you can&#39;t make the company look bad. Look at Adria Richards formerly of SendGrid. <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/">arstechnica.com/&#8230;/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks</a></p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what your opinion is on that situation, SendGrid HAD to fire her. She was a developer evangelist for the company, meaning she was a public face for them. After that, no one would want to make contacts with her for SendGrid. That hurts SendGrid and thus she was fired.</p>
