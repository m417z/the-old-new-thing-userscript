		<p>Raymond, what I&#8217;ve seen some other authors do is to briefly chat with the reader and make their inscription based on that. &nbsp;It&#8217;s quite amazing, to me, to come up with something vaguely good in that amount of time.</p>
<p>If I ever order one, I will have no choice but to request the inscription, &quot;RTFM&quot;. (But maybe that&#8217;s preprinted on &#8217;em?) ;)</p>

		<p>Raymond, a well deserved congratulations!! &nbsp;You definitely have some very interesting knowledge to share with other developers. &nbsp;Any chance you&#8217;ll be tasked with writing more of your commentary in MSDN magazine?</p>

		<p>Someone told me that MSFT employees are not allowed to engage in profitable side ventures of any type. &nbsp;Is that incorrect, or was an exception made for your case?</p>

		<p>Since this post is likely to end up being a high-ranking search result for &#8220;old new thing book&#8221; and other such queries, I&#8217;ll take this opportunity to say that I just finished reading the book and, despite the fact that I&#8217;d read much of the information on your blog before, I still found it very entertaining and informative.</p>
<p>My only minor critique is that some bits of it are very code-heavy. Most of it is fine, but there were a few parts where there were just several consecutive pages that were almost entirely program listing, which I found I had to skip over. In my younger years I used to enjoy studying program listings from magazines and books, but it seems that my brain is no longer wired for quickly scanning code in printed form*. I found the text around the code in most cases told me everything I needed to know to understand the point you were making.</p>
<p>(* I wonder if perhaps this is because books don&#8217;t generally have &#8220;syntax highlighting&#8221; as you&#8217;d see in the programming editors of today. I wonder if there are enough possible shades of grey to print legible syntax highlighting in a book.)</p>
<div class="post">[<i>I too hate long tedious chunks of code. Any large chunks of code you find in the book were entirely reluctant. (I&#8217;m thinking specifically of the one in the Taxes chapter.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I think they&#8217;re just trying to share some of your profits.</p>
<p>But hey, at least it goes to a good cause. Or something like that.</p>

		<p>Now, what would the success criteria be? After all, everyone who reads your blog and enjoys it probably already has a copy of it. Unless, I suppose, those at Microsoft are made blissfully unaware of your insights and thus might actually come around to the store seeking knowledge, but then they wouldn&#8217;t know what &quot;The Old New Thing&quot; really is.</p>
<p>Such is the irony &#8211; those who know and wanted a copy probably already got one, and those who don&#8217;t, probably won&#8217;t. Unless the peer recommendation grapevine is really strong at Microsoft.</p>

		<p>&quot;Someone told me that MSFT employees are not allowed to engage in profitable side ventures of any type.&quot;</p>
<p>Writing a book (especially a technical one) is not exactly a *profitable* side venture.</p>
<p>Having said that, I do know of Microsoft employees that *do* have a &quot;profitable&quot; side venture (for example, Rick Brewster who makes Paint.NET &#8212; the software is free, but apparently he makes a tidy profit from the advertising and donations on the website)</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  I think you should sign it &quot;I can&#8217;t believe I had to write this.&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Since the idea of Raymond signing copies of his books first came up, I have been wondering what I would ask him to write should the situation ever present itself.</p>
<p>That quest is now over. Daev, this is utterly superb.</p>

		<p>I heard a joke about an English author in Australia who dedicated a book to Emma Chissit, since that what he thought the woman holding a copy said to him.</p>
