		<p>Why wouldn&#8217;t a coffee shop have coffee? I get the &quot;can you wait 4 minutes while we brew a new pot?&quot; thing a lot, but I&#8217;ve never had the experience of being turned away because they didn&#8217;t have ANY coffee.</p>
<p>Even in Japan Tully&#8217;s is the good stuff. Much better than the sour brew that seems to be common around here.</p>

		<p>Don&#8217;t have Tully&#8217;s around here, but I had that same thing happen at Starbucks. Not only did they not have coffee, they had no milk o_O;</p>
<p>They only had espresso-based drinks that didn&#8217;t require milk. That day I found out how nasty an &quot;Americano&quot; was.</p>

		<p>I can top this one. &nbsp;Once my parents told me they want into a startbucks only to be turned away because one of the employees had lost the tip of his finger in a grinder. &nbsp;They thought it was a joke until they saw the blood stained rags and an ambulence pulled up right as they were leaving. &nbsp;The manager told them that the store would get a detailed cleaning and that the machine in question would be disassembled and bleached (they did find teh finger tip BTW) but we still don&#8217;t go back there. &nbsp;Thankfully they opened another starbucks alot closer (because we didn&#8217;t see that comming).</p>
<p>I also attend a school that has a bar in the student center. &nbsp;Before the new management took over the bar was notorious for running out of beer and food. :P</p>

		<p>reminds me of going into an Indian restaurant (in the USA) for lunch that had run out of rice&#8230;.</p>

		<p>Mmm&#8230; Tully&#8217;s. I used to have a two-Dilletante-mocha-a-day habit. I would walk past a Starbucks (not hard to do, granted) to get to a Tully&#8217;s.</p>
<p>I think the only things I really miss about the Northwest are Tully&#8217;s and Kohana Mongolian BBQ in Bellevue.</p>

		<p>I once was turned away at my local Subway because they ran out of bread.</p>

		<p>&#8230;and recently my favorite local taco shop was out of hot sauce for several days. &nbsp;They said they got it from overseas. &nbsp;Why? I don&#8217;t know.</p>

		<p>Actually, exactly the same thing happened to me in May of last year in a Timothy&#8217;s in Toronto (on York St, should anyone care): this major-chain coffee shop was out of coffee. It wasn&#8217;t even all that late at night.</p>
<p>Apart from the coffee famine, it&#8217;s a great city to visit!</p>

		<p>I was at an IHOP (International House of Pancakes) recently that had run out of orange juice. &nbsp;I couldn&#8217;t believe it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand why they couldn&#8217;t send someone to the closest grocery store and BUY some, rather than waiting for their supply truck to deliver. &nbsp;Oh well.</p>
<p>They were also out of tartar sauce once (they serve lunch and dinner also). &nbsp;That&#8217;s not too hard to make from common kitchen ingredients&#8230;<br /></p>

		<p>Hmm, I went to a McDonald&#8217;s that ran out of Big Mac sauce once. But the best food WTF ever had to be going to Al&#8217;s Beef (an awesome Chi-town Italian beef place) and having them tell me they were out of beef.</p>

		<p>I remember going into my local &quot;Chicken Treat&quot; only to be told they were out of chicken.</p>
<p>After reading Rick Scott&#8217;s comment above I went and looked up &quot;Americano&quot;. I must say it does sound horrible. Where I live (Australia), filter coffee is as rare as hens&#8217; teeth. About the only chain that regularly sells it is McDonalds, and even they are moving more and more to espresso.</p>

		<p>Jonathan: As any Simpsons viewer knows, that&#8217;s easy to fix: just put the mayo out in the sun for a few hours&#8230;</p>
<p>lc: You don&#8217;t get coffee as a &#8216;big&#8217; drink, just shots of espresso? Interesting &#8211; my colleague from Slovenia says it&#8217;s the same there.</p>
<p>Here, on the other hand, I ended up with an Americano this morning, since Starbucks wasn&#8217;t open when I walked past it :-(</p>

		<p>A restaurant where I used to live, in Arizona, would open at 10 AM and close when they ran out of food. Every day. This would occur between 2 PM and 3 PM. Considering their food was cheap and the portions enormous ($3 USD for a 12&quot; chimichanga and a pound of fries) that was no surprise.</p>
<p>It was also no surprise that it was a front for money laundering&#8230; well I&#8217;ve really veered off-topic, but you get the idea.</p>

		<p>Yeah, the pay for wifi thing still doesn&#8217;t cease to amaze it. &nbsp;It makes perfect sense at an airport or other such &quot;captive audience&quot; place, but for coffee shops (Especially the Big chains like Starbucks and Boarders) to start charging (via T-Mobile) is kinda a joke. &nbsp;The longest the average user is going to be there is probably about 3 hours (note: longest AVERAGE, not people who make a living out of this place.) so if you buy the plan and use it every day for 3 hours &nbsp;5 days a week (which is pretty excessive) that&#8217;s $.30 an hour. &nbsp;But if you&#8217;re just there one day, that $1/hour+ Wifi,</p>
<p>Personally I like St. Louis Bread Co. (Panera for all you out of towners, we started it, it&#8217;ll never change in my mind!) who still give the wifi away for free, there&#8217;s never really enough people on it to really bottleneck it, so that&#8217;s not a problem, heck they might even be piggybacking on the Broadband that&#8217;s already in the resturant for the creditcard system. &nbsp;I&#8217;d love to see a day when pay for wifi at coffeeshops/eateries dies, but as long as T-Mobile is doing it, I doubt it&#8217;ll happen. &nbsp;They&#8217;ve also got the grip on airports and such, so it&#8217;ll always look popular to them.</p>
<p>(PS I know Boarders isn&#8217;t a coffee shop persay, but it is for the sake of this generalization.)</p>
