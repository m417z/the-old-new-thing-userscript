<p>By replicating Google&#39;s trick of 8.8.4.4, only this time with self-signed SSL and the public key shipped with Windows. Surely MS can use one of its addresses for that purpose. It has a class B.</p>

<p>Wait. I&#39;m by no means particularly knowledgeable about SSL, but your statement sounds backwards to me.</p>
<p>First, wouldn&#39;t injecting their own SSL cert not have worked unless they were able to register a new CA on the user&#39;s machine (or convince an existing one that they were running bing.com)? I thought that was the POINT of certificates. Second, I thought self-signed certs provide NO protection against MITM attacks, because they&#39;re not signed by a party (a CA) that the user has out-of-band knowledge about.</p>

<p>Wow I didn&#39;t even realize this had another way to read. Let&#39;s try this way: To defeat the ISP&#39;s mechanism, the default search provider should be changed to be self-signed SSL with a well-known public key to an IP address owned by Microsoft.</p>
<p>But yeah I would not dare redirect all DNS lookups through Microsoft&#39;s servers. That way lies madness.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Well, since the electrons leaving your house hit the ISP&#39;s routers first, they could always redirect all traffic destined for the hard-coded Microsoft IP address to their private servers instead.

		<blockquote><p>

<p>Meh. The AUP is an agreement between a party that agrees to provide service (the ISP) and another party that agrees to pay (the customer.) The forbidden activity clause was likely meant to apply to the customer, not to the ISP.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: That would break every installed copy of the OS if the IANA decides to tell Microsoft that their IPv4 block is being reassigned and would they please migrate to this other one before the end of next month? IP allocations come with an explicit understanding that the registry can change it at any time. This doesn&#39;t happen often (being a pain for everybody involved), but if word got out that a company as widely reviled as Microsoft hardcoded an IP address in their distributed software, the risk that somebody in the decision loop would feel motivated to think up a technically convincing reason that the block needed to be reallocated would be significant.</p>

		<p>@Henning Makholm: Microsoft has one of the old-school IP assignments that cannot be pulled without a stack of contract violations. While these may well all be pulled if IPv6 fails, at that stage the costs involved are a lot worse than one patch to what turned out to be one version of the OS.</p>

		<p>@Joshua, @Maurits:</p>
<p>Both good points. For the &quot;won&#39;t self-signed be worse&quot; example, I was thinking too much in the web situation &#8212; the OS vendor certainly has a very easy-to-use out-of-band communication mechanism to transfer their public key. :-) As for the &quot;the user won&#39;t have the CA&quot; argument, I was thinking too much of people like myself who just ignore the CD from the ISP. I&#39;d like to think that no ISP would *actually* install a new CA that they explicitly use for spoofing sites, but&#8230; well, let&#39;s just say I suspect there&#39;s someone out there who could disappoint me.</p>

		<p>[&quot;What kind of evil Microsoft shenanigans is this? Stealing all my DNS traffic and breaking my intranet.&quot; -Raymond]</p>
<p>I think Microsoft has done this once before, by hardcoding Windows Update Server IP so PCs won&#39;t be tricked to install update from fake update server by DNS poisoning.</p>
<p>If Microsoft would consider the ISP&#39;s action a security threat, Microsoft might do that once again.</p>

		<p>Although, Joshua, manually specifying different DNS servers may help,* and if more ISPs are starting to spoof DNS than maybe Windows shouldn&#39;t use the ISPs DNS servers any more. This would then also necessitate checking that the DNS server behind one of the built-in IPs isn&#39;t itself faked by the ISP of course.</p>
<p>However, I think that if this happens to you, you should immediately switch ISPs. There are plenty of ISPs that don&#39;t muck with your traffic. And send a letter to your previous ISP stating in no uncertain terms why you switched.</p>
<p>* I had to do this myself not because the ISP was evil, but because their DNS servers where slow and often crashed. So I specified some third party DNS servers. DNS is too important to be left to the ISP.</p>

		<p>Switching ISPs might be a nice idea, but it&#39;s easier said than done. Some devices (like a 4G tablet or phone) don&#39;t have a choice of ISPs. Many places only have a single broadband provider. My location has exactly two, and I&#39;m already using the good one. I&#39;m not going to switch sides to the Empire just because the Rebel Alliance did something really stupid.</p>
<p>Back when all Internet access was dial-up, there were few differences between ISPs. You wouldn&#39;t have to worry about getting a slower connection from one than another, but switching was painful because most people had email addresses connected to their ISP. If you switched ISPs, you had to switch email addresses, which is probably worse than switching broadband providers.</p>

		<p>@cheong00 &#8211; I think what you&#39;re referring to is where certain address lookups bypass the hosts file. They still use DNS &#8211; what they prevent is a change on the local machine *preventing* DNS lookups from occurring.</p>

		<p>@Henning Makholm, &quot;if the IANA decides to tell Microsoft that their IPv4 block is being reassigned&quot;</p>
<p>To where, exactly, would Microsoft&#39;s block be reassigned? &nbsp;Even ignoring Joshua&#39;s comment about contracts, they&#39;d probably have to reassign a whole lot of other folks to find a space for it.</p>

		<p>@Neil: Probably not, but if someone is in control of your connection to the Internet they could spoof the IP address of a host (not) quite as easily as spoofing DNS. Once you are at a point where you can&#39;t trust the infrastructure that you&#39;re on, nothing short of maybe VPN to a trusted infrastructure is going to help.</p>
<p>If I were in this situation, I&#39;d take it up with my government&#39;s telecommunication regulator. I would think that this violates your right to privacy just like if your phone company tapped your line without legal need.</p>

<p>I&#39;m sure they&#39;ll get right on that.</p>

		<p>Would hard-coding the correct IP address in your hosts file* be a violation of their AUP?</p>
<p>*Or local caching DNS server, so that you can fix your entire LAN at once.</p>
