		<p>FWIW, my Fiancee says my other Girlfriend is my Xbox, especially when new games come out. &nbsp;Which is very interesting, because when I bought Oblivion, I could pry her away from it with a crowbar. &nbsp;So I guess that would make the xbox both of our girlfriends? &nbsp;Hmmm that&#8217;s odd.</p>

		<p>Brandon: I rationalize the unusual stock photo as having been flipped horizontally so that the driver is not facing away from the text. Your eyes are likely to follow the gaze of the person in the photo, and it is a bit distracting to have your eyes directed away from the text, so it makes sense that a graphic designer would flip the photo to look better. I personally would have made the driver look like she was in the left seat of the car and put the photo on the left side of the text.</p>

		<p>@Mr Cranky</p>
<p>You seriously don&#8217;t understand? &nbsp;Raymond didn&#8217;t want to mention his wife because he probably doesn&#8217;t want anyone to focus their attention towards her, and he probably doesn&#8217;t want anyone trying to guess if she&#8217;s a Microsoft employee or what not.</p>

		<p>@ChrisR: Raymond hardly needs to worry about that. &nbsp;A little logical deduction will show that, given that Raymond is a bicycling Adonis and a god among men with a mind like a sort of Microsoftian Einstein/Hawkings/Batman, it can only be the case that his wife is some kind of hypersmart uber-babe whose brains, charisma and stunning good looks are as yet unsurpassed in all of human history. &nbsp;Anything else would be entirely unreasonable.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Other girlfriend&#8217;? the examples given from amongst Raymond&#8217;s friends appears to mean activities that are time consuming and provide enjoyment. The gender-based description is interesting. &nbsp;I wonder what &#8216;girlfriend&#8217; means that differentiates it from something not gender centric. &nbsp;&#8216;Name witheld&#8217; uses the term &#8216;relationship&#8217; after &#8216;husband&#8217; and &#8216;boyfriend&#8217;. &nbsp;Are terms like &#8216;love&#8217; or &#8216;paasion&#8217; inappropriate? &nbsp;My friends generally have several core loves, passions, and it is always good to hear them talk about their passions even if they are circuit boards or software code. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Does the term &#8216;other girlfriend&#8217; imply that there is something wrong with having this other passion? &nbsp;Many socieites promote a single family unit with a fremal-male relationship that are commited to monogomy for live (e.g. Christian). &nbsp;To have an other &#8216;girlfirend in this model might imply inappropriate behaviour. Was conveying the hint of inappropriate behaviour part of Raymonds intended message? </p>
<p>Other &#8216;girl friend&#8217; rather than other &#8216;woman&#8217;. Why a girl rather than a woman? &nbsp;Is the lack of maturity of the other love and important part of the meaning?</p>
<p>How do single people play into this model of relationships? &nbsp;Do Raymond&#8217;s single friends have &#8216;other girlfriends&#8217;?</p>
<p>Did Raymond even give the choice of the gender-centricity of the term a second thought? &nbsp;For example, &nbsp;</p>
<p>1) its the term my friends use so it&#8217;s the one I used, &nbsp;</p>
<p>2) the gender-specification is a good lead towards introducing my wife within my blog</p>
<p>3) since some of the other girlfriends are &#8216;male&#8217; and &#8216;inanimate objects&#8217; they themselves have no gender so using the phrase in this blanket fashion demonstrates that it&#8217;s application in non-gender-specific so it is ok to use</p>
<p>4) using a &#8216;other boyfriend&#8217; as a potentially provocative device for commenters &#8211; Raymonds &#8216;other boyfriend&#8217;!</p>
<p>Time for a good cup of tea and some promiscusous engagement with my passions, &nbsp;all of which are &#8216;other&#8217; to each other</p>
<div class=post>[<i>I think you&#8217;re thinking about this way too much. 5) It&#8217;s the term used by my friends&#8217; wives. Says so right there in the opening sentence. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>@::Wendy::</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that in my experience with this phrase the &quot;gender&quot; of the object/hobby recieving description is fitted to the person. &nbsp;So my &quot;Other Girlfriend&quot; may be my Xbox, but my Fiancee&#8217;s &quot;other Boyfriend&quot; is her books (a Small public Library&#8217;s worth.) &nbsp;We&#8217;ve alwas used it to cover any activity/hobby that takes a noticable amount of time. &nbsp;(Kinda like girl/boyfriends)</p>

<p>OK, so Raymond hadn&#8217;t mentioned his wife because many of his readers would express surprise to find out he had a wife. &nbsp;And those readers were surprised because Raymond had not mentioned her before.</p>

<p>Works fine on Firefox 3.0.x here. &nbsp;Yes, I know 3.5.x is out now, but we haven&#8217;t gotten approved to deploy it yet.</p>

		<p>My wife teases me that &quot;my girlfiend&quot; is the nice lady who owns the Vietnamese restaurant close to our house. The owner does indeed dote on me, and she notices when I&#8217;ve not been there in a while. If I look tired, she scolds me for working too hard.</p>
<p>The restaurant has a generic name, so my wife never remembers the name, and has settled on &quot;let&#8217;s go to your girlfriend&#8217;s for pho and banh mi&quot;.</p>
