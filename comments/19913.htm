		<p>And don&#8217;t forget to save as .png instead of .bmp. &nbsp;I&#8217;m amazed at how many 3MB screenshots that I get. :)</p>

		<p>I got asked to report bugs with Slashdot&#8217;s site a few months ago. Turns out they never read/respond/fix bug reports, but I&#8217;m still putting them in&#8230; the only difference is that the notations on the screenshots have gotten funnier and funnier.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a gallery of them:</p>

<p>And my particular favorite:</p>

		<p>Yeah, Crapdot has really stunk it up lately. &nbsp;Idle is an abomination, but at least it has its own section and can be ignored. &nbsp;Borking up the user pages is a criminal offense second in severity only to Hitler&#8217;s crimes (I am not joking). &nbsp;I don&#8217;t care for the relatively recent introduction of dynamically-loaded pages (i.e. Craphose and comments), but it&#8217;s not a huge deal; I just set my User-Agent to IE6 before going there and I get the old behavior.</p>
<p>Jess: Sometimes people do a Print-Screen and paste it directly into emails; this is highly annoying, as it takes up a lot of space both in terms of storage and screen area. &nbsp;It is especially annoying when the screen shot is so large that I have to use the scroll bars to see the whole thing.</p>

		<p>&quot;Sometimes people do a Print-Screen and paste it directly into emails&quot;</p>
<p>It took us a while to train our guys to use Alt-PrintScreen instead of Print Screen with no cropping when sending screen shots&#8230; they have dual monitors&#8230;</p>

		<p>Hey, just wanted to suggest to readers in the Firefox camp (and I think it has an IE plugin as well) to check out FireShot, which makes screenshot annotating ridiculously easy and pretty. &nbsp;I would never bother to make those circles and notations and stuff in screenshots as nice if I didn&#8217;t have a free Firefox plugin that does it for me! &nbsp;Really, there&#8217;s no excuse for unannotated screenshots when the foss community makes it so easy on us.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve noticed some developers write bad code as a sort of game. It&#8217;s sort of a system test &#8211; you&#8217;re supposed to do a code review, and I just hacked in this piece of crap code. Will you call me on it?</p>
<p>If the answer is &quot;no&quot;, a puzzle develops. Precisely how bad does my code have to be for you to say something? I can fix it later, in a separate checkin, so there&#8217;s no permanent harm. But if my function says &quot;bool IsEven(int parm){ return (parm == 2); }&quot;&#8230; I mean, honestly, are you even reading these?!</p>
<p>If the answer is &quot;yes&quot;, a different puzzle develops. How subtle an error will you let me introduce? If my function fails only on alternate Tuesdays when it&#8217;s a full moon and the year is an even multiple of 17, will you catch that? Again, I can fix it in a separate checkin, so no permanent harm.</p>
<p>Note that I am speaking from the viewpoint of a purely hypothetical developer who does this, and that developer is not actually ME. I&#8217;ve just seen this dynamic from the management side, and this is what I figure the people who do that are thinking.</p>
<p>It works out in the end&#8230; you see a pattern of progressively more and more subtle issues blocked at code review, or more and more egregious ones passing it, but they&#8217;re fixed rapidly &#8211; usually within the hour. I&#8217;ve generally found it harmless, so I tend to just let the team do it.</p>

		<p>With regard to creating puzzles when asking for help:</p>
<p>I help with a friends website, among other things I&#8217;m one of the main peopel users contact when they need help. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve heard things like this:</p>
<p>&#8216;I forgot the password to my other account. Can you help me?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;What&#8217;s the username?&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;I&#8217;m not telling.&#8217;</p>
<p>At this point, I just swear at them.</p>
<p>A lot.</p>
<p>(Every helpdesk&#8217;s fantasy, isn&#8217;t it?)</p>

		<p>This is why I use the Snipping Tool for taking screenshots when I want to show of bad behavior.</p>
<p>Circle the problem on the screenshot, add in some large red arrows pointing to said circle, and highlight any incorrect text. &nbsp;Include a before screenshot with the same area circled, and then include explanatory text saying &quot;why did UI element FOO change from BAR to BAZ?&quot; (And describe what user actions took place in between the two screen shots!)</p>
<p>Asking good questions is hard. :)</p>

		<p>The usage of the ellipses also seems wrong. It really seems like it should be four dots and with equal space rather than dot space dot dot dot.</p>

		<p>I second the Snipping Tool shipping in Vista. &nbsp;Snip is a great utility and I get mark exactly what&#8217;s wrong or highlight text, and saving the file in Ping, or emailing straight from the Tool is very handy.</p>

		<p>Another good one, if you can get your company to spring the $50 or so, is SnagIt. It can even take short movies, if you want to demonstrate an animation or failure-to-redraw type bug.</p>

		<p>Years ago I seemed to get more than my fair share of 4mb+ bitmaps of people&#8217;s desktop sent to me as a screenshot. This was a little bit annoying as our mailserver is located at the corporate HQ in another country, so it arrived at a glacial speed.</p>
<p>Then things progressed so that most of them were word documents with embedded pictures. OK, I can open those, no problem. Too easy.</p>
<p>More recently it became screenshots embedded in single slide powerpoint presentations. Its interesting that this must imply we are appealing to a new demographic &#8211; managers. Still too easy. I&#8217;ve yet to receive the &quot;Questions?&quot; slide at the end like you though Raymond.</p>
<p>Just recently though, I&#8217;ve had cause to lament the march of progress providing cheap electronics. I&#8217;ve started receiving screenshots taken with digital cameras, with lots of megapixels. The picture is invariably suffering a bit of camera shake so it is a challenge trying to infer what the text could be saying.</p>
<p>What next?</p>
