		<blockquote><p>
  I don&#8217;t understand why they were added to</p>
<p>  Win32, since there was already a way of</p>
<p>  embedding strings in resources, namely,</p>
<p>  string resources.
</p></blockquote>
<p>The kernel guys use structured 32-bit values for all status codes, and there is a strong need for a (localizable) message for every status code.</p>
<p>&quot;Win32 resources&quot; are not an exact fit this requirement, for a number of reasons. A more natural (IMO) approach is to have a single source file that defines the numeric codes and the message strings associated with same.</p>
<p>I suspect that the best reasons for this, though, are</p>
<p>1) They kernel guys came from the VMS culture where use of a message source file/message compiler was the system norm.</p>
<p>2) The kernel, and subsystem, use of same was in existence long before there was a Win32, i.e. back when the OS was &quot;NT OS/2&quot;.</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t of course give any direct reason why Win32 had to adopt the same convention as the kernel.</p>

		<p>Why is the last arg explicitly typed versus the old &#8220;&#8230;&#8221; indicator for a variable argument list ?</p>
<p>Is it a code-safety related change (so you don&#8217;t pass garbage, or forget a few params that cause garbage to be read off the stack, giving a potential attack vector), a MS preferred implementation manner, a language standard change or __ ?</p>

		<p>Strings in message tables are assumed to be in the &quot;current ANSI codepage&quot;, whatever that means, and for me that alone is almost incentive enough to never use them.</p>
<p>Strings in string tables are UTF-16, but they are, curiously, packed in bundles of 16 per resource, they are not NUL-terminated and have, instead, a prefix USHORT with the character count (basically making them wide-character Pascal strings). Whoever was responsible for that design sure had to be very proud of it.</p>
<p>Win32 doesn&#8217;t have a standard counted string type, so they cannot be used directly from memory and need to be copied instead. Word on the street is LoadString lets you access the original pointer+size in the resource section as an undocumented feature &#8211; figure it out by yourself. Personally, I prefer a combination of FindResource/LoadResource/LockResource and manually parsing the string bundle.</p>
<p>For some other curious reason, LoadString and wvsprintf are implemented in user32.dll rather than kernel32.dll, pulling in user32.dll (and gdi32.dll, and related kernel mode overhead) unnecessarily from many otherwise minimalistic libraries.</p>
<p>Raymond: I believe DWORD_PTRs are supposed to be equivalent to pointers in everything (size, alignment) but semantics.</p>

		<p>&gt; Better inconvenient than impossible. -Raymond</p>
<p>The &#8220;standard&#8221; solution to that is to provide two functions, one that takes a &#8230; and another that takes a va_list. &nbsp;See, for instance, fprintf and vfprintf.</p>
<p>(But since the &#8230; version merely forwards to the va_list version, with some va_start/va_end wrapping, it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;d be hard for users to write their own wrapper for FormatMessage. &nbsp;It might be nice if there was a standard wrapper, but oh well.)</p>

<hr />
<p>Maybe he meant that, by default, the .mc source file is assumed to be in the current ANSI code page. &nbsp;Indeed it is.</p>
<p>But, actually, mc gives you &quot;Unicode or ANSI&quot; control over both input (-a/-u) and output (-A/-U), with -a -U being the default.</p>
<p>Possibly such control is a relatively new feature; I dunno.</p>

		<p>I think the question is valid.</p>
<p>Given that the function name is FormatMessage, you kind of expect the word MESSAGE to be in some of the flags that are passed to it. In particular, FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_HMODULE sounds like a request to load the &quot;message to be formatted&quot; from a resource. The person who asked the question probably didn&#8217;t know about the existence of &quot;message resources&quot;. Similarly, FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_STRING, when compared to FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_HMODULE, sounds like the function takes a pointer instead of a resource ID.</p>
<p>Better names would be</p>
<p>FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_STRING_RESOURCE and</p>
<p>FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_MESSAGE_RESOURCE</p>
<p>The bigger problem with FormatMessage is that it takes too many options. In the number of lines the guy spent calling FormatMessage, he could open a text file, scan down to the line containing his message ID, and rip out the string in question. Localizing the file in question would then be a job for the installer, which seems like the right level at which solve the problem. Such text files can also be worked on by the less technically inclined localization guys (as compared to .rc files, which can break the build).</p>
<p>And again, in order to make life easier for the programmer, why deal with these IDs at all? String IDs just tend to repeat, in a mangled form, the contents of the message. A solution I&#8217;ve seen successfully used involved simply wrapping each string in the source that&#8217;s supposed to be localized with a function call:</p>
<p>LocalizeString(&quot;some text&quot;)</p>
<p>A command-line tool then scanned the entire source tree for occurences of the pattern LocalizeString(c++ string). All these strings were saved to the messages file, to which the localization engineer would add translations:</p>
<p>en: some text</p>
<p>ru: рыба</p>
<p>LocalizeString then looked things up in this file. The engineers got readability out of this, and saved one identifier per message.</p>
<p>Orphan messages were also eliminated. Isn&#8217;t this a big problem? Any given Windows program that uses string resources probably has 20% of &quot;garbage&quot; strings (strings that are no longer used).</p>

		<p>Mihai: turns out we are both right. Some tables contain ANSI strings (see: ntoskrnl.exe) but most have UTF-16 strings. It makes sense that the symbolic names for bugcheck codes (which is what ntoskrnl.exe&#8217;s message table contains) would be ANSI, since the kernel debugging API doesn&#8217;t support Unicode. I guess there&#8217;s a flag for it in the resource format</p>

		<p>Alexei: in my experience psychic debugging involves someone making a mistake which you are able to guess because it&#8217;s a common mistake, and maybe a mistake you&#8217;ve made yourself in the past.</p>

		<p>&gt; If you&#8217;re not going to use a message resource,</p>
<p>&gt; you&#8217;ll have to use the FORMAT_MESSAGE_FROM_STRING</p>

<p>&gt; FormatMessage, he could open a text file, scan</p>
<p>&gt; down to the line containing his message ID,</p>
<p>&gt; and rip out the string in question.</p>
<p>Thereby making execution very inefficient on every target machine every time it gets executed, instead of once while trying to figure out how to code the function call. &nbsp;If all the lines of parameters were understandable then it would be better to accept the number of parameters.</p>

<p>&gt; LocalizeString then looked things up in this file.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s why, for example, a vendor&#8217;s web page shows a list of products, in which the left hand column (except for the top row) is an integer starting at 1 and counting up, and the left hand column&#8217;s header (top row) is a word which means the opposite of &quot;Yes&quot;. &nbsp;The vendor started with a word that means the opposite of &quot;Yes&quot; in one or two languages, and localization took that meaning, instead of finding localizations of a different meaning of that word.</p>

		<p>ac: see what JustMe said. BSTRs have their own Very Special allocator (requiring, in this case, to copy the string anyway), you can&#8217;t use them to refer to a string in an arbitrary range of memory</p>

<p>Either that, or including those who write to the event log ^_^</p>
<p>For a few years I was confused by a ton of event log messages talking about not having resources for remote computers. &nbsp;Then one day I wanted to add some debugging traces to a program, but didn&#8217;t want to spend a few days figuring out how to obey MSDN&#8217;s rules just to record debugging traces, so I recorded strings the same way I used to do with printk. &nbsp;Oh, so that&#8217;s where all those log messages came from, talking about not having resources for remote computers. &nbsp;When a very small software company made &lt;deleted&gt; around 7 years ago, they were as lazy as I was.</p>
