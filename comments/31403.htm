		<p>I went to see this in San Francisco, too, and it&#8217;s great &#8212; just plain fun. Hearing a squeaky-clean boy scout sing at the top of his lungs about the problems caused by &quot;&#8230;hiiis e-REEEEEEEC-tion&quot; is absolutely hilarious.</p>
<p>I wished I&#8217;d volunteered to be one of the audience spellers. They worked hard to eliminate the last one, too, but he got out on &quot;lysergic acid diethylamide&quot;. I did come in fifth in my state spelling bee in eighth grade, but LSD is actually quite easy to spell &#8212; it&#8217;s long but utterly predictable, as long as you know it&#8217;s &quot;lysergic&quot;, not &quot;lycergic&quot;. </p>
<p>Anyway, the audience involvement is a brilliant stroke. It probably just made it all the more fun to watch someone keep it going that long&#8230;</p>

		<p>Sounds like it was a lot of fun! &nbsp;Of course, just about anything that&#8217;s on Broadway (or your local equivalent ^_^) is usually a lot of fun. &nbsp;When my girlfriend and I spent four days in New York City back in February, we saw three others: &nbsp;&quot;Wicked,&quot; &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,&quot; and &quot;Avenue Q.&quot; &nbsp;We *almost* saw &quot;Spelling Bee&quot;, but opted for &quot;Avenue Q&quot; instead &#8212; you can&#8217;t see them all, after all. &nbsp;Still, she&#8217;s a theater buff, so I think we&#8217;ll seriously consider catching this the next time we&#8217;re up there. &nbsp;Thanks for the tip!</p>
<p>(And all three of &quot;Wicked,&quot; &quot;Scoundrels,&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are great shows, and all very different, for those who are curious. &nbsp;&quot;Wicked&quot; is a huge full-scale classic musical drama about the Wicked Witch of the West. &nbsp;&quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; is an hilarious musical comedy based on the 1980s movie of the same name, all about con men trying to out-con each other. &nbsp;And &quot;Avenue Q&quot; is, of course, &quot;the dirty Sesame Street&quot; &#8212; and with song lyrics like &quot;What do you do with a B.A. in English?&quot; and &quot;The Internet Is for Porn,&quot; how can you go wrong? :)</p>

		<p>Speaking of spelling, you always spell &quot;accomodate&quot; not &quot;accommodate&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a native English speaker. I&#8217;m studying English now (It&#8217;s really tough for me by the way.) So I&#8217;m not sure it is acceptable or not.</p>
<p>And I didn&#8217;t know this word when I first saw it on your blog so I tried look this word up on my dictionary, but I couldn&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, your blog is really attractive and helpfull to improve my knowledge of English.<br />
<br />(My English is still stupid though. I will glad if someone correct this comment!)<br /></p>

		<p>Sorry. &quot;Accommodate&quot; is one of my weak words. &quot;Minuscule&quot; used to be another, but I overcame that one.</p>

		<p>My dad (not native english speaker) failed an English high-school equivalent Chemistry exam for &#8216;childish use of the language&#8217;. &nbsp;The example they gave him as feedback was writing that &#8216;Water solidified&#8217; (Ice). &nbsp;I think he should have been given extra marks for ingeniuos use of the language &#8211; he obviously knew what he was writing about and could communicate it. &nbsp;At least he can spell (unlike me, native English miss-speller).</p>
