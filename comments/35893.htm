		<p>Does anything in Windows take account of leap seconds?  If I used an embedded version of Windows for my time machine and wanted to go back to 1601, should I pass the time machine the number of nano-seconds in the FILETIME structure for the current time or should I add on a few more for leap seconds?  I hope Microsoft isn&#8217;t ignoring the market for time machine operating systems.</p>

		<p>This has been discussed before.  Posix-compatible systems are required to have time-of-day clocks that are already incorrect by around 20 seconds, and Windows systems are compatible with that whether or not their Posix subsystems are being used.</p>
<p>The part I can&#8217;t figure out is why, after a Windows system uses NTP to nearly synchronize itself with an atomic clock (after two or three intermediaries), how come it doesn&#8217;t adjust itself to 20 seconds in the future.  Also what happens to a Posix system if it happens to execute an NTP operation during a leap second.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s a neat trick.  Took me a few sample cases to see that it really worked, but neat.  Could be very useful in environments like SQL Server, where the datediff() methods are way too basic: the year datediff() just subtracts the years, ignoring month and day.</p>
<p>I would, of course, expect a *much* better comment in the source code than the one you provided.</p>
<p>And, err, you didn&#8217;t avoid a call to AddYears().  Maybe you meant some other method?</p>
<p>One other question: how does .net handle daylight savings time?  I recall having to do brutal hacks to get past the fact that IE6.0 ignored DST, but 6.0a suddenly became the *only* browser to automatically adjust datetimes to reflect DST.  (meaning the timeless date arithmetic I was trying to perform lost or gained a day after rounding).</p>

		<p>Norman: NTP has a flag that the time server can use to warn that a leap second is coming up. Typical NTP clients on POSIX systems make the clock run a bit slow for a few minutes before and after that time, so the leap second is never visible.</p>

		<p>More math?</p>
<p>static void PrintAge(DateTime bday, DateTime asof)<br />
<br />{<br />
<br />  int diffSortOf = 32*(asof.Month + 12*asof.Year) + asof.Day<br />
<br />                 &#8211; 32*(bday.Month + 12*bday.Year) &#8211; bday.Day;</p>
<p>  int years  = diffSortOf/32/12;<br />
<br />  int months = (diffSortOf % (32*12)) / 32;</p>
<p>  DateTime t = bday.AddYears(years).AddMonths(months);<br />
<br />  int days = (asof &#8211; t).Days;</p>
<p>  SC.WriteLine( &quot;{0} years, {1} months, {2} days&quot;<br />
<br />              , years, months, days);<br />
<br />}</p>
