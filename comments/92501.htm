		<p>That explains why yesterday&#8217;s post was delayed almost an hour from the normal 10am EST time. That&#8217;s my normal &#8220;take a mental break from work&#8221; time when I read the freshly posted article.</p>
<p>I know others have asked over the past few days, but I haven&#8217;t seen a reply&#8230; are you planning to change the stylesheet for your blog or stay with what I assume this is &#8211; the default?</p>

		<p>I might change it a little, but not much. Back in the early days, I changed the colors every three months! I&#8217;m too old for that stuff now.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve done some further tweaking to my user style (so if you&#8217;ve already installed it, check for updates) and I think I&#8217;ve now recreated most of the old style: <a href="https://userstyles.org/styles/121616/the-old-new-thing-classic-style" rel="nofollow">https://userstyles.org/styles/121616/the-old-new-thing-classic-style</a></p>
<p>Apart from that, I&#8217;ve noticed two problems with the new layout in mobile mode (i.e. screen width &lt; 768px):<br />
1. In the desktop style, clicking on the blog title at the top of the page takes you back to the overview with the most recent posts. In the mobile layout, the link points to &quot;#&quot; and nothing much happens.<br />
2. Especially in portrait mode, the nested comments don&#039;t work really well. Anything more than one level of indentation is either squished up against the page border or even spills over into the background. I my user style, I&#039;ve reduced the amount of indentation in mobile mode, which improves the situation somewhat, although it doesn&#039;t solve it completely for deep levels of nesting.</p>
<p>I&#039;ve sort of fixed both issues in my user style, but as they affect all MSDN blogs using the new software though, they should probably best be fixed globally and not by using some custom CSS.</p>

		<p>I actually had an issue with cygwin git that I THINK was caused by a Windows Update waiting for reboot. git pull (other git actions worked fine) would not start and I had to work a bit to figure out the Windows error code it was spitting out since cygwin was hiding it. A stackoverflow post (<a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28822442/the-application-was-unable-to-start-correctly-0xc0000056-click-ok-to-close-th" rel="nofollow">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28822442/the-application-was-unable-to-start-correctly-0xc0000056-click-ok-to-close-th</a>) lead me to the solution (a reboot was needed). I had a pending Windows Update waiting for reboot, so I assumed that was it. Who knows though, especially given this post it could have been some other installer I had run.</p>

		<p>Thanks.  This is good information to know.  Since I&#8217;m ex-MSFT support, people (colleagues, friends, etc.) all expect me to know a little something about how this all fits together.  However, after four years away from the mother ship, my knowledge is getting a little stale and needs to be refreshed occasionally (like I was by this blog post).  For what it&#8217;s worth, I was one of those &#8220;customer representatives&#8221; that would occasionally pester Raymond by posting carefully crafted questions to the appropriate internal mailing list.</p>

		<p>@Raymond</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever had a single round of Windows Updates succeed without a reboot, except when the only update was a Security Essentials definition. There was recently a *Flash Player* update for IE11 on Win10 that required a reboot &#8212; that&#8217;s not a part of the operating system, and isn&#8217;t even supposed to be part of the browser!</p>

		<p>Well, Windows 10&#8217;s updates have started to be more cumulative. So there may have been another patch included in there which required a restart.<br />
Although if there is one problem about Windows 10 updates that I have is that the associated KB articles are lacking in details as to what the updates actually fix. For the cumulative updates, this could get quite long, so I would at the very least be happier with a list of changes that the update fixes which is new compared to the last update, and a link to the replaced update.</p>

		<p>My favourite recent example showing how well this problem is solved is MSVS 2015: all of the initial installation, the CTP and the final Update 1 installation have helpfully asked to close all the existing VS instances before continuing to avoid a subsequent reboot. Needless to say, all of them have gleefully continued to rebooting nevertheless after the end of the installation.</p>

		<p>The thing is, Visual Studio is a huge collection of things, so any one of them could be responsible. Normally I find that it is the .NET framework that gets installed along with it that is the cause.</p>

		<p>Another blog-related comment, right now it&#8217;s quite hard to scavenge through the archive before 2015 (or the current year, it seems), as all blog posts are put in the same bag.</p>
<p>Before the transition, posts were grouped by month, no matter how old or how big the archive index turned out to be.</p>
<p>We can mitigate by editing the URL and appending /{two-digit month number starting from 01}.</p>

		<p>One of the recent windows 10 TH2 updates appeared to leave me without tcp ip protocols until I rebooted. At least they disappeared and I needed to reboot. I have it set to manual reboot because I sometimes leave things running overnight and I like to know if they complete succesfully or not.</p>

		<p>&gt; To reiterate earlier caveats, when I talk about situations where The Machine Simply Must Work, I naturally presume you’re not talking about life-critical medical applications, because Windows is not for life-critical applications, as the esteemed attorneys who hand-crafted the Windows EULA from artisanal Unicode characters will happily point out.</p>
<p>Hmm, I checked a couple of different EULAs and could not find any such mention. I looked for “medical”, “critical”, “life”, and “machine”. Nothing. ಠ_ఠ</p>

		<p>Limited warranty, you know. Medical hard real-time equipment too critical to use a closed source software without full warranty. If it were open source, where you could fix your bugs, lack of warranty would be less of  a problem.</p>

		<p>A fresh windows OS usually needs multiple reboots to install all patches. This has been a pain since windows update was invented, and is still a pain.</p>
<p>Why can&#8217;t windows update, in year 2015, install patches and reboot repeated times until all patches are installed? How hard could it be?</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command: for life-critical applications, one usually wants a real-time OS (RTOS), because they often are timing-sensitive too. Therefore, most operating systems for life-critical applications will also be a RTOS. And Wikipedia has a list of them: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_real-time_operating_systems" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_real-time_operating_systems</a></p>

		<p>Thanks Raymond/Mark for more info on this. Really interesting to know and all very logical too.</p>
<p>PS obligatory comment about new blog theme. I did prefer the older one on the eyes, hopefully the style can be chaneged a bit to make text easier to read (as well as your responses to comments etc)</p>

		<p>Wasn&#8217;t there a thing about the &#8220;download but don&#8217;t install&#8221; setting not being respected for some security updates?<br />
I remember someone posted something like that (on the update against the &#8220;blaster&#8221; worm, I think) and concluding that for critical computers, only the &#8220;notify but don&#8217;t do anything else&#8221; setting was safe.</p>

		<p>&#8220;If it were open source, where you could fix your bugs, lack of warranty would be less of a problem.&#8221;</p>
<p>No!  If &#8220;it&#8221; were open source (meaning your operating system for life-critical systems) then you would have to study all of the source code to make sure it met your requirements, and that it had no bugs &#8212; which are really, really hard to find in a large system.</p>
<p>Using an open-source system does not magically guarantee quality, especially if there are millions of lines of code in that system.</p>

		<p>I think its hilarious that you think &#8220;life-critical medical applications&#8221; are written to some higher standard.</p>
<p>What I wouldn&#8217;t give at my current job, in a life-critical field, for a handful of my old Microsoft co-workers.<br />
Instead, I&#8217;m staring at a mountain of 20 year old code that has serious flaws every 5 lines.</p>
<p>(just one example: <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hospira-fda-cybersecurity-idUSKCN0Q52GJ20150731" rel="nofollow">http://www.reuters.com/article/us-hospira-fda-cybersecurity-idUSKCN0Q52GJ20150731</a>)</p>
