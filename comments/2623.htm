		<p>Somehow that got lost in the German translation which is &quot;Programme&quot; and not &quot;Programmdateien&quot;.</p>

		<p>The translation teams did not seem to be that much concerned about the difference; at least in German versions this folder was just called &quot;Programme&quot; (&quot;Programs&quot;). With the nice side effect that programs that do not like spaces in their path could be installed and used there.</p>

		<p>The clutter of the Program Files directory was a real turnoff for me, coming from a &quot;classic&quot; Mac background. &nbsp;In classic Mac OS, the filesystem was also the app launcher and programs were generally self-contained things you could put wherever you wanted them (thanks to resource forks).</p>

		<p>As I recall the Swedish version of Windows 95 did the same thing, calling the directory &quot;Program&quot; (literally, (computer) program or programs) rather than for example &quot;Programfiler&quot; which would have been the literal translation of Program Files.</p>
<p>And that doesn&#39;t even begin to touch on the issue of translating directory names&#8230; like, nobody thought to translate the name of the Windows directory.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t know; that justification sounds kind of silly.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, a &#39;Programs&#39; directory. &nbsp;Better click all the things!&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, a &#39;Program Files&#39; directory. &nbsp;Better not click all the things!</p>
<p>It seems to me the type of person who would browse &quot;Programs&quot; would also browse &quot;Program Files&quot;. &nbsp;According to your own link people still browse the directory and click all the things anyway. &nbsp;I&#39;m just going to pretend the real reason was to force applications to handle paths with spaces correctly.</p>

		<p>And this, ladies and gentlemen, why Windows has to resort to horrible kludges to support a command line with missing quotes. Thanks, Program Files. This is why we can&#39;t have nice things.</p>

		<p>As well as the program files, doesn&#39;t Program Files also contain the programs? What I mean is along with ACRORD32.DLL there is also ACRORD32.EXE which like your POWERPNT.EXE example most people consider the program. I guess what you&#39;re saying is at the Windows restaurant ACRORD32.EXE is the recipe for baking up the Adobe Acrobat Reader program which the shell server delivers to your high resolution table where you will eat your PDF with your mouse, keyboard, or hands if you have one of those new tablet utensils.</p>

		<p>Sure programs should handle spaces in path names correctly but having spaces in paths is just such a pain for everything. So much escaping and quoting could just be gotten rid of if they were removed. Thankfully Vista got rid of the abomination that was &quot;Documents and Settings&quot;, Users just makes more sense, though why they couldn&#39;t just copy unix at that point and use home, then again Users is a bit more accurate.</p>

		<p>Let alone &#39;Program Files&#39; or even &#39;Documents and Settings&#39; (really silly lengthy name). What about the ubiquitous &#39;My&#39; prefix?

		<p>@Kit</p>
<p>To be fair, &quot;Users&quot; is a much newer directory in Windows-land, and whoever came up with it probably wasn&#39;t the same person who thought &quot;Program files&quot; was a good idea in the nineties.</p>
<p>Personally, &quot;Program Files&quot; never bothered me much; &quot;Documents and Settings&quot; is where my hatred lies.</p>

		<p>Knowing the rigorous testing that many developers use, if Microsoft didn&#39;t have commonly-used paths that used spaces, every program in the known universe would die when given them (see: Unicode). I&#39;m glad that this issue is largely moot nowadays.</p>

		<p>Program Files? &#8211;&gt; While I hate spaces in file and directory names, I can survive it.</p>
<p>But if you really want to have fun then look at the following two folders on windows 64 system:</p>
<p>System32 (this is where the 64-bit code is placed)</p>
<p>WOW64 (this is where the legacy 32-bit code is placed)</p>
<p>if you want to register a 64-bit COM server you simply call regsvr32.exe (logic isn&#39;t it?)</p>
<p>On the other hand if you want to register a 32-bit COM server you cannot simply call regsvr32.exe. You need always to ensure that you either specify the full path or call it from a 32-bit process (e.g. 32-bit console). Thank you VERY MUCH&#8230;</p>

		<p>Whoever goes outside of Desktop and My Documents is already in the pantry. I don&#39;t think calling folder &quot;Program Files&quot; helps much. I would prefer it if the Explorer team went with some kind of special presentation for these folders, e.g. Explorer display every subfolder as a big descriptive block with an icon and &quot;Program Name, by Corporation Name&quot;, &quot;Takes this much space&quot;, and if you double-click it it runs whatever is in this folder in Start Menu, and by Right-click it lets you &quot;View program files&quot;, &quot;Uninstall&quot;, and all this can be disabled if you&#39;re power-user. I guess it would have been nicer.</p>

		<p>@Glen: &quot;To heck with the fact that it was going to break millions of scripts, and a huge percentage of existing software.&quot;</p>
<p>Those scripts and software were already broken. &quot;Program Files&quot; just made it more obvious.</p>
<p>I think I&#39;ve heard something very similar to your description, but with a different spin: that MS deliberately included the space specifically to try to force programs to be written correctly to deal with spaces. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s true or not, but given the level that MS attempted to keep compatibility, I find it more plausible than &quot;Hey look at us with spaces! Aren&#39;t WE cool!&quot;</p>

		<p>Pretty much any Swedish computer you come across will upon logon show an Explorer window opened at C:Program. The sacred art of properly quoting Run registry strings is something that most software will never master.</p>

		<p>The latest fail from the company who brought us System32:</p>
<p>C:Program Files (x86)MSBuild12.0binamd64</p>
<p>&quot;amd64&quot; isn&#39;t even MS own official name of the architecture! (it&#39;s x64) This was done in year 2013.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>@Michael: Yes, the the Swedish version of Progra~1 is called &quot;C:Program&quot; which makes Raymonds reasons invalid. But the problems don&#39;t stop there with the Swedish windows version. &quot;C:Program&quot;, is of course much worse than the german &quot;Programme&quot;. Why? Because when some english installers with hard coded paths create &quot;C:Program Files&quot;, commands wont work any more, because the path parser in windows mixup the two folders.</p>
<p>This was such a common and bad problem that MS had to do something about it, but the cure was worse than the disease. When newer versions of windows explorer detect that you have both folders, it shows a modal dialog box, suggesting to rename one of the folders, causing at least one, usual several, installed program to stop working. And it doesn&#39;t help that many of MS own programs have hard coded &quot;C:Program Files&quot; in its installers, which destroys the Swedish OS.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>&quot;amd64&quot; was the internal code name for the architecture, and one thing about code names is that they tend to hang around long after the official name has been chosen because nobody wants to go around renaming everything and risking introducing all sorts of bugs. -Raymond</em>]</div>

<p>I&#39;m sure I&#39;ll regret responding to the ages-old troll:</p>
<p>AMD64 is AMD&#39;s name. You have a problem with it, talk to AMD.</p>
<p>&quot;x64&quot; is the generic term used because most consumers don&#39;t give a damn about the official name, and &quot;AMD64&quot; would confuse them. &#39;What, I can&#39;t run this on my Intel?!&#39;</p>
<p>System directories are not localized. The DISPLAY NAMES are localized, but that has nothing whatsoever to do with the actual directory structure on disk. If you&#39;re using non-English directory names for anything other than presentation to the user, stop. You&#39;re doing it wrong.</p>

		<p>@Anon: Choosing the name of C:Program is not an option the end user have. That&#39;s where several version of windows install all program files to when using the localized version. Why was the folder name localized? And why wasn&#39;t &quot;Document and settings&quot; localized at all?</p>

<p>Really?</p>
<p>Maybe because if I install a &quot;program&quot; (like VS) that has both 32-bit and 64-bit components, I&#39;d rather have them co-located then have the 32-bit components put into &quot;c:program files (x86)blah&quot; and the 64-bit components put into &quot;c:program filesblah&quot;, even if it means that the directory name isn&#39;t 100% right?</p>

		<p>@Evan: That&#39;s not how Office, SQLServer, and all other components of VS are installed. Other components are installed in a the correct folders, i.e. 64-bit binaries are installed in C:Program Files on 64-bit windows. That way you can assume binaries in C:Program Files are using the native bitness of the OS.</p>
<p>@amd64fan: That assumption would be wrong.</p>

		<p>@Michael</p>
<p>&quot;And that doesn&#39;t even begin to touch on the issue of translating directory names&#8230; like, nobody thought to translate the name of the Windows directory.&quot;</p>
<p>I suspect that the Windows directory does not get translated for the same reason that Volkswagen is not called &quot;People&#39;s Car&quot; or SAAB is not called SAC (Swedish Aeroplane Corporation) in the English speaking world. It is a trade name, not a description.</p>

		<p>This made me smile because I used to forcibly rename C:Program Files to C:Programs after installation (and then had to do a bunch of shortcut and registry modifications to make things work). &nbsp;Then I got a bit smarter and found a way to do it with the unattended install file. &nbsp;It was always fun to see which software failed because someone had hard-coded &quot;Program Files&quot; in their paths. &nbsp;Even some installers would still default to this, even though the Windows API would return Programs as the correct location. &nbsp;&quot;Good&quot; times.</p>

		<p>[&#8230;amd64&#8230;]</p>
<p>It looks natural to engineers if you look outside of the MS world. i386 is normally the cpuarch name for x86. amd64 is normally the cpuarch name for x64.</p>
<p>The platform triplet for Windows x86 is i386-pc-mingw32. You would expect the x64 to be amd64-pc-mingw64; however it is in fact x86_64-pc-mingw32. The Cygwin variants are i386-pc-cygwin and amd64-pc-cygwin as expected. Platform triplets don&#39;t change once assigned.</p>

		<p>@DWalker: Umm, dll hell, anyone? Shared binary files may sound like a good thing in theory, but is not a good idea in practice after all. MS figured that out years ago, and has in recent years tried to promote side-by-side binaries instead.</p>
<p>@Joshua: The folder in question was named &quot;amd64&quot; because it contains x64 binaries. An application should not put some of its 64-bit dlls in &quot;program files&quot;, and some of them in &quot;program files (x86)&quot;. That&#39;s plain wrong.</p>

		<p>Don&#39;t start with the Mac, it&#39;s got worse problems than Windows:</p>
<p>&#8211; Oh, just copy that .app thing; but what about shared libraries/frameworks, Finder integrations, etc?</p>
<p>&#8211; Oh, use a .pkg (kind of Mac&#39;s .msi); but there&#39;s no standard, and more important, GUI way of uninstalling things installed through packages&#8230; Welcome to App/Bundle Hell</p>
<p>&#8211; Some (official) apps deal well with spaces, others don&#39;t (go figure! it&#39;s *nix, it already receives a proper argv!)</p>
<p>&#8211; For some (stupid?) reason, file system names with e.g. accented names use the NFD form, where é ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unicode_equivalence#Example">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Unicode_equivalence</a> ) is two code units instead of just one</p>
<p>&#8211; The UI is not only single-threaded, it&#39;s &quot;main&quot;-threaded, meaning that the first thread (the one that executed &quot;main&quot;) is special and the only that can reliably manage windows</p>
<p>&#8211; Oh, but some other things also require the &quot;main&quot; thread, like the initialization of CoreFoundation; as a cool side effect, if you load a library that depends on it and it hasn&#39;t yet been loaded, it will crash if not running in the &quot;main&quot; thread, how cool is that? you must send a message to the main thread to load the library for you and sync the result back, or do as suggested here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://openradar.appspot.com/7209349">openradar.appspot.com/7209349</a></p>
<p>&#8211; You know the spinning wheel of death? ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinning_pinwheel">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Spinning_pinwheel</a> ) Well, in a Mac, you&#39;ll see it quite a lot, specially in Safari</p>
<p>&#8211; You don&#39;t like fuzzy letters? Hahahahahahahaha! Jobs did</p>
<p>So, although some things in OS X are very nice (e.g. an open menu changes dynamically when you press shift, control, option or command while in Windows it only changes the next menu you open; searching in the Help menu highlights top-level menu items <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MedxN19kzBg">http://www.youtube.com/watch</a> ), I find it way more cumbersome.</p>

		<p>@DWalker:</p>
<p>You have to remember MacOS was developed:</p>
<p>1) in 1984 on computers with 128k of RAM, and</p>
<p>2) with a very very large, and very complete built-in API</p>
<p>Therefore its designers never saw a point to shared libraries, and they weren&#39;t fully implemented until years and years later (System 7 finally had them, IIRC.) Classic&#39;s lack of memory protection made them more prone to crashing for a long while. (The first app I remember really embracing DLLs on Mac without crashing was Office 98, actually.)</p>

		<p>One major nit about some of the commentary above: MS-DOS 2.0 allowed spaces in file names. And lots of apps would break if you used them. Win95 just made it more obvious.</p>

		<p>@Joker_vD: &quot;VS by default puts different platform binaries into different output folders by default, and it doesn&#39;t mess things up&quot;</p>
<p>Oh yeah, I forgot to respond to this.</p>
<p>Note, however, that both directories are (by default) still under your project. You don&#39;t have your source in &quot;c:usersmeprogramsfancy-thingsrc&quot; and it compiles to &quot;c:vs-buildsfancy-thingx86&quot; or something like that.</p>

		<p>Sorry if that was already mentions, but here&#39;s my two cents. I always thought that naming Program Files like that was specifically to introduce a space character in a system&#39;s &quot;mission critical&quot; directory. And the purpose of it was to eliminate all thinkable bugs with having a space in a folder name. In the older DOS days directories could only have names consisting of not more than eight characters and no spaces. To ensure smooth transition to directory names where spaces are allowed this thing was done with Program Files directory. But that always was just my subjective guess.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: Exactly how it works now—with aid of Makefiles full of cryptic stuff (so that those Makefiles occupy half as much space as the actual source), &quot;config.h&quot; files with lots of slightly less cryptic macro stuff, and other textual files of magical lore and incantations.</p>

		<p>@Evan &quot;I now have a folder that I can&#39;t delete because the name is too long and I&#39;ve been too lazy to get a utility I can use to remove it.&quot;</p>
<p>Dos prompt, dir/x from enclosing folder to get the short name, then delete by short name.</p>
<p>If there&#39;s no short name, you should still be able to delete the directory by using a carefully-chosen wildcard.</p>
<p>Finally, you don&#39;t need to use a special backup tool. &nbsp;There&#39;s a KB article about how to do it. &nbsp;I don&#39;t remember the details, but it boils down to something like &quot;delete everything in the steam directory but steam.exe and the games you want to keep, then move whatever&#39;s left where you want it and run steam.exe, which will patch everything up.&quot; &nbsp;I didn&#39;t move to a different computer, but I did move my Steam installation to a different drive to get it off my SSD, and I found that KB article and it worked. &nbsp;I searched for something fairly obvious like &quot;move my steam installation&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Evan:</p>
<p>Just rename it and delete. If regular rename doesn&#39;t work, use SVN&#8230; (yes, it works, because it accesses files and directories by relative paths and those will work always and by this way SVN also can create nice directory structure.)</p>

		<p>[&quot;amd64&quot; was the internal code name for the architecture, and one thing about code names is that they tend to hang around long after the official name has been chosen]</p>
<p>You haven&#39;t been around when (whatever would become) Windows 8 was being developed? In those days, to invoke MSBUILD and build your binaries, you were supposed to specify whatever code-name-du-jour Windows 8 had, and it changed like 4 times or so. It was so incredibly stupid, as if the marketrrhoids took over programming.</p>

		<p>This feels a bit like revisionist history to me. &nbsp;What *I* remember, and I think most sys-admin or programmers would remember similar conversations with their peers at the time, was &quot;They had to go put a frickin space in the name *just* to prove they supported spaces. &nbsp;To heck with the fact that it was going to break millions of scripts, and a huge percentage of existing software. &nbsp;Screwed by Microsoft again.&quot; &nbsp;Otherwise why not just &quot;ProgramFiles.&quot; (no space). &nbsp;</p>

<p>Lead Developer thinks: hmmmmm &#8230;. a directory for program files&#8230;. hmmmmm&#8230;. </p>
<p>Lead Developer: &quot;I know, Program Files!&quot;.</p>
<p>Random Intern: &nbsp;&quot;Hey, is that the most usable name &#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>Lead Developer: &quot;Someone smack that kid! Our users will use whatever WE give them.&quot;</p>
<p>Programmer: &quot;Hmmmm, its going to introduce spaces into the directory path name&#8230;.&quot;</p>

		<p>The problem with MacOS storing its programs in their own folders is that it makes them darn near impossible to find. It might have made sense in a system that only used floppies, but not on a hard disk. In order to find a program you had to search the whole folder tree, with windows popping up all over the place, where you had to scroll around to see what was hiding there. Of course you might be able to find things on your own computer, but anybody else&#39;s was a crapshoot.</p>
<p>What lots of people did was drag programs to the desktop (or worse, elsewhere) to make them easier to find, but then they were no longer with their related files. Maybe it made the program unable to find its help file, or maybe it just meant that Word was in one place and Excel somewhere else. It sucked to go to the Office folder, only to find everything BUT the actual Office apps!</p>
<p>So then they created aliases, which are the Mac version of shortcuts. At least that way you could have an app on your desktop that would work properly, and you couldn&#39;t lose an app because the original would always be in its main folder.</p>
<p>You could also make the apps show up as items on the Apple menu, and now I guess you can &quot;dock&quot; them to make them availble without searching. But as far as I know, to this very day there&#39;s nothing like Program Manager or the Start Menu that just shows you a catalog of installed apps.</p>

		<p>Ahh, paths with spaces: the zombie argument from 1992 that simply refuses to stay dead.</p>
<p>I hate to break this to you guys, but it&#39;s 2013. &nbsp;The argument we *should* be having is over MAX_PATH, and how dealing with the associated problems is STILL a common thing.</p>
<p>&gt; What about the ubiquitous &#39;My&#39; prefix? Why oh why not just &#39;Computer&#39;, &#39;Documents&#39;, &#39;Pictures&#39; or &#39;Music&#39;</p>
<p>I think I remember reading that (part of) the rationale for these names were to help make it clear to users that this is where *their* personal files should go. &nbsp;&quot;My Computer&quot; and &quot;My Documents&quot; make sense to me, but having a separate &quot;My Pictures&quot; instead of just making a &quot;Pictures&quot; directory under &quot;My Documents&quot; never did. &nbsp;And then you get third party programs creating &quot;My Fancy Doodads 2013&quot;&#8230;</p>
<p>&gt; To be fair, &quot;Users&quot; is a much newer directory in Windows-land</p>
<p>Not really newer &#8212; I always saw it as a (sensible) return to the Windows NT approach of storing profiles in C:WINNTProfiles.</p>

		<p>@640K: &quot;That&#39;s not how Office, SQLServer, and all other components of VS are installed. Other components are installed in a the correct folders, i.e. 64-bit binaries are installed in C:Program Files on 64-bit windows. That way you can assume binaries in C:Program Files are using the native bitness of the OS.&quot;</p>
<p>Then I dunno. Personally I think that&#39;s obnoxious, as I explain in the following.</p>
<p>Though&#8230; really? I thought that even the 64-bit compilers still went under &quot;program files (x86)microsoft visual studio&quot; somewhere. I can&#39;t check right now though.</p>
<p>@Joker_vD: &quot;Colocated *where*? In &quot;Program Files&quot;? In &quot;Program Files (x86)&quot;? In &quot;ProgramData&quot;?&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t really care. Pick one. But one of the things I like about the Windows way of doing program installation is that everything&#39;s together, instead of vomiting files in 17 different places like happens on some other OSs I could name.</p>
<p>Not that VS follows that anyway (it installs several hundred MB to your system drive even if you install it primarily elsewhere), but that&#39;s still not an excuse for making it even worse.</p>
<p>@Nick: &quot;The argument we *should* be having is over MAX_PATH, and how dealing with the associated problems is STILL a common thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Hah. I went to use the Steam backup utility a couple days ago to make things &quot;easier&quot; to move from one computer to another, which if you back up Game A, Game B, and Game C will create a folder named &quot;Game A and Game B and Game C&quot;.</p>
<p>I tried to select my entire library. (Well, everything I have installed anyway.) I now have a folder that I can&#39;t delete because the name is too long and I&#39;ve been too lazy to get a utility I can use to remove it.</p>
<p>@Nick: &quot;I always saw it as a (sensible) return to the Windows NT approach of storing profiles in C:WINNTProfiles.&quot;</p>
<p>Storing the profiles under the Windows directory was a terrible setup, way more annoying than &quot;Documents and Settings&quot;.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t want to hijack the thread much more than I have so: * there&#39;s no short name, * if I try to delete it manually (either by &quot;typing&quot; the whole name or with a wildcard) it just says &quot;The file name is too long.&quot; * If I try to &#39;ren&#39; or &#39;move&#39; it, it just says the same thing as if I try to delete it. (Actually that&#39;s technically a lie&#8230; then it says &quot;The file name *or extension* is too long.&quot;) * The same is true if I try &#39;del /s /q &quot;\?&lt;directory name&gt;&quot;&#39; or &#39;del /s /q &quot;\?d:blah&lt;directory name&gt;&quot;&#39;. It&#39;s possible that &#39;dir&#39; isn&#39;t showing me the whole name though; it seems to be cut off. * The backup thing isn&#39;t really so much &quot;special&quot; as just &quot;the backup feature within Steam itself.&quot; The nice thing about it is it&#39;ll compress the stuff for you, and I was shuffling stuff across on a cheapish flash drive, so reducing the amount of data that needed to be written would have helped. But yeah, next time I do this I&#39;m just copying the thing over. :-)</p>

		<p>In the Polish version, “Program Files” is translated as… “Program Files”. Which is pronounced “program feel-ess” and means nothing. Oddly, “Program Files (x86)” is translated as “Pliki programów (x86)”.</p>

		<p>Sorry Raymond,</p>
<p>But on this article I don&#39;t see the logic in your reasoning.</p>
<p>I found this article on Wikipedia which contains the various translations: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Program_Files" rel="nofollow" target="_new">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Program_Files</a></p>
<p>&#8211;&gt; Why isn&#39;t it then translated in all languages also???</p>
<p>And like the German version which means &#39;Programs&#39; instead of &#39;Program Files&#39;; there the translation went bad?</p>
<p>I agree with others on this. A badly chosen name. Could have easily been calles: &#39;Applications&#39; or &#39;Programs&#39; or &#39;Apps&#39; or &#8230;</p>

		<p>There&#39;s a lot of misuse of localization resources here. The DISPLAY NAMES of special directories are localized in modern versions of Windows (i.e. versions of Windows which are not a decade old.)</p>

		<p>Ah yeah, sorry. That comment was rather flippant. I was making fun of the fact that &quot;Documents and Settings&quot; was shortened to resolve the MAX_PATH thing but the 3 character less &quot;Program Files (x86)&quot; was retained (or maybe introduced). Having the &quot;Access Denied&quot; thing pop up was disconcerting when moving to Windows 7, but I guess that would count as rummaging around the pantry to many users, and an application&#39;s internal program files can be forced by developers to use shorter paths, I guess. Like a nice descriptive name with space(s) in the path leading to an app&#39;s location, but then HLOWLD32.dll located inside the actual location.</p>
<p>From the technet article &quot;Blocking List contents also has the pleasant side effect of removing an attractive nuisance for new programmers, who may be tempted to continue the tradition of those older applications.&quot; Heh, &quot;Program Files&quot; definitely had a similar benefit.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m not sure what everyone&#39;s problem is with the name Program Files. &nbsp;Is it because of the space in the name which require one to enclose paths in quotes? &nbsp;Or is it the strictly literal reasoning behind the name, as discussed in Raymond&#39;s post? &nbsp;While I don&#39;t agree that there are &quot;no user servicable parts&quot; in Program Files, and the reasoning makes little sense to this technically-minded audience in 2013, I try to put myself into the position of the people who named the folder 20-ish years ago. &nbsp;As a technically-minded manager circa 1993 (or whenever the name Program Files was decided upon), making decisions about making the OS usuable to non-technical people, I can understand how someone would arrive at that name.</p>

<p>@Adam Rosenfield: Trouble is, you&#39;ll find _lots_ of forum and comment posts offering advice on how to &quot;fix&quot; the permissions, instead of pointing out the new locations. It&#39;s even more common with the old &quot;Application Data&quot; and &quot;Start Menu&quot; folders.</p>

		<p>&gt; C:Program Files (x86)MSBuild12.0binamd64</p>
<p>&gt; @Raymond: Why do a path contain both &quot;x86&quot; and &quot;amd64&quot;?</p>
<p>I know some folks who worked on this. &nbsp;The reason it&#39;s in &quot;Program Files (x86)&quot; is that the installer itself is a 32-bit binary. &nbsp;They did that so it would work everywhere. &nbsp;(Unless one day ia-32 binaries won&#39;t run everywhere. &nbsp;Cf. 16-bit apps.) &nbsp;And it happens to installs tools for multiple arichtectures.</p>
<p>Also the authors are not nitpicky people and aren&#39;t bothered by the irony. &nbsp;(A prerequisite for staying happy working at Microsoft, it would seem.)</p>

		<p>When Microsoft came with &quot;Program files&quot; as the name for that directory, was obviously trying to do the right thing. However, it was just a poor decision as it was &quot;documents and settings&quot;. It is unnecessary long (even in English!), and it has an space in it, leading to incompatibility problems and strange internal algorithms, such as &quot;try first &quot;programfiles&quot;, then &quot;program files&quot;, etc. Talking about translations, in Spanish this folder is &quot;Archivos de Programa&quot;&#8230; uff&#8230; 20 characters is lengthy, just for the folder name.</p>
<p>If you want a scary name, then use &quot;_app_files&quot; or something. It is also important to note that the name the directory has in disk and the name the directory is shown to users does not necessarily has to be the same thing. You can always do a logical mapping. I don&#39;t get why translations, for example, need to affect the actual folder.</p>

<p>I could write a page on the idiocy of workspaces in %UserProfile%.</p>
<p>Or the idiocy of that &#39;Enterprise&#39; naming convention.</p>
<p>Or the idiocy of FName.LName.DOMAIN account naming, and how you should only have .DOMAIN profiles if your system is misconfigured or you had severe OS issues.</p>
<p>Instead, I&#39;m going to point out that VS2013 can&#39;t be installed on Windows XP, the last OS to use Documents and Settings.</p>

<p>You&#39;re never supposed to refer directly to ANY system directory. You&#39;re supposed to ask the OS for them. That&#39;s why nothing that works with &quot;Documents and Settingsusername&quot; that is written properly will break on &quot;Usersusername&quot;, because %UserProfile% is always going to point to the right place.</p>
<p>And translation DOESN&#39;T affect them.</p>
