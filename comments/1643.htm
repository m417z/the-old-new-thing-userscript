<p>These almost lost to time tidbits are always interesting.</p>

		<p>@jbw Oh we had that already. I even was so free to look it up for you because I wasn&#39;t too sure on the details anymore myself:</p>

		<p>This post is intereesting, though what interests me more is the original post (comment) was made nearly one and a half years ago. In all that time no one stumbled across the question and posted an answer. Even more interesting, is knowing Raymond&#39;s system of having a queue of posts over a year long makes me wonder if Raymond&#39;s answer was written a year and a half ago and only just now emerged.</p>

		<p>I agree that is a rude name to be using for every post here. I would have considered it acceptable if the name was chosen to go with the post content but otherwise is inflammatory without a point.</p>

<p>Don&#39;t worry about it. That blog is a hideous mish-mash of misunderstanding basic OS functionality.</p>

		<p>@skSdnW: You can also just stop using TCHAR entirely. &nbsp;If you&#39;re not compiling for Windows 9x, there&#39;s no reason to make a char build anymore. &nbsp;Just always code for wchar_t.</p>

		<p>I wonder if, a hundred years from now, Microsoft will ressurrect the source code for the pre-2000 versions of MS-Windows and MS-DOS and donate them to a museum. Major versions of MS-Windows are important cultural artefacts of our era, and it would be good to be able to look back to the days when the computing landscape of the future was shaped and understand the reasons behind the decisions which will have left their mark on the whole of humanity.</p>

		<p>@Cesar</p>
<p>Right. Like we keep in a museum the source code of mainstreams from the 60&#39;s. Ever wondered to look at their OS&#39;s? Me neither. The future will say &quot;You had to use fingers on a keyboard to type?&quot; as same way we do to our fathers &quot;You had to punch holes in papers to make it compute?&quot;. And remember, Apollo missions were all based on those punch holes!.</p>

		<p>@voo: Yea, as mentioned in the other thread, I think it is the move from SLM to SourceDepot, which AFAIK was done just before Win2000 RTMed.</p>

		<p>@Danny, there&#39;s a whole bunch of people who call themselves &quot;computer archeologists&quot; and who absolutely love looking at old software, often with a special interest towards (but certainly not limited to) operating systems. And there already are museums of that kind, although because of the nature of software, most of them are accessed online rather than physically. <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://os2museum.com">http://os2museum.com</a> is one example (don&#39;t be fooled by the name, it&#39;s far far more than OS/2 and given the apparent ratio of OS/2 to non-OS/2 stuff, by now I suspect that the name is just a relict). The Computer History Museum in Mountain View, on the other hand, is an example for a big and hugely popular museum that does host all kinds of older systems. Granted, it&#39;s mostly the physical machines, but they do have some software and some restored machines with (presumably) their original operating systems.</p>
<p>Funny story, I started my computer archeology back when I was a little kid. My father&#39;s PC had the then recent MS-DOS 5.0 on it and I got a huge kick out of installing DOS 2.11 on a floppy disk and looking at the differences. Nowadays I install PC/IX and Xenix 86 in emulators.</p>
<p>So, yes, as Cesar says, I absolutely think that yesterday&#39;s operating systems will be important cultural artifacts in the future, at least for some subset of humanity.</p>

		<p>Windows 2000 was developer in SLM, the Source Depot transition happened right after it. Presumably, the transition included some form of history, but maybe that got archived in order to keep the size of the depots maintainable.</p>

		<p>BTW, I wonder when Office etc transitioned to SourceDepot.</p>
