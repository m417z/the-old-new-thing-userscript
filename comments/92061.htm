		<p>Seems fairly similar to a British show called Take Me Out (which my girlfriend seems to enjoy, for some reason).</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Yup. According to Wikipedia, the creators of the show took inspiration from <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Taken Out</span>, the Australian show that also inspired <span style="text-decoration:underline;">Take Me Out</span>. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Hah! For a second there I thought Raymond had found an _actual_ alternative dating show on which Bill Nye had appeared. I should&#39;ve known it was just a comedy sketch from </p>
<p>&quot;Almost Live!&quot; It was fun watching it again after all these years; boy, I sure miss &quot;Almost Live!&quot;&#8230;&quot;The 206&quot; wasn&#39;t really making the grade (it had the occasional gem, but wasn&#39;t the non-stop riot that the widely talented ensemble of &quot;Almost Live!&quot; managed).</p>
<p>While I agree we should not assume &quot;Serious Inquiries Only&quot; is representative of the dating scene in China, I fear that too much of the American dating scene _is_ in fact reflective of or (worse) informed by what folks see on a show like &quot;The Bachelor&quot;. Maybe not for all people, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be much distance between the show and the actual &quot;meat market&quot; bar scene that has been with us for decades.</p>

		<p>In a similar vein I rather liked the &quot;Dating in the Dark&quot; concept, which apparently caught on in China as well &#8211; contestants are literally in the dark, in an unlit house, while viewers get the benefit of infra-red cameras to see what&#39;s going on. Rather a neat idea I thought &#8211; though I imagine not understanding the language would leave you at an even bigger disadvantage than with regular TV shows!</p>

		<p>Great show. I can&#39;t believe Australia is the only country to have subtitled it. Hilarious.</p>

		<p>What isn&#39;t readily apparent from most descriptions is that the women who don&#39;t get a match return indefinitely! I thought they just lasted until the end of the episode and each new episode starts with 24 new women.</p>
<p>But really it sounds like the women are an ensemble cast in a reality TV series &#8212; almost to the point where getting matched with a bachelor is like being &quot;eliminated&quot; for some of them.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>I updated the rules to include that interesting fact. (I never knew that, because I never watched more than one episode at a time.) The author of the &quot;undercover story&quot; I linked to was advised by the other contestants, &quot;Don&#39;t forget to turn off the light&quot; so you stay on the show. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>The unmatched women don&#39;t return indefinitely. They are eligible for a maximum number of episodes. Sometimes the host may give unfortunate individuals, men or women, another go, base of popularity or whatnot.</p>

		<p>&gt; The English equivalent would be something like [&#8230;]</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<p>A bit off-topic but my pet-peeve when looking at Chinese movies (and many movies from other Asian countries as well) is that the subtitle translator often fails to capture this. The result is often an English that sounds very strange. An obvious example that comes to mind is the Chinese word &quot;hao&quot; which literally means &quot;good&quot; but it can be used in a much wider context and is often used where an English speaker would say &quot;ok&quot; or &quot;alright&quot; (at least ASFAIU but my Chinese is very limited).</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>&#8211; &quot;Do you accept this offer?&quot;/&quot;Is this offer good for you?&quot;</p>
<p>&#8211; &quot;Good!&quot;</p>
<p>Please note that this is not the same as going to China and make fun of weird English signs, because most translators are English/American (as far as I can tell) so I think it&#39;s just sloppy handiwork..</p>

		<p>It may help to understand that SBS is a public TV network with one of the most interesting business models of any public TV network in the world. It&#39;s diversified a lot now (most recently, they just started a free-to-air version of Food Network), but early on, SBS has acquired the best team of translators in the country, and hired them out to any business that needed it. Because it&#39;s also a TV network, subtitling and closed captioning was (and still is) part of the service.</p>

		<p>I think an English equivalent phrase that is also a little cryptic might be &quot;No tyre-kickers&quot;.</p>

		<p>@cheong00: I thought there was something off on that first 9999 translation (I only had cantonese for a year, and half of that was painting :). So tsin = 1000 and bark = 100. Never too old to learn :)</p>

		<p>Iris: I was basing my &quot;indefinite&quot; notion on the linked &quot;undercover&quot; story where the author states that some women are on for 6 months or a year. And she tells the story of a bachelore who was paid to pick a certain contenstant who had been on for 150 episodes (18 months at two episodes per week) just to get her off the show.</p>

		<p>Well, funny you should mention this show. &nbsp;My son&#39;s ex-girlfriend went to China for 6 months and she was stopped on the street and asked if she wanted to be one of the &quot;foreign girlfriends&quot; on that show. &nbsp;Turns out the show is pretty hokey, they shot some scenes of the Chinese guy and her, romantic scenes with candlelit dinners and rose-petals a-fluttering. &nbsp; All totally bogus, but plausible-looking. &nbsp;At least she got a good dinner and union-scale pay out of it. &nbsp; </p>

		<p>I managed to make it though an episode of the show last night. It was a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion &#8211; you know it&#39;s not going to end well, but you can&#39;t help but watch it happen.</p>
<p>You never know how successful the guys are going to be, either. One guy was doing well, with most of the 24 women still keen to date him, up until the friend interviews. In the space of a single sentence almost every one of the girls turned their light off. The friend&#39;s comment? &quot;He&#39;s looking for someone pale, skinny and rich.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s something I could watch much of, due to the cringe factor involved. But I can certainly see how it&#39;s got a cult following.</p>
