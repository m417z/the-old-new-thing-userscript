		<p>He&#8217;s lucky he didn&#8217;t get arrested and put on the sex offender registry.</p>

		<p>I remember hearing about a case where some woman was laughed out of court while suing a nude jogger for indecent exposure, in no small part because she had learned where the guy was used to jogging and went there specifically to be &#8220;shocked&#8221; by the dreadful sight and sue the guy over it.</p>

		<p>Is this dated January 30? Frankly, the tone is more appropriate for a note signed on April 1&#8230;</p>
<p>As for the poor guy, he may not know that for some designs the only difference between being considered obscene or fashionable is the absence or presence of a sports clothing company on it&#8230;</p>

		<p>Raymond, we all know you were the jogger. Just admit it.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a conversation that I just had with a friend of mine who administrates a game server. He told me how people are shocked that there is a &#8220;full nude&#8221; setting in the game, and that many want it to be off. We both are in disbelief now: Where is the logic in &#8220;it&#8217;s offending to show male and female private parts, but it&#8217;s fine to display violence and blood splatter on the screen&#8221;? Well, so much about &#8220;indecent exposure&#8221;.</p>
<p>Now, I&#8217;m not a nudist, but what&#8217;s wrong with nude jogging, and how can there be victims? I mean, a victim to witness a human being in its natural state? Okay, we all know there are many folks that we rather do not like to see this way, but so what? Just don&#8217;t watch. Not everybody who shows his or her private parts is a sex offender or the like, but I see the scare tactics are in place and working.</p>
<p>To come back to the game: He certainly left the &#8220;full nude&#8221; setting in its ON state. :) But he really misses a &#8220;no violence&#8221; and &#8220;no blood&#8221; setting.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m reminded of one time I watched The Godfather on Lifetime or someother daytime movie channel.  We saw Sonny beat up Carlo in the street (granted, one of the worst pulled-punches every shot) and then (SPOILER ALERT) Sonny shot to death at the turnpike &#8230; but the brief shot of Michael&#8217;s fiancee&#8217;s nipples &#8211; heavily pixelated.</p>

		<p>I want to mention that there are sufficiently loose, light, drafty pairs of running shorts on the market that this man could get virtually the same immune-system preparation without worrying about offending anybody.</p>
