		<p>It seems that empire-building is suddenly a good thing.</p>
<p>&quot;You will also prove to your boss that you can easily be moved into another role&quot; &#8211; Maybe that is desirable if you don&#8217;t like your current job&#8230;</p>
<p>I just can&#8217;t get into the mindset of people who think like this. I want to take what I do to as high a level as I can. I can&#8217;t do that if I keep changing jobs or spend my time coordinating a lot of other people to do my work for me.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s simple. You look at your job as doing a task (Writing code, designng features, whatever). So do the other people. They&#8217;ve just defined the task as &quot;Get promoted.&quot; Everything they do is in support of their primary task. Anything that doesn&#8217;t support it doesn&#8217;t get done.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t ever assume the people around you share your goals.</p>

		<p>Here&#8217;s some classic Raymond Chen: &quot;Apparently I&#8217;ve been promoted by mistake all these years&quot;.</p>

		<p>Your quote fits nicely into recent comments on minimsft blog regarding Indian empire-building at MS.</p>

		<p>Raymond, the fact that you are not a higher level is a key reason I left Microsoft. No joke.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve personally seen your work, you are not just a blogging wind bag who looks good on paper. Any team would kill to have someone of your knowledge, skills, work ethic and clarity in communication.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit this kind of GAL analysis is faulty, you probably have been rewarded far past any given title from options and otherwise. And I&#8217;m not actually a great fan of some of your humor posted internally.</p>
<p>But in the end if a programming demigod as yourself doesn&#8217;t get a higher technical rank just because you make things work and people smarter rather than building an architectural folly as some others have been richly rewarded for, well I don&#8217;t want to be there because such a company does not reward (anymore) work that I respect. That fact that you stay is apparently a quirk of your personality as you know you could leave at any moment.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is too direct, but you have had a huge influence internally as well as externally, I hope you feel richly rewarded and not just a cog in the machine, because a cog you are not.</p>
