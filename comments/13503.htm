		<p>I know the feeling &#8211; being distracted from working on XYZ problem by&#8230; phone calls about XYZ problem! Yes, the staff may not understand what&#39;s happening and what you&#39;re doing about it, but that&#39;s little consolation when you&#39;re the one person handling everything.</p>

		<p>Great story, Raymond. Thank you for providing the background. Now I understand that there was already a high awareness of the bug count and the bug-fixing process. Worrywart managers sometimes keep themselves busy in superfluous ways.</p>
<p>In the Boeing case, more thoughts occurred to me. Why did it take to flight day for the Vice President to learn that Boeing would be disappointing its customers that day? Why didn&#39;t the passenger jet manager communicate to the VP well before the deadline? Or why didn&#39;t the VP more actively pursue about the true status of the plane?</p>
<p>I&#39;m posing hypothetical questions here. I don&#39;t expect The Answers&trade;. Intuitively though, it looks like more communication earlier in the process would have avoided distracting communication later.</p>

		<p>Funny how a story about communication could lead to such confusion on my part! With your clarification, I now see that the &quot;from some other division of Boeing&quot; clause was right in my face the whole time.</p>
<p>I agree&#8211;this is a good example of the benefits of a chain of command. Senior management certainly should know better than to burden random subordinates elsewhere in the corporation.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  The sentence &quot;If you need help, then ask your manager&quot; therefore gets things backwards
</p></blockquote>
<p>And has an annoying comma-then sequence. If the comma is there, &quot;then&quot; is not required. If &quot;then&quot; is there then the comma is unneeded. I asked Purdue (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://slashdot.org/~Chacham/journal/164954" rel="nofollow">slashdot.org/&#8230;/164954</a>), they responded &quot;Actually, you need both the comma and then.&quot;</p>
<p>Well, Elements of Style doesn&#39;t use both, though they never state it as a rule. Oh well.</p>
<p>Just a pet peeve. Hmm&#8230; Raymond&#39;s pet peeves. What could they be?</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a supervisor I once had. &nbsp;Back in days past, when I was in my early twenties, before I had my CS degree, and before I made Raymond Chen my programming god, I worked for a textile company. &nbsp;My job was to coordinate the schedules of all the dying machines in the department to get fabric dyed as quickly as possible with as little downtime as possible. &nbsp;A fellow employee had the responsibility of delivering the correct lot of fabric to the correct machine when the current lot was finished with its cycle. &nbsp;My supervisor would often instruct me to, &quot;page John and make sure he knows to deliver that next lot to the machine as fast as he can. &nbsp;We have to avoid downtime.&quot;</p>
<p>Nevermind the fact that John already knew to get the fabric to the machine.</p>
<p>Nevermind the fact that John had to stop what we was doing and find the nearest phone on the manufacturing floor to respond to my page (he always had to respond in the off chance I actually had something important to tell him).</p>
<p>Nevermind th fact that this activity often added 1 &#8211; 3 minutes to the time it took John to get the fabric to the machine.</p>
<p>And to this day, people wonder why I left that job.</p>

		<p>After this happens a few times, isn&#39;t it obvious the passenger jet manufacturing guy should simply pad his schedule to account for the time catering to the Corporate VP? Or CC the VP on schedule changes, and then tell the VP to RTM when he calls.</p>

<p>@JamesNT</p>
<p>&quot;And to this day, people wonder why I left that job.&quot;</p>
<p>Why? Was that job really rewarding enough that you would&#39;ve stayed if your supervisor wasn&#39;t a dipstick?</p>
<p>I would quit too if I couldn&#39;t say, &quot;John knows what needs to be done. How about I page him and ream his ass if he doesn&#39;t get the fabric to the next machine on time.&quot;</p>

		<p>A product division at my company was late for a release. Everyone was pretty upset about missing the release date, so they decided to have a meeting to determine how to mitigate the issue in the future &#8230; before the release. So the release, which was late, was made even more late by spending half a day in meetings. This prompted more meetings about why the meetings were had before the release. In the end, the product was late by an entire week for three bugs that took 6 hours collectively to develop and test.</p>

		<p>Pre-emptive note: I say the following without intending to incite any political hand wringing.</p>
<p>This reminds me of how people report on Vice President Biden going down to Louisiana to &#39;personally oversee&#39; the cleanup process that&#39;s taking place in the Gulf. When people bring it up, they say it with an air of &quot;Well *now* things will get done.&quot;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know about you, but if you want to guarantee that I don&#39;t get anything done, have my boss hover over me. And my boss isn&#39;t the Vice President of the United States.</p>
