		<p>普通話 actually means something other than &quot;Normal Speech&quot;. It is short for &quot;普遍通用話&quot; (take the first, third, and the fifth characters). &quot;普遍&quot; means &quot;General&quot;, &quot;通用&quot; means &quot;Common&quot;, and &quot;話&quot; means &quot;Speech&quot;. Combine all that together, it means a language that can/should be used by all Chinese people (since a lot people in China only speak their dialect).</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Then I was faked out by cognates. In the dialect I grew up speaking, &quot;,普通&quot; means &quot;normal&quot;; it looks like in Mandarin, <a href="https://translate.google.com/#en/zh-CN/ordinary">it means &quot;ordinary&quot;</a>. Still, even with the sense of &quot;ordinary&quot;, it gets the point across: This is the ordinary way of talking. Anybody who talks otherwise is going out of their way to be different. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>To be fair, many languages have ambiguity and depends on context. Also the category word in Chinese is similar to collocation in English: you don&#39;t have a general rule but only convention.</p>
<p>For pronunciation, ⟨low level tone⟩ and ⟨dipping tone⟩ have small difference. Some may say one is &quot;more correct&quot; than the other. This reminds me the case of pʰ, p and b in English.</p>
<p>And 普通話 does not translate as normal speech. While 普通 means normal, 普 means popular (普遍) and 通 means common (共通, 通用).</p>

		<p>&quot;so my speech tends to come off as rather rude and abrupt&quot;</p>
<p>In addition to having the more general issue of the social skills of the thermonuclear device? Or would this qualify as falling under that categorisation (no Z, because I&#39;m inadvertently a Latin English revisionist) in a limited context? Or is THAT dependant on the language we&#39;re discussing it in?</p>

		<p>A short while back, I was attempting to learn some German for a vacation my wife and I had planned. In many ways, German was easy to learn because of it&#39;s similarities to English. &nbsp;There were definitely things that tripped me up, like having to learn the gender of nouns and the declension of the various cases (both of which I&#39;m still quite horrible at). &nbsp;Throughout the process, my programmer brain kept wondering what an engineered language would look like so that it would be easy to learn, easy to use, and communicate effectively. &nbsp;A few of the things that came to mind were:</p>
<p>1. Do not assign gender to inanimate objects. It is not obvious that doors are boys and windows are girls.</p>
<p>2. Minimize homophones; they create ambiguity.</p>
<p>3. Keep subject/verb agreement. As you said, this helps ensure listener understands the speaker.</p>
<p>4. Minimize variance in sentence structure. In German, word order is much more relaxed than English due to the flexibility provided by the various articles in each case. So you can distinguish the subject from the direct object by the article. For example, in English the sentence &quot;The dog bites the man&quot; is very different from &quot;The man bites the dog.&quot; due to the word order. In German, you can say either &quot;Der Hund bei&szlig;t den Mann&quot; or &quot;Den Mann bei&szlig;t der Hund.&quot;, and both would translate as &quot;The dog bites the man&quot; since &quot;den&quot; puts &quot;dog&quot; in the accusative case (direct object), and &quot;der&quot; puts &quot;man&quot; in nominative case (subject).</p>
<p>The fourth one is especially interesting to me. &nbsp;A language which attempted to conform to that restriction would likely not be a good candidate for poetry (or other forms of creative writing) as it can depend on wrangling sentence structure to match a meter or rhyme pattern.</p>

		<p>&gt; doors are boys and windows are girls.</p>
<p>At least in German, Spanish, etc. the wrong gender just sounds wrong (non-extant word). In Arabic it&#39;s a different word with a different meaning.</p>

		<p>Growing up for some years as a child in Japan, I never realized that Japanese has tones. &nbsp;To my American ear, the tones sounded like accents &#8211; in English, when one accents a syllable, one&#39;s pitch tends to rise. &nbsp;It was only many years later that I learned, with surprise, that my &quot;accents&quot; were actually tones.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve ran into the Native speakers issue from the other side a few times. I&#39;d like to learn a second language but my attempts tend to be hindered by not having a very good conceptual/technical understanding of English. I know when to use &quot;He&quot; and when to use &quot;Him&quot; but if someone randomly asked me for the English masculine subjective pronoun I&#39;d have to think about it a bit. </p>

		<p>That retcon issue reminds me of how &quot;than I&quot; is justified as more correct than &quot;than me&quot;, because &quot;than I&quot; is short for &quot;than I (am)&quot;. Sure, you can do that, but that doesn&#39;t make it more correct.</p>

		<p>@Andy: That&#39;s rotten. Condider &quot;no mí papa&quot;, does it mean &quot;not my pope&quot; or &quot;not my potato&quot;? (I&#39;ve actually used &quot;not my pope&quot; before).

		<p>I find stuff like this endlessly fascinating&#8230; but purely at a layman&#39;s level, as I&#39;m no linguist and am essentially monolingual (I dabbled in French but never got beyond French 103 in college, and it&#39;s grown quite rusty since&#8230; I also dabbled ever so briefly in Russian). &nbsp;But I love hearing these perspectives, insights, and discussions. &nbsp;I could read stuff like this for hours and never grow bored. &nbsp;I dated a native French speaker and got a lot of insights into my own language as well, which I share as often as I can to help remind people just how difficult English can be :-)</p>

		<p>@Mark Yes, but in a book about a language there is likely to be a paragraph that goes something like &quot;These are the subjective pronouns in this language&#8230;&quot;. In order for that paragraph to be meaningful you need to understand what the subjective pronouns are in your language so that you can make a connection.</p>

		<p>From my days as a Linguistics student I remember hearing the claim that there&#39;s some evidence that languages are constantly evolving between word order languages and case languages. Obviously this claim requires some objective evidence. The example I remember is Chinese. Apparently there are very old Chinese texts that show this. There&#39;s no evidence for other languages, but the thinking is that this is mainly because there aren&#39;t any texts in other languages that are old enough. (I learned this ~40 years ago so I have no idea what the current thinking is).</p>
<p>Given the movement in spoken English away from the who/whom distinction, and other similar changes in &quot;sub-standard&quot; English, it&#39;s easy to see the change in the case to word order direction. I&#39;d enjoy hearing about any examples of languages going in the other direction.</p>

		<p>The occasional confusion with English, like the bat example, could be fixed by creating another noun for one of the objects. There&#39;s plenty of room to expand vocabulary in English.</p>

		<p>@Chris B: In our spare time, my friend and I have been working on our own language with much the same goals as you state (though not 3). It is indeed terrible for poetry ;)</p>
<p>Our intention was for it to be really easy to parse by a computer &#8211; so every linguistic construct is based on the same idea, but taken to an extreme &#8211; prepositions and conjunctions act like verbs, for example. We haven&#39;t worked on it in quite a while and it&#39;s quite insane ;).</p>

		<p>@Mark: But you might learn basic grammar from a book (ie an exercise book).</p>
<p>@Boris: So what do you say, &quot;a scissors&quot;? That doesn&#39;t make sense, because &quot;scissors&quot; is plural, but &quot;a&quot; is not. Or do you say &quot;a scissor&quot;? Neither of those are correct.</p>

		<p>&quot;It has no grammar.&quot; Let&#39;s see what would happen if that were true. In which case any amalgam of words would have the same meaning. This greatly limits the complexity of sentences as &quot;subject verb object&quot; is hard and &quot;subject verb object if subject verb object&quot; is borderline impossible.</p>

		<p>As a native speaker, I concede that I&#39;m probably not aware all the exceptions that you have to deal with, but I still don&#39;t understand the bit you wrote about &quot;没&quot;. &nbsp;Treating it to mean &quot;have not&quot; makes sense to me. &nbsp;In your examples:</p>
<p>没濕 = hasn&#39;t gotten wet (rather than &quot;isn&#39;t wet&quot;)</p>
<p>没飲牛奶 = hasn&#39;t drunk milk (rather than &quot;isn&#39;t drinking milk&quot;)</p>
<p>They don&#39;t translate to &quot;isn&#39;t X&quot; because they don&#39;t just refer to the present state. &nbsp;Something could have gotten wet then dried up, and it would be wrong to describe it as 没濕. &nbsp;A person could have drunk milk in the morning but is not drinking any now, and it would be wrong to say they 没飲牛奶.</p>

		<p>Learning a language by translating is always going to run into issues like these. &nbsp;It&#39;s very rare for grammatical constructs to have exact direct translations between two languages. &nbsp;To really make sense of a language, literally all existing notions of entities, space, and time have to be revised in order to &quot;think&quot; like a native speaker. &nbsp;It&#39;s not that native speakers are ignorant about the differences or exceptions &#8211; to them there is honestly no difference. &nbsp;The reason you think they are exceptions is because you learned to think about things with a different system. &nbsp;It&#39;s like going to a supermarket and wondering why eggs and milk would be in the same aisle, when you&#39;ve always thought chicken-related and cow-related things are very different.</p>

		<p>You are lucky that we are living in 2014. Before, in Chinese written language, there was no punctuation. So how would you read? The tonic feature of Chinese was the only help you can get. BTW, it was very poetic indeed.</p>

		<p>@Joshua and &nbsp;@Andy</p>
<p>Well, Basically if you want to refer to a Female cat, you use &quot;La Gata&quot;.. if you refer to a male cat, use &quot;El Gato&quot;,, &quot;La Gato&quot; just sounds wrong when it comes to the gender of the subject&#8230; </p>
<p>the same happens with most of the subjects that have genders (example, &quot;La Luna&quot; (the moon&quot;) instead of &quot;El Luna&quot;&#8230; Luna is a female subject in spanish, El Sol (the sun) is a male subject.</p>
<p>The same happens in portuguese!, &nbsp;obviosuly, if you&#39;re not a native or almost native speaker, such things are really difficult to understand, specially if you come from a language that does not handle gender for subjects&#8230;</p>
<p>Chinese is just plain difficult to understand</p>
<p>A friend said that Korean is a way much better to learn, easier when it comes to writing, speaking it is another big deal, lol!</p>
<p>Good luck!</p>

<p>&quot;Or are you saying that in Chinese, the verb &quot;有&quot; also serves double purposes as a verb meaning &quot;to possess&quot; and as a tense marker? (Thereby contracting people who claim that Mandarin has no tenses.)&quot;</p>
<p>有 alone isn&#39;t commonly used as a tense marker (although I&#39;ve seen it used that way, more often in some dialects). &nbsp;没有 is indeed used as the equivalent of &quot;haven&#39;t&quot; as a verb tense.</p>
<p>Treating &quot;没&quot; as a negating adverb might not be the most productive since removing &quot;没&quot; from a sentence but leaving &quot;有&quot; does not always work to cancel the negation. &nbsp;It might make more sense to treat &quot;没有&quot; as a single unit (with the &quot;有&quot; being optional) that can have multiple meanings:</p>
<p>&#8211; Does not possess/include (when paired with a noun): 没(有)钱 don&#39;t have money</p>
<p>&#8211; Has not happened/performed an action (when paired with a verb): 没(有)吃 haven&#39;t eaten</p>
<p>&#8211; Has not become/acquired an attribute (when paired with an adjective): 没(有)湿 haven&#39;t gotten wet</p>
<p>&#8211; Some others I&#39;m undoubtedly forgetting</p>
<p>I&#39;m not saying translating it into &quot;have not&quot; or &quot;not have&quot; in multiple senses of the term is the rule by design. &nbsp;But if the happy coincidence lets us simplify the way to think about it, then why not exploit it?</p>
<p>I have no problem with contradicting people who pretend Mandarin has no tenses. &nbsp;As you said, it has no inflections but tenses certainly exist in the language.</p>

		<p>&quot;One of my colleagues told me that he missed those signs on his trip to Italy. There would be signs labeling each exit, but rarely was there a sign telling you what highway you were currently on!&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s another culture thing, I guess: we tend to miss a lot of information just because we don&#39;t know what to look for.</p>
<p>In Italy, the easiest way to find out on which highway you are (without using a GPS) is to look for an overpass: there&#39;ll be a pair of square brown signs, one before and another after the overpass, bearing the name of the highway and the number of the overpass.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve only ever heard of &quot;classifiers&quot; under the name &quot;measure words&quot; previously; and I believe it conveys the meaning better. For example, in English the nouns that require measure words are generally the uncountable ones (ie. those without inherent unit); eg. &quot;bread&quot; requires a measure word whereas &quot;bun&quot; does not; &quot;water&quot; requires a measure word whereas &quot;drop&quot; does not.</p>
<p>It&#39;s often interesting to me that &quot;whom&quot; is unpopular. The mappings &quot;she&quot; =&gt; &quot;her&quot;; &quot;he&quot; =&gt; &quot;him&quot;; and very useful and naturally used by many, but the same mapping &quot;who&quot; =&gt; &quot;whom&quot; is not and confuses people.</p>
<p>The only other language I type regularly is Hebrew; and it is always interesting to see how different pieces of software cope with switching between left-to-right and right-to-left &#8212; many of the weird things I see have been previously explained on this blog &#8212; thanks :)</p>

		<p>Actually I&#39;m always conscious that my mother tongue (Cantonese) is one of the &quot;hardest to learn&quot; language in the world.</p>
<p>To be fair, Mandarin is not that hard when compared with learning the (now abandoned proposed standard) third generation of Simplified Chinese. In the current version of Simplified Chinese we see, at least a character is a character. In the 3rd version you may found a character representing something you&#39;d ordinary say as a word. The government officials realized that they&#39;re overdoing it so the proposed standard was thankfully abandoned.</p>

		<p>I think a sheet of ticket is just as (linguistically) interesting as a school of fish.</p>
<p>Mandarin is a simplified form of Cantonese and is already easier to learn. The Manchurians never succeeded to pronounce the sounds of Cantonese and ended up adopted Mandarin as the official Han language of the Ching dynasty.</p>

		<p>@Alex: Actually Cantonese is one of the older languages in China. It was established back before the Han Dynasty, used by Chu Kingdom (the southern region on the map) in the Warring States era.</p>
<p>That&#39;s why most of the &quot;Chu Ci&quot; (a kind of essay that used to be recite with particular rhythm) still sounds right with Cantonese.</p>

		<p>THe term &quot;normal language&quot;, &quot;ordinary language&quot;, or better yet, &quot;common language&quot;, is due to Chinese, or rather, Mandarin, becoming a single language. &nbsp;Give or take simple vs. traditional and different phonetics depending on the zone, it&#39;s still written the same way.</p>
<p>In software, we have an example, called Common Lisp, an attempt to standardize and unify lisp, which it did, but it was so expensive that it was fossilized.</p>

		<p>And than regarding Mandarin, it&#39;s language origin was the &quot;Northern Officials&#39; Language&quot; (北方官話), which evolved from &quot;Officials&#39; Language&quot; (官話) that established somewhere in latter Han Dynasty, so it&#39;s not correct to say &quot;Mandarin is a simplified form of Cantonese&quot;.</p>

		<p>@user: that reminds me of one thing that trips me *all the time* in English&#8230; The prepositions &quot;on&quot;, &quot;in&quot;, and &quot;at&quot; map to the same preposition (&quot;em&quot;) on my native language. When writing in English, I never know whether I used the correct one. Except for the very obvious cases (on the table, in a box), I end up going by &quot;pattern matching&quot; with everything I&#39;ve ever read in English; the correct case should sound more natural since it&#39;s the one I&#39;ve read more often, but there&#39;s always a nagging doubt.</p>

		<p>@Raymond: In English, ambiguity is frequently and gleefully exploited to humorous effect. This is especially true for homophones. Is the same true of the ambiguities in Mandarin? Do Mandarin speakers make more puns than English speakers?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Puns exist in Chinese, but homophones are in such abundance that ambiguity resolution is run automatically. If you had to consciously resolve ambiguity, you would be overwhelmed by the possibilities. You might not even realize that there&#39;s a pun in there until somebody points it out, and then you have to backtrack and run your parser a second time after disabling the ambiguity resolver. By analogy: Consider a chess puzzle, and the answer is &quot;Rb5, checkmate!&quot; You say &quot;No, that isn&#39;t checkmate.&quot; And then you have to stop and realize, &quot;Oh, he meant to move the other rook, the one on a2, which would be checkmate, except that it&#39;s also an illegal move.&quot; You had to rewind and turn off the ambiguity resolver (&quot;Was that Rab5 or Rcb5?&quot;) in order to let you see the illegal move. (Side note: In Chinese, puns are sometimes used to get around censors.) (Second side note: My ambiguity resolver for Cantonese is not well-developed, so I see puns where others don&#39;t. I&#39;ll make a pun, and people will just look at me funny until I explain it. Their ambiguity resolver filtered out my joke.) -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Maybe the next time somebody says that Chinese has no grammar you can point out about word order, which *is* grammar.</p>
<p>(I&#39;m not very knowledgeable in Chinese, so correct me where I&#39;m wrong)</p>
<p>Like if you say &quot;我爱你&quot;, this can only mean &quot;I love you&quot;. It can&#39;t never mean &quot;You love me&quot;, unlike, say, German and Latin where you can switch the subject and object and the sentences still have the same meaning but translating the sentences word for word (without regard to case) will give the wrong meaning.</p>
<p>Also if you want to say &quot;I love you&quot;, it has to be &quot;我爱你&quot;. Or maybe (I&#39;m just guessing here) &quot;爱你我&quot;. But in either case the word order grammar rule will give only 1 unambiguous meaning.</p>
<p>Perhaps they don&#39;t realize that word order is grammar because all languages they know have the same word order. If they also know Korean or Japanese (SOV), or Irish or Tagalog (VSO), or Klingon (OVS), or German, Latin, or Russian (somewhat free in order), or French and Spanish (which can be SVO or SOV depending on whether the object is a pronoun) they would have thought differently.</p>
<p>Or perhaps their understanding of &quot;Grammar&quot; is the overly simplistic, &quot;inflected by person and number&quot;.</p>

		<p>&gt; (They will naturally defend classifiers by saying that they are completely obvious and in no way arbitrary.) </p>
<p>Maybe _because_ they&#39;re native speakers, their mind imagines a commonality between ribbons and dogs and skirts that doesn&#39;t actually objectively exist. Like how different languages&#39; color names allegedly affects how people see color &#8211; Russian having two different kinds of blue [one of which includes most dark blues, and one of which includes the color of the daytime sky] which they don&#39;t see as any more similar than blue and green. Or, on the other hand, Japanese having a category &quot;blue&quot; which _includes_ green.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of every time someone tries to explain F# to me. They say &quot;look, it&#39;s simple&quot;. Then they say something about currying (which is apparently nothing to do with a Lamb Balti) and the rest becomes gibberish.</p>

		<p>In his autobiography, _Little Wilson and Big God_, Anthony Burgess writes that </p>
<p>&quot;[Malay] was a revelation. It had learned something that the more conservative tongues of the Indo-European family did not wish to learn&#8211;that properties like gender and word inflection were needless luxuries, that the strength of a language lay in semantic subtleties and not syntactic complexities, that the rigid taxonomy of &#39;parts of speech&#39; mean nothing. The Malay language, and later the Chinese, changed not just my attitude to communication in general but the whole shape of my mind.&quot;</p>

		<p>Regarding 普通话, I recall a Shanghai cab driver complimenting my friend (from Inner Mongolia) on his Mandarin using a phrase that ended with 很普通的. He translated it to me as &quot;your speech is very standard.&quot; (As an American I know we have dialects here too, but the idea that a Cajun could compliment someone from Maine on the &quot;standardness&quot; of his midwest accent is just really funny.) To compliment another Chinese native on his standard Mandarin definitely does not feel like &quot;everyone talks like this&quot; attitude to me.</p>
<p>Also a lot of older Shanghai people, especially older folks, instead of 普通话 would say 国语 which I took to mean &quot;national language&quot;.</p>
<p>Finally, regarding &nbsp;有 as a &quot;perfective&quot; particle. It seems like it is not a coincidence that it&#39;s also &quot;to possess&quot; because it does the same double duty in a lot of modern European languages like modern Greek, German, Albanian and English. And in Portuguese it even shows up twice &#8212; there are &quot;ter&quot; and &quot;haver&quot; which both mean to have but both serve as auxiliaries for perfect constructions. Seeing it do the same thing in both Indo-European languages and Chinese is kind of amazing.</p>
<p>What a fun blog you have!</p>

		<p>Cesar:</p>
<p>Not to nitpick but isn&#39;t the Spanish preposition that covers English &quot;in&quot;, &quot;on&quot;, or &quot;at&quot; written &quot;en&quot; and not &quot;em&quot;?</p>
<p>Going back to the article, I do find it funny though that everyone assumes what they experience or know to be &quot;normal&quot; and that everyone else is just going out of their way to be non-normal.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m a native speaker of Western U.S. English, yet I recognized by learning Spanish just how hard English is. &nbsp;English is just a huge mess. &nbsp;How to inflect words tends to vary depending on whether the word is German or French/Latin in origin. &nbsp;Spelling is ridiculous because the printing press came to England at the worst possible time in the history of English.</p>
<p>The way ambiguities in English are resolved is annoyingly subtle: in the last sentence of my first paragraph, if I had used &quot;English history&quot; instead of &quot;history of English&quot;, it would sound like I was referring to the history of England rather than the English language.</p>
<p>Of all the languages I&#39;ve seen, which, granted, is not many, Spanish seems the simplest among the natural languages.</p>

		<p>&gt; 1. Do not assign gender to inanimate objects. It is not obvious that doors are boys and windows are girls.</p>
<p>That is just to your English speaking brain. &nbsp;To someone speaking a language with gender this is a goofy statement. &nbsp;Various phrases would &quot;sound wrong&quot; if you don&#39;t have proper agreement of gender.</p>
<p>Even your exception (&quot;inanimate&quot; objects) shows your English speaking bias. &nbsp;If we are being objective, why exclude animate objects at all? &nbsp;English used to have genders for inanimate objects, too. &nbsp;It happened to drop them for inanimate objects and retain them for a few pronouns. &nbsp;But that is just the path it took, not all possible paths. &nbsp;Someone who speaks a language with no gender inflection whatsoever would find the distinction between &quot;he&quot; and &quot;she&quot; odd and confusing. &nbsp;I know people for whom this is a problem in their English learning.</p>
