		<p>Reference: The Service Pack Shuffle</p>
<p>There&#39;s one other case for needing to detect whether or not a particular update has been installed.</p>
<p>I had a case where on Windows XP SP2, installing a specific component of my application would result in a bluescreen that could not be easily cleared from safe mode (Windows Installer doesn&#39;t run in safe mode on XP). There was a particular update required to be able to install, so I checked for it by checking the version number of one of the files in the update (I believe it was kernel32.dll but that&#39;s not important). I got lucky and it wasn&#39;t one of those dual-mode updates (released between SP2 and SP3) so a simple greater-than version check did the job. Had it been such an update I don&#39;t know what I would have done. Calling Windows Update Agent would have been out of the question as I had to function without internet access (meaning WUA could theoretically not know of the update&#39;s existance) and the problem was so bad that I couldn&#39;t allow the install to continue.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: So if for whatever reason the user tried to reinstall SP2 they would immediately blue screen?</p>

		<p>If you are to read only one of these, go for ‘The Lying Disease’. It was truly shocking and weirdly interesting and sad at the same time. Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m living in a world partially filled with aliens masquerading as humans. Sigh.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re in for something shorter, I recommend the one about Best and Schadenfreude. I still remember seeing his cringe-worthy Spiel on Penn and Teller.</p>

		<p>@Neil: Nothing I can do about it. It&#39;s an MS component that&#39;s causing the bluescreen so I can&#39;t fix the bug in the component. Microsoft opted to fix the bug in Windows instead so that&#39;s what it is.</p>

		<p>@ &nbsp;free Windows Media Center add-on for Windows 8 Pro</p>
<p>to bad the site just says &quot;We couldn&#39;t process your order&quot; whenever you try to get a key (email address, used os and browser don&#39;t matter). well actually it does this since about a month: <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/141052-microsoft-accidentally-gifts-pirates-with-a-free-windows-8-pro-license-key" target="_new" rel="nofollow">http://www.extremetech.com/&#8230;/141052-microsoft-accidentally-gifts-pirates-with-a-free-windows-8-pro-license-key</a>. it is a shame that ms isn&#39;t able to put up a notify that they disabled the key process for now and will activate it later on again (maybe this time you have to use your valid win 8 key?).</p>

		<p>@ Undercover air marshals, you’re now welcome to board</p>
<p>I&#39;m confused by that line in the article&#8230; shouldn&#39;t they be on board like other aircraft passengers? If they&#39;re allowed to board earlier, people could have guessed who are possibly one of them, and therefore kind of defeat its purpose.</p>

		<p>@Ray</p>
<p>Watched the video about speech recognition twice and I still don&#39;t get the punch line you say it choked you at 7:30. It must be a Chinese related and since I don&#39;t speak Chinese can you elaborate a little bit please?</p>
