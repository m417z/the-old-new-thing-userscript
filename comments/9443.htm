		<p>Can you clarify the difference (if any) between the behavior of critical sections and slim reader/writer locks? &nbsp;In particular, the conditions you wrote lead to process termination are &quot;If you attempt to enter a critical section that is owned by a thread that was terminated by an earlier phase of process termination&hellip;&quot; and &quot;if you attempt to acquire a slim reader/writer lock during process termination, and the lock cannot be immediately acquired&quot;.</p>
<p>Note the discrepancy between the two. &nbsp;For critical sections, you only get terminated if the critical section is owned by a thread that&#39;s been terminated (very reasonable, since obviously that critical section is never going to be released). &nbsp;But for slim reader/writer locks, apparently even if the lock is simply held by some other still-running thread, that&#39;s enough to get the process killed.</p>
<p>Are the two criteria really different? &nbsp;If so, could you please elaborate on the motivation behind having different rules for the two different kinds of locks?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>There is no difference. There is no such thing as &quot;some other still-running thread&quot;, since all other threads have been terminated! In both cases, the rule is &quot;if the lock cannot be immediately acquired.&quot; I just expanded the definition of &quot;cannot be immediately acquired&quot; in the critical section case. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Is slim lock (as well as crit-sect) territory considered kernel folk turf? As far as I understand, it&#39;s pretty much usermode stuff. Also, are mutexes electrified? I guess not. But they have a separate status for such cases.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Right, SRW locks and critical sections are user-mode objects. I thought I explained that in the second paragraph. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>All of this is common sense. When you are terminating, you don&#39;t want to have a dependency on something that has already been shut down.</p>

		<p>Can I assume that this rule applies the slim reader/writer lock in .NET as well?</p>

		<p>It&#39;s pretty easy to just look at the source code and see that ReaderWriterLockSlim is implemented in C#. The ReaderWriterLock appears to be implemented with Windows APIs.</p>

		<p>Raymond, I was assuming that if you didn&#39;t know someone else who reads your blog would.</p>

<p>For this post your old slogan &quot;Not a .NET blog&quot; would be handy&#8230;</p>

		<p>Actually, what happened to the slogan?</p>
<p>And it is/was always &quot;Not a .NET blog&quot; &#8211; just said in a more microspeak/enterprisey/buzzword format&#8230;</p>
