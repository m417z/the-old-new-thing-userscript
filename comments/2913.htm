		<p>If it&#39;s by design that a textbox can have its caret blinking even when typing on the keyboard will not send characters to that textbox, then the design is wrong. Anyone who&#39;s ever accidentally typed their password into a different (and plain text) window than they intended will tell you that.</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8230;the window doesn&#39;t know that. It&#39;s sitting around as an active window, wondering why nobody is typing anything.&quot;</p>
<p>Man, now I feel bad for leaving the window on its own.</p>

		<p>What I&#39;ve always wondered is why this situation causes the &quot;activated&quot; window to show up randomly in the Z-order. Let&#39;s say I start an app, move on to two other apps (my calculator and my checkbook), and then the app shows its window. I would expect the app to show up either on top, between my checkbook and calculator, or just below my checkbook and calculator.</p>
<p>In reality what happens is that it will show up anywhere in the Z-order, from the bottom all the way to the top. It can be hard to even know that the app even launched.</p>

		<p>Now if I could only figure out why, when I&#39;m happily typing along, another app pops up some dialog, stealing focus, and causing my typing to go into the dialog&#8230; sometimes randomly dismissing the dialog depending on what keys are mapped, meaning I can&#39;t even see what happened. &nbsp;It&#39;s very annoying. &nbsp;Even Outlook has been known to do this occasionally. &nbsp;I thought the &quot;Another app/window cannot steal your focus&quot; problem had been solved, but apparently that&#39;s not strictly true&#8230;</p>

<p>Bleh. Easily fixed as follows: The caret blink timer calls GetForegroundWindow (GetActiveWindow won&#39;t work here) and not blink if it&#39;s not the right window.</p>
<p>Now for those who implemented their own textboxes with their own carets, it&#39;s their problem now.</p>

		<p>I agree with the sentiment that an app with the caret blinking but that doesn&#39;t actually have the focus is a really bad user experience (especially on multimonitor and especially in schemes with partially transparent window borders or low visual distinction between the foreground window and the other windows). &nbsp;Is there anything a developer can do to make sure their app is never blinking an an inappropriate moment? &nbsp;From your description, it doesn&#39;t sound like it, but I remain hopeful.</p>

		<p>When I&#39;m working with virtual machines, I sometimes forget whether the VM or the real computer has the mouse focus. &nbsp;Each machine has its own blinking edit cursor and thinks it owns the mouse, but in reality only one does, so you get multiple blinking cursors.</p>
<p>That problem is much trickier to solve &#8212; you&#39;d either need guest extensions in the VM to communicate to the guest OS that &quot;you just lost focus&quot;, or you&#39;d need the hypervisor to pull tricks like tell the guest OS that the mouse was unplugged when it loses focus.</p>

		<p>Windows doesn&#39;t seem to be handling well some non-respond cases (as I saw recently in Windows 7). Namely when a program hangs inside WM_INITMENU/WM_INITMENUPOPUP message (for example, when debugging a ON_UPDATE_COMMAND_UI handler). The program window then becomes impossible to switch from, and the debugger can never become a top window. You can start Task Manager, but it won&#39;t kill the program being debugged. Logout works, though.</p>

		<p>[Or apps which rely on the caret blink timer to perform other business logic.]</p>
<p>Having a visibly blinking caret and having a timer go off are different things though.</p>
<p>I&#39;m still a bit confused about what creates the unwanted situation though. Even if a window doesn&#39;t respond to messages when you switch away from it, shouldn&#39;t it still have a notification that it should no longer blink a caret sitting in its message queue?</p>

		<p>That means it&#39;s possible to make sure the caret (for standard controls, again whoever creates his own carets is on his own) will never show up when the window doesn&#39;t have focus without breaking backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>And I still cannot picture the chain of events (and messages) that create the problematic situation to begin with. The text in your article suggests that either Windows forgets to send the unfocus notification or that the window ignores it, in which case I don&#39;t see how the caret would ever be properly hidden when the window loses focus.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>To preserve backward compatibility, you would have to leave the timer running but somehow let it know, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m just running you for compatibility reasons.

		<p>I can&#39;t think of a time when I&#39;ve seen two windows in the same desktop with carets blinking simultaneously. Obviously it is a major problem with VMs, RDP clients, and the like. But how often does it happen within a single desktop?</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve been in the situation where PopularBrowser blinks what looks like a caret in the address bar, but the window isn&#39;t focussed and you cannot type in the address bar. It usually happens when launching the browser or creating a new window. But to the best of my knowledge they implemented their own caret (badly), so this isn&#39;t really what we&#39;re talking about here.</p>
<p>I cannot reproduce Raymond&#39;s scenario; I do get a WM_ACTIVATE(WA_ACTIVE, hWndPrevious) but then I get a WM_ACTIVATE(WA_INACTIVE, NULL) too and the edit control doesn&#39;t even receive focus, even though it does when I don&#39;t switch away during the Sleep. Oh well.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve got it with Raymond&#39;s scenario with one wrinkle. The application tried to steal global focus but was prevented from doing so.</p>
<p>[To preserve backward compatibility, you would have to leave the timer running but somehow let it know, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m just running you for compatibility reasons.

<p>Easy only for the standard controls. Custom controls would still blink.</p>
