		<p>&quot;and users will say, &quot;Harumph, why doesn&#8217;t this program work with voice recognition? All my other programs do.&quot;&quot;</p>
<p>Personally, I find it more likely that they&#8217;ll say, &quot;Harumph, why doesn&#8217;t voice recognition work with this program? &nbsp;It works with all my other programs.&quot;</p>
<p>The difference being, essentially, where blame gets placed. &nbsp;It might not be MS&#8217;s fault, but I&#8217;m sure that many people will assume it&#8217;s a deficiency in the voice recognition rather than in the non-accessable program.</p>

		<p>For websites, accessibility also means &quot;be nice to search engines trying to index your site&quot;.</p>
<p>The increasing graphical compexity of systems and of web pages is something I personally despise, and not just because I&#8217;ve seen GUI-coding move from being 80% of the programming, testing, and code for an application to well over 99%. That&#8217;s less accessible for the programmer, and adding no extra utility for the user.</p>
<p>Contrary to popular opinion, a &quot;too-pretty&quot; interface also makes the application less accessible and appealing to the end user: the overly-twee default XP theme is a case in point.</p>

		<p>Having worked with a few people with sight disabilities, I have had experience with some screen readers. </p>
<p>They do a wonderful job with what they are given, but there is so much more that we (as developers) can do to make them work better.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, many companies say &quot;the &lt;insert application here&gt; is only for our use, in-house. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t bother with the accessability stuff&quot;.</p>
<p>*sigh*</p>

		<p>Very true. As an example, my laptop has a feature where I can hold the middle button and then moving the mouse scrolls the window below the pointer instead of moving the pointer (IBM TrackScroll or something similar). This works very well with anything using the stock Windows controls, and works with varying amounts of success with other programs. As a couple of examples, Lotus WordPro ends up scrolling a page at a time as opposed to a few lines, and this doesn&#8217;t work at all with the contacts list in MSN Messenger (not singling MS out for blame here, there&#8217;s some just as bad open-source stuff). In both cases they&#8217;ve to a greater or lesser extent rolled their own scrollable window, and their own version doesn&#8217;t quite behave the same way as the system one.</p>
<p>The point is that by ignoring the system components, they&#8217;ve lost all the functionality that is provided by them. Which is quite a lot &#8211; the stock edit control for example has full clipboard support. It&#8217;s one of my pet peeves with a lot of programs, including some major open source projects (e.g. GTK) &#8211; the stock control isn&#8217;t pretty, so rather than make it owner-drawn they roll their own which doesn&#8217;t have any significant extra functionality.</p>

		<p>I suppose while we talk about speach reconition, I should mention that I predict *very* few people will use it.<br />
<br />Apple have had speach recognition built into the Mac OS since way back in the 68k days. Nobody uses it. In OS X its been hidden away in System Prefs, but it used to be much more prominent.</p>
<p>Reasons?<br />
<br />* Useless in an office environment. Too much ambient noise, getting worse the more people that use it.<br />
<br />* Same in public places.<br />
<br />* People feel embarrassed about talking to their computer. I remember reading a study on this somewhere, saying that unless people are alone in a room, they feel stupid talking to inanimate objects, even when they respond.<br />
<br />* Speech is often inaccurate, especially with background noise, requiring people to say the same thing several times, hightening the embarrasment.</p>
<p>So voice seems to be a feature that sounds godd in theory, but won&#8217;t take off, except for the visually impared.</p>
<p>Another thing, relating to this thread, is that it should not be possible to automate some dialogs, for security reasons. Look at what has become of the &quot;unsigned driver&quot; box (which was a silly idea in the first place, implemented for economic reasons only).</p>

<p>Back when WinXP was new, I knew some marketing folks wanted to use the XP look on their app on Windows 2000. They got designs from a graphics house and gave it to the devs, who laid out a UI pixel-by-pixel using their own controls.</p>
<p>The result was completely non-accessible: all the buttons were graphics; no keyboard navigation or hot-keys; was the same size at all screen resolutions; didn&#8217;t follow the color scheme the user picked. It wasn&#8217;t even skinnable.</p>
<p>But they didn&#8217;t care. It looked pretty.<br /></p>

		<p>I agree, accessibility support is very important and we&#8217;re investigating adding support for the VCL framework in Delphi. However, it&#8217;s unfortunate that MSAA isn&#8217;t better documented and rather than using brief pseudocode it would have been nice to see real world code and perhaps even an example. I&#8217;d love to see you discuss handling WM_GETOBJECT (my apologies if you&#8217;ve already discussed it before in which case link please &lt;g&gt;).</p>

		<ul>
<li>Chirping &quot;walk/don&#8217;t walk&quot; signs and automatic BART train announcements help me even though I see fine.
<p>&#8211; Firefox type-ahead find was partly for accessibility, and I love it. &nbsp; </p>
<p>&#8211; LABEL tags keep me from having to navigate my mouse onto tiny checkboxes and radio buttons.</p>
<p>&#8211; More &quot;semantic&quot; HTML sometimes helps both screenreaders and search engines use webpages effectively. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&#8211; More generally, you could argue that accessibility goes along with well-designed UI and code. &nbsp;Joel Spolsky, dude that he is, offered &quot;design for extremes&quot; as a UI design principle. &nbsp;A well-organized dialog composed of familiar widgets is good for screenreaders and for sighted folks. &nbsp;The cause and effect here are debatable, of course. &nbsp;</li>

		<p>OK folks&#8230; Perhaps I&#8217;m the only one who doesn&#8217;t get it, or perhaps the emperor indeed does not have any clothes.</p>
<p>Leaving aside test automation case, where I can actually see how accessibility could be useful, implementing accessibility for the disabled really seems like a quite altruistic (read: economically unjustified) effort. It means increasing the effort that goes into development by X%, while increasing market reach only by a much smaller Y%, Y &lt;&lt; X. So, leaving aside idealism and PR as motivation, why would any application developer want to invest in that? Increase the development expenses and thus the price EVERYONE has to pay for the same software?</p>
<p>It seems to me a more efficient solution would be centralized rather than dispersed &#8211; i.e. a company catering specifically to make existing software accessible to the disabled, and charging extra money for a smart solution that solves that, instead of each developer having to go (or chosing not to go) to great lengths to make each individual program accessible.</p>

		<p>In general, Microsoft has a pretty bad record of offloading responsibilities that should be taken care of centrally onto application developers, at the expense of reliability and security. </p>
<p>Cases in point &#8211; cooperative multithreading; and even nowadays, the general reliance of Windows on programs to be well-written, well-intended and well-behaved. </p>
<p>Only in recent years has Microsoft realized that it DOES need to take responsibility and does need to start solving problems centrally, and the effect of these initiatives has been better security and reliability for everyone. </p>
<p>Perhaps accessibility cannot be done without cooperation from programs. But yeah, right. Requiring programs to cooperate is the easy way out. Let the people who develop the accessibility feature instead do their job and create the accessibility infrastructure that won&#8217;t require any explicit cooperation, and then truly everyone will be satisfied.</p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>Windows does cover accessibility automatically if you do things the &#8220;conventional&#8221; way. It&#8217;s if you decide to be &#8220;clever&#8221; &#8212; owner-draw controls, windowless controls &#8212; that you need to do accessibility work. It&#8217;s unclear how Windows is expected to be able to figure out that your circle with a greater sign on it means &#8220;Next&#8221;. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>re: denis bider:<br />
<br />It seems that many folks do not deal with various large corporations or governments that may require accessability features to qualify for the whole bid. &nbsp;Thus, although the percent of users is small, the feature may be a qualification one and is necessary to actually qualify to bid the multi-million dollar job. &nbsp;Without the support the large payday cannot come.</p>
<p>I cannot imagine any construction company bidding to build a new post office without thoughts for ramps and such. &nbsp;The same is true in some cases for software.</p>
<p>Oh, and better testing support for better quality software can also be seen as bottom line addition as suport costs and bug fix costs drop.</p>

		<p>If ALL versions of developer stadio included a very good GUI testing tool that could be used for both unit and system testing of UI and depended on the accessible technologies. &nbsp;Developers would start to support accessible technologies in all new code just so they could test it without having to spend hours with a mouse! &nbsp; </p>
<p>If the testing tool is not free and in ALL versions of developer stadio, it is unlikely it will get used enough to make a difference.</p>
<p>Just think if all comp Sci students were expected to use such a tool on there third year projects, it would soon spread.</p>

		<p>I believe there are websites that will check your pages for accessibility &#8216;errors&#8217;. How many sites havn&#8217;t been tested and passed with these is rather large. I doubt desktop developers would make as much use of a tool as the web devs do wth theirs.</p>
<p>The best way to test is to send the app to a disabled user and see what they make of it.</p>
