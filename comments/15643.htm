		<p>What if a program exited unexpectedly? Did the system reroll the previous changes to cursor state?</p>

		<p>What happens if you called ShowCursor(FALSE) but then forgot to call ShowCursor(TRUE) and another app called ShowCursor(FALSE)&#8230; but DID remember to call ShowCurstor(TRUE)?</p>

		<p>Playing with our Surface machine here, I&#8217;ve always wondered why a cursor jumps out every now and then.. (and getting it to go hide again &#8230;)</p>

		<p>Also remember that with Windows 2.03 on a 8086, outputting on the screen without visible cursor and outputting to the screen with visible cursor were very different from the performance perspective! I know some programs and programmers that used ShowCursor() to increase the speed of the output.</p>

		<p>I can remember writing graphics programs under DOS with a mouse (and an installed mouse driver).</p>
<p>You needed to hide the mouse cursor before drawing to the screen, and then show the mouse cursor when you were done drawing. &nbsp;Otherwise, when you moved the mouse around there would be remnants of the mouse left behind where the application was drawing. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>This is very interesting. &nbsp;I never thought about those uses of the ShowCursor. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve always thought it was primarily for hiding the cursor when it shouldn&#8217;t be shown, for example, during a slide presentation or video playback.</p>

		<p>This behavior of course led to the ubiquitous forum thread:</p>
<p>A: &quot;How do I hide the cursor?&quot;</p>
<p>B: &quot;ShowCursor(FALSE)&quot;</p>
<p>A: &quot;I tried that, and it doesn&#8217;t work&quot;</p>
<p>C: &quot;You have to call it in a loop, like this:</p>
<p>while( ShowCursor(FALSE) ) {}&quot;</p>
<p>B: &quot;But [why that&#8217;s bad]&quot;</p>
<p>A: &quot;Thanx, C, that fixed it!&quot;</p>
<p>B: &quot;Aaaaaugh!&quot;</p>

		<p>&quot;And in a case of everything old is new again, the growing popularity of touch computing means that you once again have a class of computers with no mouse.&quot;</p>
<p>Good grief, even more of these dang 80s fashions are making themselves popular again. &nbsp;I&#8217;m not really looking forward to the shoulder pads and aviator sunglasses, but at least we&#8217;ll get miniskirts back.</p>

		<p>And Windows XP is still very usable without a mouse. Really, it is. When I am typing long stretches of text (code, reports) I often get by just using keyboard shortcuts. The only thing that really sucks without a mouse is the web.</p>
<p>And of course there we get to yet another reason to have the cursor on: the user might be using mouse keys, for example because they&#8217;re disabled and can&#8217;t use the mouse, or like me because I sometimes need to nudge the mouse pointer one pixel and I simply don&#8217;t have the dexterity.</p>
<p>By the way, I tried to turn off mouse keys and unplugged my mouse, but although Windows acknowledged that there was no mouse on the system anymore (ping-bong) it didn&#8217;t hide the mouse pointer. It just sat there, unmovable.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Dynamic unplug is a bad test, since Windows doesn&#8217;t have a time machine. The initial cursor show value was calculated at boot time. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Windows CE often has a touch screen, but it really just emulates a mouse. Tapping the screen moves the cursor around.</p>
<p>Which, when you think about it, is kinda handy for giving visual feedback oh where you tapped.</p>
<p>Otherwise you have to provide other kinds of feedback &#8211; see Windows Mobile/Phone.</p>
<p>Then again, touch systems often provide a mouse, for the few times that a developer evaded some programming taxes&#8230;</p>

		<p>How did the system handle switching between applications back when this was a global state &#8211; was this something handled in the default WM_ACTIVATE?</p>
<div class=post>[<i>If the system managed the cursor show count on a per-window basis then it wouldn&#8217;t be a global state any more!

		<p>Right, but that requires each application to know and react appropriately when it&#8217;s being switched, which was why I asked if it was handled in DefWindowProc.</p>
<p>I guess I didn&#8217;t see that as being &#8216;ruled out&#8217; by your statement that the system doesn&#8217;t manage it, since I didn&#8217;t see it as part of &#8220;the system&#8221; if it did.</p>
<p>So each program that messed with the ShowCursor state (other than ones that never yield before reverting the change) had to have its own code to save it and restore it?</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Over 99.99% of the time, programs do not yield before reverting the change. (The only example I can think of in the 0.01% percent is Reversi, and possibly not even Reversi.) Given the constraints, it was probably a fair trade-off. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Random832 has a good point. Programs like screensavers or PowerPoint that need to keep the cursor hidden would have to hide it when they activate and show it again when they deactivate.</p>
<p>I think Raymond is saying, however, that 99.99% of all programs had no need to ever show/hide the cursor except when displaying the hourglass. Since the hourglass only applies while performing a long operation, you would just show the hourglass before starting the operation and hide it afterwards, at which point you would yield control.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>PowerPoint isn&#8217;t even in the 0.01%, because it just does a SetCursor(NULL) in its WM_SETCURSOR handler to avoid having to &#8220;remember&#8221; to manage the cursor on activation changes. -Raymond</i>]</div>
