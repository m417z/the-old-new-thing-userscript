		<p>Several years ago, I was on an airplane, and I overheard a boating disaster story told by the guy in the seat behind me. &nbsp;It went like this:</p>
<p>&quot;OK, you know how the airport out in San Diego is right there on the water and the runway goes right up to the waterfront? &nbsp;Well, this buddy of mine was out boating out that way a while back. &nbsp;It was Memorial Day, and he&#39;s out enjoying the holiday, but when it was getting along towards evening, he decided to head back but he couldn&#39;t get his boat to start.</p>
<p>&quot;He got on the radio and started radioing to land for help, but it turned out there was a problem with his radio too. &nbsp;It would send, but he didn&#39;t hear anything as a response. &nbsp;So he figured it wasn&#39;t working at all. &nbsp;Back on land, they heard his distress call, but because of the holiday it took a long time to get a rescue crew together to go out and pick him up. &nbsp;So after a while, he figured no one was going to come and rescue him.</p>
<p>&quot;So my friend takes the next logical step: pulls out his flare gun and fires a shot up in the air, but he didn&#39;t look around first. &nbsp;So he fires a flare in the air&#8230; directly into the path of a plane on approach. &nbsp;It bursts right against the windshield, dazzles the pilot, and the pilot panics, pulls up in a big hurry, and radios to the tower saying &#39;Help, I&#39;m under attack!&#39;</p>
<p>&quot;Didn&#39;t take long at all after this for my buddy to get &#39;rescued&#39; by a very unamused platoon of Marines.&quot;</p>

		<p>Sounds like your friend was a bit in over his head</p>

		<p>Somehow the quote &quot;You&#39;re going to need a bigger boat&quot; seems to go with the blog title. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>I cast a spell to summon a bigger boat.</p>

		<p>Did he learn how to start the boat?</p>

		<p>I just want to know what the bag limit is during boat season&#8230;</p>
<p>(I&#39;m reminded of a colleague some years ago who changed a tape on the university&#39;s central server, shut the front door which protected the drives, then, from habit having just shut a door, turned the key &#8211; remembering a split second too late that the key was not to lock that drive door, but to control the system power supply. In those days, that mistake meant a few hours of filesystem repairs and some awkward questions to answer &#8211; though probably not quite as awkward as the ones the Coast Guard and Marine Corps had for the earlier story subjects!)</p>

		<p>But if this was your colleague, then by definition he was either a programmer or close to the sensitive business of software development? If so, wouldn&#39;t he consult documentation before pressing buttons on a boat? Or even better, ignore his wife&#39;s request?</p>

		<p>It sounds as if he started a boat all right, just not the one his wife had in mind.</p>

		<p>Why hadn&#39;t the wife given him a quick runthrough on critical buttons and systems beforehand? Did she point out safety vests? If he&#39;s &quot;not much of a boat person,&quot; he needs this runthrough before being allowed to touch anything even more&#8230; or she needs to not tell him to operate things.</p>
<p>Poor management, as we see too often&#8230;</p>
