		<p>How does it know that slot 247 actually IS LocalAlloc? Does it save the names along with the ordinal? I thought those were two separate tables, one matching names to ordinals and one matching ordinals to addresses.</p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>Sorry, I wasn&#8217;t clear enough. I&#8217;ve updated the entry. It&#8217;s slot 247 in the <b>name</b> table (the table that maps names to ordinals). -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Actually, I think it was me what pointed that out. &nbsp;:) And I&#8217;m sorry for the bad link in that post. &nbsp;It should be <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/0500/hood/" target=_new rel=nofollow rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/0500/hood/</a> without the trailing angle bracket. (Whoever wrote the link detection in the blog software should really fix that bug). </p>
<p>The &#8216;bind&#8217; utility that performs the DLL binding is part of the Platform SDK. &nbsp;Some documentation on it is available at <a href="http://windowssdk.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms726407.aspx" target=_new rel=nofollow rel="nofollow">http://windowssdk.msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms726407.aspx</a></p>

		<p>What happens if the file timestamp matches, but kernel32 (or whatever DLL &#8212; this isn&#8217;t very likely with kernel32) can&#8217;t be loaded at its preferred base address? &nbsp;The cached address (0x7C8099BD) would be wrong in that case, right? &nbsp;(If that&#8217;s actually a memory address, and not an RVA or something, then it would be.) </p>
<p>I assume there&#8217;s code in the loader to handle this case properly (i.e. fall back to either the ordinal hint or the name)?</p>

		<p>BryanK: &nbsp;That would just require a simple subtraction of the preferred base and addition of the actual base to the cached value.</p>

		<p>: it justs uses the cached value (0x7C8099BD). If they don&#8217;t match (for example, maybe there was a kernel32 hot-fix)&#8230; </p>
<p>How does it know they don&#8217;t match? I assume this value is just the entry address of the function. What other information could be obtained easily from this address to verify?</p>

		<p>Wouldn&#8217;t it be better if the checksum field in the PE header was actually populated by default, and it matched on that rather than the timestamp? &nbsp;That seems like a more reliable means of detecting a matching DLL.</p>

		<p>Raymond commented <br />&gt;Consider the cost of enforcing the checksum </p>
<p>If you were using it, you wouldn&#8217;t need to recalculate the checksum, it would just be one more 32 bit word you check to see if the DLL matches. It would only be calcuated by the linker when the DLL was built. </p>
<p>/I once worked on an embedded system which this information to compare module versions. </p>
<p>uint32 Checksum; &nbsp; // Just a sum of bytes <br />uint16 FileLength; <br />uint8 &nbsp;VersionNumber; </p>
<p>If any of these did not match, a new version would be downloaded. Unfortunately, the checksum was just an arithmetic sum of bytes, not a CRC, and there were some very small files where the order of bytes could change but nothing else. E.g. </p>
<p>0x01, 0x02, 0x03 has the same sum as <br />0x02, 0x01, 0x03 </p>
<p>The one byte version number was added to handle this. When you built new software, you checked for the file contents changing without altering the byte sum, and handled it by bumping the version byte manually. </p>
<p>There were date and time fields too, but the module comparer had been hacked to ignore them, since otherwise &#8216;rebuilding from the same label would cause loads of unnecessary downloads&#8217;. Sheesh.</p>

		<p>Well, you could refuse to load any DLLs that didn&#8217;t have the checksum set, but that would break every DLL ever shipped. The kernel does enforce the checksum for kernel mode &#8211; when I first installed Virtual PC on Windows 2000 from an MSDN download, the ISO had (silently) burned incorrectly and the VPC network driver was corrupted, so driver wouldn&#8217;t load. This caused Windows 2000 to bugcheck. On Windows XP it merely caused the network stack to stop working. </p>
<p>At this point I obtained ISOBuster and extracted the contents of the ISO to my hard disk, and installed from there. Much better.</p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>As I understand it, the original question was a hypothetical: &#8220;What if we required the checksum from day 1&#8230;&#8221; The first point is that without enforcement you haven&#8217;t gained anything. The second point is that enforcement in user-mode means you lose demand-paging. -Raymond</i>]</div>
