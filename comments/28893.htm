<p>For that matter, what tipped you guys off that people were doing this?</p>

		<p>What happens? &nbsp;Now they&#8217;re using a brush handle that in the best case is just &quot;freed&quot;, or it has been re-used as a different colour brush. &nbsp;Worst case, it&#8217;s not a brush handle anymore and who knows what will happen in that case&#8230;</p>

		<p>It would have been better if the Win95 developers would have introduced a new &#8216;system&#8217; flag for brushes instead of re-using the &#8216;do not delete because I am a class brush&#8217; flag&#8230;</p>

		<p>re: Frederik</p>
<p>Yeah, on casual analysis this just looks like bad design. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t implement an optimization and then break that very same optimization by implementing something that unregisters/destroys/whatever the handle regardless. &nbsp;Couldn&#8217;t the code check to see if the handle was some sort of special &quot;immortal&quot; handle and not tear it down in that case? &nbsp;Where these two features implemented by different groups or something?</p>

		<p>Isn&#8217;t hindsight wonderful? &nbsp;Obviously what happened was that originally there wasn&#8217;t (and as far as I know still isn&#8217;t) any support for reference counted brushes. &nbsp;Nothing wrong with that, it wasn&#8217;t deemed necessary in the original design.</p>
<p>So then along comes sombody who notices this perf issue. &nbsp;The GDI guys already have a mechanism to prevent &quot;system&quot; brushes from being deleted so it&#8217;s a trivial feature to implement. &nbsp;They either don&#8217;t remember or don&#8217;t know that the USER guys (a different team remember) are already monkeying around with this flag on thier own whim and boom you have a bug.</p>

		<p>Keep in mind this was 1995. Back then programmers were expected to cooperate with the system, and documenting what not to do was considered sufficient. That&#8217;s laughable now in the days where users must be protected from programmers, but it wasn&#8217;t then.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Keep in mind this was 1995. Back then programmers were expected to<br />
cooperate with the system, and documenting what not to do was<br />
considered sufficient.&#8221;</p>
<p>I disagree. &nbsp;While it was the case that many people were used<br />
to the idea, having moved over from Win16, and it was assumed that<br />
programmers weren&#8217;t nefarious, it wasn&#8217;t the case that it was assumed<br />
documentation would be a sufficient protection.</p>
<p>Simply put, programs crashed because of bugs. &nbsp;One of the main<br />
selling points of Windows 95, over Windows 3.11, was a greatly<br />
increased resistance to program crashes causing system-wide failures<br />
(along, of course, with a 32-bit api). &nbsp;Yet competitors of the<br />
time (OS/2 and Windows NT being good examples) implemented a truly<br />
separate memory address space (ie, they didn&#8217;t, AFAIK, leave critical<br />
shared DLLs in a read/writeable share arena where any program could do<br />
nasty things effecting all running programs) and worked to resolve<br />
misbehaving programs from causing the system to crash or other programs<br />
running at the same time to malfunction in unexpected (for the user)<br />
ways; ie, a programmer gotcha wouldn&#8217;t be covered and programs that did<br />
malfunction would almost certainly rapidly crash themselves alone.</p>
<p>Having said all that, this was clearly a bug and an oversight in the<br />
original design. &nbsp;Whoever designed it clearly wasn&#8217;t thinking far<br />
enough ahead to actual usage. &nbsp;Certainly such is a common affair<br />
in programming (sadly), but that doesn&#8217;t really excuse in any way this<br />
instance. &nbsp;In any case, it sounds like old news and an interesting<br />
example of how a simple design change many times need more thought put<br />
into it.</p>

		<p>&quot;System color brushes were a new Windows 95 feature. I thought you folks decided that people who mis-use new features deserve what they get.&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#8217;m not understanding the effects of destroying the system color brushes, but does that have a system-wide effect? &nbsp;If so, I&#8217;d like to point out that memory protection was also a new Windows 95 feature. &nbsp;It&#8217;d seem appropriate to make either the system color brushes read-only to processes or give each process their own copy.</p>
<p>If, however, system color brushes are local to a process only and the effect is merely one application trashing itself, then I guess I don&#8217;t see it as much of a big deal. &nbsp;It&#8217;d probably help if I were to study the MSDN before spouting off, eh?</p>

		<p>So what you&#8217;re saying, Raymond, is that there is a bug in Windows 95&#8217;s handling of system colour brushes in conjunction with Window backgrounds?</p>
<p>So why wasn&#8217;t it fixed!? I can understand keeping bug-compatability with older versions of Windows, but this was a new feature!</p>

		<p>I haven&#8217;t done any programming in 5 years, and did very little gdi stuff when I did, but I&#8217;ll take a guess at it. &nbsp;COLOR_XXX&#8217;s are defined starting at 0, hence the first would give you a null brush, which is either not a good thing or it has a special meaning (believe this is the case) therefore the +1.</p>

		<p>&gt; But of course, you didn&#8217;t need to use a</p>
<p>&gt; system color brush in the first place. You</p>
<p>&gt; should have used that (HBRUSH)(COLOR_xxx + 1)</p>
<p>&gt; pseudo-brush.</p>
<p>But of course you[*] DID need to use a system colour brush in the first place. &nbsp;When you discovered that you had to use that (HBRUSH)(COLOR_xxx + 1) pseudo-brush instead, you lost the following capability:</p>
<p>&gt; a magic type of brush which always paint in</p>
<p>&gt; the corresponding system color, even if the</p>
<p>&gt; system color changes</p>
<p>Pedantic correction to my own writing: &nbsp;you[*] didn&#8217;t lose that capability because</p>
<p>&gt; it seemed to work for a while, and then bad</p>
<p>&gt; things would start happening.</p>
<p>So you[*] never had that capability in the first place, you lost a misguided hope of having that capability. &nbsp;Still, I see how the idea sure looked attractive to programmers of the day, just as you[**] did.</p>

		<p>Jon, I will comment if it&#8217;s the same to you. That article is full of shit. Windows gives exactly two options, and they are the right ones, you know, those Joel pleads for, and I don&#8217;t understand what the hell the article is even about. Maybe about that &quot;advanced&quot; pop-up menu nobody concerned will ever see</p>
<p>The new &quot;sleep mode&quot; that debuts in Vista is also the &quot;right choice&quot;: it works as stand-by, i.e. instant power-on, but behind the scenes it also performs a hibernate, so when the power goes off or 20 minutes pass, the computer safely turns off and your session is preserved</p>

<p>On its own that statement is true, but it&#8217;s not a valid answer to complaints about Windows 95. &nbsp;People who wanted to pay for Windows NT instead of paying for Windows 95 (or 98) didn&#8217;t know where to get it. &nbsp;Unless we could make do with slyly configured crippled selections of hardware from about two vendors, we had to pay twice in order to get Windows NT.</p>
