		<p>And then you get to interact with my code. If I only placed 1 timer on my Window (the usual case), WM_TIMER isn&#39;t going to look at TimerId at all.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: Not an issue, your code never sees their timer callback. &nbsp;Either they used a timer procedure, or subclassed your window procedure and didn&#39;t forward it to you.</p>
<p>If your code sees it, it means it didn&#39;t reach the code meant to handle it.</p>

		<p>@Ben Voigt: Actually it can be an issue, I came across it once (had to debug it to figure out what went wrong). Some third party control created a global refresh timer without checking the timer ID and ended up reacting to unrelated timers. Can&#39;t remember how exactly the timers were configured though. There may have been global hooks involved in the controls implementation, it was an onscreen keyboard control. We ended up not buying that control ;)</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Strange, because both of the standard ways of doing this avoid letting the original window procedure see the unknown timer message. You can register your timer with a <code>TIMERPROC</code>, in which the message is handled inside <code>Dispatch&shy;Message</code> and never reaches the window procedure; or you subclass the window and pick off the timer without forwarding to the original window procedure. If they installed a global hook, then they will see all sorts of timers they didn&#39;t create, so that can&#39;t be it either. Unless they also assumed that there were no other windows on their thread? -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@Someone: Ahh, well that&#39;s not your code seeing their timer, it is their code seeing your timer. &nbsp;The subclass procedure definitely needs to be written to forward timers it doesn&#39;t own to the original window procedure.</p>

		<p>My guess: they handled WM_TIMER inside the message loop for some (probably bad) reason, rather than calling DispatchMessage and handling it in the window proc. Hope they never create any modal dialogs.</p>

		<p>@parkrrrr: They might have done it on purpose so that the timer didn&#39;t do anything when a modal dialogue was up. Quite a few programmers don&#39;t expect their timers to fire when a message box is up for instance, it&#39;s quite funny when they put up a message box from the timer and their screen gets filled with them.</p>

		<p>@Raymond: They probably tested their onscreen keyboard mostly as a standalone process or in simple test programs, never in a real application, even though usage as embedded control was a supported and advertised configuration (and the one we were looking for at that time). That&#39;s the only way I can imagine someone coming up with something that broken. We sent them a bugreport but never heared back from them.</p>

		<p>&gt; It&#39;s hardly a coincidence that the timer ID space is the same size as the address space.</p>
<p>So someone intentionally designed it this way?</p>
