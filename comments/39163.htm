		<p>Wow, that&#8217;s ace. Reminds me of the Thrift Store Paintings which I went to see at the ICA, in London, a few years back, which was great fun and more than a little disturbing.</p>
<p>I was searching for details of this, and it turns out that Bad Art has it&#8217;s own section in the Yahoo Directory: <a target="_new" href="http://tinyurl.com/2efdn" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/2efdn</a></p>
<p>I never realised that it was a full full blown movement in it&#8217;s own right. Lots of good stuff.</p>
