		<p>Maybe the program maintains in memory information that the user isn&#8217;t allowed/supposed to see (perhaps credentials for a web service, or a private key, in clear text?). Then, the user could use the &#8220;attack&#8221; to reveal them. But, anyway, the user could do this with a memory browser, so it would only reveal the real problem (in this hypothetical case, storing clear text secrets).</p>

		<p>How about if the program was running at a higher privilege level than the programs the user could normally run, so the user would not normally be able to view the memory of the program except via this bug? (Like how setuid and setgid programs in Linux are used to regulate access to some resources.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s contrived though, and still not remote and not code execution.</p>

		<p>There was a number of classic bugs where you could get SUID binaries to dump a world-readable core containing /etc/shadow. Or outright spit it out (for example by having them attempt to use it as configuration and reporting syntax errors showing the contents of each line).</p>

<p>But surely nobody would be stupid enough to allow that to allow a bug that significant through into production! Ah.<br />

		<p>Yeah, but that&#8217;s not an overrun.  Assuming the password was stored hashed (which it should be, or you could just read it off the disk), the most likely thing that happened is that it was being _set_ to the password on creation.  Probably, something that was done for debug/test purposes, and never got removed.  The error here was faulty programmer logic, not faulty program logic.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what the article says:<br />
&#8220;If a hint was set in Disk Utility when creating an APFS encrypted volume, the password was stored as the hint. This was addressed by clearing hint storage if the hint was the password, and by improving the logic for storing hints.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Microsoft have tradition of thank people who give them information about the vulnerability.</p>
<p><a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/mt745121.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/library/security/mt745121.aspx</a></p>
<p>This gives incentive to security researchers to file report so they can get their name listed for fame. (I think it helps to include a link to official website of major software vendor for your achievements if you&#8217;re going to apply a position in these companies)</p>

		<blockquote><p>First of all, there is no writing going on.</p></blockquote>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t inherently make it not a severe bug.  There was no writing going on in Heartbleed, but it was still one of the most serious buffer overrun exploits of all time.</p>

		<p>True, but that comes under the &#8220;Information Disclosure / Exfiltration&#8221; part of the post.  </p>
<p>Heartbleed was it disaster because it not only allowed Information Discloure of attacker-controlled *very* *very* secret information (private keys), but it also sent them over the internet to anyone who knew how to request them.  This bug requires a local-attacker to produce non-exfiltrated disclosure of non-attacker-controlled data.</p>

		<p>Yeah, that&#8217;s the key thing. It&#8217;s certainly in the same category of bug as Heartbleed&#8230; but the seriousness of Heartbleed was three-fold&#8230; it could be exploited remotely, it revealed highly sensitive data, and it could at least partly be targeted. The bug described here, not so much.</p>

		<p>The information returned by Heartbleed was attacker-controlled? I thought it was just whatever 64k bytes happened to follow the allocated buffer in memory&#8230; Of course, successive attacks with brand-new connections would cause such buffers to be reallocated elsewhere, allowing to probe most of the server process&#8217;s memory over time even without attacker control.</p>

		<p>OK Raymond, plenty of stories throughout the years where people report false security vulnerabilities, they already are on the other side of the air hatch and so on. But how about one story where an actual vulnerability was reported? Because every 2 or 3 months we read about another Windows zero-day vulnerability that was used to gain access to people/organizations computers. When do we get one of those for a change?</p>

		<p>I remember one long ago where the security bug did indeed involve the font rendered. It mattered somewhat what the characters were, but mostly it mattered the sheer length of the string to be rendered had to be tens of kilobytes of length, so there was no possibility of exploiting it over a filename.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this yielded a direct to kernel exploit from a large  in webpage served off the internet.  Thank you Nxxxxx.</p>

		<p>Well, I think it depends on the nature of the application.</p>
<p>If that application reads from a database, and the next string variable to the &#8220;input&#8221; is part of SQL statement, there could be valid &#8220;information disclosure&#8221; type of vulnerabilities. (In my experience, not many companies have implemented schema/table based access control on their database server. Most, at most, implemented database based access control only. So be able to alter SQL statement means they may read data they shouldn&#8217;t be able to read)</p>

		<p>I think if you count a &#8220;vulnerability&#8221; needs debugger to work as vulnerability, all applications that includes parts that runs under impersonation context fails.</p>

		<p>If you can attach a debugger, you are already past the hatchway. Most of the time.</p>

		<p>&#8220;But if you have sufficient charisma to socially-engineer the victim into performing those operations, or you have sufficient privileges to perform automation, then why are you wasting your time attacking this program?&#8221;</p>
<p>I think these two are far from being equivalent. The &#8220;if you have sufficient privileges&#8221; argument always holds, but social engineering is tricky: some users might be fooled into clicking some icons or entering commands into a program that is already on their computer, but not into typing a URL or running a downloaded executable</p>
