		<p>Not only that, but the phrase &quot;without any hesitation&quot; is hesitation :-)</p>

		<p>No, I think it&#8217;s actually a correct statement. His confidence is applied to the fact that he thinks it will happen, not that it will happen :)</p>
<p>(Err ok, what I said isn&#8217;t that clear, but hopefully you understand what I mean).</p>

		<p>In Russia, we have an anecdote that goes like this:<br />
<br />==<br />
<br />Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are flying a balloon. It’s misty. They lose their way.</p>
<p>Suddenly they see a skyscraper and a man in one of the windows. “Where are we?” they ask him. He thinks for a while and answers, “In the basket of a balloon.”</p>
<p>“Damn those mathematicians,” says Holmes, as the fly away from the skyscraper.</p>
<p>“Holmes, how did you know he was a mathematician?”</p>
<p>“Elementary, Watson. His answer was absolutely correct and absolutely irrelevant to us.”<br />
<br />==</p>

		<p>You get the same joke with a manager and an engineer. The manager asks where he is and the engineer&#8217;s answer is absolutely correct but completely useless. Then the manager says &quot;I&#8217;m lost, get me out of here!&quot; &#8211; ordering the engineer to do something impossible to fix the manager&#8217;s mistake. Oh well&#8230;</p>
