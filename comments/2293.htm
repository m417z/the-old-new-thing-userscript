		<p>&quot;Gladly, the cross-eyed bear&quot; is what I used to hear too whenever I listened to the hymn &quot;Keep Thou My Way&quot;. I didn&#39;t even know there was a word for this till I went searching for the phrase and came across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondegreen#In_songs" rel="nofollow" target="_new">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Mondegreen</a> :D</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Off-topic continuation of my post yesterday ( <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/12/16/10482308.aspx#10484202" rel="nofollow" target="_new">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/10482308.aspx</a> ), couldn&#39;t post there any more, last time Raymond, I promise: Turns out you were absolutely right, the bottom edge of the maximized Firefox window was overlapping the top of the taskbar, and hence Alt+PrtSc captured the latter too. _However_, I have confirmed on 3 other Windows 7 32 and 64-bit PCs with both integrated and external graphics that this seems to be a quirk of Aero Basic. With full Aero enabled the bottom border of the maximized browser window is still as fat and should result in a similar effect, but pressing Alt+PrtSc somehow excludes that top sliver of the taskbar. Looks like Aero Basic is just not as intelligent when it comes to excluding the taskbar from the screenshot, and Intel is not to blame here after all.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the graphics subsystem could have been &quot;intelligent&quot; enough to detect and exclude (or blank out) the overlapped portion of the active window from the screenshot, or maybe there was a technical barrier to this. Anyway thanks a lot Raymond, I really appreciate you taking the time to respond and explain. Now, back to the regular scheduled programming&#8230; :)</p>

		<p>As someone who watches &quot;Restaurant Impossible&quot;, I had no idea about the St. Petersburg story until just now.</p>

		<p>South Frisian?</p>
<p>There&#39;s a North Frisia, but the remainder of Frisia is not commonly called South Frisia (Friesland)&#8230;.</p>
