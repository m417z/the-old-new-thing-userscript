		<p>I came up with orange safety vest guy&#8217;s solution. The gift shop clerk&#8217;s proposal was also a possibility, but seemed far less efficient. I didn&#8217;t even consider the self-identified engineer&#8217;s option and I&#8217;ve been on enough car ferries to strongly doubt there would be enough room on a full car deck.</p>

		<p>Thanks for the article.  Interesting read.  Clearly shows the mindset of an engineer.  Always have to know how it works :)</p>

		<p>I have been on that ferry several times, but only before about 1990. Never thought about the situation before. Thank you for a most excellent diversion just now. Well played.</p>
<p>I now live in Georgia now. Like that matters&#8230;</p>

		<p>The problem statement has misleading information.  It says &#8220;the cars which boarded in Friday Harbor are facing backward. And they are pointed at each other nose-to-nose.&#8221;  </p>
<p>There is no mention that there is more than one lane on the ferry (although we could maybe guess that, it wasn&#8217;t in the illustration).  The mention that the cars pointed at each other &#8220;nose to nose&#8221; doesn&#8217;t say that there are some lanes where this is not true.  I suppose that the complete info would have made the problem too easy&#8230;.</p>

		<p>I too read &#8220;We wondered how the three lanes of cars were&#8230;.&#8221; and then thought &#8220;What!??&#8221;.  I reread and couldn&#8217;t see reference to the lanes earlier.  I guess mentioning what was observed &#8211; that there was an entire line still facing one direction may have given the game away (assuming you could see the entire line in one view, which is probably unlikely)</p>

		<p>Easy solution: have the cars which board at Friday Harbor drive backwards onto the ferry.  Perhaps even employ one of the orange-safety-vest people as a valet.  All cars would be facing the direction of travel at the last dock which should ease the deboarding process.</p>

		<p>Ferry from Bari to Durres does that with big vehicles like trucks. No wonder the ferry left two hours after original departure time :-)<br />
It is loaded from back only, not the normal ro-ro style.</p>

		<p>Dumb question.  How do more people get on the ferry at Friday Harbor than get off??  Do they not fill the ferry to capacity and leave space at the front of the line(s)?  Just curious?  I&#8217;ve made this run multiple times and never paid attention as to how it was done.  It didn&#8217;t even register that the cars loading at Friday Harbor were facing the cars loaded at Anacortes.  And wouldn&#8217;t Orcas, Shaw, and Lopez be handled the same way?</p>

		<p>If more people are getting on at Friday Harbor than off, then they have to leave room at the front of the ferry at Anacortes.</p>

		<p>I wonder what the fuss is about. Backing off a ferry in reverse for one or two car lengths, to me, seems to be a manageable challenge. Once you are on dry land, you can always make a three-point turn and continue forward in the right direction.</p>

		<p>You also have to traverse <a href="https://www.simply-san-juan.com/" rel="nofollow">the boarding ramp</a> in reverse. That camper van driver was not happy.</p>

		<p>Think of it from the perspective of the ferry operator: what cheaper to operate?  The ferry as-is, with people backing out/turning around on board, with guidance from crew members, or a massive investment in their fleet of ships, to equip them with some sort of lazy susan?</p>

		<p>My memory is a little hazy, but IIRC, the ferry &#8220;The Cat&#8221; that formerly operated* between Bar Harbor, Maine and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia only had a vehicle ramp on one end, and it had a semicircular turnaround lane at the other end.  During loading, some of the cars would board, use the turnaround, then face backwards during transit, while the cars that boarded later would stay facing forwards and fill in the remaining lanes.  During unloading, the cars facing backwards would exit, then the other cars facing forwards would drive through the turnaround and exit.</p>
<p>* I&#8217;m specifically referring to the ship that operated between 2002–2005.  The ship that currently operates between Portland, Maine and Yarmouth is a different one, though it looks quite similar.  Interestingly, the FAQ for that one <a href="https://www.ferries.ca/thecat/faq/" rel="nofollow">https://www.ferries.ca/thecat/faq/</a> mentions that RVs must board *and* exit backwards.  I can&#8217;t think of why that would be necessary.</p>
<p>(I might also be confusing this with the M/S Scotia Prince, a different ship that formerly operated between Portland and Yarmouth.  Like I said, my memory is hazy.)</p>

		<p>Once cars have driven off at Friday Harbor, all remaining vehicles move forward as far as possible.<br />
Ferry backs out, turns around, and re-docks the other way.<br />
New cars drive in.</p>

		<p>Only a few cars get off at Friday Harbor. Your plan would require the entire ferry to get back in their cars just to let 20 cars off. And turning a ferry around and redocking takes a long time as well.</p>

		<p>My solution was to divide the ferry vertically, so that all of the cars travelling the full distance park on one side and the cars going half-way park on the other side; they then leave forwards at the half-way point and the new cars drive on facing the other way; those new cars then leave forwards at the destination while the other cars can then use the space to turn around. However I see now the benefit of single lane approach, as long as you arrange for a diagonal border something like this (if the blog formatting doesn&#8217;t get in my way):</p>
<p>[oo} [oo} [oo} [oo} [oo} [oo} [oo} [oo} [oo} 9 facing forwards<br />
[oo} [oo} [oo} [oo} {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] 4 forwards 5 backwards<br />
[oo} [oo} [oo} {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] 3 forwards 6 backwards<br />
[oo} [oo} {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] 2 forwards 7 backwards</p>
<p>After emptying the 18 facing forwards the 7 facing backwards U-turn in the available space and the other 11 cars can then follow them.</p>

		<p>My first idea was to drive the cars that are in reverse out backwards. </p>
<p>But then I remember that I sometimes have trouble driving my car backwards out of my 3 car garage&#8230;</p>
