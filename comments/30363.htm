		<p>This seems like a problem for the CRT. &nbsp;As far as I know, VC gives you the option of statically or dynamically linking the CRT. &nbsp;But it seems like the headers will have to make a choice to support one thing better than the other. &nbsp;Conditional compilation would work, but then people would have to remember to include a #define somewhere. &nbsp;Is this dllimport vs. static linking thing something the compiler could figure out on its own if you&#8217;re doing Link-time codegen?</p>

		<p>&#8220;All this discussion is for x86, by the way. Other architectures have different quirks.&#8221; </p>
<p>Huh? Surely you mean this is for PE/x86. Other formats (e.g. ELF/x86) will naturally have a different shared library ABI (with related quirks). But given that you&#8217;re talking about PE/x86, what other architectures does PE run on? (Aside from PE/x86-64, which will be mostly running 32-bit userspace apps anyway) </p>

		<p>Don&#8217;t forget the DEC Alpha, and every other processor that NT used to support. Each one has there own quirks.</p>

		<p>nksingh:<br />
<br />You bet this is an issue for the CRT. &nbsp;The CRT headers use a lot of conditional compilation. &nbsp;Look at the file &quot;crtdefs.h&quot;. &nbsp;This defines &quot;_CRTIMP&quot; as either &quot;__declspec(dllimport)&quot; or nothing, depending on whether or not you&#8217;re using the DLL version of the CRT. &nbsp;Every CRT export has &quot;_CRTIMP&quot; (or some variation) in front of it. &nbsp;Luckily, most people don&#8217;t have to remember how this works, so most people don&#8217;t have to worry about forgetting to put the _CRTIMP prefix on the functions.</p>
<p>You do have to do something so the compiler knows what you want, though. &nbsp;The VC 8.0 CRT uses the _DLL symbol to decide whether or not to import the functions. &nbsp;You can get this symbol defined (or not) based on a #define in a common header (probably not the best way), by passing -D_DLL or some other symbol as a command-line argument, or by using one of the -M?? switches (which is like passing -D_DLL plus some other stuff).</p>

		<p>Right &#8211; the context *is* well-established now.</p>
<p>*That&#8217;s what confused me!*</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to figure out why the clarification was necessary, or what other information it gave us than that which was already implied by the *last couple of weeks* posts (which have been excellent). I couldn&#8217;t figure out was the reason for the clarification was, so assumed I must have been missing something. (Happens a lot :)</p>
<p>Sorry to come across as one of the Nitpick Police.</p>
<p>/me tiptoes away, trying to not draw any more attention&#8230;</p>

		<p>Raymond, you mentioned in a previous entry in this series &#8220;Next time, we&#8217;ll look at the dllexport declaration specifier&#8230;&#8221;. I have yet to find a mention of it. Did you decide to save it for later, did it somehow got lost, or am I just blind?</p>
<p>(Me, I think <strong>dllexport simply tags the name for publication, much like a .def file would do, but without the power of the .def file to rename exported symbols and so on)</p>
<p>On the subject of __imp</strong> prepended function names &#8211; is that the only thing __dllimport does &#8211; renaming the entry in the import-lib (actually, more like providing the mapping __imp_X -&gt; X) to be externally visible as __imp__sym for the symbol sym in the DLL the import library is generated for?</p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>Or (3) I mean dllimport, not dllexport. Typo. dllimport influences the codegen of the DLL&#8217;s clients. It control how the DLL is <b>consumed</b> not how it is <b>produced</b>. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>How appropriate that I wrote &quot;__dllimport&quot; when I intended __dllexport to generate the names. :-)</p>
<p>Still, does __dllexport do anything else but create the name __imp__X for X in the import library, even if subtle things like &quot;slightly&quot; modify optimizations or anything else? Even if not, how exactly does that work (on a COFF level if you don&#8217;t mind)? There must be a &quot;mapping&quot; stored in the COFF object file for the linker to pick it up, no? Is it simply that addr X get referred by the name real_fn as tatic, and __imp__real_fn as public?</p>

		<p>Does anyone have any idea of how much the __dllimport optimisation is worth these days? I mean how much faster is the optimised case than the &quot;naive mode&quot; case on modern CPUs?</p>

		<p>Is the optimized call always slower than a local call? File size increases one extra byte, why?</p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>Sigh. I already answered the extra byte question in the fifth paragraph. Please read the article before asking questions. I&#8217;m not going to talk about performance issues because performance is complicated. Different CPUs behave differently. -Raymond</i>]</div>
