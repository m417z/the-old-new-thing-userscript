		<p>Small typo: your #define declare intercept*able* instead of intercept*ed*.</p>

		<p>How timely !</p>
<p>I was wondering how to redirect calls to undocumented functions (like ddraw&#8217;s AcquireDDThreadLock), and how DDrawCompat did it (it turns out it uses Detour Express to simply &#8220;jump&#8221; to those functions by calling the real ddraw.dll).</p>
<p>I was hooking calls to functions such as DirectDrawCreate easily thanks to the types and functions defined in ddraw.h,</p>
<p>As it was very early in my project, I simply did this for each function :<br />
&#8211; define a function with the same name in EXPORTS section of the DEF file (example : &#8220;DirectDrawCreate = DirectDrawCreateHook&#8221;)<br />
&#8211; define a function with matching return type (from ddraw.h) that simply calls the real function imported from ddraw.h</p>
<p>But for those undocumented functions I could not call them by name (AcquireDDThreadLock is not defined in ddraw.h) nor know which type they returned (again, not defined).</p>
<p>As I was seeing it, Run&#8217;Time Dynamic Linking was only an answer to the &#8220;call the real function&#8221; part (of course I was wrong).</p>
<p>But I wondered how people did it before Detour / EasyHook, and this give such an &#8220;of course !&#8221; solution that I&#8217;m a little ashamed I didn&#8217;t think of it sooner.</p>
<p>Thanks a lot !</p>

		<p>The wonderful book &#8220;Working Effectively with Legacy Code&#8221; by Michael Feathers describes all kinds of techniques like this (usually in a language-neutral way) for &#8220;hooking&#8221; into places and making &#8220;seams&#8221; to be able to test individual pieces of things. Usually, one can find some way to abuse a compiler to point things to your own code when the code you&#8217;re testing isn&#8217;t expecting things, even in a non-OO language.</p>

		<p>So many projects try to globally replace malloc and free that I&#8217;m mildly surprised the C and C++ standards committees haven&#8217;t provided official hook points.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s because so many projects don&#8217;t actually have a good reason.  Library implementations and/or compiler instrumentation seem good enough for finding bugs (leaks, double-frees, pathological allocation patterns).</p>
<p>The system allocators are about as efficient (and secure) as general purpose allocators can be.  But many project still insist on changing the allocator for performance.  The way you get better performance is to exploit something specific about your application&#8217;s allocation patterns.  For any non-trivial app, though, those patterns are specific to only a portion of your application, so hooking at the global level is overkill and surrenders the other benefits of the system allocator.  So, sure, it might make sense to allocate all your fribblediwidgets with an arena allocator, but hijacking all allocations is fraught with peril.</p>
<p>I hope that one day, the C++ compiler folks will change new and delete to use something other than malloc and free, just to screw with all the C++ developers who&#8217;ve replaced malloc and free.</p>

		<p>They do, it&#8217;s called ld. The C standard doesn&#8217;t define dynamic linking, so they expect that defining the symbol redirects callers in the standard library to it.</p>

<p>Playing devil&#8217;s advocate, if you&#8217;re going to reinvent the allocation wheel for part of your application, then your allocator probably wants to have some understanding of the memory usage of the rest of the application.  That means hooking malloc for accounting purposes.</p>
<p>But the real question is why you&#8217;re reinventing the wheel in the first place.  Is the performance issue really big enough to justify all that developer time, and the fragility that comes with it (see: Heartbleed, etc.)?</p>

		<p>Don&#8217;t be silly, Contoso would never have had something on Linux in the first place :P</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s all fun and games until they start encountering nasty stuff, like an MSVC header where memory is allocated with _malloc_dbg, but freed with regular free (such as strstream, for example).</p>

		<p>An aside on Linux, how dynamic linking is different, and LD_PRELOAD would have been fun.  ;)</p>
