		<p>@Damien To be more precise, they never visited each wizard page multiple times during the same run.</p>

		<p>And in my attempt to be more precise I just reiterated what Raymond already said, whoops.</p>
<p>Anyway they might have assumed features of the wizard system that simply don&#39;t exist (automatic cleanup) and only focused on testing each page individually and assumed that testing Back/Forward wasn&#39;t necessary since that&#39;s the wizard&#39;s job to make sure that works&#8230;</p>

		<p>&quot;Testing Back/Forward wasn&#39;t necessary since that&#39;s the wizard&#39;s job to make sure that works&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>As a tester myself, I think that assumptions (what to test/not to test) are very bad for testers to make. But i also understand practical challenges, managers always wants to make some decisions on your behalf, &quot;why are you testing that control, its Microsoft&#39;s, and they have already tested it, Just make sure our code (UI) works fine with it)&quot;. If the tester doesn&#39;t know how to raise concerns or convince managers then they will just test individual pages, and we get this output.</p>
<p>Also with new development methodologies (like in Agile) testers may end up getting the code in chunks (one wizard page at a time), and if the regression test suite is not updated/designed back/forward may never be covered in the test cases.</p>

		<p>You only need back if you do something wrong. I&#39;ve even seen wizards which didn&#39;t have a consistent order of steps, the buttons worked more like a random web. It has happened enough times for me to not trust back buttons in wizards. Though the most irritating wizard I&#39;ve seen is the old Telephone cpl applet, which you have to kill with task manager to quit if you don&#39;t want to finish it.</p>
