		<p>But if we were offended by these fake apologies they have to issue another fake apology for offending us with their original fake apology. &nbsp;It&#8217;s the infinite loop of life.</p>
<p>In other news, The Daily WTF changed its name to &quot;Worse Than Failure&quot;, obviously to be more PC or whatever. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t really like backronyms in general, but this crosses the line. &nbsp;The REAL WTF is that WTF no longer stands for WTF. &nbsp;WTF?</p>

		<p>The thing that amazes me about those public figures (namechecked in the Saletan article) who blame their behaviour on &quot;prescription medicines&quot; is that they never seem to bring any legal action against the doctor who ruined their lives by such irresponsible prescribing. Surely a medical professional, faced with somebody demanding a repeat prescription for an addictive drug, shouldn&#8217;t just write one out, but should first check their medical records, as well as carrying out a full assessment to determine if the treatment is appropriate or not?</p>
<p>And come to that, why are celebrities prescribed painkillers that are so much more addictive than those used by the rest of us? I&#8217;ve never heard of a non-celebrity becoming addicted to painkillers, even after recovering from prolonged illness requiring months or years of medication.</p>

		<p>When I use this sort of &quot;apology&quot;, I am making a point out of it. It&#8217;s phrased in that way because indeed I am not sorry for what I did, and the other person is indeed a crybaby (or whatever the case may be). When I actually am sorry I don&#8217;t use the &quot;fauxpology&quot;.</p>

		<p>I say people who cannot go through life without being apologized to everytime they&#8217;re offended are pansy crybabies. &nbsp;Grow up and get over it!</p>
<p>Besides, the problem isn&#8217;t the apology. &nbsp;You can&#8217;t force someone to feel sorry for something they have no remorse over. &nbsp;The problem is that politicians are career politians and do what they please in office rather than what is right or what the will of the people is&#8211;whether Democrat or Republican. &nbsp;We need men to step up to the plate and really serve our country by holding public offices rather than run around complaining all the time and doing nothing about it. &nbsp;Get these you-know-what&#8217;s out of there!</p>

<p>(Yes, Raymond, I know that when you post about problems, you don&#8217;t like that everybody comments how your company makes those problems too, but this isn&#8217;t an attack to you&#8230; it&#8217;s just what came to my mind after reading your post.)</p>

		<p>&quot;As befits its name, you see it most often in politics, where poorly-thought-out solutions are proposed for urgent problems.&quot;</p>
<p>Because their constituents demand it. Never mind the problems are often bigger than what the politicans can control, they must appear to be doing something &#8211; anything &#8211; or else risk being labeled &quot;ineffective.&quot;</p>
<p>Plus, it also calms the public down, giving time to develop a solution rationally (or not)</p>
<p>It stands to reason, that most people do not recognize poor solutions, because if we had any idea how to solve a problem, we would not need the government to do it for us, now would we?</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s often called &quot;the Thatcherite Syllogism&quot;, but &quot;Thatcherite&quot; is a word with a lot more meaning here in the UK than elsewhere.</p>
<p>Also, if you capitalise &quot;something&quot; in point 2 it has a lot more rhetorical impact, in my experience.</p>

		<p>The second form of apology is a special case of a more general weaseling technique, sometimes known as the cowardly passive (for the use of the passive voice as a way of avoiding admitting responsibility), as in:</p>

<p>(Although I like the name &#8211; it&#8217;s a lot easier to pronounce, and the acronym of the name is a cunning clue as to the nature of the content. I don&#8217;t necessarily mind taking out swears in names if it makes room for a better name.)</p>

		<p>First of all, &quot;WTF&quot; is an abbreviation, not an acronym. TO be an acronym, it must be pronounced like a word, like &quot;RADAR&quot; or &quot;NATO&quot;.</p>
<p>And to bring this all back around, one frequently sees The Politician&#8217;s Fallacy in coding.</p>
<p>Often, you see things like this:</p>
<p>int GetAValue()</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;if (pGlobalStruct == NULL)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;{</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;LogError(&quot;pGlobalStruct == NULL&quot;)</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return 0;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;}</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;return pGlobalStruct-&gt;SomeValue;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Of course, pGlobalStruct has one correct value and 65000+ (or in this new-fangled 32-bit world, 4 billion) possible wrong values, and were only checking for one of them.</p>
<p>I worked on one system where every access to a particular pointer was preceeded by a check if if were NULL. &nbsp;I pointed out that the pointer was set to the correct value at startup, was never changed, and at no time set to NULL. A bad value would require a bad memory chip, and the chances that bad memory chip happening to leave the value set to null were remote.</p>
<p>}</p>

		<p>Off-topic, but an example of clouded thinking, which perhaps actually is on-topic&#8230; a friend of mine, who happens to be conservative, and is generally gung-ho Law and Order, Throw &#8217;em In Jail, had an interesting defense of Rush Limbaugh&#8217;s addiction to painkillers.</p>
<p>He said &quot;do you know how much chronic pain hurts, and how easy it must be to become addicted?&quot;. &nbsp;Now, I know for a fact that my friend has never been addicted to painkillers and has no personal experience. &nbsp;It was just his instinct to defend a fellow politically conservative person.</p>
<p>In similar situations, when celebrities on the liberal side have gotten into trouble (addictions, etc.) he wants to lock &#8217;em up, and mouths off about the Liberal Commie Pinkos who can&#8217;t control themselves&#8230;</p>

		<p>Ronald Reagan, January 27th, 1987: &nbsp;&quot;Mistakes Were Made&quot;. &nbsp;As someone else later pointed out, this linguistic formation takes the blame and essentially &quot;casts it into the wind&quot;.</p>
<p>Although, Reagan takes full responsibility in another sentence in the same speech. &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;&#8230;though we&#8217;ve made much progress, I have one major regret: I took a risk with regard to our action in Iran. It did not work, and for that I assume full responsibility. The goals were worthy. I do not believe it was wrong to try to establish contacts with a country of strategic importance or to try to save lives.</p>
<p>And certainly it was not wrong to try to secure freedom for our citizens held in barbaric captivity. But we did not achieve what we wished, and serious mistakes were made in trying to do so. We will get to the bottom of this, and I will take whatever action is called for&#8230;&quot;</p>

		<p>The Politicians&#8217; Fallacy causes the most harm when &quot;Something must be done&quot; isn&#8217;t correctly evaluated.</p>
<p>Too often it&#8217;s not true.</p>

		<p>Dan Rather pulled the old &quot;mistakes were made&quot; for the falsified national guard memos. &nbsp;(his producer also called them &quot;fake but accurate&quot;, which is an interesting perspective on the craft of journalism)</p>

		<p>Here is a quote that embodies the politician’s fallacy:</p>
<p>“In any moment of decision, the best thing you can do is the right thing, the next best thing is the wrong thing, and the worst thing you can do is nothing.” — Theodore Roosevelt</p>

		<p>Another grand example of this comes from the Tamil Tiger terrorists whom yesterday intentionally fired mortars at the US, Italian and German diplomats and appologised saying&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;I express our regret at this unfortunate incident,&quot; said Rasiah Ilanthirayan, the Tamil Tiger spokesman. &quot;Our people were not informed of the diplomatic movement. &#8230; This is a criminal negligence on the part of the Sri Lankan military.&quot;</p>

		<p>James, you don&#8217;t pronounce &quot;WTF?&quot;</p>
<p>It rhymes with &quot;hootf.&quot;</p>
<p>More seriously, when I was a trouble-making teenager in anger-management classes (read: I made people older than me angry), we were taught to use this type of apology, if you were really sorry that someone was offended.</p>
<p>The point was to *never* apologize for anything that you didn&#8217;t actually feel sorry for, because you&#8217;d feel cheated/abused. &nbsp;It&#8217;s about being assertive, but considerate. &nbsp;It can certainly be turned into a snub, but it doesn&#8217;t have to be every time it&#8217;s used.</p>
<p>Another variant of this is conditional: &quot;I&#8217;m sorry if you were offended by my post,&quot; for example.</p>

		<p>D:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &gt; [Dan Rather&#8217;s] producer also called them &quot;fake but accurate&quot; &lt;&lt;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Technically, he is correct. The documents presented on the show, while not the same phyisical documents written in the 60&#8217;s (which were probably destroyed by now), by all accounts, they do convey the same information. &nbsp;The documents shown were merely visual aides; None of the reporting was based on them.</p>
