		<p>&quot;Recall the rectangles are exclusive of the endpoint, so rcPaint.bottom is actually the first row outside the rectangle.&quot;</p>
<p>MSDN Libraries for both October 2001 and October 2003 have the following characteristics.</p>
<p>For GetClientRect(), the description contradicts itself.  The first paragraph falsely says that the lower-right corner is involved.  A later paragraph correctly says that the width and height are involved.</p>
<p>For GetWindowRect(), the description is false only.  The first paragraph doesn&#8217;t say, but a later paragraph says that the lower-right corner is involved.</p>
<p>The fact is exactly as you say, a point which is adjacent but outside of the lower-right corner is involved.</p>
<p>For one customer, I had to position a bunch of scrollbars and their related frames.  Every time I resized the main window, every scroll bar grew in width.  I fixed it by deliberately coding some off-by-one errors.  Then I remembered your series on scrollbars, and here is your information, you got it right and the MSDN library got it wrong.</p>
<p>Sometimes you hinted that you have contacts at MSDN.  Please see if you can persuade them to fix the descriptions of GetClientRect() and GetWindowRect().</p>

		<p>Done. I also asked for a special remark in the documentation for RECT to indicate that &quot;By convention, the bottom right coordinates of rectangles are normally exclusive. In other words, the pixel whose coordinates are (right, bottom) lies immediately outside the rectangle.&quot;  Hopefully this blanket statement will cover all the other functions that operate on rectangles.</p>

		<p>Thank you for making that request, but may I also ask you to make the English a bit clearer?  Even though I handle English much better than I handle Japanese, I would still get tripped up on &quot;normally exclusive&quot;.  Backing up and reparsing the sentence yields a more meaningful result, &quot;are normally&quot;, but the word &quot;exclusive&quot; isn&#8217;t quite clear.  The second sentence does clear up the confusion, but still there&#8217;s no need for the first sentence to create confusion.</p>
<p>Maybe &quot;By convention, the bottom right coordinates of rectangles are usually the height and width instead of the actual bottom and right.&quot;  The second sentence still helps explain it fully.</p>

		<p>Except that&#8217;s still not correct. If top/left is not (0,0) then bottom and right are not the height and width. I have a blog entry scheduled for February 17th to explain rectangles better &#8211; I hope you can hold out until then.</p>

		<p>You&#8217;re right, my wording isn&#8217;t correct for GetWindowRect().</p>
<p>For GetClientRect() I think my wording is correct and understandable.  If you agree with that, then we can fix the wording for GetWindowRect() next.  Anyway, I think it is possible to be both correct and non-obfuscatory.</p>
<p>Yes I&#8217;ll wait until February 17th.</p>
