		<p>The original Macintosh System (ten years before it was called Mac OS) also did all memory management in software without an MMU (but IIRC, it got a little help from the 68000, which was more advanced than the 8086). Anyway, I agree it&#39;s awesome what the OSes of that time got to do with so little memory (384 Kb of for Windows 1.0, 128 Kb of RAM and 64 Kb of ROM for Macintosh System 1.0). Keep that in mind the next time a moron tells you need 8 GB of RAM to write a letter in Word! :-)</p>

		<p>When you said &quot;initialized to 1&#39;s&quot;, I assumed you meant that each entry was all 1&#39;s (0xFF), for which a SAR is a no-op. &nbsp;Took me a bit to figure out you really meant each byte is initialized to the number 1. &nbsp;Neat trick, though.</p>

		<p>@Adam Rosenfeld: &nbsp;I had the same confusion. &nbsp;Bytes that are &quot;initialized to 1&#39;s&quot; sound like they are full of FFs, especially when you are talking about bit manipulation in the code. &nbsp;But I get it now.</p>

		<p>@ Adam, David, Martin: Not to be irritating to Raymond, but I&#39;ll be the first to point out that &quot;apostrophe s&quot; does not make the 1 plural. A better wording would have been &quot;&#8230; each initialized to the value one.&quot;</p>

		<p>It also means you could do something more sophisticated by initialising to a larger number, or by playing with the high bit to mean &quot;always resident&quot; or track different history. &nbsp;Sure, an accessed bit is all you need, but would be interesting to know if anyone did more than that.</p>

		<p>@Brian: I&#39;m not sure how that&#39;s relevant here. &nbsp;If &quot;1&#39;s&quot; here were possessive instead of plural, it wouldn&#39;t make any sense (initialized to the <em>what</em> belonging to 1?).</p>

		<p>[I thought I answered this in the linked article. -Raymond]</p>
<p>Afraid I&#39;m not seeing it. I see INT 3F is in the file so it can be copied into memory and used directly. I see a statement that says the details are different in unimportant ways (which I can see SAR being one). I don&#39;t see anything addressing why INT 3F is the file but SAR (with appropriate padding) is not. If you know you will need both, it doesn&#39;t make sense to me to put in one and not the other.</p>
<p>I&#39;m speculating that INT 3F was added to the file format for the stated reason and then tools and executables were built. Later, it was decided to do LRU and a SAR instruction was required. Rather than change the format and cause a ripple effect on tools and existing executables, it was decided to just rewrite the entry as it was loaded.</p>

		<p>To those who are worried about the apostrophes, here&#39;s what the Chicago Manual of Style FAQ has to say about it (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/CMS_FAQ/Plurals/Plurals20.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/&#8230;/Plurals20.html</a>):</p>
<hr />
<p>Chicago style omits the apostrophe, but the thing about style is, there is no single great arbiter who makes rules that everyone follows. Different houses use different styles. Following a particular style allows a person to be consistent within a given document, but it really doesn’t matter which style you choose.</p>
<hr />
<p>So everyone&#39;s right! Participation medals all around!</p>

		<p>FWIW, my first parse was also &quot;&#8230; a table of bytes [each] initialized to 1s&quot; but the subsequent paragraphs cleared the confusion. &nbsp;sar on a value of FF is a NOP, so each byte must be initialized to a value of 1.</p>
<p>Considering the scope of Windows 1.0, any benefit from using a value other than 1 would probably not be worth the time and OS code to do it.</p>

		<p>@Mark:</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure that the goal is to remove as much timed polling as possible so that the CPU can remain in a lower power state. &nbsp;But if you do need to use a timer to poll something, I think the newer coalescing timers are the preferred method (SetWaitableTimer(Ex)).</p>

		<p>@Mark</p>
<p>The only way to make a battery last a long time is to turn off as many chips as possible. The OS tries very hard to keep all components in the system off as often as possible. Waking up a sleeping CPU isn&#39;t too bad &#8212; just a few microseconds. But waking up a stopped clock takes a few hundred microseconds, and waking up a sleeping motherboard takes a few milliseconds. So each time the system has to transition from sleeping to waking takes several milliseconds, during which time all of the chips on the motherboard are using the battery. If you take several milliseconds to wake up, execute 10 instructions, and then go back to sleep, you used 20 milliseconds of power to do 10 nanoseconds of work. In addition, certain deeper sleep states take even longer to wake up, so the OS won&#39;t go into those sleep states unless the system has been completely idle for say 300 milliseconds.</p>
<p>Bottom line is that something that wakes up 4 times a second makes the motherboard use 80 milliseconds of full power per second, and also completely prevents it from going into the deepest sleep, so it continually uses say 10% of full power always, for a total of 18% power usage when it should have been something like 1% power usage.</p>

		<p>@Adam, David, Brian and Martin et al &#8230;. &quot;bytes initialized to 1s (or 1&#39;s)&quot; is quite clear to me. &nbsp;It comes down to whether the reader (incorrectly) injects some words into the sentence that aren&#39;t actually there, namely &quot;&#8230; [all the bits of] the bytes&quot;, or replaced the word &quot;initiatialized to&quot; with &quot;with all bits set to&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Doug: Thanks, that was rather enlightening! &nbsp;Although, come to think of it, your explanation implies that in this case there seems to be a loophole. &nbsp;If the computer is in sleep mode, we can turn off fancy memory management routines, since no one is using memory. &nbsp;If it&#39;s not in sleep mode, we can afford to run 4 times a second, since we&#39;re awake anyway.</p>

I figured out how to rewire the display so it read 33 normally and 99 with the turbo switch pressed. All my buddies kept asking me how I got the CPU to run at 100 MHz and were jealous of me. Little did they know&#8230;</p>
