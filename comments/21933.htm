		<p>The implication is that he was going to rob the place, but other than his &quot;odd&quot; wardrobe there was nothing to suggest this was the case. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s an idea &#8211; maybe he was a freaking gardener!</p>

		<p>John: So he&#8217;s a gardener. The only difference is that he gets better-than-average service. It&#8217;s a win-win situation. :)</p>

		<p>Some years ago, the then mayor of Alexandria, Virginia, saw a fellow walk into his bank with a handgun. He sat the man down and started selling him a loan, explaining terms, etc., and carried it on till the police arrived. As I recall, there was no question that the man had the handgun to rob the bank.</p>

		<p>Years ago I was a floor manager for Toys R Us and basically our rules for dealing with shoplifters was basically the same.</p>
<p>An increased attention on the customer, especially suspicious ones, sets up the expectations that customers are being watched (in a good way), and that shoplifting is unlikely to succeed.</p>
<p>As James says, &nbsp;the &#8216;suspicious&#8217; types that are really customers get better service and the thieves are rattled and bug off.</p>

		<p>So the best way to get good customer service is to act suspicious. Of course, it could also get you a visit from the police instead of good service.</p>

		<p>@john</p>
<p>Who needed a roll of quarters?</p>
<p>Here in Costa Rica you can&#8217;t even enter a bank wearing anything that obscures your face, and cell phone use is not permitted.</p>

		<p>@Jim:</p>
<p>Maybe he had parked his lawnmower somewhere where you need to put small change into the parking machine, and needed quarters to pay for his space :)</p>

<p>The problem is to figure out where you&#8217;ll get better service and where you&#8217;ll just get a squirt of mace and a set of new bracelets. :-(</p>

		<p>In the evening after a meal, some people like walking in parks. Me, I like to troll around in the local home improvement stores looking at cool cordless drills, nail guns etc&#8230;</p>
<p>NOW I understand why I get better service in the evening.</p>
