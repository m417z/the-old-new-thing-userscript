		<p>There is one very annoying problem with the automatic touch keyboard, it seems to have some sort of connection to the old on screen keyboard.</p>
<p>Start osk.exe and minimize it, now try using the touch keyboard in a metro app!</p>
<p>Is there any way to disconnect the OSK from the touch keyboard?</p>

		<p>&gt; This is a per-process setting, and once set, it cannot be unset.</p>
<p>I can already see it. A third-party dynamically loaded DLL (shell extension, printer driver) enables that setting in its own dialog boxes, and doesn&#39;t turn it off. The host program cannot defend itself against it.</p>

		<p>&quot;By default, the Windows 8 touch keyboard does not appear automatically when focus is placed on an edit control in a desktop program. To change the behavior for your program, just use this one weird trick.&quot;</p>

		<p>Looking forward to next week&#39;s solutions then. I know you can &quot;anchor&quot; the touch keyboard, but that seems to work by reducing the desktop space to work with, squishing the app, and some apps don&#39;t take well to that.</p>

		<p>The touch keyboard does indeed appear when you focus edit controls in SOME desktop applications if it happens as the result of a touch action. Even if a hardware keyboard is connected.</p>
<p>I think this is only happening for Office applications (Lync/Outlook I tested quickly just now). I am not sure if it is the result of your code (you mention it should happen as a result of a focus, so even the mouse or hardware keyboard focusing does it I assume&#8230; which is not the case in Office).</p>
<p>Anyway the OS likes to move the window out of the way of the keyboard when it appears. In addition you can set the keyboard to dock to the bottom of the screen so windows CAN&#39;T go under it (which means all your windows are now resized and squished). I imagine your fix is going to invoke one of these if only because it&#39;s standard (and there&#39;s no better way to go about it, really).</p>

		<p>Typically settings that can be set but not unset are security features, like memory protection mechanisms. That way you can set them at program startup and malicious code cannot remove them.</p>
<p>In this case, though, I suspect that nobody thought that DisableFocusTracking() would be needed and thus there is no way to unset EnableFocusTracking().</p>

		<p>If you are implementing this in your app, please keep in mind&#8230;</p>
<p>It is often the single most annoying thing you can do to a user of a touch device.</p>
<p>When I am filling out a web form, and I touch a field to set focus &#8212; it does not follow that I&#39;m intending to use the touch keyboard to type. &nbsp;When you reflow the document twice every time I touch an input field, that gets real annoying, real fast. &nbsp;Unfortunately, Microsoft does not yet capture swear words spoken near the computer as part of the customer improvement program.</p>

		<p>@Dave Bacher, yeah, I&#39;m usually found poking the touch screen in front of me, brutally stretching one of my arms from the keyboard and back, too! &nbsp;I guess that makes two of us! &nbsp;Wow, why didn&#39;t Microsoft thought of us all?</p>

		<p>I have a Windows 8 tablet (a real tablet form factor, with no built-in or detachable keyboard), and without the touch keyboard automatically appearing when I set focus, the tablet would be unusable. I&#39;m hoping that more applications implement this behavior.</p>

		<p>I suppose the &quot;right thing to do&quot; depends on a combination of whether your device HAS a keyboard, and what you are thinking when you touch the screen. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>I think in this case the &quot;right thing to do&quot; is probably &quot;whatever the user has indicated their preferred operation is via a setting&quot;.</p>
<p>And people who tap the screen while reading are probably a sub-set of text selection readers. &nbsp;Come to think of it I do both as well.</p>
