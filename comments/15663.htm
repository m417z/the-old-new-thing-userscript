		<p>Ah yes, back in the days of unmanaged switches.</p>
<p>They had no way of identifiying the switchport where the source-MAC originated from.</p>

<p>My bad. Not having started my venture into computers until the mid-1990&#8217;s, I was raised with TCP/IP for networking (on the Internet, of course). I didn&#8217;t know it wasn&#8217;t commonplace in the 80&#8217;s.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m having some difficulty with the concept of a network stack that doesn&#8217;t allow for incoming connections (this is actually the most interesting part of the story to me). Does anyone have pointer to a relatively brief reference that might enable me to understand Raymond&#8217;s response to the first comment, or is such a thing a contradiction?</p>

		<p>Raymond, I thought the original title (&quot;You are listen to&quot;) was a subtle play on words, akin to to old &quot;All your bases are belong to us.&quot;</p>

<p>Ohhhh, so you just mean that nobody had written any filesharing software, but doing the broadcast was not much work. Thanks for clarifying &#8211; I interpreted that comment as saying that it would be infeasible to do it on a NetBIOS network (and I was thinking through things like &#8216;well, you could listen by polling for a broadcast telling you where to send the stream&#8217; and so on :-))</p>

		<p>I had something similar happen to me at community college. &nbsp;I had dial-up at home, and was using Debian Linux at the time; Getting more software meant sitting somewhere with decent bandwidth and downloading the packages.</p>
<p>I worked in a computer lab on campus, and it happened that the only computers in the lab that could burn disc images were some Macs running OS X. It also happened that those weren&#8217;t closely tied into any of the college&#8217;s authentication or security systems. &nbsp;And while the campus had decent connectivity throughput, they had a budgeted usage limit that may not have been updated since the days the whole campus was on a T1.</p>
<p>I was in the middle of disc image 12 out of 13 before the infrastructure folks burst into the lab and were checking every port number against their notes. Because of the layout of the lab, my station was among the last four that was checked.</p>
<p>They let me finish downloading that disc image. I still have the disc I burned, somewhere.</p>

		<p>I once worked in a company where we all shared our mp3s as music$. That way, given a list of machines anyone in the know could find them, but $ shares don&#8217;t show up to a casual observer. The end result was a batch file that generated a m3u playlist which you could play in WinAmp.</p>

<p>It is possible Bob was physically &#8216;erased&#8217;, Tron-style, having his consciousness converted to a Microsoft simplified-UI product of the same name several years later that, like his radio service, was tragically short-lived.</p>

		<p>I had the happy opposite experience. Mid-90s I was working a contract at a company which was trying to be first-to-market with a gig-ethernet switch. We were encouraged to play Doom to stress the prototype.</p>
<p>Saddly, the company missed the window and collapsed along with so many others during the telecom bust. I was long gone by then (had just been engaged on a short contract to build remote panel displays for their network management software).</p>
<p>But it was a fun and lively summer that I spent there, and it was the only time I ever got an email from my boss telling me to drop my work and get on with the serious business of playing!</p>

		<p>NetBEUI is a non-routable protocol. &nbsp;Back then, Microsoft used NetBEUI (NetBIOS-based protocol) and not TCP/IP. &nbsp;If it was the late-80&#8217;s, then likely LanMan was the server software. &nbsp;Windows 3.0 or 3.1 with some sort of real-mode redirector. &nbsp;Maybe Xenix was involved. &nbsp;Microsoft ITG would have had to narrow it down the way Raymond says for sure.</p>

		<p>You could convert it to 8-bit 11khz mono wav and get bitrate that&#8217;s even lower than most mp3s you&#8217;ll find today (something like 40kbps, I think). Sure, it sounds way worse, but at least you&#8217;ve got music!</p>

		<p>&lt;blockquote&gt;What makes this story seem apocryphal is that in the 1980s it was unlikely that any random machine Bob went to would actually have a sound card with correct drivers and speakers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;</p>
<p>You could fake it by doing pulse width modulation on the PC speaker. &nbsp;To do this, you&#8217;d program the 8253 timer so that the timer channel that was attached to the timer interrupt ran at (say) 11025 interrupts per second, and every interrupt you&#8217;d retrieve the next sample, program the 8253 channel attached to the speaker in one-shot mode for a duration proportional to the sample value &#8230; and Bob&#8217;s your network-flooding uncle!</p>
<p>As for flooding the network: just sending a lot of broadcast packets with WAV data in them would be easy to code on a modern UNIX (in fact you can do it in shell with the appropriate tools). &nbsp;Thankfully I&#8217;ve never had to write DOS NetBIOS code, but I imagine it&#8217;s much simpler to blast out broadcast packets then initiate sessions, etc.</p>

		<p>Back then it&#8217;s unlikely that he even had a way to extract WAV files from any CDs he may have had, let alone a 16-bit stereo sound card to play them on. It&#8217;s likely he would have recorded 8-bit mono mu-law or ADPCM from the line-in on his sound card. Bob could have likely fit 3 hours of music on his gigantic-for-the-time 80 MB hard drive.</p>

		<p>My version of this is when I was moving some large databases from one part of the corporate network down to my local machine.</p>
<p>The problem was, I was in a &#8216;regional&#8217; building that had only 2x 2Mbit links, and ~800 other people trying to use the network for more time critical things (like answering customer questions).</p>
<p>I was quite shocked to get a call from someone in IT telling me to stop doing whatever it was that I was doing.</p>

		<p>Huh. I would&#8217;ve thought Bob would make his &quot;music server&quot; watch for a specific broadcast packet, the send data to that particular host, listening for broadcasts. As Bob moved, he would re-run his program, and the music would follow as the server swapped addresses. That&#8217;s how you &quot;connect&quot; &#8211; the client broadcasts, the server observes and strams data.</p>
<p>Assuming of course, that netbeui supported direct transfers and control signalling&#8230;</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  You could fake it by doing pulse width modulation on the PC speaker.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I seem to recall a game doing just that, &quot;TRACON&quot; or &quot;Terminal Radar Approach Control&quot;. Great game. &nbsp;The speech coming from the PC speaker was good enough, with just enough distortion to make it sound like radio transmissions.</p>

		<p>It never ceases to amaze me the distance some people will go regarding music- Broadcasting it over a corporate network, downloading it from shady sources, buying expensive portable players&#8230;</p>
<p>I generally use a small, cheap, FM receiver.</p>

		<p>Many years ago, I worked for a contractor contracted to do document management software for an industrial company. We had a T1 line to one of their plants for support purposes. (It was in another state, so it was fairly expensive.) At one point they, replaced the T1 with ISDN, believing that it would be less expensive. (It could connect on demand, and we wouldn&#8217;t pay for idle time.)</p>
<p>One of the things that we did was index CAD files. The process would grab the files from their server, read the attributes off the drawing, associate them with the appropriate real life hardware, categorize the drawing, and write all that back to the document server. One of my coworkers started off a set, and an hour later we got a call because we were running up ISDN charges at a ridiculous rate. We ended up disconnecting the modem, and going back to the T1. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>My recollection is that the Microsoft corporate network was using XNS with Ungerman Bass NICs and monolithic driver stacks in era that sound cards first started appearing in PCs. &nbsp;(And that that wasn&#8217;t till 91-92, with the first &#8216;MPCs&#8217;.)</p>

		<p>@Morten: Heck, you could find a Win3.1 driver that did that &#8211; it implemented a sound driver, and modulated the PC speaker. So any PC that could run Win 3.1 could experience the dings and tadas, though it was quite tinny.</p>
<p>Heck, you probably could play MP3s on that for amusement. I think I did Mod4Win.</p>
<p>Too bad it was never ported to Win95.</p>

		<p>I had that Win3.1 PC speaker audio driver. It sounded horrible and used all the CPU on my 486 when it was playing. Bob would not have used that technique to listen to music while he worked.</p>

		<p>As I recall, in 1989 the Creative Labs Sound Blaster was the first PC sound card that could play PCM music (the kind needed to play back recorded audio). Prior to that, sound cards were just synthesizers (think MIDI vs. WAV). Since CD-ROM drives didn&#8217;t become generally available until 1990, it&#8217;s unlikely that MS actually had anything you could consider to be a &nbsp;multimedia division in the 1980&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Bob most likely misremembered the timeframe, as this couldn&#8217;t have happened until the early 1990&#8217;s.</p>

		<p>That recalled me when i was in Redmond the first time back in may~oct 2006. 2006 FIFA World Cup was in Germany. My coworkers would go to the office and watch the games via an internal TV channel(some kind of testing project). I hope that channel is still alive.</p>
