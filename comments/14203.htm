		<p>&quot;If you are an executable, then the process heap was created on your behalf.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;If you use the C runtime library default heap, then that heap is under the control of the C runtime library,&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Remember that a DLL is a guest in the host process.&quot;</p>
<p>So, the C runtime library, which is a DLL, and therefore a guest in any process which dynamically links with it, creates its own default heap, which is different from the processes default heap?</p>
<p>Actually, that does make kind of sense. Which is why malloc()/free() (which presumably works with the C runtime library heap) is separate from CoTaskMemAlloc()/CoTaskMemFree() (which I imagine works with the process heap)</p>
<p>Yes? No? Seems weird though&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Karellen,</p>
<p>C runtime library DLL is not a guest, it&#8217;s a mother-in-law&#8230; Other guests even may bring their own MIL&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Karellen, I see this a lot. &nbsp;In language it&#8217;s called overregularization. &nbsp;In this case it&#8217;s an over-application of the principle that DLLs are guests in the process&#8217; house to the C runtime library DLL.</p>
<p>The special-ness of the C runtime library in this context seems obvious but some people need it spelled out. &nbsp;I suspect the AppCompat team owes the bulk of its reason for existence to these kinds of people. #rant off</p>

		<p>@Karellen, A DLL (or whatever) is allowed to create its own heap and then give it (or APIs which call it) to other people to use. That&#8217;s all the CRT is doing (unless it is using the process heap, which it is allowed but not guaranteed to do as well).</p>
<p>The important things are that you don&#8217;t mess with someone else&#8217;s heap&#8217;s settings without knowing you are allowed to, and that you don&#8217;t allocate memory from one heap and try to free it from another.</p>

		<p>@arnshea: So&#8230; the C runtime is different from other DLLs, but it&#8217;s still creating its own heap separate from the process heap (that is what Raymond said, right?) which it owns instead of you, but you can get permission to mess with if you want, which you could do for any heap created by any other DLL if it provided an API for that purpose?</p>
<div class=post>[<i>There&#8217;s nothing special about the C runtime. It is a guest in the host process. It creates a heap, which under the general rules of polite society therefore belongs to the C runtime. The C runtime _get_heap_handle function is explicitly documented as granting the caller permission to use the handle to change the heap to a low fragmentation heap. Thus, the convention in the subject line is adhered to: &#8220;Don&#8217;t mess with it without permission from the owner.&#8221; I can&#8217;t believe I had to write that. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Hey Raymond,</p>
<p>thanks for keeping your articles going, even through regular doubts of the &#8216;is this still worth doing&#8217; kind.</p>
<p>I love seeing these low level things I never knew about. A low fragmentation heap, I&#8217;ve been developing software for a long time and never heard of it&#8230; And all the discussion here gets me thinking, why do dll&#8217;s not just always create their own heap, what is the advantage of having the same/a different heap, &#8230;</p>
<p>Good stuff, thank you!</p>

		<p>Arnt, &quot;why do dll&#8217;s not just always create their own heap, what is the advantage of having the same/a different heap, &#8230;&quot;</p>

<p>I thought that locking of memory was still a requirement in win32 because when I tried to remove it in user space software i wrote, some API (drivers?) stopped working because they assumed that you locked the memory.</p>
<p>Btw, descriptor tables + selectors which translates all addresses several times could probably be used to move/defrag memory without the need for locking memory.</p>

		<p>@640k, Having to lock memory in Win32 is vanishingly rare.</p>
<p>Memory allocated using GMEM_MOVEABLE or LMEM_MOVEABLE still need to be locked/unlocked but getting/setting data on the clipboard is about the only place you&#8217;d typically run into that.</p>
<p>And memory fragmentation is a far, far, faaaar lesser issue than the complexity of having to use descriptors/selectors and locking/unlocking for everything. I think there are better ways to reduce (if not solve) fragmentation with better trade-offs which don&#8217;t involve making every memory access ridiculously complex and error prone.</p>

		<p>@640k: I think you are trying to reinvent managed memory (possibly without the automatic garbage collection). Virtually all GC systems compact the heap automatically, so you don&#8217;t need to worry about heap fragmentation in a managed memory environment.</p>
<p>If you choose to use manual memory management, you must be willing to handle all the complexities that come with that. You can&#8217;t just blame the OS because it doesn&#8217;t do your job for you.</p>
