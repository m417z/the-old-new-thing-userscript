		<p>&quot;these devices, by virtue of being prototypes, had a high infant morality rate.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s good, wouldn&#39;t want them stealing the baby milk&#8230; (Not nitpicking, I just found the typo amusing.)</p>
<p>I&#39;m reminded of doing something similar &#8211; much cheaper, of course &#8211; for academic conferences. For the first one I was involved with, we just loaded the files onto CD: a trivial process, load up a duplicator with a 100 disk spindle of blanks, a master CD-R to copy and an image to print as the label, out come 100 labelled, burned and tested disks. Second time around, technology had moved on: memory sticks, pre-printed with our logo but with no data on. Two powered USB hubs on my laptop, a script to copy the files, flush buffers then re-read for testing, and I was loading batches of 8. (Third time round, I&#39;d automated it so the insertion event ran the format/load/verify script, so I could fill up all the hub ports and wait for the corresponding number of &quot;OK&quot; messages on the console.)</p>

		<p>@jas88 Maybe I&#39;m missing something, but I believe he intended to say &quot;infant mortality rate.&quot; Meaning, they died young.</p>

		<p>@JackBNimble &#8211; jas88 knows that, he was making a pun on the typo (&quot;infant morality&quot; ~ &quot;stealing milk&quot;).</p>

		<p>So the answer was yes, I was missing something.</p>

		<p>Great stories! &nbsp;Thank you for sharing. &nbsp;I work at a small company that puts on our own yearly user conference. &nbsp;It&#39;s nice to hear how the big boys do things. &nbsp;Mad props to Jensen.</p>

		<p>One of the devices blew up on stage? Which keynote was this in? Is it available on Channel 9?</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  I didn&#39;t write the scripts, so I don&#39;t know what they did exactly.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I wrote the scripts &#8211; your assumptions are dead-on.</p>
<ul>
<li>We did the firmware after copying network bits locally so that devices failing on those steps would do it sooner rather than later.</li>
<li>
<p>Visual Studio was preinstalled in the image to avoid per-device install time.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Since you mentioned the colors, there was one other: we matched the script phases to the table skirts so you could tell at a glance where the machine was supposed to be. &nbsp;Green phase ran on green tables, blue script on the blue tables. :)</p>

		<p>If we&#39;re going to nitpick Raymond&#39;s spelling, I&#39;m going to wonder whether there were 16 or 256 tablets on each palette. (Or maybe they set biClrUsed?)</p>

		<p>Cool story. :)</p>
<p>Now that I have my surface, I don&#39;t need my &quot;prototype&quot; anymore. &nbsp;It was a great device and served me well.</p>

		<p>Very cool story. So any chance we&#39;ll ever get a firmware update for the motion sensor, so it becomes usable? I know it exists, because it was used during build for a motion sensor demo, and the person demoing it told me you had a different firmware for the demos.</p>

		<p>I hope you give a talk at this year&#39;s event.</p>

		<p>The year is 2005 and I just started working for Siemens Automotive VDO (defunct now, Siemens sold it&#39;s automotive division meanwhile) and I got &quot;shipped&quot; directly to work for the immobilizer for Mazda RX8, 2nd edition (goal year to be on the market was set at 2007). Now, while on hardware test room, the room where you would get your code, burn it on a flash simulator that would be the final BCM (Body Control Module) board unit and start testing, I had also to connect to all the sensors (internal lights, screen wipers, tire-guard, etc) via CAN (Controlled Area Network). These CAN&#39;s were simple chips that you simply plug into a socket, pretty much the way you plug your CPU on motherboard in a PC. And you would handle them with your hands, right? Well, at least that I saw everybody doing it. So I did it also. And none of them worked. Dead. In the water. NULL. After trying a dozen, asked one of the adjacent guys, that was working on another feature for the same BCM &#8211; &quot;wtf is going on? why none is working?&quot;. So he came to my test table, put his hand on the heater pipe from the wall, grabbed one from the box of &quot;virgin&#39; ones, teared the plastic bag, fished out, place it on the socket and magic happened. It worked. I asked, why did he put his hand on the heater pipe? He said to get rid of electrostatic charge in order not to damage the CAN chip. And looking at the dozen that I already damaged, smiled and said: &quot;did you know that each is costing 5000 (yes thousands) EURO?&quot;</p>
<p>Told him that of course I knew about electrostatic charge, but that was a problem with &#39;80 / early &#39;90 CMOS / NMOS, later all had buffers to prevent this from happening. He&#39;s reply was: &quot;You&#39;re absolutely correct 100%, and this CAN is the actual prototype design from 1992 when Siemens invented the immobilizer feature and they continued to manufacture it internally using the same CMOS / NMOS from 1992. Hence the electrostatic charge killing them. In the final shipping of the BCM module we have another one which is costing us only 150 EURO to produce and has all those buffers included&quot;. And he shrugged his shoulders when I asked why those were not shipped to us.</p>
<p>Corporations work in mysterious ways, that was my conclusion.</p>
