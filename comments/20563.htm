		<p>Sounds very vague. Perhaps you could get your source to elaborate?</p>
<p>My VPN software (OpenVPN) doesn&#8217;t touch any wifi hardware when connecting, other than actually using the card to connect.</p>
<p>A disconnected wifi card surely has no greater attack surface than a disconnected wired NIC?</p>

		<p>Indeed, it sounds strange to me too. The VPN software might indeed have to jump through a dozen hoops to secure the wireless connection. But I really doubt it is continuously spending CPU time to ignore the wireless connection.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d love to know what it&#8217;s &quot;securing&quot; too. Perhaps run procmon while connecting, and post a little comment here?</p>

		<p>What if I access the VPN with my wireless connection?</p>

		<p>Tom: don&#8217;t trust OpenVPN over wireless connections, a thousand times so if you are using redirect-gateway. If the wireless connection goes down and then back up, its &quot;real&quot; routes pushed by the DHCP server will override the OpenVPN routes. I discovered this the hard way</p>

		<p>Hyperion: You can try the OpenVPN option that uses route.exe to set routes instead of using the normal API calls. &nbsp;I think those are persistent&#8230;</p>

		<p>Yes, but OpenVPN is no &quot;solution&quot;, it&#8217;s just an excellent excellent tool/product.</p>
<p>Microsoft definitively uses such bogus software that checks whether your handbrake is on &#228;h I mean, whether your virus scammer &#228;h scanner is running and whether windows update is on, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>From a security perpective this is *always* rubbish because you easily can and should fool that software and waive it with an &quot;all is okay&quot; packet.</p>
<p>Sadly there is MUCH too less informationen about sending fake status reports to such &quot;solutions&quot;.</p>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s also a matter of policy or termination</p>
<p>(unless you don&#8217;t disassemble your laptop or have the admin passwort and there is no virtualization or trusted computing involved)</p>

		<p>Christian: I think I agree.</p>
<p>Yesterday I struggled with Vista&#8217;s built in zip-support. It refused to unzip .js files, so I removed the script host association for those files. Then it refused to unzip files that had no extension&#8230; I was lost for words. I usually unzip using the command line, but this time I needed to avoid one directory in particular and the visual approach seemed easier.</p>
<p>Then I needed to send a .js file to a MSN contact and was told I had no virus scanner installed. WTF? I told it to use C:nonsense.exe as its scanner, and the upload went well. However, that screwed up my downloads of course, since c:nonsense.exe does not actually exist.</p>
<p>Pre-emptive Raymond snarky comment: Yes, I realise you are not to blame, wrong team and all&#8230; I still would like to point out that most security software is overkill and just an annoyance to advanced users.</p>
