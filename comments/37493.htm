		<p>Didn&#8217;t know that Americans are interested in football (I mean &quot;soccer&quot;), too.</p>

		<p>Isn&#8217;t this a little bit outdated topic? ;-)</p>
<p>Mat Hall: And what game can you stand? Or is chasing a piece of hard rubber better? :-)</p>
<p>On a related theme: during the Ice Hockey World Cup, there were commercials for EA Sports NHL 2005. If the only thing they add each year in these series is the up-to-date realism, shouldn&#8217;t this version contain only a big &quot;strike&quot; message? :-)</p>

		<p>I prefer something like cricket &#8212; the game itself is long enough that you&#8217;re unlikely to miss a crucial play if you get up to go to the toilet, and it means instead of telling the wife I&#8217;m off to drink beer and lounge about in the sun for three days I can use the excuse I&#8217;m off to watch a major sporting event.</p>
<p>On the whole, though, I think sport has become too much of a commercial enterprise, and everyone&#8217;s in it for the money rather than the love of the game.  Call me old fashioned (or just plain stupid) but the good ol&#8217; days when &quot;professional&quot; sportsmen tended to have a day job and got paid a nugatory sum for playing the sport made the whole thing more appealing.</p>
<p>We now return you to your regularly scheduled prgramming&#8230;</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t stand the game*, but that&#8217;s pretty cool none the less.  If they could do it in real time then it&#8217;d be even better.</p>
<p>On a vaguely related note, many years ago I started (but never finished) a real time snooker (like pool, only better) version of this; it would take an image of the table from an overhead camera and recreate it in a virtual environment allowing you to view the table from any angle, make &quot;what if&quot; predictions, etc.  At least that was the theory, but I never quite got it to work before I got bored and moved on to my next brainwave.  Having seen this, I may now revisit it&#8230;</p>
<p>* It&#8217;s not so much the game itself, it&#8217;s more that some players earn the GDP of a small nation in a single week just for running up and down chasing an inflated pig&#8230;</p>

		<p>Mat, I like cricket too, but I must counter your argument about not missing too much if you get up to go to the toilet. I was at Old Trafford several years ago watching England play Australia and twice I went to the toilet and missed Ian Botham taking a wicket. Bah!!</p>
