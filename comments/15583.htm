		<p>Years ago, the company I worked for wanted to do this on &lt;cough&gt; Windows 4.51.</p>
<p>Basically, a &quot;Start Here&quot; icon to explain what the heck this new NT thing was&#8230;</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t want to lock it, per se, but wanted to put it there every time the user logged in.</p>
<p>We gave up trying to lock it and were happy we could even just get it to show up regularly.</p>

		<p>As a software publisher, I would have no excuse for attempting to lock my icon to any place on the user&#8217;s desktop.</p>
<p>As a user, however, I have every right to try to keep my icons in known physical locations despite where other software thinks my icons belong. For example a corporation might want the icon for their corporate portal to always be in the upper-left corner of the desktop so that training documents are accurate. Or I as a user might want to be able to find icons by position even after my screen resolution has changed and Explorer has decided that my icons need to be rearranged.</p>

		<p>Just curious if there exists an unsupported way of doing it. &nbsp;I remember the story a while ago about installers that wanted to pin shortcuts to the Start menu; you said there is no supported way of doing this, but it is possible none-the-less (even documented on various Microsoft blogs, etc).</p>

		<p>@Gabe: See Stardock&#8217;s &quot;Fences&quot; for desktop icon arrangement. It&#8217;s a &quot;why would need this?&quot; program. Until you use it, then it&#8217;s a &quot;why wasn&#8217;t I using this before?&quot; app.</p>

		<p>Heh. &nbsp;I also thought of &quot;TheWebsiteIsDown&quot;. &nbsp;I came here to recommend setting the desktop background to a picture of the icon. &nbsp;That would certainly &quot;lock a specific icon to the upper left hand corner of the desktop&quot;.</p>

		<p>The request could have meant a lot of things, but since it&#8217;s out of context I&#8217;ll have to assume it was related to an installer. </p>
<p>The first scenario that came to mind however, was that the customer didn&#8217;t want people removing icons from a shared workstation of some sort so other people using the workstation could always launch an application. You could probably do this via a group policy or the likes.</p>

		<p>For the kinda legitimate purposes of training or controlling a shared workstation, using an imaged or thin-client type solution is probably better. Just re-image the workstation every night, and have the icon be in the same spot on a freshly imaged workstation.</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8230;a program so amazingly awesome that it should appear as the very first thing on the desktop so you won&#8217;t forget how awesome it is.&quot;</p>
<p>Alternatively, the app must be so appalingly awful that the only way it will ever be used if it is rammed hard down the customer&#8217;s throat.</p>
<p>Actually, they could probably add an image of their icon to the poor user&#8217;s wallpaper, and then subclass the desktop window to respond to mouse clicks in the appropriate area, and intermittently enumerate the icons sitting on top and move them if a naughty end-user put one over *their* space.</p>
<p>And then complain about &quot;incompatibility&quot; and &quot;Windows bugs&quot; if Microsoft chose to do anything about it in a future version of Explorer, saying &quot;please fix this now since it is holding up our product development&quot;.</p>
<p>And then when Microsoft decline, giving obvious and excellent reasons, just reply with &quot;Tx. Interesting&quot;.</p>

		<p>I received a request that originated with an executive at a customer who wanted to ensure that no icons would ever cover the organization&#8217;s logo on the mandatory wallpaper. &nbsp;If a user moved an icon over the logo, the software I was to write was supposed to move it somewhere else. &nbsp;(Our official response was, &quot;no, there is no supportable way to do that.&quot;)</p>

		<p>A nice option (don&#8217;t know, maybe Windows 7 has it) would be &#8216;pin this icon to the desktop&#8217;, so that you can&#8217;t accidentally delete it when deleting all the other icons that eventually will end up there (by saving temporary files to the desktop, and installing certain programs).</p>

		<p>At a previous job, the VP of Sales visited a customer site and noticed a user who had changed our program&#8217;s shortcut icon to be the dynamite icon from pifmgr.dll, presumably because the software crashed so much.</p>
<p>The request came to me to find a way to address this problem &#8212; not the quality of the software, of course, but to stop users changing the icon.</p>

		<p>Here in the right-to-left word, an application which locks its icon to the leftmost position would look bizarre.</p>

		<p>Agreed, this would be awful it it was allowed. As for the training argument, icons aren&#8217;t always going to be in the same place all of the time (different companies, home PC, library PC etc), so why not get users used to looking around for a particular icon? They&#8217;re going to need to learn to do that at some point, so why delay the inevitable?</p>

		<p>What about Kiosks?</p>
<p>Wouldn&#8217;t a Kiosk want icons locked in one place (and non-deletable) so that the passerby couldn&#8217;t &quot;wreck&quot; the desktop?</p>

		<p>@John: Yes, there are unsupported ways.</p>
<p>Here are some I cam up with&#8230;</p>
<p>1) Explorer needs to ssve icon position information *somewhere*. Hack that location to have Explorer alway put your icon there.</p>
<p>2) Have an app periodically poll the desktop. If your icon isn&#8217;t where you want it, send the appropriate mouse and keyboard events to clear out the space, and make a new shortcut to your app in that space.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s semi-supported way (the steps aren&#8217;t supportable, but you rely on Microsoft to keep your icon there):</p>
<p>Set the user&#8217;s desktop to auto-arrange by name, &nbsp;create your icon, naming it so it&#8217;s first sorted, and the force a sort.</p>
<p>If the user can do it, then there&#8217;s a way to do it.</p>
<p>The official way is to have the user do it themselves during some tutorial. Chances are, most will keep it there.</p>

		<p>Actually, in Vista and 7, Windows &quot;helpfully&quot; puts new icons one space down from the upper left.</p>
<p>I wish I knew why this was and to make it stop, as I then have to move those icons to get them back in the order I want them.</p>

		<p>Someone You Know: There are two basic kinds of kiosks. The first is where you run an app full-screen, which nowadays is probably just a web browser in kiosk mode. When the browser inevitably crashes, you want some way to easily restart it.</p>
<p>The other scenario is where you just want the user to be able to run a small assortment of apps. For example, maybe you have a library with a few computers for patrons to use. Why write a launcher app when Explorer does a perfectly good job of that already? The only problem is that you want to be able to print up a laminated sheet with instructions that say things like &#8220;To type a document, click here&#8230; To browse the Web, click here&#8230; To search for books in the library, click here&#8230;&#8221;. You want the screenshot on the instruction card to always show the correct location of each icon.</p>

There have been countless complaints (Bing for Auto arrange Explorer or Auto sort Explorer and enjoy the disaster) and Brandon Live also mentions here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=766326" rel="nofollow">http://www.neowin.net/forum/index.php?showtopic=766326</a> that it wasn&#8217;t actively removed which means it was an oversight while designing the new ListView control and MS does not bother to issue a hotfix to fix it.</p>

		<p>Where I&#8217;ve worked before, they wanted the entire opposite &#8211; they had a mandatory corporate wall paper which included the text containing usual corporate garbage such as &quot;You are not allowed to change the wall paper, install programs, access the internet for any purposes not connected with your job function&quot; etc&#8230; along with the usual &quot;Violation of these terms.. blah.. disciplinary action.. blah&quot;. They wanted to make sure no icons would ever cover that text.</p>
<p>After several meetings, it was decided the best way would be to alter the message to include &quot;You may not place any additional icons on this desktop, and you may not move any existing icons.&quot;.</p>
<p>It took a long time to proove to management that using remote desktop can re-arrange your desktop due to resolution changes. The last solution I heard before I last was another policy change &quot;You must access remote desktop connections using the same or higher resolution than that used by the PC normally.&quot;</p>

		<p>Not that I&#8217;m endorsing it, but the desktop (at least on XP) is just a ListView32 window. It understands LVM_ messages. It&#8217;s still not easy to make to it work correctly, since multiple icons on the desktop can have the same display name. </p>

		<p>I agree that not every process needs to be able to access all windows of other processes, but there are exceptions. Accessibility applications come to mind. IIRC, IFolderView is what I used when I wrote a utility to save/restore all icon position. It has been many moons since I wrote it, and I don&#8217;t quite remember.</p>
