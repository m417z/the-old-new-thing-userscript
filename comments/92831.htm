		<p>The story sounds like a boring life, really. Too little work to do is as bad as too much&#8230;</p>

		<p>I think I can beat it.  After I quit Microsoft, they kept paying me.  I didn&#8217;t have the guts to keep up the pretense.  I do have a nice, humble letter from them politely requesting a reimbursement.</p>

		<p>At least in Austria if you receive the wrong salary you are required to pay it back, as long as you couldn&#8217;t unintentionally think that the payment was valid.</p>
<p>Meaning if you stop working and still receive a paycheck you&#8217;re on the hook to pay it back.</p>

		<p>If he did receive a paycheck and either the amount of check was correct or his first and last name was on it (or both), then they perfectly knew who he was and what was his job. For one thing, the Building 1 receptionist had the knowledge that the check was his, and had his contact info too. For another, didn&#8217;t you have FICA and payroll tax there in Redmond? Or does Microsoft never audits its accounts book? (Especially when Bill Gates was around?)</p>

		<p>In contrast to the fictional forgotten employee story, I prefer the true story of Apple&#8217;s Graphing Calculator, featuring people who had been fired and weren&#8217;t being paid, but who kept showing up to do the job anyway.[0]</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s not really a punchline, so this isn&#8217;t really a spoiler, but: &#8220;We wanted to release a Windows version as part of Windows 98, but sadly, Microsoft has effective building security.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Karellen, thanks for this.  Long read, but worth it.</p>
