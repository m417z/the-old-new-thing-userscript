		<p>So, just out of interest, what mailing list software does Microsoft use? I take it these aren&#8217;t Exchange distribution lists?</p>
<p>I guess it must be something home-grown? I also wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if it predates SMTP&#8230; (Or at least the use of SMTP outside of *nix).</p>

		<p>Dog: I&#8217;ve heard that Exchange is used internally since the NT 4 days, when they finally exorcised the last of their Xenix machines. Of course, that&#8217;s just scuttlebutt, and we&#8217;ll need to hear from Raymond if my source is correct, or not.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, MS mailing lists are Exchange distro lists; we are 100% Exchange here. &nbsp;However, we use a custom interface to manage mailing lists, not the standard one in Exchange.</p>

<p>Or more likely, someone just stopped by your desk/office and said &quot;You better not post that information about our mailing lists being available to the public, or we are going to get spammed like crazy.&quot;</p>

		<p>The default has been internal-only for awhile now. When I set up an alias for feedback for customers, I have to go through that hard-to-find hunt to change the setting to allow external email.</p>

		<p>My company&#8217;s DLs default to not accepting email from outside the company. I agree this is a good thing in general.</p>
<p>But (of course, &nbsp;there&#8217;s a but) I work at a Microsoft vendor. Many of our account managers use their Microsoft (v-) email account for all their Microsoft-related work&#8230;including sending us work from their Microsoft clients.</p>
<p>You see where this is leading, yes?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve inquired about setting it up so that DLs can receive email only internally and from specified domains, such as microsoft.com. So far I&#8217;m told this is&#8230;drumroll&#8230;too much work. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>I recently had a problem where certain emails to a client were getting dropped in the bit bucket. It turned out that sometimes the client sent email that CC:ed an internal-only email list. When you do a reply-all that internal email address ends up on the list, and since the reply originates from outside the client, the client&#8217;s email system ignores it.</p>
<p>The least it could have done was bounce it or deliver only to the valid addresses.</p>

		<p>Nice way to force them into action, by publicizing it.</p>

		<p>Michael, I have to ask: &nbsp;Under the principle of dogfooding, why in the world doesn&#8217;t Microsoft internally use the Exchange interface to manage the mailing lists? &nbsp;</p>
<p>If the standard interface to manage lists in Exchange isn&#8217;t good enough for MS, then it&#8217;s not good enough for customers.</p>

		<p>Distribution Lists have been internal only by default for more than a year at least (I think the switch happened as soon as the first instance of spam was observed).</p>
<p>@David &#8211; MS uses a custom interface only because there are a number of business processes that are automated around the DLs and the web interface accommodates this. In addition, DLs are not limited to select few &#8212; anyone in the company can create a public DL.</p>

		<p>When I worked at a certain large Australian company (~45k staff), our Exchange network had a custom-built web interface allowing us &#8216;normal folk&#8217; to create and transfer ownership of Distribution Lists and Generic Mail Accounts (sales@&#8230; etc)</p>

<p>Still, what&#8217;s the difference? Still not good enough for ordinary people? Still can&#8217;t be needed by anybody else?</p>

		<p>Still &#8211;</p>
<p>Microsoft is no different from any other company. They have custom business processes, and the custom interface they use surely supports these processes. Every company I&#8217;ve worked for has customized the environment to support the business &#8211; and Microsoft provides plenty of hooks for companies to do this.</p>
<p>If you think the standard Exchange interface needs more functionality, make feature requests instead of insinuating Microsoft is doing something shady.</p>

		<p>&quot;Still not good enough for ordinary people?&quot;</p>
<p>There is a difference between &quot;not good enough&quot; and &quot;not appropriate&quot;. Just because a company the size of Microsoft needs a particular feature doesn&#8217;t mean everybody else needs it as well. I&#8217;d say most large Exchange deployments (&gt; 10,000) have customized interfaces as well.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t understand the idea that just because Microsoft is a software company they should release every single piece of code they&#8217;ve ever written for internal use. I work for a 3-,developer company and even *we* have custom software that we&#8217;ve written to support our own internal processes. It doesn&#8217;t mean we should release all of that code.</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t wish autogroup (that is the custom interface for managing distribution lists) on anyone. &nbsp;Websites shouldn&#8217;t have right-click menus.</p>

		<p>Microsoft&#8217;s internal mailing list management system is painfully awful. The interface is pretty much a case study in bad website usability, and list names are limited to eight characters. I guess this kind of solves the problem of dictionary words since you have to abbreviate pretty much anything when you create the list name.</p>
