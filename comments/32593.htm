		<p>Can anyone tell me why designing a robotic camel jockey would save camel racing?</p>

		<p>tt: the problem they were having was that they could no longer use children as jockeys. The reason children were used in the first place was because they don&#8217;t weigh much. This is, for example, why horse jockeys in the U.S. are usually very small people. The less for the animal to carry, the more energy they can put into moving quickly.</p>
<p>So, the robotic jockeys help because if you can design one that weighed less than an 18 year old (the new minimum age for a jockey), your camel could move faster, carrying less weight, than the competition&#8217;s.</p>

		<p>Not only that, but the children they were using were paid for and bought from poorer neighboring countries&#8211; basically slave labor.</p>
<p>Wired has a great article about the issue:<br />

		<p>Maybe someone can explain leg shaving to me then.</p>
<p>I would swear it&#8217;s for tradition and not much else. I hear people mention tarmac rash, and easier massaging, etc&#8230; but honestly&#8230; it&#8217;s just for the looks isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>(Just ordered a full Campagnolo Record groupset and eagerly awaiting delivery&#8230; maybe I should shave my legs in the meantime)</p>

		<p>I always assumed the leg shaving was for aerodynamic reasons.</p>

		<p>Road rash and massage are two valid reasons for the leg shaving.  Try pulling medical tape off a hairy leg, or see what a mess massage oil makes on that unshaven limb.  Aero benefits?  Not really.</p>
<p>But I hope not to crash very often, and as an amateur I&#8217;m not getting massages on a daily basis.  So for the vast majority of racers out there, they (including myself, sheep that I am) shave because&#8230;everybody else does.  I refer you to the article on air conditioning that Raymond posted, specifically &quot;tradition&quot;.</p>

		<p>Leg shaving has to do with FEELING fast more than anything.  I think you feel cooler, too.</p>
