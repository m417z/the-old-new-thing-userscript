		<p>Thanks for reminding me just how much fun a small child can have with Microsoft Word. &nbsp;I remember literal squeals of laughter when my son figured out how to change the font size on his own. &nbsp;For several days, nothing was more hilarious that 3 point font followed by 300 point font.</p>

<p>&#8230;so thought other people, trying to recover their important files that disappeared&#8230; Seriously, children will get to the places you din&#39;t know exist. Raymond being (most likely) an administrator on his laptop doesn&#39;t help, either.</p>

		<p>&quot;The account is not an administrator, and the nieces are actually quite good at following instructions.&quot;</p>
<p>I get that the concerns of security, unsupervised use of your account, etc. are overblown, and of no concern.</p>
<p>Yet, this is still a great illustration of the &quot;hammer/nail&quot; metaphor.</p>
<p>Our own kids loved using Notepad as an intro to the computer too. And yes, to suit their needs we had to change the font face and size. I could have written a whole new program for them to address that need. But as the _parent_ of said kids, I didn&#39;t exactly have a lot of spare time to waste on a project like that (granted, uncles without their own children have more time to spend on such things :) ).</p>
<p>But giving each kid their own individual account fixed the problem in a matter of minutes, no coding required.</p>
<p>I submit that as a programmer, one&#39;s first inclination might be to always write a program to solve a problem. But that&#39;s not always the best or most efficient way to do so!</p>

		<p>@pete.d &#8211; I would say you&#39;re reading too much into this. I assume that Raymond, as a very competent programmer, felt that this was a super-simple task. He could make a program that does exactly what he needs and less room to accidentally mess things up with unwanted features. He probably also thought that it would make a very simple example problem for this blog. Kill two birds with one stone, so to speak.</p>

<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>On the other hand, I myself have been amazed with the effects of some sequences of keyboard chords a child can do, that what I really want is to log them! I mean, they get to things so much faster ;)</p>

		<p>Not related to this post, but related to your niece: an old post mentioned she came up with the girl&#39;s name Alula. &nbsp;Turns out the alula is a part of some birds&#39; wings, analogous to the slats of an airplane&#39;s wings. &nbsp;Not sure if that&#39;s where she got the name from, but it isn&#39;t a nonsense word.</p>

<p>Ah, that brings back memories of the Oscar the Grouch program that someone wrote for the Macintosh many years ago. &nbsp;Oscar would pop out and sing a little song when you dumped files in the trash, and then a different one (if I recall correctly), when you emptied the Trash.</p>
<p>More than one parent paid the price for amusing their two or three year old by installing the program when, in their absence, the child proved his or her observational skills and made Oscar sing with no adult intervention at all&#8230;</p>

		<p>I remembered that when I have chance to play with &quot;LOGO&quot; for the first time, it&#39;s quite addictable. (We only had Hercules Graphics at that time, so not much can be done and every seems interesting in the first time)</p>

		<p>@John Doe: Absolutely every single one of the things in that comic is something that is (effectively) per-account or can be configured to be. All the major desktop OSes have facilities for keeping accounts quite firmly separate, that being the entire damn POINT of user accounts.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;Finally, I create the window as a fullscreen popup, so that all my nieces get is a clean screen with no window chrome. (I was using the new Microsoft design language before it was cool.)&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>That&#39;s really nice shop-talking stuff. I think it was in the &quot;What&#39;s new&quot; section coming with Visual Studio 2012 where I read it, or somewhere else along these lines. For what it is worth, I did give VS 2012 a serious try, but reverted to VS 2010 not before long as there was just a little too much contents, and no chrome left at all as far as I am concerned.</p>
