		<p>The name &quot;Sir Humphrey Appleby&quot; gives it away. He was one of the characters (a senior civil servant) in the British TV series &quot;Yes, Minister&quot; of the 1980s.</p>
<p>They could at least have picked a more obscure name.</p>

		<p>rjmx: Raymond said before the quote that he changed the names of the people/company/country involved (and linked to a remarkably detailed Wikipedia article on fictional places in &quot;Yes, [Prime] Minister&quot;). Though perhaps we should send an airborne battalion over to St George&#39;s Island anyway. As a show of goodwill, of course.</p>

		<p>@rjmx &#8211; not sure if you&#39;re joking, but in case you&#39;re not, the link to &quot;fictitious nation&quot; explains &quot;St George&#39;s Island&quot; as a &quot;Yes, Minister&quot; reference. Raymond is not going to go through the trouble of picking a fake country and company and yet use a real name.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve seen vendors send out spammy requests like this to people, once they&#39;ve learned the names of higher-ups. They&#39;ll say something like &quot;so-and-so&quot; (usually a manager or VP often in a somewhat related area) asked me to contact you about our new product, hoping that that borrowed authority will trick you into talking to them and giving them a chance to sell you on their product.</p>

		<p>A technique I learned from Terry Pratchett is the split sentence. &nbsp;&quot;I&#39;ve been speaking to the divisional director and I need a new laptop&quot; is one I&#39;ve tried. &nbsp;&quot;Hello&quot; in the lift counts as speaking to doesn&#39;t it? The implied authority can work wonders.</p>

		<p>If the attachment was clean then maybe your colleague&#39;s &lt;name&gt; is similar to some &lt;name&gt; the VP mentioned during the conference, so the Contoso dudes tried to stab in the dark. (What the Contoso dude remembered ≈ What the Contoso dude heard ≈ what the VP thought he said ≈ what the VP actually said)&#8230; <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4VtcOCHePB4">http://www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>

		<p>Vimes: having acquired a new laptop for that employee, IT then emails the divisional director and politely restates the need to follow the established hardware replacement procedures, referencing the employee&#39;s statement that it was the divisional director who approved the new laptop (they&#39;re not going to quote the employee word-for-word, but rather your implied meaning). How does the divisional director proceed?</p>

		<p>Since this is the first genuinely professional sounding (and domestically authored) attachment bait I&#39;ve ever seen used to distribute malware, I&#39;d be very curious to have a look at this document to see what they might have up their sleeve.</p>

		<p>There are other ways to get a (new) laptop:</p>
<p>&#8211; State that your current tasks require it, e.g. 64-bit, more than 4GB RAM, an actual SSD for benchmarking or to make sure that disk I/O is/was a bottleneck that is solved by using an SSD, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211; If you already have a laptop, use it over a blanket, or otherwise obstruct its ventilation, to make it overheat and eventually ruin it invisibly, without scratches, dust, paper clips or staples, liquids, etc.</p>
<p>&#8211; If you don&#39;t have a laptop, state that your current tasks or responsibilities require that you work in remote places, such as travelling to a client, running conferences where you share the desktop with all the development tools running, etc.</p>
<p>All of this is, Of Course™, rather unethical, envious boy/girl.</p>
<p>Have you noticed the cuteness? Comments are automatically hyphenated on IE10 and IE11.</p>

		<p>@John Doe:</p>
<p>1) Been there, done that, and it didn&#39;t work. Boss just say why don&#39;t you do your tasks at Deaktop if performance is slow.</p>
<p>2) No comment.</p>
<p>3) Unless you&#39;re C-grade(a.k.a.: CXO) or manager grade. they&#39;ll just buy one for your division and make you borrow it when needed.</p>

		<p>@cheong00, well, I didn&#39;t way it works 100%, just easier methods that are also less likely to get one fired. Someone above in the hierarchy must be stupid enough to fall for 1 and 3, or to repeatedly fall for 2. And even then, one must be stubborn enough to make it sound credible, one can&#39;t just &quot;fold&quot; when his/her ass is about to be uncovered. It&#39;s a risk.</p>
<p>If the &quot;excuses&quot; to get a new laptop are not real or even good enough, one is simply being stupid (e.g. envy of someone?), and one is actually hurting the company.</p>
<p>However, I&#39;ll refrain further expanding this subject. It&#39;s quite unfortunate to know these techniques have been applied, some times more successful than others, everywhere (work, clients, contractors, public institutions, schools, homes&#8230; some even do it on personal devices so friends and family buy a present for Christmas or birthday&#8230;) Is this off-topic or what?</p>
