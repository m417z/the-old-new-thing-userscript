		<p>At some point you really have to suspect the meter reading. &nbsp;I mean, the guy in Bulgaria would literally have to have almost 1% of his blood volume be ethanol.</p>

		<p>@Spizzbot: well, the story [1] says the police who took him in did indeed suspect their meters were broken; they tested him five times before taking him to a hospital, where the doctors confirmed it.</p>
<p>So, believe it or believe it not, it does seem like the authorities were properly incredulous.</p>

		<p>cc: Sorry to be nitpicky, but it only says the police &quot;thought their equipment was broken&quot; but &quot;five separate lab tests taken the same day confirmed the man&#8217;s blood-alcohol level of 0.914&quot;</p>
<p>In other words, the police gave him the breathalizer an undefined number of times, it&#8217;s the hospital that tried five times before finally concluding that he was somehow able to not only survive but remain conscious and lucid at twice the lethal limit. Again, I apologize for nitpicking.</p>
<p>What I do find interesting on that is that he wasn&#8217;t DUI. He was a pedestrian that was hit by a car. Don&#8217;t drink and walk now? (Or how about the much simpler approach: Don&#8217;t drink.)</p>

		<p>These type of accidents are getting very common</p>
<p>day by day Driving while intoxicated is not at all safe for the people. I don&#8217;t know why people drive when they know that it&#8217;s a serious crime.</p>

		<p>@Mark: Because they&#8217;re &lt;i&gt;drunk&lt;/i&gt;, perhaps? &nbsp;Alcohol is known to lower inhibitions, including ones that normally inhibit us from committing crimes like DUI.</p>

		<p>&gt; &quot;I don&#8217;t know why people drive when they know that it&#8217;s a serious crime.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the correct reason not to drink and drive. You shouldn&#8217;t drink and drive because it&#8217;s stupid and you endanger other people.</p>
<p>&gt; &quot;Because they&#8217;re &lt;i&gt;drunk&lt;/i&gt;, perhaps? &quot;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the usual reason. Most of the time people who are driving while drunk are on the way home from e.g. a bar. This implies that they actually *planned* to drive drunk. (You know you need to get back home, you know you&#8217;re going to drink in the bar. You still choose to drive there instead of e.g. taking a bicycle).</p>

		<p>@Aaargh!:</p>
<p>In light of that statement, I would bet it&#8217;s the &quot;It won&#8217;t happen to me&quot; syndrome. &quot;/Other/ people get arrested for DUI. /Other/ people crash. /Other/ people die. Not me. Bad things like that don&#8217;t happen to me.&quot; By the time they find out the truth, they&#8217;re serving time in a prison, hospital, or mortuary and it&#8217;s a bit too late.</p>
