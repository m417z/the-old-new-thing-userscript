		<p>Not the same but kind of. I once wrote a feature to generate (rich) text reports in a personal finance planner application.</p>
<p>The financial institution &#8211; our clients &#8211; could customize the report, and put in different statements depending on certain financial conditions. We had special consultants to help the institution with this task.</p>
<p>After the feature was finished, I was repeatedly asked by the consultants to make reports and customizations. Often accompanied by questions about which statement would suit such and such condition.</p>
<p>I had an incredibly hard time explaining that I only implemented the feature, and that the content was up to them.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just that I was pegged as &quot;the report guy&quot;.</p>
<p>In the end they got it though. I could be quite persistent in refusing to do their job :)</p>

		<p>Sorry for the nitpicking, but for SharePoint you can register your SharePoint farm centrally in Active Directory with a service connection point (e.g. for SharePoint 2010 see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff730261(v=office.14).aspx">technet.microsoft.com/&#8230;/ff730261(v=office.14).aspx</a>). If you have permissions, you can query the service connection point and then query the farm for a list of sites. This isn&#39;t trivial but it is possible. Of course, this isn&#39;t on by default and by getting a list of sites, you still don&#39;t know the name of of that somebody&#39;s site (unless the name is &quot;Somebody&#39;s Site&quot;). The better approach is still to ask them.</p>

		<p>I agree with Jason. There are many servers which have administration tools that allow you to select a server from a list (SQL Server and Terminal Services come to mind). It&#39;s not too far-fetched to think that Program Q might have similar capabilities, or just register itself in AD.</p>
<p>I would certainly hope somebody would at least ask about it prior to manually compiling such a list.</p>
<p>To put it another way, let&#39;s say somebody asked &quot;What&#39;s the best way to find out Program Q&#39;s install directory on my server?&quot;. The answer might be &quot;Remember where you put it when you installed it&quot; or it might be &quot;Just check HKLMSoftwareMicrosoftProgramQInstallPath&quot;. Since the latter answer is just as likely as the former, you&#39;d be foolish for not asking.</p>

		<p>Eventually you have to know something though: &quot;Where is the repository of repositories? Where&#39;s that repository?&quot; (etc.) Also, if the program is an internal, limited-use app there likely isn&#39;t anything so fancy as a repository server!</p>

		<p>Doesn&#39;t all M$ software phone home to a central repository? Ask the license guys, they sure keep track of every software installed on every server.</p>

		<p>&gt; What&#39;s the best way to get the repository server name for any given repository</p>
<p>&gt; To get the repository servers used by your test team, you um ask your test team?</p>
<p>Hmm&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible that the asker *has* a list of repositories (or at least, they know how to get it.) They are asking how to get the repository server name from the repository name, which is a reasonable question, assuming that the software is already successfully communicating with the repository.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>The &quot;repository&quot; here is not any programmatic name. It&#39;s a conceptual repository, like &quot;The repository that contains all our Canadian customer information. I want to do a query against all the tables in that repository, but I don&#39;t know the server&#39;s name.&quot; -Raymond</em>]</div>

<p>A central license repository of the software does only have knowledge of where the installed software are located. What each software database contain isn&#39;t replicated to the license server, you have guess based on metadata, and query a selected set of servers which has the software installed. The initial question didn&#39;t assume more.</p>

		<p>Raymond why do you keep responding to 640k? There&#39;s years of evidence that he/she/it is an anti-ms troll, there&#39;s no point responding.</p>
