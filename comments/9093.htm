<p>Hmmm, yes, we can start with the fact that regsvr doesn&#39;t even exist on my 64-bit Windows 7, so yes &#8211; I&#39;d imagine there would be an error&#8230;</p>

		<p>Years ago back in the &quot;DLL not found&quot; days we wrote a debugger that would figure out the missing DLLs and all sorts of COM and registry issues. regsvr was always a mystery to the VB crowd at the time. We wrote a little tool that would actually explain the error codes if possible that were returned from trying to register a DLL. Its called regdrop and it&#39;s here <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.addisonsw.com/revsqu.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.addisonsw.com/revsqu.htm</a> if anyone wants it.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Luke, use full path names!
</p></blockquote>
<p>As Raymond has written several posts about this before, I know that you have to use full path names when calling LoadLibrary from your own program.</p>
<p>But without checking first, I would have guessed that regsvr32 uses its current directory to convert the given file name argument to a full path before calling LoadLibrary. That&#39;s what I except a well behaved command line utility to do. (e.g. &quot;dir explorer.exe&quot; doesn&#39;t search the path, either)</p>
<p>Apparently this is not the case.</p>

		<p>@Me: Correct, Regsvr32 appears to just call LoadLibrary on the name/path given on the commandline, without any modification.</p>
<p>If you&#39;ve set the registry value which bans the current directory from the library path (plugging the DLL-planting hole) then it means you always have to give regsvr32 a full path.</p>
<p>(Would be nice if you could use &quot;.dllname.dll&quot; as a shorthand to make regsvr32 resolve it to the absolute path, but I guess there&#39;s probably something wrong if you are (un)registering DLLs by hand often enough to care that much.)</p>

<p>Please note: incorrect subject area, haven&#39;t read post, lack of &#39;please&#39; and use of &quot;I need you&quot;, lack of contact details, vague requirements&#8230;</p>

		<p>Why is it that many DLLs fail to register under Vista/7 using regsvr32 from an elevated admin cmd prompt but those same DLLs registered successfully on XP and earlier? Leads me to believe something is broken in Vista&#39;s regsvr32. Doesn&#39;t happen with all DLLs though.</p>

		<p>Meh. A particular DLL registration function could succeed on XP but fail on Vista/7 if the first thing it tried to do was some interaction with a service that is now isolated in session 0 and then failed out. Probably about a thousand other things too.</p>

		<p>@xpclient:</p>
<p>Originally, Windows didn&#39;t support this mechanism for registering DLLs at all. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Now, I don&#39;t work for Microsoft, and this is based on my personal experience. &nbsp;However, as a developer who occasionally has written DLL files, including COM, I have occasionally implemented self-registering DLLs. &nbsp;However, I will never &#8212; never &#8212; implement another one. &nbsp;If a registry entry is corrupt, there are a variety of reasons why it could be corrupt, but none of them involve Windows just randomly changing the entry because it feels like it. &nbsp;Some process, it changed that entry to point at the wrong thing.</p>
<p>Now when you change that entry back (using RegSvr), you eliminate any ability to diagnose the problem.</p>
<p>For Windows System DLLs, you can usually fix them using System File Check (sfc /scannow). &nbsp;For third-party DLLs, you can usually run the same installer that copied them onto the system in the first place.</p>
<p>Now I want to ask you something though:</p>
<p>&quot;Looks like you are blind. I have been using these DLLs under XP/2000 with no problems but some of them register properly under Vista/7.&quot;</p>
<p>Ok so I&#39;ll bite &#8212; why are you running RegSvr32 on, apparently from your message, Microsoft provided DLLs in the first place? &nbsp;If you&#39;re not having any problems, then you shouldn&#39;t have to re-register them. &nbsp;If you&#39;re upgrading the files, the correct route would be Microsoft&#39;s MSM &#8212; which would register the files appropriately on its own. &nbsp;If you&#39;re downgrading, you&#39;d want to uninstall then install the down level MSM. &nbsp;If you&#39;re just coping the files, or running RegSvr32 on random files to mask some problem, the MSM for DirectShow &#8212; for example &#8212; does a lot more than simply registering a couple of the DLLs it copied, and if you don&#39;t run its installer, you can cause problems in a week, month, year when some other program runs and doesn&#39;t find the entries the MSM writes, and therefore installs some other random version of the components.</p>
<p>If you write a MSI file (WiX, 10 minutes &#8212; for vast majority of installs), then services like System Management Server or LogMeIn One-To-Many can easily install it on multiple computers. &nbsp;The people installing it don&#39;t have to understand batch files, or write one &#8212; they just drag the MSI on, and say &quot;deploy this to that group.&quot;</p>
<p>For testing in Visual Studio, on your own code, there&#39;s a value in running it &#8212; but you shouldn&#39;t be running it against Microsoft&#39;s DLLs in that scenario.</p>
<p>What scenario do you have where you&#39;re having to register Microsoft&#39;s already installed files in the first place?</p>

		<p>It looks like these kinds of issues arise mostly because they fall in the trap of thinking that &quot;regsvr32&quot; is a tool used to register DLLs (thanks to the name regsvr32). Anyone who has ever tried writing even a test COM DLL will understand that regsvr32 is just a way to loading the COM DLL and invoking its DllRegisterServer function. In fact like in case of COM, if you can just add the registry entries manually for the DLL, there is no need to use regsvr32. Also in general the DllRegisterServer function is not specifically supposed to create some registry entries, it might do anything which the author of DLL wishes to achieve. The confusion arises probably because people who use regsvr32 may not be specifically used to COM programming.</p>
