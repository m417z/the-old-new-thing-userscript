		<p>Raymond, quoting an earlier post: &#8220;If there are multiple shortcuts to the same program, then the most-frequently-used shortcut is selected&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymond, today: &#8220;we will choose either the standard Notepad shortcut or the LitWare Release Notes shortcut, depending on which one you&#8217;ve run most recently.&#8221;</p>
<p>In my mind there&#8217;s a difference between &#8220;most-frequently-used&#8221; and &#8220;most recently [used].&#8221; &nbsp;One is not necessarily the other. &nbsp;You could&#8217;ve run Notepad 500 times but the Litware version was the one that pushed it over the top. &nbsp;That doesn&#8217;t make it the MFU shortcut, does it?</p>
<p>(Sorry for asking a question, I probably just canceled the whole series.)</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Corrected. Actually, since points also fade over time, a more accurate description would be &#8220;most frequently recently&#8221;, but that&#8217;s pretty unwieldy, and as you&#8217;ve noticed, I&#8217;ve been inconsistent in how I abbreviate it. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Given that he&#8217;s said &quot;most frequently&quot; repeatedly now, I suspect &quot;recently&quot; was a mistake on his part this time, so I assumed that&#8217;s what he meant.</p>

		<p>This answers the question of why, for the longest time, I had SourceSafe release notes in my start menu. &nbsp;Now I have &quot;Reporting System Release Notes&quot;.</p>
<p>LOL.</p>

		<p>Another reason why Opera shouldn&#8217;t use command line parameters to set important options (like &quot;-notrayicon&quot; :)</p>

		<p>Oddly, I think my brain inserted a comma, so I read &quot;depending on which one you&#8217;ve run most, recently&quot; (that is, which one has been run the most, in recent days). Apparently that was the &quot;correct&quot; reading, so I guess it was all for the best.</p>
<p>English is a wonderful language.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve had that Notepad &quot;bug&quot; happen to my start menu, and found it confusing. &nbsp;The new rules seem quite logical to me.</p>

		<p>Wolf, you&#8217;re not alone, I read it the same way, and even considered posting that, but I figured I&#8217;d just let Raymond clarify what he meant.</p>

		<p>This whole thing is ridiculous. &nbsp;How many man hours were spent designing, coding and testing this feature which is (a) impossible to get right, as your tale of escalating hacks shows (b) pretty useless anyway</p>

		<p>@Al: the feature is definitely not useless. I had a computer yesterday of which the owner claimed Word had disappeared. What had happened was that is was no longer on the start menu.</p>
<p>This user depended on that &#8216;useless&#8217; feature to do all his PC work.</p>
<p>By the way Raymond will the series cover what happens when the dektop wizard cleans up unused icons?</p>

		<p>So what effect does the &quot;Remove from this list&quot; context menu item have?</p>
<p>Does it reset the counter to 0 for that program? &nbsp;or just enough to get it off the &quot;hit list&quot;?</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been able to see a pattern&#8230;</p>
