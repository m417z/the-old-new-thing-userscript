		<p>What about subclassing each individual window/control with a simple implementation that otherwise just passes everything to the previous class&#8217; window procedure?</p>

		<p>It would probably have been wiser for functions like SetClassLongPtr to take a WNDCLASS or an ATOM instead of an HWND. It makes more sense, and I bet nobody would&#8217;ve made the mistake of thinking the new value only applied to the one window.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Menu<br />
  <br />&gt;SetMenu(hwnd, hmenuNew) + destroy the old menu</p>
<p>It always makes me nervous, trying to figure out if an old menu (or font or whatever) should be destroyed. &nbsp;If the old object belonged to a window class, and we destroy the old object, how do we know that other windows of the same class aren&#8217;t going to get in trouble?

		<p>I always liked the Set[Class|Window].* functions &#8212; so obviously additional memory allocated at the end of a C struct (at least to my way of thinking, could&#8217;ve been assembler originally). And definitely an interface designed by and for people of, dare I say, a bygone age.</p>
<p>The other thing of note, is the lack of orthogonality in the ways the class defaults are overridden.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not saying these are bad, they&#8217;re simply not something anyone would design in 2006. Right?</p>

		<p>&gt; What about it? If that&#8217;s all it did, it seems<br />
<br />&gt; like an awfully expensive nop.</p>
<p>I think what I was trying to ask is *how much* really expensive is<br />
the overhead? Especially compared with the relative simplicity of then<br />
being able to use those class functions to change a parameter when<br />
needed, and, erm, let the OS worry about it?</p>
<p>I agree it&#8217;s messier at runtime, but if some app requires multiple<br />
windows/controls like that, writing a single MakeNewClass function and<br />
a generic minimal window procedure for it can look more appealing then<br />
overriding specific messages per-control in several different window<br />
procedure of the application.</p>
<p>BTW, off-topic, but your in-comment replies do not show up in<br />
comment feeds. You may want to raise a request to have a comment<br />
updated in the feeds when it&#8217;s edited. It&#8217;s a very safe assumption that<br />
your replies are important to everyone monitoring a post here, so when<br />
you do reply people shouldn&#8217;t see that there are no new comments on the<br />
post&#8230;</p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>If you want to register one generic class and subclass it every time you create it, then you can do that. You can work out the overhead yourself (a few extra calls at window creation, plus a few more at every window message) &#8211; you get to decide if it&#8217;s worth it. Note of course that if you do this then anybody who tries to manipulate your program via FindWindow (e.g. your automated testing system) will be in for a surprise. If you want to request features for the blog software, you can raise them to the software vendor. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Is automated testing systems incompatible with subclassed windows?</p>
