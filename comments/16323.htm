		<p>Finally, you emulate us!</p>
<p>My friend and I did this in Singapore airport in 2002. When we came out of immigration and started running, a couple of security people start running with us asking about our flight and calling ahead to hold it while we board. The flight took off within a minute of us getting in.</p>
<p>We were so late, they had already unloaded our luggage as a security measure (we were in 24-hour transit at Singapore, so our luggage was booked through). The checked-in luggage eventually reached us a day or two later.</p>

		<p>Whenever I&#8217;m stuck in an airport it helps to remember that when &quot;Around the World in 80 Days&quot; was written, it was considered science fiction.</p>

		<p>My way of finding a good local restaurant depends on where I am. If I&#8217;m in my car, I use the GPS&#8217;s built-in Zagat guide. If I&#8217;m some place with Internet access, I go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.flavortownusa.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.flavortownusa.com</a> to find a place nearby that has been featured on &quot;Diners, Drive-ins and Dives&quot; on the Food Network. Another good strategy is to find some place with a chef &#8212; bad restaurants don&#8217;t have chefs.</p>
<p>I also like to go places I&#8217;ve heard of but have never been to. For example, I&#8217;ve heard of Wolfgang Puck but had never been to one of his restaurants. When I was in Seattle and found out he had a cafe there, I had to try it.</p>

		<p>I have a Korean friend who played football in high school. &nbsp;He would have to remind the opposing team that he was technically a gook and not a chink. &nbsp;If you were going to insult him, at least have the brains to do it correctly. &nbsp;Kind of like Steve Martin&#8217;s rant in Roxanne.</p>

		<p>the part of the story containing the racial slur made me very angry.. But there are idiots everywhere.. Do they deserve to be mentioned in a blog? I don&#8217;t know&#8230; Haha&#8230; I am just wondering what these guys would say If they knew your income&#8230; </p>

		<p>My wife and I were passing through Salt Lake City last July and overheard someone say, &quot;No chink food either&quot; as they passed a Chinese restaurant. &nbsp;We both looked at each other in shock and said, &quot;People still say that?!&quot; &nbsp;Amazing.</p>

		<p>Wow, I originally read that as &quot;chunky&quot;. &nbsp;I thought maybe he was making a comment about your weight. &nbsp;(I&#8217;ve never met you, so I don&#8217;t know how much you weigh. &nbsp;I guess I assumed that it&#8217;d be more common to be called one name than the other in public.)</p>

		<p>1) Papa Del&#8217;s is the Champaign-Urbana benchmark for Chicago-style pizza, but the pizza in Chicago proper is better yet.</p>
<p>2) If I have checked luggage, I never run for a plane. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not worth it to arrive and find your luggage didn&#8217;t make it. &nbsp;(Of course for a short weekend trip, you probably just had carry on&#8230;)</p>
<p>3) Shamefully, it is completely possible that those jackasses were from the area.</p>

		<p>I was sad because I had no shoes, then I met a man with no feet, and stole his shoes. What? He wasn&#8217;t going to use them.</p>
<p>Sorry&#8230;&#8230;</p>

		<p>I did catch your talk at U of I, and wanted to say &quot;Good job.&quot; &nbsp;I enjoyed it quite a bit. &nbsp;It was worth the trip.</p>

		<p>Hey! Thanks for coming out to see all of us in Illinois. I apologize that we are not all awesome. I really enjoyed getting a chance to talk with you, and hope we will get the opportunity to do it again someday when I am spending slightly more time in Seattle!</p>

		<p>I love running to catch flights!</p>
<p>It happened to me once because I confused the boarding time and departure time. I was sitting in the lounge, watching TV on my laptop and drinking a Diet Coke, when suddenly I hear them calling for all passengers of the flight&#8230; I looked at my boarding pass again, then at the watch &#8211; I had one minute to cross the airport. I was late, but the plane hasn&#8217;t left and they haven&#8217;t taken out my luggage, so they hurried me on board&#8230; There was someone else who was one minute behind me. When he got on board I saw them closing the doors, and the plane quickly began to taxi, then stopped, and the captain said that we missed our scheduled departure window and since the airport is extremely busy we&#8217;ll have to wait about 40 minutes for a new one.</p>

		<p>Maybe the airlines should just stop allowing these &quot;last minute&quot; people to board the airplane.</p>
<p>If you arent at the gate on time, your bags get taken off the airplane and you aren&#8217;t allowed to fly period.</p>

		<p>Jon, Most of the time, the late people are late because of the airline running late with other flights. &nbsp;Its not really their fault.</p>

		<p>I was disappointed in the Chicago pizza I had at Papa Del&#8217;s. &nbsp;And I like pizza. &nbsp;It just seemed too thick and undercooked.</p>
<p>Chez Panisse, Alice Waters&#8217; restaurant in Berkeley, makes a good pizza and a great calzone. &nbsp;But it&#8217;s entirely different than Chicago pizza. &nbsp;(And when you go to Chez Panisse for the first time, there are better things to order from there than pizza.)</p>

		<p>&#8220;Up until that point, my interactions with the fine people of Illinois were uniformly positive, and I had found them all to be unfailingly polite and helpful. I&#8217;m going to give the state the benefit of the doubt and say that the guy and his buddy were visiting from another state. (Like maybe New Jerkland or something.)&#8221;</p>
<p>I had that preconception about NJ as well. &nbsp;When I traveled there to provide some training, I found it was only the area around Newark that had a high jerk quotient. &nbsp;The rest of the state was made up of wonderful hosts, students and general people. &nbsp;They did talk a little funny, though.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>I wasn&#8217;t referring to New Jersey when I wrote &#8220;New Jerkland&#8221;; I was just making up a name. (Actually, I was more worried that people would think I was referring to New Zealand.) &#8220;East Jerkland&#8221; would probably have been better. -Raymond</i>]</div>
