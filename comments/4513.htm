		<p>I very rarely remember my dreams (maybe twice a year or thereabouts) so when I do, they&#39;re that much more striking.</p>
<p>So I like these summaries of yours &#8211; you should write them down on a blog or something.</p>

		<p>&quot;They&#39;ll just fail differently now.&quot;</p>
<p>Something about this suggests a long acquaintance with software development and testing.</p>

		<p>The thing about people wearing &#39;flesh-colored suits under their clothes all the time just so they would look good &quot;naked&quot;.&#39;&#8230;</p>
<p>Wow. I would have never even thought about that. That&#39;s so crazy, I can definitely see it happening. Actually, now that I think of it, I just wonder WHEN.</p>

		<p>Guys, I think AC is just about to realise why we all look better than him naked. Our only hope is to get him to the dentist pronto!</p>

		<p>Not sure if I&#39;m more disturbed about you having that dream, or that you thought you should share it with us.</p>

		<p>I dreamt that I went to coffee shop to have dinner alone last night. Instead of taking traditional seat, the shop&#39;s owner invite me with another 2 groups of people to eat in the kitchen. The kitchen is half-open bar style, and located half-floor above the ground so we get a good view from the interior of the coffee shop. However since I don&#39;t know the others (there&#39;s 8 people sitting around the table) and they talking and laughing with big noise, I feel a bit weird and didn&#39;t enjoy the meal well.</p>

		<p>I dreamt that I was in a building with Data from Star Trek: The Next Generation, and someone I didn&#39;t recognise &#8211; we were being shot at. So, we decided that a small garden shed nearby would provide the best protection from bullets. The unknown guy and I ran through the line of fire to the shed, and didn&#39;t get shot. We sent Data in the opposite direction to get some chairs. When we got into the shed, there came a knock on the door &#8211; it was the farmer from Hot Fuzz ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cun-LZvOTdw" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch</a> ). We had a conversation (I could somehow understand him) about the odd weather recently &#8211; we came to the conclusion that we hadn&#39;t missed out Spring entirely, but that it seemed to be a lot shorter/more extreme than usual (and he&#39;s a farmer, remember, so he clearly knows what he&#39;s talking about).</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know if Data ever got back with our chairs as that&#39;s around when I woke up.</p>

		<p>Brazil &#8211; yummy mommy. That&#39;s when I realized redhead&#39;s are hot. Until then brunet&#39;s were my thing. My wife is a redhead :).</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  probably because I became prematurely senile
</p></blockquote>
<p>Perhaps the entire dental procedure was a delusional fantasy within your dream:</p>
<p>In your dream you are senile and have been forcibly committed to a full-care institution for your own safety. Most of the patients on your ward are elderly and you only really see them during pill dispension time, when you have moments of lucidity. At some point you have a psychotic episode involving the dental procedure.</p>
<p>So just laugh it off: the whole Brazil-like future dentistry thing never happened!</p>

		<p>@Muzer0: Apparently Data was still in the other shed with Arthur &quot;Two Sheds&quot; Jackson watching him composing his next symphony.</p>
<p>(Since Data is so polite he can&#39;t just interrupt him and ask if he may take those chairs.)</p>
