		<p>@David, yes, it&#39;s what you say when you finally determine the user-agent after looking through lots of log files. </p>

		<p>And yes, the Ahoj shots were actually very popular when I was in my twenties. One time we took an empty package, filled it with dry salad seasoning and gave it to a friend for the shot&#8230; hilarious, though he was not particularly amused.</p>

		<p>Here is some Brausepulver: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://youtu.be/aFmWdh7ClSw">http://youtu.be/aFmWdh7ClSw</a></p>
<p>Many Germans remember a juicy scene in Die Blechtrommel by G. Grass, when Oskar shares some Brausepulver with his lover Maria.</p>

		<p>Er, I didn&#39;t quite understood the part about learning Chinese instead of German. Is it because China and Germany are on the opposite ends of the continent? (One in the far west and one in the far east?) Or is it because Microsoft has a language input lab in China?</p>

		<p>So I&#39;m Austrian and not German (still know enough Germans, my father for one..) and I&#39;ve never seen anyone write a breve over the u &#8211; if I&#39;d have to guess I&#39;d say Scandinavian custom. The 1 and 7 on the other hand is indeed very common, always leads to confusions on the other side of the ocean, by now I actually have taught myself to write the American way.</p>
<p>Ahem anyhow: Great story! It&#39;s always fun to unexpectedly run into people who speak the same language in a foreign country. I remember the one time I walked into a store in southern New Mexico and it turned out the shopkeeper&#39;s mother was German and had taught her a bit when she was a kid.</p>

		<p>In S端tterlinschrift, the script that was common in Germany at the beginning of the last century, the lower case letters u and n are actually identical, except for the breve, which distinguishes them and is therefore necessary for legibility. Many people who grew up writing S端tterlin (the *** banned it, because they mistakenly thought it was Jewish) kept the habit of putting an accent on the u even when writing Latin Script, where the letters n and u are clearly distinguishable. It appears that Raymond met some people who wrote or read S端tterlin.</p>

		<p>Whoops, I didn&#39;t expect to be bowdlerized! What I meant to say is that a number of type faces and even styles of handwritings were bannend in 1941 by people who had little knowledge of German culture.</p>

		<p>@Martin And there I thought you were censoring yourself for unexplained reasons! Surprising what gets filtered.</p>
<p>Thanks for the explanation, really interesting. So at least to some degree an age thing &#8211; probably also a bit locality. S端tterlin/Kurrentschrift do use the breve, Frakturschrift (the one I&#39;m used to when talking about &quot;old script&quot;) on the other hand doesn&#39;t. </p>
