		<p>In Britain we are taught that Alexander Graham Bell was Scottish. We&#8217;re also taught that democracy was our idea, although for the reasons cited above it obviously isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>A popular one here is John Logie Baird&#8217;s television.</p>

		<p>And of course the Brits know that Mr Swan invented the light bulb. &nbsp;His bulbs have bayonet bases, rather than the screw-in base that we have in North America. &nbsp;I have visited the Museum of Science (in London, UK, naturally) where there is a considerable exhibit of his work. &nbsp;And a few jibes at the Americans for thinking it was Edision. &nbsp;I&#8217;m also reminded of a &#8216;joke&#8217; that the Soviets invented the telegraph, based on a farmer finding wires in his field, and also the radio, based on a different farmer NOT finding wires in his field&#8230;</p>

<p>George Stevenson is often credited with railways.</p>

		<p>Actually, saying that Ford invented the automobile is just an invitation to the pedants who will say that Ford actually invented the modern assembly line.</p>
<p>People tend to muddle it later in life when it isn&#8217;t so important.</p>

		<p>Iceland invented end rhyme (last word in sentence one, rhymes with last word in sentence three). &nbsp;H&#246;fu&#240;lausnir, Egill Skallagr&#237;msson. &nbsp;Also, Iceland wrote the first book on grammar, and was the first European country to write in it&#8217;s own language (and not Latin).</p>

		<p>Norway has two inventions that we are very, very proud of:</p>
<ul>
<li>the cheese slicer (not the cheese cutter which uses a wire) by Thor Bj&#248;rklund in 1927.</li>
<li>
<p>binder by Johan Vaaler, first patented in 1901. Actually this is a myth, according to Wikipedia, since binders already existed before his invention.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>However, Norwegians have done much bigger contributions then these inventions. One is the Birkeland-Eyde process to make nitrogen (this patent was the starting point for Norsk Hydro). Another is the Simula programming language by Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard of the Norwegian Computing Center, which modern object-oriented programming languages (e.g., C++, Java and C#) are based on. Probably a lot of nice offshore oil inventions as well&#8230;</p>

		<p>For the United States: television, the Internet, and the cellular telephone. I think many Americans would claim the World-Wide Web (even though it was invented in Switzerland) as a result of Mosaic/Netscape. (This is similar to crediting Henry Ford with the invention of the automobile.)</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  &gt; In Britain we are taught &#8230; that democracy was our idea
</p></blockquote>
<p>John Locke does not get enough credit &#8211; much of the inspiration for America&#8217;s revolutionary ideas came from his writings. &nbsp;&quot;Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot; is a nearly plagiarized quote of Locke&#8217;s &quot;life, liberty and estate (property)&quot;. &nbsp;The key idea &#8211; that these are natural rights &#8211; was expounded by Locke. &nbsp;He should be better known in America.</p>
<p>Though much of Locke&#8217;s writing were done while he was living in Holland&#8230;</p>

<p>Press (you know the thing that makes books) =&gt; &nbsp;Laurens</p>
<p>making land out of water =&gt; every single dutchman that ever lived :)</p>

		<p>In Greece I was also taught that Greeks invented democracy. Other than that Greeks are supposed to have laid the groundwork for the development of philosophy, mathematics, physics, biology and pretty much every other greek named thing as a science (except for economics).</p>
<p>Greeks claim to have organized the first olympic games some 2800 years ago. And back then there was some guy named Homer whose stories are still read today occasionally. He was also the template for the creation of a character in the Simpsons.</p>
<p>The sad thing is that my compatriots often think they are cool by default because of these things and they don&#8217;t have to accomplish anything by themselves.</p>

		<p>I find it interesting how the US and UK history books portray WWII. I grew up hardly knowing that the US &#8216;helped&#8217;, but on the other side of the pond, you would think that the US single-handledly won the battle.</p>

		<p>Eastman may have invented dry photographic plates and camera film, but William Fox Talbot was taking pictures of Reading, UK in 1843, before Eastman was even born. The inventor of photography was probably Joseph Nic&#233;phore Ni&#233;pce (although that&#8217;s from Wikipedia).</p>

		<p>And talking about the bulb, I remember watching a program about Tesla, who cam up with his own Incandescent light bulb, when Edison questioned usage of his bulbs on Tesla&#8217;s AC lines, Tesla came up with his version of bulb with nodes coming out, with out using Edison’s patented screw design.</p>

		<p>Besides the list Jamie provided above, Canada also tends to boast of the War of 1812, staking a claim as the only country in history to have won a war against the United States. The simplified version of the story tends to be &quot;The Americans invaded us, we fought back, pushed them out of our country, kept going until we made it to Washington, burned down the White House, and went back home.&quot;</p>
<p>Oh, and hockey also &quot;belongs&quot; to Canada. And a more modern Canadian invention is IMAX films.</p>

		<p>Here in brazil, the most known claim is that Alberto Santos Dumont &#8220;invented the airplane&#8221;.</p>
<p>However we have a more recent example: people are claiming that the Indiana Jones hat was designed by a brazilian: <a href="http://www.aboutsaopaulo.com/news/culture/indiana-jones-hat-is-made-in-sao-paulo/" rel="nofollow">http://www.aboutsaopaulo.com/news/culture/indiana-jones-hat-is-made-in-sao-paulo/</a> I didn&#8217;t check the claim carefully, but it &nbsp;simply &lt;i&gt;doesn&#8217;t look true&lt;/i&gt; to me.</p>
<p>Other brazilian invention claims (I don&#8217;t know if each one is true or not):</p>
<p>&#8211; Alberto Santos Dumont invented the wristwatch</p>
<p>&#8211; A brazilian (Nélio Nicolai) invented the phone caller ID technology (known in brazil as &#8220;bina&#8221;)</p>

		<p>Britain again:</p>

<li>
<p>The computer, as mentioned above</p>

<p>the first moving picture was shot in Leeds, West Yorkshire, though by a Frenchman (so we&#8217;re not responsible for Charlie&#8217;s Angels: Full Throttle).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>We generally talk less about the concentration camp, which we gave to the world in the Boer War.</p>
<p>Incidentally, Fox-Talbot may have taken photos of Reading, but his most famous ones were of Lacock Abbey in Wiltshire.</p>

		<p>Brazil:</p>
<p>Raymond already mentioned that, but we are taught that Alberto Santos Dumont is the inventor of the airplane. I just heard of Wright brothers much much later, and not at school.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s always hilarious watching these debates play out in Wikipedia too.</p>
<p>&quot;John Doe was an Italian-born[1] Jew[2] of Dutch[3] and Lithuanian[4] descent who was raised in Canada[5] and lived in Argentina for several years as an adult[6]. He is perhaps best known for inventing the belly-button-lint remover[citation required].&quot;</p>

		<p>For Romania, the first thing that comes to mind is the fact that we defeated the Turks over and over, and thus kept the Ottomans from raping and pillaging their way all the way to France. So we like to take credit for the survival of Western Europe.</p>

		<p>I too will make no attempt at verifying accuracy.</p>
<p>In addition to most of the above claims, I remember school instilling me with Canadian claims to wireless radio including, especially Trans-Atlantic communications in schools; the CanadArm, the Manned Lunar Lander, advanced jetfighter technology (up to the Avro Arrow), and mobile air conditioning (as in car A/C), Plexiglas, Paint rollers, a particularly useful form of commercial nuclear technology, Walkie-Talkies, and most importantly of all, Television.</p>
<p>In this field, a claim to Java is also sometimes made at higher levels of schooling.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always been fascinated by the claims to Bell&#8217;s work. &nbsp;Born in Scotland, did his major work in Canada, moved and filed for patent in the States, and insisted he would not be a hyphenated American. &nbsp;Although he spent half of each year in Canada in a place they named after their old home in Scotland.</p>
<p>A few more abstract &quot;inventions&quot; (like Democracy for the US) include:</p>
<p>Public Healthcare</p>
<p>The Universal Declaration of Rights and Freedoms</p>
<p>Peacekeeping</p>
<p>TIME ITSELF (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandford_Fleming" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandford_Fleming</a>)</p>

<li>
<p>gunpowder -&gt; ? ~1000AD, probably also invented elsewhere independently</p>

<p>paper -&gt; Cai Lun ~100AD</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>movable type -&gt; Bi Sheng ~1000AD</p>

		<p>In Israel we pretty much take credit for every invention ever made by any Jewish person in the 5000 year history of the religion.</p>
<p>Also, even though it&#8217;s not inventions, we celebrate the fact that we survived (which for us is the same as &quot;won&quot;) the wars of 1947, 1956, 1967, 1969, 1973, etc. while mostly being heavily outnumbered.</p>

		<p>Raymond, I cannot believe that you added &quot;Democracy&quot; to the list.</p>
<p>Like Pi pointed out, it was invented in Greece. ( I also don&#8217;t know what Raziel is smoking, but it must be good stuff ).</p>
<p>Greeks were building the Parthenon (which still stands today) when most people&#8217;s ancestors were living in caves.</p>
<p>Again like Pi points out, Greeks&#8217; ancestors did so much for civilisation, that modern day Greeks feel they can just put their feet up and rest (for 2-3 thousand years) :-)</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  &gt;John Locke does not get enough credit &#8211; much of the inspiration for America&#8217;s revolutionary ideas came from his writings. &nbsp;&quot;Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness&quot; is a nearly plagiarized quote of Locke&#8217;s &quot;life, liberty and estate (property)&quot;. &nbsp;The key idea &#8211; that these are natural rights &#8211; was expounded by Locke. &nbsp;He should be better known in America.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Along those lines of reasoning you might as well go back to Persia’s Cyrus the Great as an early proponent of Human Rights.</p>
<p>I wonder if Iranians claim the invention of human rights (or natural rights as Locke put it).</p>

		<p>Also, I am reminded of something that happened to me many years ago.</p>
<p>American Gate Agent: Where are you going today?</p>
<p>Me: Lester B. Pearson Airport in Toronto.</p>
<p>GA, mockingly: &quot;Lester B. Pearson?&quot; Geez, who do they name these airports after anyway?</p>
<p>Me: When he was prime minister of Canada he was instrumental in the creation of the maple leaf flag. And he was the first Canadian to win the Nobel Peace Prize, for his creation of the United Nations Peacekeeping Forces. But I know what you mean. There&#8217;s some airport in New York called &quot;John F. Kennedy Airport&quot;, which is also named after some guy who probably did something important.</p>
<p>GA: Uh, yeah. Here are your boarding passes.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s mostly a philosophical point (or even a joke&#8230; the distinction is a fine one when Discordians are involved), but the theory is it&#8217;s prevented at least a couple of devastating World Wars since the middle of last century that otherwise would have killed perhaps as much as 100 million people.</p>
<p>In any event, it&#8217;s only fair for the US to claim it as our own, regardless&#8230; basic responsibility.</p>

		<p>&quot;Canada claims the telephone because Bell lived in Canada at the time he was inventing it; seems reasonable to me&quot;</p>
<p>True, but we also claim Basketball and Superman, which were invented by Canadian guys while they were in the U.S. &nbsp;The logic is inconsistent.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d say for Sweden: The welfare state. And if outright invention is not claimed, then the claim is to the best implementation.</p>
<p>As an aside, I&#8217;d say just about every claim is bogus &#8211; inventions are based on previous progress and are always incremental. Even revolutionary discoveries such as Einstein&#8217;s are based on the current state of the art.</p>

		<p>I used to live in Hong Kong, and I could confirm what Zheng Hua said: we are taught that we invented the 4 great things: compass, paper, firepowder, movable type.</p>
<ul>
<li>Compass: in some far-away BC, originally used by a king to defeat another king in foggy area, in a form of a cart hosting a statue, which had its finger always pointing South. That is why in Chinese, compass is named &quot;Pointing-South Needle&quot;.</li>
<li>
<p>Paper: some kind of primitive form of paper existed before, but Cai invented the way to make paper out of wood, which finalized the common method of paper manufacturing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Firepowder: this story is funny. Chinese folks back then tried to make medicine (imagining they could make immortal drugs), probably using something highly flammable (like sulfer), thus after injuries, discovered firepowder. It was not made as weapon until firepowder has been introduced to western world, and Europeans improved firepowder to be suitable for military use. Then, Mongolians used it in battles, including against China (uh-oh!).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Movable Type: not much of interesting story here. However, the movable type system made by Johannes Gutenberg seemed to be an independent creation, not influenced by the Chinese system.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Something may not be really &quot;invention&quot;, but Chinese claim to have a lot of things influenced western world before European surpassed Chinese, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Math formulas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Mechanic device to observe astronomy</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Earthquake detection device (a huge jar with 8 dragon mouth holding balls. This was claimed as a Chinese invention around 200AD)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Forensic science</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Medical knowledges, notably a book about medical values of different herbs</p>
</li>
</ul>

		<p>An important question here is &quot;When determining who invented something, how much importance to you give to &#8216;making it work&#8217;?&quot;</p>
<p>For example, many people had the idea (and even prototypes for electric light bulbs before Edison &#8212; except they would all burn out in a few minutes. &nbsp;Edison&#8217;s design was the first to last long enough to be practical in use.</p>
<p>Similar with Otis &amp; elevators. &nbsp;The basic idea of elevators goes back to the Deus ex Machina of ancient Greece, but not until Otis were they safe enough to be used to carry human on a daily basis.</p>
<p>From here we can move on to the question of &quot;Democracy&quot;. &nbsp;While the US can&#8217;t claim the initial concept of Democracy, &quot;Democracy on a national level as an alternative to Monarchy after Independence through Revolution&quot; is our, and would seem to be the important part.</p>

<p>The technology for space flights was based on German rocket technology. Both Russia and US have used knowledge and researchers from Germany after WW2.</p>

		<p>@tcliu: Definitely, it is very hard to say who invented something since rarely it is totally independent and hard to determine where the new invention starts or if it is an improvement, or similar people had similar ideas.</p>
<p>Anyway, even if, why should we be proud of what people of our country did, if it weren&#8217;t ourselves how achieved it? It is not as if just having the same nationality as somebody famous says anything about yourself.</p>
<p>It is fun to argue, but not very rational nor important.</p>

		<p>In school, I never learned that Ford invented the automobile. My teachers always made it a point to note that he invented the (modern) assembly line.</p>
<p>It took the History channel to point out to me the effect the (modern) assembly line had on warfare.</p>

		<p>dghdhg,</p>
<p>The ancient chinese had solid fueled rockets (of the toy variety), but the American Robert Goddard was the first to really experiment with liquid fuel rockets. He also came up with the first practical rocket nozzle that boosted efficiencies to nontrivial percentages.</p>
<p>von Braun and his fellow Germans in Peenemunde (spelling?) certainly was the first to make longer range guided rockets. &nbsp;And it&#8217;s also true that the Russian and US space programs continued to use German expertise&#8230; indeed the US military made a special push to get to the German rocketry guys before the Russians got to them.</p>

		<p>I think the most disputed invention is the telephone. USA and Canada claim it, France has Bourseul, Germany has Reis, here in Italy we have Antonio Meucci, which is the <em>real</em> inventor, of course ;).</p>
<p>Off the top of my head, other claimed Italian inventions are:</p>
<ul>
<li>monocular (Galileo Galilei, but actually a Dutch invention);</li>
<li>
<p>the scientific method (Galileo Galilei)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Icecream, pizza, and a variety of other dishes;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>republic and representative democracy (Rome);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>nuclear fission (Enrico Fermi);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>banks;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>universities;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>motorways;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>arch (in architecture);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fresco (painting);</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>and of course all the stuff you can attribute to Leonardo da Vinci.</p>

		<p>I believe that the credit for both the first artificial satellite of Earth and the first manned spaceflight goes to Russia.</p>
<p>Also, Tetris is said to be invented by Alexey Pajitnov.</p>
<p>Funny thing is that in school I was taught the steam locomotive and radio was invented by Cherepanov brothers and Popov, respectively.</p>
<p>P.S. It should be noted that Russia conducted an experiment that involved maintaining a &nbsp;communism regime on a sixth part of the world for some 74 years.</p>

		<p>more from Greece:</p>
<p>Pap Test (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pap_test" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pap_test</a>) and the two Nobel Prizes in Literature (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgos_Seferis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giorgos_Seferis</a> <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odysseas_Elytis" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Odysseas_Elytis</a>).</p>
<p>History textbooks do not hesitate to point that Greece shaped the outcome of World War II, by repelling the Italian attack, causing thw German intervention and thus mortally delaying the invasion of USSR. Left-leaning textbooks apply the same logic to the Greek Resistance. Supposedly, the disruption of the supply lines due to the blow-up of Gorgopotamos bridge sealed the fate of Afrika Korps.</p>
<p>Needless to say that the canonical spontaneous answer is &quot;Euro 2004 Cup!&quot; :-)</p>

<li>
<p>Niels Bohr &#8211; various scientific work, can put a bit of claim on the nuclear bomb&#8230;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peter Naur &#8211; Backus-Naur notation and the Algol language. He also laid the foundation for datalogi (computing science) in Denmark.</p>

<p>I had a middle-school teacher in Houston insist that Percival Lowell &quot;discovered&quot; Pluto, and marked my test answer wrong, since I answered with Clyde Tombaugh. &nbsp;I actually knew Clyde Tombaugh, since he lived in my birth town.</p>
<p>Percival Lowell predicted its existence, and Clyde Tombaugh found it, so the question might be ambiguous. &nbsp;Mr. Tombaugh was given the opportunity to name it, and the PL in the Pluto name that he picked, is an homage to Mr. Lowell.</p>

		<p>To the Greeks who comment here: If you do this too, I ask of you &#8211; Please stop taking credit for everything all the time.</p>
<p>I was sitting on a three hour flight next to a Swede with a Greek father and all he did THE ENTIRE FLIGHT was talk about how everything was invented by the Greeks (and how the Turks suck). He even insisted that my first name (which comes from the Bible, mind you) had Greek origins.</p>
<p>Again, just to be clear &#8211; this is not a generalization of all Greeks.</p>

		<p>@alex:</p>
<p>How does Russia claim the nuclear bomb? &nbsp;That was fairly clearly a U.S. invention. &nbsp;My recollection is that Russia, while partway to independent development of the bomb, ended up taking a shortcut by copying the results from British and American scientists after the U.S. bombed Hiroshima and Nagasaki. &nbsp;There is no indication that the Soviets were particularly close to completing an atomic bomb at the time they began duplicating U.S. discoveries.</p>

		<p>Ahh&#8230; I&#8217;ll bite it. Mexico claims the invention of</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Tequila &nbsp;(hey, the Russians mentioned vodka!)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Zero: Some Indian guy already pointed to a Wikipedia article where it grants India the honor, but for all we (Mexicans) know, the Mayans where the first guys to give it a glyph (although the Wikipedia says the Olmecs did it first)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A calendar close enough to our modern 365- days Gregorian calendar (again, blame the Mayans)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Color television: In 1946, Guillermo Gonz&#225;lez Camarena sent the first color transmission that was &quot;backward-compatible&quot; with B/W TV. Other color TV demostrations were gave before (mainly, Berlin in 1939 and CBS/RCA in 1940) but I&#8217;d assume that his was the first back-compat and &quot;easy/cheap&quot; to retro-fit in cameras. I&#8217;ll also assume his transmission was using electronic color not mechanical color (since the first [mechanical] color tranmission was in 1928 by a Scottish!)</p>
</li>
</ul>

		<p>Re. Denmark: we define ourselves mostly by having lost wars against Sweden, Britain and Germany (twice &#8211; but we almost didn&#8217;t fight the last time so that may not count). Oh, and we quite fancy that &quot;hygge&quot; is our invention too.</p>

		<p>Otis, Ford, Edison, etc. are credited for inventions realized elsewhere before them for the same reason Christopher Columbus is credited with discovering the Americas: when predecessors did it, nothing changed. It&#8217;s not the original, but the seminal discovery that&#8217;s significant.</p>

		<p>England invented hooliganism &#8211; this was pioneered by Sir Reginald D&#8217;Iolanthe Hooligan of St. Evenage (1816-1862) who famously said &quot;when I come across one of the dirty unwashed lower orders, playing in the foul streets and tenements, I take it upon myself, in the name of King and Country, to smite his nasty pox ridden visage with a stout pole until he screams for mercy and begs me for forgiveness. Come and have a go, if y&#8217;think you&#8217;re hard enough. Go on I say. I will have satisfaction.&quot;</p>

		<p>The discussion above about CANADA and Superman stem from the &quot;Canadian Heritage Minutes&quot;, a series of commercials that have been airing for two decades on Canadian television.</p>
<p>Here is the list of these moments, and therefore the list of invention Canada claims:</p>

		<p>So as you can tell from that list, Canada does not in fact claim to have invented Superman.</p>
<p>It merely notes that as a moment in Canada&#8217;s history.</p>

		<p>Wow, this game really draws the crowds&#8230; :)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised nobody came up with the microprocessor, invented in the USA by an Italian engineer, Federico Faggin.</p>
<p>Also, I find amusing how the French even try to get credit for the radio, while the whole world (and the old 2000&#163; Italian banknote) knows pretty well that Guglielmo Marconi invented it.</p>

		<p>I was once having dinner with an in-law and his friends when one of the latter, a Briton referred to the occasion when &quot;the British invented longitude.&quot; Obviously this was a slip of the tongue for &quot;a practical and reliable instrument for computing longitude&quot;, but we Americans wilfully misunderstood him and gave him a hard time.</p>
<p>@Pi &#8212; why not economics, if you going for credit&#8211;Xenophon write a dialogue of that name.</p>
<p>@William &quot;Also, Iceland &#8230; was the first European country to write in it&#8217;s own language (and not Latin).&quot; Are you sure? The Anglo-Saxon dialogues mention the first Danish raids on England, which I&#8217;d have though occurred before the settlement of Iceland.</p>

		<p>The three big ones Australians (in my old school at least) actually get taught about are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The stump jump plough</li>
<li>
<p>The Hills Hoist clothes line</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bionic ear</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the above posts gives a pretty good list of inventions though.</p>

		<p>In Britain we are also proud of our failures. &nbsp;We had the second person to reach the South Pole (using the wrong equipment) and they died on the trip back. &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Falcon_Scott" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Falcon_Scott</a> &nbsp;See also Ernest Shackleton&#8217;s Endurance Antarctic voyage as another successful failure.</p>
<p>There was also that whole &quot;The sun never sets on the British Empire&quot; thing. &nbsp;The &quot;innovation&quot; in that was maintaining rule over a wide variety of countries. &nbsp;For example at its peak Britain ruled India with only 5,000 bureaucrats. &nbsp;Sadly some of the more despicable acts of history were also invented in the process &#8211; see the Boer war at the turn of the 20th century and the Malayan Emergency after WWII.</p>

		<p>For Australians there&#8217;s much more.</p>
<p>The indigenous Australians, for instance, have the boomerang and didgeridoo.</p>
<p>For Australians in general, we have the Black Box Flight Recorder (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_data_recorder" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flight_data_recorder</a>), vegemite (of course), the pacemaker, the cochlear implant, and many many others.</p>
<p>But in terms of being part of the cultural identity, I would say the boomerang and didgeridoo are big parts of the australian cultural identity, as well as Vegemite, the hills hoist and the two stroke lawn mower (also apparently an Australian invention).</p>

		<p>Piaskal: &quot;5. Maria Sklodowska-Curie&quot;</p>
<p>Laurent: &quot;immigrants are claimed by France (e.g. Marie Curie)&quot;</p>
<p>Funny thing, names are. In Poland we are taught her name was Sklodowska-Curie (maiden first, then husband&#8217;s), everywhere else she is known simply as Curie. I thought until today it&#8217;s our issue, we are wrong, she used her husband&#8217;s name, enough already, right? Well, no: today I saw Nobel Prize diploma (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Dyplom_Sklodowska.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Dyplom_Sklodowska.jpg</a>). Obviously she used the double name herself. Yay! We are not such chauvinist after all&#8230;</p>

		<p>we turks claim to have invented yoghurt. &nbsp;one turkish minister even claimed that it was &quot;the first case of genetic engineering in history&quot;. although two things are highly disputable, in my opinion: that the people who invented it were turks in the modern sense, and the stuff they invented was yoghurt in the modern sense.</p>

		<p>* His point is probably that a-bombing Japan ended the second world war much earlier than it would have otherwise, and that the balance of terror during the cold war deterred full-scale land wars. &nbsp;</p>
<p>This argument ignores that reasoning from and about counterfactuals is inherently nonsensical.</p>
<p>* Canada claims the telephone because Bell lived in Canada at the time he was inventing it; seems reasonable to me.</p>
<p>* Canada is also proud of that robot arm on the space shuttle, aka the CANADARM. After all, that&#8217;s what the space shuttle is _for_ &#8212; moving stuff around with that arm! &nbsp;What else could it be for?</p>

		<p>New Zealand was also first with universal women&#8217;s suffrage.</p>
<p>And we were the first non-US country to successfully defend the America&#8217;s Cup (but not <em>everyone</em> here thinks that&#8217;s a major contribution to humanity)</p>

		<p>Back in &#8217;99 I was on the wrong side of the pond and happened to go to the Avoncroft Museum (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.avoncroft.org.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.avoncroft.org.uk</a> &#8211; if you haven&#8217;t been to Avoncroft and you live in the UK or your current meatspace coordinates include bits of the UK, run, don&#8217;t walk to your nearest BritRail terminal and go there) where they have (had, at least) a great exibition on telephones (Yes, they have a TARDIS). &nbsp;The caretaker took great delight in informing me that the automatic telephone switch was invented by an American Undertaker in Kansas City, MO (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strowger_switch" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strowger_switch</a>).</p>
<p>That has to be the greatest American invention (because we can call you to tell you than we&#8217;re going to drop an Atom bomb on you, or invade your country, or deny your request for military assistance, whereas before it would come as a surprise).</p>

		<p>New Zealand:</p>
<p>Often claims flight, pre-dating the Wright brothers by a gentleman called Richard Pierce.</p>
<p>I think this claim is genuinely thought to be possibly the truth.</p>
<p>Peter Jackson (The LOTR Director), sort of diluted this by using Pierce&#8217;s flight as the central tenant of his movie Forgotton Silver which is a spoof historical movie that purports all sorts of New Zealand &#8216;we did it first&#8217; moments.</p>
<p>A highly entertaining movie that fooled a lot of people apparently, but sad if it does indeed dilute debate about Pierce vs Wright Brothers vs whomever else.</p>

		<p>Alexander Graham Bell was Canadian. He was born in scotland, however, he spent a large portion of his life in NS, Canada. He was definitely not american in anyways.</p>
<p>On another note, the great Indian mathematician, Aryabhatta invented the &#8216;0&#8217;&#8230;without which there wouldnt have been any binary math or computers or anything which depends on software :o))</p>

		<p>Accomplishments of France as taught to students, or that students end up believing:</p>
<p>* Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen</p>
<p>* Radio (Edouard Branly)</p>
<p>* The United States (Lafayette)</p>
<p>* Microcomputer (Micral)</p>
<p>* TGV</p>
<p>* Vaccination (Louis Pasteur)</p>
<p>* Steam engine (Denis Papin)</p>
<p>Naturally of lot of this conveniently ignores history, e.g. the Magna Carta, Bill of Rights, Shinkansen, etc.</p>
<p>As is typical, immigrants are claimed by France (e.g. Marie Curie), but French people who emigrated still count (e.g. Beno&#238;t Mandelbrot, Philippe Kahn).</p>
<p>Chauvinism sucks :-(</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m surprised not to see World War Two on Raymond&#8217;s list.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s something most Americans seem to end up believing that *their* country alone won. Like several entries on the original list, of course reality isn&#8217;t that simple, but I&#8217;d definitely say it belongs on the list of things that Americans are taught to be proud of, much more so than, say, Ford.</p>
<p>As for us, in Denmark, I suppose I&#8217;ll have to say the vikings. Looting and pillaging most of Europe, and getting to America hundreds of years before Columbus. Again, of course, bits of this is disputed, but it is probably the most noteworthy thing students are taught to be &quot;proud&quot; of here. (Proud of how big and powerful we were, controlling most of Britain, and besieging Paris, not so much of what we did. Nailing people to church doors probably isn&#8217;t something most people would be proud of&#8230;)</p>
<p>And like Roger said above, we&#8217;re also quite proud of some of our failures. Like, say, losing one of the greatest navies in Europe to the English, and having them burn down our capital afterwards, (And then to recover, planting huge forests to build new ships from in the long term&#8230;. just when people start building ships of metal instead of wood), and of course losing huge chunks of lands to Germany and Sweden 100-150 years ago.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, and C++! Bjarne Stroustrup is from Denmark. So is the guy who invented PHP (as if that&#8217;s something to be proud of), and while we&#8217;re at it, C#&#8217;s Anders Hejlsberg&#8230; And some of the people behind Standard ML too.</p>

		<p>Norway; apart from the cheese cutter thing and the binder I guess we&#8217;re the most proud of our national day (17th of May) where all the kids in Norway attend huge parades. Not a lot of countries celebrate their freedom with a non-military parade.</p>

		<p>&quot;Which, in the spirit of bold claims, reminds me that we also invented monotheistic religion :P&quot;</p>
<p>Umm, nope, you didn&#8217;t. It was a guy named Akhenaten, pharaoh in Egypt (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhenaten" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akhenaten</a>) who wanted to snatch power from the high priest. Also the babylonians did something in that direction with Marduk who received the roles of all other gods at some point. Jews know these guys well, there were being enslaved in their respective countries.</p>
<p>As every human discovery this is based on previous state of the art :).</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s worth pointing out that Aussies will cheerfully claim any Kiwi Inventor/Discoverer as Australian. </p>
<p>&quot;What, you mean Sir Edmund Hillary *wasn&#8217;t* Australian?&quot; </p>

		<p>@Pi: &quot;The sad thing is that my compatriots often think they are cool by default because of these things and they don&#8217;t have to accomplish anything by themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>That is the whole point of chauvinism. You can forget you own crappy self by taking refuge in the group.</p>
<p>@Omer van Kloeten: &quot;He even insisted that my first name (which comes from the Bible, mind you) had Greek origins.&quot;</p>
<p>No problem there. The christian bible was, in a large extent, invented by Greeks.</p>

		<p>The one that always sticks in my mind for Northern Ireland is the airplane ejector seat. I don&#8217;t know how accurate it is but it&#8217;s esoteric enough to be memorable. Certainly I imagine not many people think of anything constructive about NI.</p>

		<p>More for the U.S.A.:</p>
<p>Maybe not so much &quot;democracy&quot;, as &quot;Freedom&quot;. Nobody was ever &quot;free&quot; anywhere in the world before 1776; and anybody outside the US who happens to be &quot;free&quot;, is only so because of US intervention.</p>
<p>We tend to think that the Emancipation Proclamation and 13th amendment ending slavery in the US was a major advancement in civil rights for the whole world; forgetting how many countries (that is, most of them) had already abolished slavery by then.</p>
<p>American schoolchildren are not (or at least in my day they were not) generally taught who invented television; I&#8217;m not sure why.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure that by now, we claim the Internet.</p>
<p>Inventions also tend to be claimed by ethnic groups within the US. George Washington Carver inventing peanut butter is generally taught during Black History Month. Native Americans are said to have invented federalism.</p>

		<p>Countries? How about small towns?</p>
<p>White River Ontario (population 841) proudly claims to be the origin of Winnie-the-Pooh. Umm&#8230; wasn’t A. A. Milne born, lived, and died in England? Yes, but the fictional Winnie-the-Pooh was named after his son Christopher Robin Milne’s teddy bear, which was named after Winnie, a live bear in the &nbsp;London Zoo, which was donated to the Zoo by Harry Colebourne, who brought the bear overseas from White River, naming it after his hometown of Winnipeg, so clearly the origin of Winnie-the-Pooh is White River. Or Winnipeg.</p>
<p>I believe Port Wing Wisconsin (population 404) claims to have invented the school &quot;bus&quot; (it as was horse-drawn cart), at least for Wisconsin. You take what you can get.</p>

<p>Other UK claims:</p>

<p>Gravity</p>
<p>Going very fast in a car</p>
<p>Monty Python</p>

		<p>The British invented time. Or more accurately, Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) and accurate clocks to measure it with. But the achievement was not inventing it; the achievement was getting the rest of the world to adopt it as well.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harrison" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Harrison</a></p>
<p>The silly thing about a lot of these claims is that two people in different locations often invented the same thing completely independently of each other. As such a number of things were genuinely invented by a number of different countries.</p>

		<p>Norway, always at the forefront of scinece &amp; technology, does of course have a number achievments. The most important of which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The paper clip (&quot;Binders&quot;) &#8211; Johan Vaaler [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_clip" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_clip</a>]</li>
</ul>
<p>A much better paper clip had already been invented in Britain, but he still managed to much of the credit, even though not one of his paper clips was actually manufactured.</p>
<p>The paper clip still managed to become a nation symbol for Norway, and was worn during WWII as a symbol of resistance to the German occupation and in support of the King and exiled government, since the King&#8217;s initials had been banned.</p>
<p>Digressing further, a middle school in Tennessee, USA started a project, called The Paper Clips Project [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Clips_Project" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paper_Clips_Project</a>], &nbsp;to collect paper clips in an effort to illustrate the huge number of victims in the holocaust. The paper clip was apparently chosen because thhe inventor, Johann Vaaler, was a jew, and because it was worn in support of Jews during WWII. Vaaler was not a Jew, he did not invent the paper clip, and it was not worn in support of the Jews. But hey, don&#8217;t let the facts ruin your day.</p>
<ul>
<li>The Cheese slicer &#8211; Thor Bj&#248;rklund [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_slicer" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cheese_slicer</a>] Yeah, that&#8217;s right. A slicer fot the all-important cheese. Now that&#8217;s something to be proud of.</li>
</ul>
<p>Some other notable achievments are:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Aerosol Spray &#8211; Erik Rotheim [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol_spray" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aerosol_spray</a>]</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Outboard mtoor for small boats &#8211; Ole Evinrude [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outboard_motor" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outboard_motor</a>] Born in Norway, but lived in the USA from the age of five.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simula &#8211; Ole-Johan Dahl &amp; Kristen Nygaard [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simula</a>] The first object-oriented programming languages.Hugely influential. &nbsp;Need I say more?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brunost [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunost" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brunost</a>] Known in Sweden as &quot;mesost&quot; and North America as &quot;gjetost&quot;. The norwegian name literally means &quot;brown cheese&quot;, oviously referring to its color, while the North American term means &quot;goat cheese&quot;, although the cheese is not necessarily, and usually only partly, made of goat milk.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Scream &#8211; Edvard Munch [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream</a>] A series of world-renowned paintings that has been featured extensively in popular culture, most notably the &quot;Scream&quot; horror movies by Wes Craven.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Modern Skiing &#8211; Sondre Norheim [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sondre_Norheim" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sondre_Norheim</a>] The founding father of modern skiing, innovated the skis and popularized disciplines such as slalom and telemark skiing. We proudly proclaim to be born with skis on our legs, yet few actually know how to use them properly. I guess proficiency is not hereditary. It follows naturally that we also must have a female population with very flexible &quot;nether regions&quot;, although I have never heard anyone (proudly) proclaiming that.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Hardingfele &#8211; (Ole Jonsen Jaastad, 1651) [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardingfele" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardingfele</a>] Also known as hardanger fiddle, it is pretty much a normal fiddle, but with an extra set of resonating strings.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Abel-Ruffini Theorem &#8211; Niels Henrik Abel [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini_theorem" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abel%E2%80%93Ruffini_theorem</a>] The theorem proves that there is no general solution to fifth-degree and higher polynomial equations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>First to reach South Pole and Northe Pole &#8211; Roald Amundsen [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Amundsen" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roald_Amundsen</a>] He was the first to reach the South Pole and, in contrast to Britain&#8217;s Robert F. Scott, actually survived the return to also be the first to reach the North Pole and even return safely from that expedition. There are three previous claims for first arrival at the North Pole, but they are all very much disputed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discovery of America &#8211; Leif Eriksson (son of Eirik the Red) [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leif_Eriksson" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leif_Eriksson</a>] As far as is known. Ofcourse we know for sure.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nynorsk &#8211; Ivar Aasen [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nynorsk" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nynorsk</a>] The second official standard language of Norway, created by Ivar Aasen by studing the various Norwegian dialects. This was done because of a dislike of the first official standard language, Bokm&#229;l, which is based on the Danish language. And ofcourse noone wants to be associated with the Danes. The language is still only used by ~10% of the population, but is taught to everyone nonetheless. For some strange reason, no other nation ha laid claim on the creation of this language.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Troll [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll</a>] Although the Troll is from Norse mythology, we do flaunt it as if it belongs to us. This probably has a lot to do with its popularity in old folk tales, but boosted by Asbj&#248;rnsen &amp; Moe&#8217;s folk tale collection that helped to preserve and popularize the tales.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Peace [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Peace_Index" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Peace_Index</a>] We proudly lay claim on the invention of peace, since we have a history of neutrality and have been given the task of awarding the Nobel Peace Prize, happily disregarding the fact that Alfred Nobel is Swedish of course. Our history of neutrality might be explained by being so easy to invade, and not so much that we are plain old pussies. We did put up a hell of a fight during WWII, but unofficially.</p>

		<p>Getting English spoken throughout the world wasn&#8217;t so hard when you consider the one-time size of the British Empire &#8211; without that it would probably have been much harder. I seem to recall reading that the decision in the US over whether to speak English or German was decided by only one vote, though I assume that wasn&#8217;t a referendum.</p>
<p>As for curry, wasn&#8217;t that invented by the British Army when posted overseas as a way of disguising the awful taste of the various items they had left to cook?</p>

		<p>So far, I see at least 4 countries claiming the light bulb as their own: the UK, Canada, Russia, and the United States.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the thing with inventions. &nbsp;They tend to evolve in small steps. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not clear at exactly what step the invention occurred. &nbsp;I think all the later claims depend on Swan&#8217;s idea of using an evacuated glass bulb, the Russian claim is independent of the Canadian and American work, while Edison purchased a Canadian 1874 patent and incorporated some parts of it into his (much improved) design.</p>

		<p>SeaDrive: Canada claims basketball because Dr Naismith was a Canadian. &nbsp;He was living in Massachusetts when he invented it, though. &nbsp;So which country should get the credit, under the Official Rules of National Pride in Inventions?</p>

		<p>Hmmm&#8230; It just occurred to me, a life-long resident of New Jersey (one of the 50 United States for the less geographically aware), we can claim many of the inventions of Einstein (who spend much of his life at Princeton), Edison (&quot;The Wizard of Menlo Park&quot; &#8212; a town which is now known as Edison, NJ&quot;) <em>AND</em> those of AT&amp;T/Bell Labs.</p>
<p>(Musically, we are home to Count Basie, Bruce Spreingsteen, and Frank Sintra &#8212; &quot;The Count&quot;, &quot;The Boss&quot; and &quot;The Chairman of the Board&quot;.)</p>

<p>This bring up another point&#8230;. Can you claim an invention for your country, if you essentially chased the inventor out of it?</p>

		<p>Just to clarify on Niels Bohr, who I consider the greatest dane to have lived, he is often refered to as the father of quantum physics. He won the Nobel Prize in physics in 1922.</p>
<p>Also related; &#197;ge Bohr, his son. He won the Nobel Prize in physics 53 years after his father, in 1975.</p>
<p>But usually, we&#8217;re just overlooked here in little Denmark.</p>

		<p>@Lol Lolovici, first off, we&#8217;re talking about claims, rather than fact.</p>
<p>However, for the sport in it, I&#8217;ll rebut: Wikipedia places Akhenaten of Egypt at the 14th century BC and Marduk of Babylon at the 18th century BC, while Abraham (first Jewish person) is placed at the 19-20th century BC.</p>
<p>Still, this far back, we can&#8217;t be sure about anything.</p>
<p>@Alex, see my previous post, in which I stated that New Testament claims don&#8217;t apply to me, since I&#8217;m Jewish. :)</p>
<p>@Mango, in the spirit of the post, why not? :D</p>

		<p>Chicken Tikk Masala was invented in the UK (by imigrants, based on traditional concepts mixed with British tastes)</p>
<p>Web/http &#8211; Tim Berners Leee, most certainly English. Though, he did invent in at CERN.</p>
<p>For a lot of these &quot;he was born here, but because he lived here he&#8217;s ours&quot; arguments. I would take the nationality(-ies) of the inventon *at the time of invention*. So, Bell, for example, will have had at least dual nationality.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t believe no one else has pointed out that the English invented, well &quot;English&quot; as a world language. England is a fairly small country, yet we got our language to be spoken, pretty much everywhere in some form or another. </p>

		<p>&#8212;-&quot;Also, Iceland wrote the first book on grammar,&quot;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Only out by around 1,500 years. Panini&#8217;s Sanskrit Grammar came out in the 4th century BC, and in it he refers to earlier works.</p>
<p>Joseph Needham, author of the monumental &#8216;Science and Civilization&#8217; in China, once gave a talk in a don&#8217;s room on the History of Alcohol. Me and my mate turned up, partly because we rightly divined there&#8217;d be free alcohol given out after the talk.</p>
<p>And yes, it turned out that alcohol was invented in China as a result of leaving fermented drinks out in the snow so the alcohol formed because of the different freezing points.</p>

		<p>&#8212;-&quot;As for curry, wasn&#8217;t that invented by the British Army when posted overseas as a way of disguising the awful taste of the various items they had left to cook?&quot;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Curry was simply the name the Brits gave to certain of the Indian sub-continent&#8217;s dishes.</p>
<p>And the food in India would have been top class, as it is now.</p>

		<p>The cotton gin is important because before it raising cotton was really labor intensive which made cotton a high end product.</p>
<p>Because of the labor requirements only large plantations could raise and process it. &nbsp;After the cotton gin cotton quickly became a common product that it still is today; it is far better then wool undies. &nbsp;Cotton because the product of the south and with large sales all over the world.</p>
<p>On the bad side with the lower laber requirements it because possible to raise cotton in smaller farms. This caused slavery to expand and probably lengthed the time that US slavery was around.</p>

		<p>In Ukraine we are proud of some Russian Empire/USSR achievements (that Ukraine was part of) like victories in wars against Napoleon and WW II. There are lot of war heroes that are Ukrainian.</p>
<p>Also some main guys behind Soviet Space and Nuclear missiles programs were Ukraine or worked in Ukraine. Examples:</p>
<p>Sergey Korolyov (head constructor) is Ukrainian;</p>
<p>Mikhail Yangel one of main competitors of Korolev is Russian but worked in Ukraine (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuzhnoye_Design_Bureau" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuzhnoye_Design_Bureau</a>). Famous R-36 (SS-18 Satan in NATO terminology) was created in this design bureau;</p>
<p>Yuri Kondratyuk (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Kondratyuk" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuri_Kondratyuk</a>) whose calculations and ideas were used in Apollo program is Ukrainian.</p>
<p>Also we are often taught that Igor Sikorsky is Ukrainian</p>
<p>Among things that we are proud of as an independent country only one came to my mind. The Constitution by Pylyp Orlyk that is claimed to be the first constitution in Europe (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Pylyp_Orlyk" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constitution_of_Pylyp_Orlyk</a>)</p>

		<p>@George Jansen:</p>
<p>&quot;why not economics, if you going for credit&#8211;Xenophon write a dialogue of that name.&quot;</p>
<p>Dang! If I had read about it, I forgot. I also hoped Greeks wouldn&#8217;t be (partially) responsible for this because I hate economics. I will never become rich but then again I am proud of doing a real job ;-)</p>
<p>@Omer:</p>
<p>I suggest you watch &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot;. You will love the family&#8217;s father and as a bonus you will learn about new applications of Windex or whatever it&#8217;s called.</p>
<p>@everybody else:</p>
<p>I forgot about newer Greek achievements like</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>the dance of Zorbas</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>soundtrack of Conan the Barbarian and eh&#8230;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>most smokers and car accidents in Europe?</p>

		<p>Also in Russia and Ukraine we are proud of our humour. There is one old joke on related theme that was popular in USSR.</p>
<p>People from different countries gathered to boast of their inventions.</p>
<p>Dutch comes out and says: “We invented thing that gives you ability to see distant stars as if they were near! It is called telescope”</p>
<p>Italian comes out in and says: “We invented thing that gives you ability to see very small things as if they were big! It is called microscope”</p>
<p>Russian comes out in and says: “And we invented thing that gives you ability to see everything through 3-foots concrete wall! It is called window.”</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m a bit late to all of this, but @JeffRobertson, I&#8217;m hoping you were being tongue-in-cheek when you said:</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe not so much &#8220;democracy&#8221;, as &#8220;Freedom&#8221;. Nobody was ever &#8220;free&#8221; anywhere in the world before 1776; and anybody outside the US who happens to be &#8220;free&#8221;, is only so because of US intervention.&#8221;</p>
<p>because I&#8217;d imagine lots of nationalities would claim to be free before 1776. For example, here in the UK we&#8217;d claim 1215 as the date (the Magna Carta), and as for the Ancient Greeks&#8230; </p>
<p>The latter are a good comparison because just like the US, they had a very large slave population who clearly weren&#8217;t free. My grandmother was Swiss, and she always claimed the Swiss invented democracy, so I&#8217;d imagine the Swiss would also claim freedom.</p>
<p>On another note, why haven&#8217;t any Italians claimed the alphabet we&#8217;re all using to comment here?</p>

		<p>As the cradle of humanity, in Kenya we &#8216;invented&#8217; homo sapiens. Stone tools and cooking fires soon followed. However the inventors migrated soon afterwards and we are left with one of the highest levels of politicians per capita in the world, we have even begun exporting them &#8211; Obama</p>
