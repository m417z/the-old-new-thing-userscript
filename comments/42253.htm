		<p>I can warmly recommend using Visio and its &quot;Windows User Interface Template&quot; for a very good compromise between speed and structure. Making changes in a user interface is almost as fast as drawing, and leaves a clean document you can actually use as part of the system specification when you and the customer have reached an agreement. It works just as well for web interfaces. We use it all the time.</p>
