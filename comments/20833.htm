		<p>I had a hunch that your line &quot;Of course, now that I told you how to do it, I have to tell you that this is not how to do it.&quot; was misleadingly bogus. That was exactly how to do it, the way anybody would have interpreted &#8216;it&#8217; in that context.</p>

		<p>What if somebody removes the Hidden and System attributes on the recycler folder?</p>

<p>I disagree about it being expected, at least from a high-level perspective. &nbsp;The question was how to skip over Recycle Bin folders. &nbsp;If I remove the attributes, the folder is still a Recycle Bin folder (my deleted files still get moved there) yet it will not get skipped over using this method.</p>

		<p>Whoops. &nbsp;I should have said the question was how to skip over &quot;weird&quot; folders. &nbsp;Removing the attributes from the recycler folder does not remove the &quot;weirdness&quot; associated with the folder.</p>

		<p>Yes, but you guys are now talking about doing weird things, that normal users probably don&#8217;t normally do. &nbsp;Why would you want to remove the hidden attribute from the Recycle Bin folder, especially if you know enough to know how to do it? &nbsp;There&#8217;s already several ways to see inside it without changing its attributes.</p>

		<p>Nope, but the hidden file attribute is INTENDED to hide folders that the typical user doesn&#8217;t need to know or care about. &nbsp;This fits the customer&#8217;s definition of &quot;weird&quot; pretty well.</p>
<p>The system attribute is intended to mark system-critical files that should be hidden as allowing the user to do stuff to them could make their system unstable. &nbsp;This might also be part of the &quot;weird&quot;.</p>
<p>If the hidden file attribute is removed, we can&#8217;t do much about that. &nbsp;Basically we have here a simple and easy solution that will cover 98.9% of cases. &nbsp;For 0.1% (hidden file attribute removed by a program without user consent) IMO the work that would have to be done would not be worth the effort to clean up someone else&#8217;s mistake (I can&#8217;t see it being intentional). &nbsp;The last 1% would be if the attribute was intentionally removed by the user, in which case it&#8217;s likely they did it on purpose and would expect and want the folder visible for whatever reason.</p>

		<p>Windows is sending some mixed messages about indexing. I have &quot;Show hidden/system files&quot; turned on in Explorer. If I right-click the Recycler folder and select Properties, then click Advanced, it has a check next to &quot;For fast searching, allow Index Server to index this folder&quot; even though both hidden and system are enabled for that folder.</p>
<p>Also, by default XP&#8217;s &quot;System Volume Information&quot; folder that holds restore points is ACLed so that not even administrators can get into it. You can change that, of course, but it also serves as a barrier to an indexer that might ignore the hidden/system bits.</p>

		<p>The problem with this approach is that there&#8217;s nothing preventing &quot;non-weird&quot; directories from being marked hidden&amp;system. &nbsp;Sure, there aren&#8217;t any by default, but I certainly wouldn&#8217;t want to exclude from my indexing any data that (e.g.) malware was attempting to hide from the user, and I&#8217;ve certainly seen malware using this strategy in the past.</p>

		<p>Jules: &nbsp;I think, by definition, all directories marked Hidden and System are &quot;weird&quot;. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretend we have a new attribute, called &quot;Weird&quot;. &nbsp;Any directories with this attribute set are therefore weird and should be skipped by user code. &nbsp;Now, nothing will prevent malware from marking its data as Weird. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You have just moved the problem, and you don&#8217;t gain anything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re back to this: everything marked Hidden and System is &quot;weird&quot; by definition. &nbsp;The fact that malware can mark itself as Hidden &amp; Ssytem is a different problem, which is not easy to solve, but it doesn&#8217;t make this approach wrong.</p>

		<p>What should I consider directories that have only one of the hidden or system attributes set?</p>

		<p>This memo needs to go to the Windows Media Player team since v11 of the player keeps returning to index the Recycle Bin.</p>

		<p>The real wtf is that the developers probably went into Windows Explorer and said to themselves, &quot;Hmm. &nbsp;Let&#8217;s just untick &#8216;hide system and hidden files&#8217; to see what sort of stuff is hidden from us. &nbsp;Oh, yes! &#8211; lots of things we don&#8217;t want turning up in our product&#8217;s scan&#8230; &nbsp;Now, I wonder how we can figure out if we have one of these hidden, system files ourselves&#8230;&quot;</p>

		<p>Dave: Why shouldn&#8217;t you be able to search the Recycle Bin? &nbsp;Makes sense to me.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you delete a folder with documents you think you don&#8217;t need any more, but there&#8217;s one file in there you forgot you put there. &nbsp;You go looking for that file later, but can&#8217;t remember where you put it.</p>
<p>So you use search. &nbsp;Since the Recycle Bin is indexed, you find it and are able to save it (yay!).</p>
<p>The Recycler folder may be intended to be hidden from the user, but the files in it certainly aren&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>You see this in many support roles.</p>
<p>People often fail to come to you with the actual problem to be solved. &nbsp;They&#8217;ve started down the blind alley of some random solution candidate and only ask for help in that blinkered context.</p>
<p>At least this seems to me to be the point Raymond is making here. &nbsp;Obvious? &nbsp;Yes. &nbsp;So why all of this discussion? &nbsp;Nod and move on.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s my computer. If I want to search a hidden or system folder, that&#8217;s totally my right. Give me a search tool that searches these places. And don&#8217;t dare tell me what I should and shouldn&#8217;t look at.</p>
