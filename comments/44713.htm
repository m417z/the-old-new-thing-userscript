		<p>So many Steve&#39;s, Steve Jobs, Steve Ballmer, but actually, Sinofsky isn&#39;t one of them. ;)</p>

		<p>Makes you wonder how many levels are between Raymond&#39;s manager and his group president, as Raymond certainly is a senior software architect or something. Can you count that number on one hand?</p>

		<p>Not having served in a branch of the military, I cannot verify the story, but presumably drill instructors would wear long underwear on sweltering hot days so their charges would think they never broke a sweat. &nbsp;Maybe Sinofsky did something similar. &nbsp;Or maybe it was nanotech &#8212; who knows? </p>

		<p>It lets me wonder: Since this is one-on-one meeting, if the room is that hot, why wouldn&#39;t he just change to another room? A corporate president should be able to get a spare room quickly. Have a meeting in a sweating-hot room doesn&#39;t sound productive at all to me.</p>

		<p>I suppose Sinofsky&#39;s office was too far away for something like &quot;Hey, you wanna continue in my office while send for a team to check out the AC?&quot; Or maybe they needed something from this manager&#39;s office?</p>

		<p>Note that at any point as the temperature was rising it would have been fine had the subordinate got up and objected to the temperature of the room. Just like many of the Sinofsky underlings could have raised more questions during the win8 cycle. I was there, many people knew the crummy tablet and the crummy app platform were going to fail hard. But few could say very openly that the emporer had no clothes. Meanwhile there is very little honor in sitting in an overheated room.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t know about Microsoft&#39;s campus, but maybe there are a few conference room on each building, like those for individual team briefing?</p>
<p>It seems very useful to me for having conference room of 4 people&#39;s size with projector.</p>

<p>As someone who grew up in a warm, often humid, area, one of the tricks you learn is that cotton underclothing will keep you cooler especially when soaked in water or sweat. For the same reason, you should never wear cotton during outdoor activities in cold weather climates (such as where I live now) unless you enjoy hypothermia.</p>
