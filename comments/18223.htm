		<p>I&#8217;ve had my office phone crash twice on me. As in, it was just sitting there, then it made a weird beep and shut off. And both times, the contacts and call log were wiped out. So either the phone has no non-volatile memory (dumb) or there&#8217;s a worm going &#8217;round that eats IP phones for breakfast.</p>

		<p>On my previous mobile phone, I noticed that after using the radio (FM broadcast), battery charge would be used up fairly quickly, even though I well and truly stopped the radio (or so I thought, anyway).</p>
<p>Power-cycling the phone returned it to normal.</p>

		<p>When I worked in support, we had a period of time where our phones would reboot every 30 &#8211; 45 minutes. &nbsp;This made dealing with customers interesting: &quot;I&#8217;d like to take a moment to let you know that our phone systems have been experiencing periodic failures that can result in our call being dropped. &nbsp;If this happens, I will call you back as soon as possible.&quot;</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not just phones. I now routinely have to reboot my Dell docking station (unplug all USB inputs and power), my newish KVM switch &#8212; same deal, you have to unplug all USB inputs and its power, which is a huge pain on a 4 port dual DVI switch &#8212; and my wireless router, which at least reboots when you remove and reinsert the power plug.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve had plenty of crashes on mobile phones as well as occasional misbehavior by my IP handset at work; what irritates me most is that any time the phone is rebooted, my call history is lost. Voicemail&#8217;s stored on the server end, but the call log is apparently stored only in RAM. There is certainly some Flash memory of some sort in there, but used only for firmware (which can be remotely updated), not for logging purposes. On the bright side, it does have some new features which are quite nice: my old analog handset lacked Caller ID, voicemail and a built-in phonebook, as well as conference calling. Some features are even easier to use: picking up another extension involved dialling some obscure code (*6 or something like that?) &#8211; now, it involves pushing the &#8216;pickup&#8217; button.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on the fence regarding the new handsets really: they&#8217;re nice, and an improvement on what we had before &#8211; but eye-wateringly expensive, at a time we really can&#8217;t afford to be spending any more than necessary.</p>

		<p>We use IP phones at work. &nbsp;I&#8217;m tempted to switch to a SIP client on my workstation and get a bluetooth headset, instead. &nbsp;Cheaper, cleaner, and I might even get around to tweaking the software to have the features I want, with less of the pain of navigating multiple levels of tiny menus to get to a particular subset of the contacts list.</p>

		<p>Rebooting a phone may be bad, but at my old job we had to get a technician in to do a firmware update to fix the fancy device in the kitchen that dispensed boiling or chilled water depending on the button you pushed. You know technology has gotten out of control when your taps need their software updated.</p>

<p>My Samsung Omnia runs Windows Mobile, and I never have to reboot it. &nbsp;Unless I leave it unplugged for a couple hours, anyway. (But that&#8217;s usually a side-effect of being in poor-signal areas or leaving the phone, Bluetooth or WiFi radios enabled when I don&#8217;t need them.</p>

		<p>As a fan of SciFi and general progress, I actually see this as a good sign.

<p>Our old phones had F-010 connectors, which is quite standard in France.</p>
<p>Moreover, the phone wire was plugged onto the wall, rather than the wall wire plugged in the phone, so that, shaking the phone couldn&#8217;t unplug it!</p>
<p>However, I&#8217;m now used to the nice features of new IP phones: Caller ID, LCD interface, conference mode.</p>

		<p>I remember a time at MS when the local DHCP server was running at about 100% with all the devices on the network. We had a power outage in the building and when it came up every IP phone was hitting the DHCP server and brought to a crawl.</p>
<p>It took DAYS before all the phones in the building were back online.</p>

		<p>There was an old joke about a toaster designed by a committee of engineers, which would include a 4-bit microprocessor, able to save preferences for each family member, etc&#8230;. of course, it would be more prone to failure than a standard &quot;non-electronic&quot; toaster.</p>
<p>Last week I was in a store and their fancy toasters had momentary contact buttons with LEDs in the buttons. &nbsp;I presume there was some sort of curcuit board that controlled the LEDs and the toaster. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think a toaster needs a microprocessor, personally&#8230;</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  but in a few decades the technology will have matured and stabilized, and we will live in a better world with no more reboots but far more possibilities than we can even dream about now.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Thanks to MS, reboots are now tolerated. I didn&#8217;t used to have to reboot my phone, and finding a Broadband router that didn&#8217;t die every few days was a challenge. Reboots will go away when we demand it and not a day before.</p>

		<p>For completeness, I must point out that the phone Raymond&#8217;s coworker had to reboot runs Windows (CE). &nbsp;Is this any surprise?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>For the record, this was one of the pre-Tanjay phones, so no, it wasn&#8217;t running Windows CE. Thank you for making up facts. I&#8217;ll try to return the favor someday. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I recently had to reboot my Motorola Razr cell phone. &nbsp;Everytime I called my wife I got *MY* voicemail: &quot;Please nter your password&#8230;&quot;.</p>
<p>I ended up having to turn it off, take the battery out, wait.. wait&#8230; wait, insert battery and power on and only then did it start letting me call my wife again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry.. I called her something nice.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Our old phones had F-010 connectors, which is quite standard in France.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Never seen that type before. A bit of googling turns up the we (the dutch) also use a quite uncommon connector. (google for &#8216;dutch telephone plug&#8217;, I can&#8217;t even find a type number). Usually, these plugs convert to an RJ-11 socket. I don&#8217;t think these kinds of connections are still used in new installations, AFAIK we use standard RJ-11 nowadays.</p>
<p>Office buildings and office phones usually use 8P8C so you can patch any wall outlet as either ethernet or phone.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Moreover, the phone wire was plugged onto the wall, rather than the wall wire plugged in the phone, so that, shaking the phone couldn&#8217;t unplug it!
</p></blockquote>
<p>8P8C connectors lock into place, you have to press a little plastic tab to remove it. Unless you have a broken connector, it should not be possible to shake it loose during normal usage. Also, in my experience most phone cords can be detached on both sides. (both the phone and wall socket have an RJ-11 or 8P8C connector and you use a patch-cable to connect the phone to the wall).</p>

		<p>You guys are talking about soft reboots. When my cell phone (which runs S60 OS) sticks on something I have to take out the battery before it will let me play with it again. Poor thing.</p>
<p>Usually happens when I don&#8217;t disconnect internet properly, which I sometimes use the cell phone for connecting the PC to internet. Go figure.</p>
