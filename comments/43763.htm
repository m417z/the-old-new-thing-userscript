		<p>Huh? This is well known in math, is called arrangement. And the formula is in form : A(k,n) = n(n&minus;1)â‹¯(n&minus;k+1) = n!/((n&minus;k)!). See wiki, is simple and clear. And to not be confused with combinations of (k,n) where the formula is: C(k,n) = n!/(k!*((n-k)!))</p>

		<p>There is this two sentence summary: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Arrangement.html">mathworld.wolfram.com/Arrangement.html</a></p>
<p>It mentions that when order isn&#39;t important (indistinguishable balls, like you mentioned) that you use a combination (like you described) to calculate the number of &quot;arrangements.&quot;</p>

<p>It does use the term arrangement, but there&#39;s no A(k,n) notation involved. It uses the same method as Raymond. I am interested in the recipe from the example at the end.</p>

<div class="post">[<em>That&#39;s not fair. You said &quot;wiki&quot;, so obviously I ignored links on wordpress.com.

There is only one way to distribute 2 balls into 2 boxes (namely, put one ball in box A, and one ball in box B). But your formula gives 2!/(2-2)! = 2, which corresponds to the two ways of arranging two distinguishable balls from a set of two (namely, AB and BA). -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>For n = k = 2, there are three distributions: 0+2, 1+1, 2+0</p>
<p>The formula, based on stars and bars, is (n+k-1)!/n!/(k-1)!</p>

		<p>@Al Go, Oh no, the ratings are slipping? That&#39;s not good, Raymond you need to keep those key demographics interested or else they&#39;ll start reading other blogs. I hear middle age women are what all the networks are after these days. Obviously that means this series should be replaced by one about knitting.</p>

		<p>How about a compromise: &nbsp;come up with real world examples instead of balls and boxes. That way it would seem more practical. I&#39;ve had it up to here with balls.</p>

		<p>@Al Go:</p>
<p>The thing is, these things while not seemingly practical can be used in other, more advanced algorithms.</p>
<p>For this particular combinatorial problem, you can use the principle in hashing algorithms. There are other interesting things, like the pigeonhole principle and the birthday problem which can appear. While not seemingly useful immediately, they all give a certain insight into situations that can arise in algorithm design.</p>
<p>So if I was to hazard a guess at what Raymond is trying to do. He is writing posts on how to solve these problems. If you don&#39;t know what the problem is though, you would go out and search for it, find the reason why you should know it in CS and feel enriched. That is speculation on my part though.</p>

		<p>@Crescens2k</p>
<p>Many of us can&#39;t learn a concept without some practical application presented, so merely presenting the theory isn&#39;t terribly educational.</p>
<p>Same way you can&#39;t learn to be a developer by merely reading some listings, really. You have to actually write code for practical purposes.</p>

		<p>@Anon:</p>
<p>And that is where the other part of someone working in CS comes into it. If you don&#39;t know something, research. These posts don&#39;t seem to be about really teaching the theory behind the problem either. Which is why I speculate that the thing that Raymond is doing is bringing to light these problems, so people become aware of them and go ahead and look them up.</p>
<p>Also remember, if you were to present this as a practical application, in such a small post it would most likely lose a lot of information. Also, as I said, they give insight into a problem and not end up being directly applicable. In fact, if you look at it another way, these are the practical application of the problem.</p>
<p>So, where do I get off on saying that. Imagine you have say 10 bins side by side, and you throw 10 balls into the bins, the probability of a bin containing more than 1 ball is not 0. The little code snippet is a way to generate different combinations at runtime. So how does this apply to an algorithm? Well, if you hash something with a finite set of possible output values (i.e. int32), the probability of a collision is not 0, and should be uniformly random if you have a good uniform hashing algorithm.</p>
<p>Theoretical problems usually use a real life example to study, but then apply it somehow to an algorithm. Like for hashing, you wouldn&#39;t really care too much about going around throwing balls at bins (or boxes) at all.</p>
