		<p>2 points for George ;)</p>
<p>A quick search on myself reveals 2 cell phone hits, which from the carriers could be my current and previous cell #s. &nbsp;It also gets 8 other cell hits. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In residential, there&#8217;s what could be my current home phone #. And 3-5 previous phone numbers (the Tacoma and Seattle hits could be someone else, but could also be me, misfiled). &nbsp;And, again, other residential hits.</p>
<p>So, a bit like search results everywhere &#8211; loads of hits, need to check each one out. $15 for the #s of the whole results lists might be reasonable. &nbsp;$15 each? &nbsp;Please.</p>

		<p>This is the sort of shady tactics that the Data Protection Act here in the UK was designed to prevent. (In particular, data may only be used for the original purpose for which it was collected and may not be disclosed to third parties without the individual&#8217;s consent.)</p>
<p>Of course, last I heard the opposition party were advocating scrapping it in the name of cutting red tape.</p>

		<p>today I&#8217;ve found &#8216;spock&#8217; a site that agregates information from linkedin, facebook and other places, on everybody.</p>
<p>try it..</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.spock.com/Raymond-Chen" rel="nofollow">http://www.spock.com/Raymond-Chen</a></p>
<p>and read the scary Wire article about it</p>

<p>They say you can remove your information from the web if you don&#8217;t want it on their site. But isn&#8217;t it on their site forever once they found it?</p>

		<p>It is my recollection[1] that, similar to faxes, it is illegal to make unsolicited commercial calls to cell phones, because there is a direct cost to the person receiving the unsolicited call. &nbsp;In that case, could we[2] start a class action lawsuit against them as an accessory to illegal phone spamming?</p>
<p>[1] And I may be completely wrong about this, in which case, disregard.</p>

		<p>I would expect cell phone spamming to be illegal because the user has to pay to receive the call, so direct market advertisers attempting to do so can be sued (they can be sued anyway).</p>
<p>But lets assume that this service is legitimate. Lets say I want to reconnect with an old friend from college by the name of Sara Smith, and I pay $15 for this service and call all the cell phone numbers for all the Sara Smiths they give me, but Sara Smith being a common name, I don&#8217;t actually get the right one. Then I&#8217;m out $15 and I voted with my wallet for a service which didn&#8217;t end up being helpful, and in doing so, I cost a bunch of people a couple of cell phone minutes.</p>
<p>Some ideas are just plain inconsiderate. I can&#8217;t imagine this service is useful enough of the time to justify the ridiculous price tag.</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8230;in what backward country do they charge people to receive phone calls?&quot;</p>
<p>Right here in the good &#8216;ol U.S. of A&#8230; and I like it!</p>
<p>I honestly believe that if cell calls were free to receive, I&#8217;d have as much problems with telemarketers as I do at home, even with the Do Not Call lists.</p>
<p>It just so happens that my phone plan gives me enough included minutes that I don&#8217;t usually &quot;pay&quot; to receive calls. If I received enough telemarketing calls though, I will pay 45 cents/minute and I will be PISSED OFF.</p>
<p>The pay-to-receive method doesn&#8217;t stop all junk: recently I&#8217;ve been getting junk SMS (text messages) offering &quot;cheap software&quot; &nbsp;The sender # is blocked and my phone company refuses to tell me who sent it.</p>
<p>In America, nothing is respected until it has a dollar value assigned. The time it takes for me to receive a junk call is not respected unless there is a dollar amount attached. Then the 45 cents to receive a call can be wielded against the telemarketer as a &quot;property rights&quot; violation (or whatever the proper legal theory is)</p>

		<p>For cell phones, in the US you pay for the minutes you use, whether they are incoming calls or not. &nbsp;For a land line, you only pay for out-going long distance calls.</p>
<p>In Australia do people have to pay more when they call a cell phone than when they call a land line?</p>

		<p>mccoyn: yes, significantly. Calling a mobile (called a mobile here, not a cell) and you&#8217;re looking at about 30c/30sec, whereas a landline is around the district of 20c, untimed.</p>

		<p>You don&#8217;t get it. &quot;Get over it&quot; doesn&#8217;t mean &quot;you should not happily hand out your information now&quot;. It means &quot;Nobody will protect you. You are on your own. Learn to behave in such a way as not to disclose anything of importance. Remember there&#8217;s *likely* always a camera/microphone/etc. trained on you.&quot;</p>
