		<p>And when was it added? During a 2000 SP? In XP? When the function moved to crypt32.dll with 2003?</p>
<p>Was it added because of TS/RDP reasons or something else?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>It was added while the function was still internal. I don&#39;t know why it was added. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@skSdnW Win2003 = WinXP x64 = WinNT 5.2</p>
<p>For what i recall from Delphi Win32 API project, it was moved and given name in Vista. In XP/2003 it only had a number index, not a public name</p>

		<p>&quot;The memory block returned by the CryptProtectMemory function can be decrypted only on the same machine that encrypted it, and only as long as the machine has not been rebooted&quot;</p>
<p>This line only is about &quot;SAME_LOGON&quot; option. In &quot;same windows instance&quot; aka cross-process mode the function works across reboots.</p>
<p>SAME_LOGON is just a bad, ambiguous constant name, it can stand for both &quot;SAME_USER_IDENTITY&quot; and &quot;SAME_USER_SESSION&quot;, the latter obviously cannot survive reboot.</p>
<p>An obvious consequence of this fuction being internal one that occasionally leaked out and after found used by 3rd party applications eventually published &quot;as is&quot; without a lot of effort to document it</p>
<div class="post">[<em>&quot;Typically, you use the CryptProtectMemory function to encrypt sensitive information that you are going to decrypt while your process is running. Do not use this function to save data that you want to decrypt later; you will not be able to decrypt the data if the computer is restarted.&quot; This is in the general discussion, not in the SAME_LOGON section. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Looks like my theory #2 from the old thread was essentially correct =^-^=</p>
<p>“Theory 2 (IMO more likely): dwFlags was originally intended to be a flags parameter, but now doesn&#39;t really mean &quot;flags&quot;. &nbsp;Only one flag was defined at first, CRYPTPROTECTMEMORY_CROSS_PROCESS. &nbsp;Eventually, the meaning of dwFlags morphed into meaning &quot;scope&quot; rather than &quot;flags&quot;. &nbsp;The absence of the former &quot;flag&quot; had to be given a name, hence CRYPTPROTECTMEMORY_SAME_PROCESS. &nbsp;The same-machine scope was left as the former flag&#39;s name, CRYPTPROTECTMEMORY_CROSS_PROCESS. &nbsp;The new functionality was added as CRYPTPROTECTMEMORY_SAME_LOGON.”</p>
