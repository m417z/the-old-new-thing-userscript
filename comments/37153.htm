		<p>It only checked the time once an hour? So if I turned on my computer at 11:50 PM, it wouldn&#8217;t know to update the date until 12:50 AM. So if I looked at the date at 12:05 AM or 12:30 AM, it would be wrong. Is this true?<br /></p>

		<blockquote><p>
  &gt; With that clock rate, 2^32 ticks equals approximately 3600 seconds, which is one hour. (If you do the math it&#8217;s more like 3599.59 seconds.)<br />
  <br />&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />
  <br />er..um&#8230; Funny, when I do the math, it&#8217;s more like 3604.48 seconds.  And it&#8217;s 2^16 (55ms) ticks.</p>
<p>Also, I think you&#8217;re missing an important point.  The timer could be set to tick at any rate with a 0.83ms granularity.  If the countdown value was set to 59578 instead of 0 (65536), then it would have ticked at 50ms (a much more sensible 20 times a second) than at the awkward 55ms (18 times a second, except every 5th second, when it ticked 19 times).</p>
<p>That would have made the date rollover check happen every 54 minutes, instead of every 60 minutes, but that wouldn&#8217;t be a problem.</p>
<p>But, it would have cause a 10% increase in the number of timer interrupts, with a corresponding 10% increase in the time spend handling them.  Since the original PC was quite slow (by today&#8217;s standards at least), IBM tried to squeeze as much performance out of them as possible, by making the clock tick as slow as the chip would allow.

		<p>G. Man</p>
<p>I believe that is true, but remember, the original PC didn&#8217;t have a battery-operated clock as more recent PCs do.  The reset to midnight (on, as I recall, 1-Jan-1982) when you turned it on.  You then had to set the time &amp; date manually, if you cared about them being right.  Most people didn&#8217;t bother, so most of the time, the clock was wrong anyway.</p>

		<p>&quot;So if I turned on my computer at 11:50 PM, it wouldn&#8217;t know to update the date until 12:50 AM.&quot;</p>
<p>Obviously you do some work to set the initial conditions so that the check occurs on the hour.</p>

		<p>Actually, the original PC had a 14.318180 MHz crystal. This frequency was chosen because it&#8217;s useful for generating composite video for the CGA adapter.</p>
<p>This frequency was divided by 3 in hardware for the CPU clock (the 8088 wanted a clock that was high for 1/3 of a cycle, and low for 2/3 of a cycle). The CPU clock was further divided by 4 in hardware to feed the Intel 8053 timer chip, which couldn&#8217;t run at 4.77 MHz.</p>
<p>Someone at IBM (in their short-sighted wisdom) decided to program the clock chip to divide the input frequency by 65536 (the maximum possible), then interrpt the CPU. This resulted in about 18.2 interrupts per second (or about 55 milliseconds between interrupts.)</p>
<p>At this frequency, there would be 1573042 interrupts per day.  The original IBM BIOS got it wrong, and reset the counter to zero after 1573040 ticks.  Various clone vendors got it wrong and programmed the timer chip to interrupt after 65535 ticks instead of 65536 ticks.  Generally, people didn&#8217;t notice these issues because the crystals weren&#8217;t that accurate anyway.</p>
<p>Anyone who used the BIOS calls (INT 14) instead of the DOS calls had to convert these weird tick counts to seconds themselves.  Many programmers had simply memorized the number 18.2 ticks per second (which is just an approximation), resulting in yet more error.</p>
<p>Overall, life would have been better if IBM had originally programmed the timer to interrupt after 59659 hardware ticks. This would have produced an interrupt 20 times per second, which would have been more convenient for everyone, with very little change in performance. (Isn&#8217;t 20/20 hindsight wonderful?)<br /></p>

		<p>It&#8217;s silly, but I&#8217;m hoping the timing will work out to make it possible for some vendor to offer a 4.77GHz &#8217;25th Anniversary Edition&#8217; PC in 2006.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s amazing how far and how fast we&#8217;ve come.  The thought of CPUs in the single digit MHz range or having to use a TV because a monochrome monitor was too expensive is laughable by today&#8217;s standards.  I guess in 20 years I&#8217;ll be flabbergasted that I ever used a computer under a terahertz. :)<br /></p>

		<p>As Jim Lyon pointed out, the original PC had no real-time clock chip, so upon booting, a stock PC had no idea what time it was. It was common in those early days to start your AUTOEXEC.BAT with a DATE command, which would ask the user to input the date and time. By default the date was set to 1/1/1980 (not 1982), which is a Tuesday, a fact I&#8217;ll never forget because of seeing &quot;Tuesday, January 1, 1980&quot; displayed about a million times.</p>
<p>I am 98% sure that Mr. Hsia&#8217;s account of the reason behind 55ms is correct, and the fact that 2^16 (not 2^32) ticks works out to ABOUT an hour is coincidence. I never worked at IBM, but I did work at Compaq and Dell in the early days, and this was the common wisdom amongst that circle of engineers. Also, I (hazily) remember an interview in Byte an IBMer from the original PC design team, and I believe he confirmed the origins of 4.77 and 1.19 as being convenient divisions of the 14.318 MHz crystal already necessary to drive the video circuitry.</p>

		<p>I make it 3599.59 seconds too:</p>
<p>x = 1.19318MHz = 1.19318 x 10^6 ts^-1;</p>
<p>y = 2^32 t = 4.294967296 x 10^9 t;</p>
<p>y / x ~= 4.2/1.1 x 10^3 s;</p>
<p>How do people get that 2^16 ticks makes an hour?</p>

		<p>2^16 ticks of the 55ms timer makes an hour.  According to Google:  (1 hour) / (2^16) = 54.9316406 milliseconds</p>

		<p>Interesting story but mostly this explains why DOS ran the timer at 55ms not why Windows 95 did. Of course, by the time Windows 95 came around we had to deal with everyone and their brother reprogramming the clock for their own purposes and assumming that no one else was doing the same thing in some other vm out of their sight &#8230; thus vtd was born but that&#8217;s another story.</p>

		<p>Why does NT run the timer at 10ms when you&#8217;ve got one processor, but at 15ms when you&#8217;ve got multiple processors (physical or virtual)?</p>

		<p>the 1.19..MHz was not chosen because of the division ratio to 1 hour, that&#8217;s just a coincidence. nor was it chosen because of cheapness &#8211; in large quantities it doesn&#8217;t matter if you order 1.19 or 1.234 MHz crystal. it was chosen simply because 3.579545 MHz (and sub/multiples) are one of the most common crystal in the world (even today), and it&#8217;s simply easier to get them (order a 3.579545 crystal from a manufacturer &#8211; you get it the next day. order a 3.500000 MHz crystal &#8211; you have to wait like 5-7 weeks to delivery). 3.579545 is the color subcarrier frequency of NTSC. divide by 31 and you get 115200 (RS232 baud rate). multiply by 4 and you get 14.318180, the main clock source in the IBM PC (Jim Lyon is correct). read about NTSC color subcarrier to understand why this frequency was chosen (the short story: because of its low interference with the monochrome TV signal).</p>

		<p>@ashwin: 2^32 has been a common value for far longer than win32 has existed.  16 bits can only cover 64k of RAM, and 32 is the next larger number in that sequence.  Notice that nobody ever talks about 24 bit processors.</p>

		<p>The early Amigas had a similar arrangement. The oscillator runs at ~28 MHz, the pixel clock runs at half or a quarter of that depending on screen mode, the processor runs at a quarter of that, the memory bus runs at an eighth, the colour clock runs at some other fraction I don&#8217;t remember, and the &quot;E-clock&quot; used by 6800-style chips runs at a fourtieth. The programmable timers are in two VIA chips connected to the E-clock and the OS sets one of them to a sensible 1/50 second (or the best approximation it can manage, anyway). A lot of regular interrupt handlers are connected to the vertical blank interrupt, though, making them dependent on the screen mode. Some people made the mistake of using that for music play-routines.</p>
<p>Sorry, this is really quite irrelevant, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

		<p>@Ben</p>
<p>I&#8217;d been resisting mentioning the Amiga, but now you&#8217;ve broken the ice I&#8217;ll carry on&#8230;  The odd thing about the Amiga was that while everything was based on multiples of the NTSC colour clock, the PAL/SECAM colour clock is almost 1MHz faster than NTSC, so the 7.14MHz CPU clock seemed a bit arbitrary for us Europeans.  We could have easily got away with running at 8MHz (like the Atari ST), but for some reason those crazy hippies didn&#8217;t think of it.  (Even the A1200 ran at 14MHz, long after saving a couple of pennies on a crystal was relevant.)</p>

		<p>Mat: There&#8217;s a delicate balance between audio, floppy, and video DMA timing that a significant change to the custom chips&#8217; clock frequency will upset. As for the CPU, in general a 68000 hits the memory bus every 4 processor cycles, so as long as the video display is set to low-res (140ns pixel clock) with &lt;=4 bitplanes or high-res (70ns pixel clock) with &lt;=2 bitplanes then Agnus and the 68000 use alternate memory cycles and the CPU hardly ever has to wait. If the processor frequency is just slightly higher then the connection from the custom chips to the CPU bus becomes more complicated for no gain: the CPU just spends more time waiting.</p>
<p>The A1200, however, is a botch job. Until you add some fast memory (for non-Amiga-users that&#8217;s memory that isn&#8217;t controlled by the custom chips), the CPU is running at about half speed thanks to memory contention. The underclocking of the CPU really makes little difference. You really need to expand it to get it running reasonably fast, and since it only has one expansion slot you may as well get an accelerator rather than just expanding the memory.</p>

<p>&gt; Notice that nobody ever talks about 24 bit<br />
<br />&gt; processors.</p>
<p>Hmm.  Question to the history channel, were there any?  I used a machine where 24-bit integer arithmetic required bignum algorithms on two 12-bit words, but I don&#8217;t recall any native 24-bit words.</p>
<p>12/2/2004 10:25 PM Qbeuek</p>
<p>&gt; AFAIK 80286 had 24 bit physical address<br />
<br />&gt; space &#8211; you could address up to 16MB of<br />
<br />&gt; physical RAM in protected mode :-) </p>
<p>The address space is separate from the integer value space.  The 80286 still provided machine instructions to do arithmetic on 8-bit or 16-bit values.  Subsequent versions added 32-bit and 64-bit but not 24-bit operands.</p>
<p>Regarding address spaces though, the IBM 360 also had a 24-bit physical address space.  The top 8 bits of a register did not participate in addressing, so software used them for other things, mostly the single top bit but some used others among those bits too.  The size of the address space didn&#8217;t change whether protection was used or not.  There actually were some models without protection &#8212; that was kind of like having multiple concurrent users logged into Windows 95 or 98 and letting them corrupt each other&#8217;s memory besides just letting them corrupt the kernel&#8217;s memory.</p>

		<p>There have been a ton of native 24-bit processors.  It&#8217;s an extremely common word size for audio and video processors.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Notice that nobody ever talks about 24-bit processors.</p>
<p>One of the first machines I seriously programmed (in the 1960&#8217;s) was a CDC 3100, with 32K of 24-bit words. Each word was split up into 6-bit characters; the character encoding bore no resemblance to ASCII (and only represented a single case of characters.)</p>
<p>The machine had 2 general-purpose 24-bit registers and 3 special-purpose index registers. (I forget, but the index registers may have only been 15 bits wide.)</p>
<p>When addressing words, the low 15 bits formed the address of a word of memory, and the next bit was (usually) an indirect bit. If set, the machine interpreted the contents of the addressed word as a new address and indirect bit. (This means, for example, that it was possible to create an infinite loop within a single instruction. Since interrupts only happened after an instruction completed, the only way out was a hard reset. But I digress.)</p>
<p>It also had the ability to address individual characters for some instructions: the low 15 bits of a 24-bit word described which word in memory, and the high 2 bits described which character in the word.</p>
<p>Ah, the good old days.<br />

		<p>Accuracy is how close you are to the correct answer; precision is how much resolution you have.</p>
