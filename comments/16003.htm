		<p>Yes, you are absolutely right! &nbsp;And they offer plaques with the cover page of the patent application on it as well. &nbsp;I know this from personal experience.</p>
<p>This is so similar to &#8216;vanity publishing&#8217; that I think they prey on the inventors. &nbsp;Of course, that brings up the whole &#8216;invention support&#8217; industry (&#8216;let us shop your patent to major companies&#8217; etc) that most regulators and such warn are useless.</p>

		<p>You get the same kind of junk when you start a non-profit association. Yeah sure, I will buy a fax for my new non-profit association when we don&#8217;t even have a regular room to meet in.</p>

		<p>Best part of that first link is that his patent wasn&#8217;t granted (or even not granted) when he wrote the post. It was given the final rejection this past June as being obvious.</p>

		<p>&quot;You get the same kind of junk when you start a non-profit association.&quot;</p>
<p>Or when you register a for-profit corporation :)</p>
<p>I also registered a trademark, and have received numerous scam mail asking for payments of $2000 (+ or &#8211; any number of your choice) to be registered in some kind of international business catalog. The letters aren&#8217;t even clever &#8212; they&#8217;re littered with grammatical and spelling errors, and don&#8217;t even offer to send you a copy of the catalog. You&#8217;re just promised that you&#8217;ll be added to some kind of online database.</p>

		<p>Great, something to look forward too. &nbsp;I have to go to the Post Office to get my mail since I live so far out in the sticks. &nbsp;I tend to not get there as often as I should. &nbsp;Can&#8217;t wait for them to start scolding me more for having an over stuffed box&#8230;.. Maybe it would be better if the patent is not approved&#8230;.</p>

		<p>Similar thing happened when I was in a car accident one time. &nbsp;The very next day I had mail from a lawyer. &nbsp;The day after that I had letters from dozens more lawyers, body shops, and chiropractors. &nbsp;Some included a copy of the police report (I guess to make me think it was something official and not an advertisement?).</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m curious aren&#8217;t there also numerous &quot;offers&quot; from patent trolls and other sleazy types to buy the patent so they can add it to their portfolio?</p>

		<p>Yes, so true!</p>
<p>I actually applied for a patent and then left the company (on good terms) a couple years later. I had totally forgotten about it when I got an offer for a framed copy of the patent, and realized what it was. So I called the company and told them about it, and they actually sent me the patent-bonus even though I didn&#8217;t work there anymore. I miss that company!</p>

		<p>&quot;I was there because my wife had just delivered our brand new baby boy: Beckett Ethan Chambers (his initial spell his name, just like his 3 older brothers).&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just one step away from naming your child with a recursive acronym :-)</p>
