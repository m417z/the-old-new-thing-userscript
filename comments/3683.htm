		<p>What about adding a MessageBeep so they know when they are doing something &quot;wrong&quot;</p>

		<p>@skSdnw,</p>
<p>Pressing the button does nothing, so it isn&#39;t interesting to them. They would rather play with the letters. If it made noise, and if they&#39;re anything like my kids or any others I know, it would quickly become their favorite button.</p>

		<p>@Jon: If you are worried about the sound you could probably flash the background color or something, and yes, if it is _only_ for fun there is no point but learning to use computers/Windows at the same time cannot hurt&#8230;</p>

		<p>&gt; Well, that was awfully anticlimactic, wasn&#39;t it.</p>
<p>Like a spark following the dynamite fuse through the blasting cap and then nothing.</p>
<p>The disappointment leaves you feeling unsatisfied and want to redo it with 3 sticks to make up for the bad one and compensate for the disappointment the first one left you with.</p>
<p>Will there be more parts this week?</p>
<p>Feeling unsatisfied and unable to relieve yourself with equal satisfaction is frustrating.</p>
<p>Like have just watched a flashback filler episode of a good sci-fi tv series. As the credits appear you are left feeling cheated and made a fool of by getting hyped up from the previous episode.</p>
<p>Leaves you with words that would make a censor work for its paycheck.</p>
<p>Tried to do a Stephen Fry word rant and failed.</p>

		<p>@WndSks:</p>
<p>Playing a beep or flashing a Windows teaches only &quot;Don&#39;t touch that button!&quot;, which is not very instructive if your goal is to teach a little about how to use the computer.</p>

		<p>How about matching the hash of a dictionary that, if a word in the dictionary is inputted, it&#39;d change color?</p>

		<p>JJJ: Have you never seen a toy for a small child? It seems like most toys have no point but to beep or flash when you press some button. If you make a special button that causes a beep or a flash, kids will push that button all day.</p>
<p>If you think that making the beep more annoying will make them learn not to press the button, you&#39;re wrong &#8212; it will only make them push the button more frequently!</p>
<p>And if it were me writing the program, I would make it as boring as possible. If it&#39;s too fun, kids will want to play it constantly, never letting me use my own damn computer. If they end up fighting over it, there&#39;s the risk it could be caught in the cross-fire. The key is to NOT turn the computer into a game.a</p>

		<p>This disables the context menu completely, instead of just the context menu key. It also blocks right-click, and Shift-F10. It&#39;s possible and easy enough to modify this to still allow the context menu to be used with the mouse by checking lParam. If the keyboard is used, the mouse coordinates are reported as (-1, -1), and the message can be suppressed. Otherwise call DefSubclassProc. If Shift-F10 needs to be allowed too, some other approach is needed, probably looking at the keyboard messages. Although, allowing right-click while disallowing the context menu from the keyboard makes sense to me in a few situations, but allowing Shift-F10 while disallowing the context menu key does not.</p>
<p>(I realise that this won&#39;t be necessary for what you have in mind, and blocking the context menu entirely won&#39;t be a problem for you. I&#39;m not trying to suggest it is.)</p>

		<p>The lesson here is &quot;80% of your time will be taken by 20% of the unexpected mid-term requested/required features&quot;.</p>
<p>Imagine if you didn&#39;t know about WM_CONTEXTMENU, a very plausible situation when you haven&#39;t read the whole Win32 reference. What would be your first approach?</p>
<p>Perhaps most people would be interested in muffling the input that pops the context menu, to only find out later that there&#39;s a message dedicated to do it, and now you&#39;ll roll back and replace all that hard work with two lines.</p>
<p>Of Course™, this wouldn&#39;t happen had you read the whole introductory section &quot;About Menus&quot;.</p>
