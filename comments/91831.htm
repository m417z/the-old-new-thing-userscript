		<p>Obviously I&#39;m missing something, because to me it seems like the right thing to do is use the icon specified in the RegisterClass call. Is the issue just that if you need to combine multiple windows then you don&#39;t know which class to pull the icon from?</p>

		<p>Gabe: Which RegisterClass call? You may have multiple classes of windows grouped together, each with their own icon.</p>

		<p>&gt; The executable itself is buried off in the Program Files directory, which nobody should be messing with anyway, so who cares if it has an ugly icon there?</p>
<p>It might even not be the same executable. The executable in the Start Menu, with the nice icon, might be a windowless &quot;launcher&quot; which loads the correct executable from the Program Files directory (and which actually shows the windows).</p>

		<p>I would have thought that in the case of multiple classes of windows grouped together, a heuristic like &quot;pick the one of the window class that was registered first&quot; or the like would work better than &quot;find a icon of a shortcut in the Start Menu&quot;. Though I&#39;m sure it must have been considered, and the Windows compatibility team finds programs much stranger than those I deal with regularly.</p>

<p>My mental model of the taskbar says that it doesn&#39;t have access to the shortcut that launched the applications, it only stores a list of executable paths (of the current top level unowned windows). So the way it gets icons is that it searches for shortcuts by executable path in the order described in the post. By the time an application gets to the taskbar, a reference to the shortcut that launched it is no longer available, so you&#39;ll get weird icons in the scenario you described if the window-showing .exe has the wrong icon.</p>

		<p>&gt; &quot;pick the one of the window class that was registered first&quot;</p>
<p>Which would be the splash screen on a lot of applications. And I don&#39;t think I have ever given my splash screens an icon. So we would be back to the start of the problem.</p>

		<p>Anyone who uses the MFC icon *demonstrably* doesn&#39;t care what their application looks like, so why bother to prettify them? With hindsight, it would have been better if the App Wizard had not included a default icon. This would have meant that all the people who don&#39;t care would have a null icon, which is both efficient and easily detected by external processes (like Explorer).</p>
<p>So, um, back to work on the time machine I guess.</p>

		<p>By &quot;pick the one of the window class that was registered first&quot;, I meant of the windows currently in the group. Presumably the splash screen wouldn&#39;t be in the group very long, and even if it were, it presumably had an icon in the taskbar in the pre-combined-windows days?</p>

		<p>I have a hard time imaging why someone would put something other than the icon for the main window first in the EXE&#39;s icon list; except for some old 3.1 era programs where the first icon of an exe was not obvious. (I&#39;ve got exactly 1 example of getting a bad icon that way, and that was in fact the reason. Confused the heck out of me until I happened to notice it was a 16 bit exe.)</p>

		<p>I wonder if this is why the icon for Command Prompt windows sometimes changes to an icon from some other random application. Random Application must add a Start Menu shortcut that runs cmd.exe (with some parameters, to run its batch file or whatever) and with its icon. And the taskbar must just pick the first shortcut it sees that runs cmd.exe. I would&#39;ve thought it would prefer the one with no command-line parameters.</p>

		<p>&quot;It so happens that Explorer already has to keep track of every shortcut on the Start menu and on the desktop, because it needs to keep track of any hotkeys registered by those shortcuts&quot;</p>
<p>Does Microsoft know how many people use this functionality?</p>

		<p>I would have said &quot;at the time you&#39;re combining the taskbar items, look at the icons that would be displayed if they weren&#39;t combined. If they&#39;re all the same (which seems like the 99% case), then just display that icon. &nbsp;If they&#39;re different, have some heuristic for choosing one: most common, or leftmost, or rightmost, or whatever.&quot; &nbsp;Surely that would be easier than scanning all over creation for an icon.</p>
<p>Or maybe just don&#39;t combine the items on the taskbar if the buttons are different. I doubt users mental model includes the concept of which EXE each window is tied to, so if two windows of the same process have different icons, most users probably don&#39;t expect them to be combined anyway.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Actually, comparing icons is hard. (What if one is a 32&#215;32 icon, and another is a 48&#215;48 icon; now you have to do fuzzy math.) As I noted, Explorer is already scanning shortcuts anyway, so the icon is basically free money. (And I&#39;m not sure you want to combine only identical icons. It means that, for example, your Inbox and an open message are not combined. Chat windows are combined only if the other party has the same online/offline state. And if a counterparty goes offline, it <span style="text-decoration:underline;">changes groups</span>. &quot;I can&#39;t find my chat with Bob. It was here just a second ago.&quot;) And all your MFC apps get grouped together, even if they are unrelated. It also means that the groupings are continually being recalculated. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Getting it from the start menu or desktop sounds fine to me. After all, that&#39;s going to be the most recognizable icon for your program &#8211; it&#39;s the thing people click on to run it!</p>

		<p>I think you accidentally answered a question I&#39;ve had for years. &nbsp;I&#39;ve long known about the hotkey feature, but never used it. &nbsp;I always wondered though how it could possibly work. &nbsp;After all, how is the poor computer to know if in some dusty corner of the hard disk is a shortcut with a hotkey? &nbsp;It never occurred to me that it only works if the shortcut file is on the desktop or start menu. &nbsp;In retrospect, it seems like a rather good idea: it works with all the shortcuts the user is likely to care about, and you don&#39;t have to pay for a full disk scan. &nbsp;Thanks for the accidental enlightenment!</p>

		<p>Using a non-runtime icon resolution also has the consistency advantage: </p>
<p>The icon used for pinned applications will be the same as the icon used in grouping.</p>
<p>I too think the current implementation was the best way to go.</p>
