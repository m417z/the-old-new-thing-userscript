		<p>If you think about it from the perspective of the implementer of FreeLibraryWhenCallbackReturns, that&#8217;s the only possible way it could work.  That function has no idea whether it&#8217;s being called from the beginning or end of your callback function â€” it can&#8217;t be inspecting the call stack to be making some kind of decision (well it *could* try to do that, but that&#8217;s a terrible idea and will break, and then what it would decide to do?).</p>
<p>The only thing it can reasonably do is queue up work to be executed later, so it doesn&#8217;t matter if that work gets queued earlier or later in the execution of your callback.</p>

		<p>In theory, the state could be kept in some ephemeral thread-local state (like GetLastError) which gets wiped out by certain intervening calls. But yeah, the obvious place for the state is in the PTP_CALLBACK_INSTANCE.</p>

		<p>Does it only free the first or last one you register? If it&#8217;s the last then it can get wiped out by intervening tasks, i.e. if you call into a component that calls it without you knowing.</p>

		<p>@smf:<br />
The documentation doesn&#8217;t specify what happens if you call it twice, so the behaviour is quite literally undocumented.<br />
There is a comment stating that it raises a structured exception though. Even though that is implementation defined behaviour, that really shows that it is an invalid situation to begin with.<br />
Anyway, depending on the situation, a component messing around with thread pool related stuff without you knowing is dangerous.</p>

<p>As a software developer you are always at the mercy of someone else who got a bonus by making something work, no matter the consequences. Who do you think your bosses respect more? The guy who got the bonus or the guy who complains that he can&#8217;t get any of his changes to work now.</p>
