		<p>I live in Cambridge (UK), where a lot of people cycle, and it is a generally accepted rule that you should spend as much on your lock as you did on your bike :)</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve got one of the speakers and its great for travelling, or just around the house. I get around 3 months use, at about 15 minutes per day playing spoken word podcasts, before it needs a recharge. And the blue LED on the base is so bright it doubles as a torch. The standard mini USB socket to charge it also commends it. On the minus side, the battery is captive, but the cost of the whole unit doesn&#39;t make that too bad a drawback.</p>

		<p>If you spend the same on your lock and your bike, you either have a ridiculously expensive lock or a 10-year-old bike from a garage sale. &nbsp;There&#39;s nothing wrong with riding an old beater bike; that&#39;s what I do when I need to park in public places. &nbsp;But my nice bike gets parked in an indoor rack at work with a cheap lock; I figure an opportunistic thief would just grab one of the other bikes that isn&#39;t locked at all, and a dedicated thief would steal the bike regardless of the lock I used.</p>
<p>The difference between a cheap lock and an expensive lock is what, 30 seconds?</p>

		<p>@JS</p>
<p>In reality you just need a better lock than the bicycle parked next to yours. &nbsp;I also live in Cambridge and the bicycle theft significantly skews the crime figures &#8211; spending 10-20% of your bicycle cost on the lock is considered prudent.</p>

		<p>I believe the proper formula for a bike lock is that its weight should vary inversely with that of the bike. In other words, if you have an extremely light bike, it&#39;s very expensive, so you need a heavy chain/lock to protect it. If you have a cheap bike, it will be rather heavy, so you only need a lightweight chain/lock to protect it.</p>
<p>The corollary is that all bikes in New York City weigh 40 pounds.</p>

		<p>I like the nested &quot;Microsoft tries not to hire dishonest people&quot;. Over time this could become something like a Choose Your Own Adventure story.</p>

		<p>I currently can&#39;t find my bike lock keys, so I just hang my bike at work and drape one of those locks people leave behind over my bike. Looks like it&#39;s locked.</p>

		<p>@Chris Lineker</p>
<p>&quot;Locks only stop honest people.&quot;</p>
<p>The corollary to that is &quot;that locks only buy you time with the dishonest people&quot;.</p>
<p>ie. a good quality lock will take more time and effort, than a cheap lock.</p>
<p>Thus encouraging thieves to move along to the next (easier) target.</p>

		<p>Heh, this reminds me of the time when I got back from university, stepped off the bus, walked to my bike and found that someone had stolen the lock (but not the bike).</p>

		<p>During college, I got back to my dorm one day and left my bike unlocked. I was inside only for a few minutes, but during that time someone had stolen it (pretty unusual for our town, lots of people don&#39;t lock anything). Three months later I happened to see it parked at the student union bike rack, and it still had my lock locked to the frame for storage. So I took it back.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t have it long after that. Had a freak accident where I went off a curb going at most two miles per hour and my rear wheel tilted a bit, part of the drive mechanism spoke-jammed it, and parts snapped and the tire popped. I can&#39;t imagine what the person who stole it did to it. Thankfully it was only a $60 bike to begin with.</p>
