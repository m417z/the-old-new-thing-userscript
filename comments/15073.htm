		<p>Long-term and the temporary most likely refer to different things.</p>
<p>For example, the parking provided may be long-term (typically more than day) but the land use may be temporary (as opposed to permanent.)</p>
<p>The purpose of the notice is to draw your attention to more detailed documents which are no doubt available for inspection, not to be a free standing explanation of the entire proposal.</p>

		<p>A parking space where you park a car for an extended period of time without actually owning the space? That is, as soon as you leave it, anyone may use it again.</p>

		<p>I read that as Temporary (unpaved or unmaintained paving) Long-Term (in use for many years).</p>
<p>Sometime ago, during a news report about illegally small parking spaces, that a regulation size parking space could cost upwards of $1000 to build, collectively with other spaces in a lot. And explaining the cost is why they try to be cheap and just repaint the lines.</p>

		<p>A long term parking is usually near an airport or train station.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a parking (temporary) where you park your car meanwhile you are in your travel (long term, maybe days or weeks).</p>

		<p>My guess would be that each parking &quot;transaction&quot; (a car arrives, is parked, and leaves) is long-term (several days), but an individual car visits the parking lot only occasionally, not regularly? Like parking lots at airports.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the rest of the sign explains what long-term temporary parking is.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of a situation I was in once. &nbsp;For unrelated reasons, I took deliver of a new car on my lunch hour from my job &#8212; which meant that I now had two cars at work. &nbsp;So, I just parked the older one in th eback of the employee parking lot and left it there (I only had space for one at my house). &nbsp;If I was planning something &quot;high-risk&quot; (like parking on the street in NYC), I&#8217;d drive to the office and switch cars, but mostly it just sat there. &nbsp;</p>
<p>One day I found on the car, a note from the building management, stating that if the car was not removed by some particular day it would be towed, citing as the offense &quot;excessive parking (more than 30 days)&quot;. Presumably, it had been 30 days from when they noticed the car to when they placed the note.</p>
<p>The funny thing was, when I found the note, it was already more than 30 days after the tow date, and the car was still there.</p>

		<p>Exactly. You can put your car there for longer terms (i.e. days / weeks, though multiple weeks stretches it). The airport example is perfect &#8211; they have two types of parking normally:</p>
<p>* Short term: people parking while they pick someone up), measured in hours or smaller. Close to entrance</p>
<p>* Long term: paid in days sometimes with week breaks where people going to holidays can park their car for 1-2 weeks (or even a month sometimes). This is normally further away (possibly far enough to ahve a shuttle service to the airport) but a LOT cheaper.</p>
<p>Still it is temporary &#8211; you dont have to take a long term contract etc.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Long-term&#8217; and &#8216;temporary&#8217; are clearly adjectives. &#8216;Parking&#8217;, at least in this context, is clearly a noun. [It can be also be a verb, as in &#8216;Where are you parking?&#8217; &#8212; but since there is no subject or object in the specified phrase, in this context, it is clearly a noun.]</p>
<p>According to the rules of English grammar, an adjective can only combine with a noun. Therefore, the result must be either:</p>
<p>A. long-term (temporary parking)</p>
<p>[since an adjective-modified noun is still a noun; thus &#8216;long-term&#8217; can modify &#8216;(temporary parking)&#8217;]</p>
<p>-or-</p>
<p>B. temporary (long-term parking)</p>
<p>Since English generally parses left-to-right, I interpret this as:</p>
<p>A. long-term (temporary parking)</p>
<p>In other words, it&#8217;s temporary (short-duration) parking that is expected to be in effect for a relatively lengthy duration.</p>
<p>If you really wanted the sense of &quot;B&quot;, I think you would say &quot;temporary long-term parking&quot;. I think adjectives in English bind strongly to their nouns. I guess that makes them right-associative.</p>

		<p>I once received a bulletin from a national standards organisation that was Titled &quot;Proposed Tentative Interim Amendment for &#8230;.&quot;</p>
<p>They actually spent the first 2 paragraphs of the bulletin defending the name of the bulletin even before they began to discuss what the bulletin was actually about.</p>
<p>The scary part is that the title actually made sense, once you understood what they were trying to say. &nbsp;</p>
