		<p>Still a lot of sticky problems, such as the inability to tell background processes apart from user actions. &nbsp;Most likely problem is real-time AV scanning the file as soon as its created triggering a false positive. &nbsp;And of course Explorer will open the file when the user browses to the directory.</p>
<p>I suspect the problem still has not been properly stated; we peeled away one layer of abstraction, but the question of WHY the program needs to care once the user sees the output file hasn&#39;t been answered.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best way is to simply execute the output file itself; then you KNOW the user is looking at it. &nbsp;It all depends on what you&#39;re trying to do.</p>

		<p>&gt; And of course Explorer will open the file when the user browses to the directory.</p>
<p>You could cheat and set FILE_FLAG_OFFLINE. This keeps explorer from issuing spurious open directives.</p>

		<p>The customer is retarded.</p>
<p>Notepad opens files with FILE_SHARE_WRITE|FILE_SHARE_READ, to allow viewing of logs currently being written. The program that writes the log need to allow FILE_SHARE_READ. This will be the least amount of pain.</p>

		<p>It would be better if MS always used the Office approach, and created a ~$filename.ext file the filename.ext are opened. That way other applications can watch the file system for the temporary file.</p>
<p>The simple solution for the customer is to open all files with Word instead of notepad.</p>

		<p>Yeah, I don&#39;t really see the point of what they&#39;re trying to do. &nbsp;It&#39;s sort of like Schrodinger&#39;s file or something.</p>

		<p>So, Raymond, did the customer explain why they wanted such a strange behaviour? Wasn&#39;t it the case of easy and impossible (or silly) parts of a solution?</p>

<p>Can&#39;t tell if you&#39;re joking, but no, it wouldn&#39;t be better. It&#39;s not an approach to detecting anything anyway. And I&#39;m not sure what do you mean by MS (so it&#39;s okay if Notepads by other companies don&#39;t do this?)</p>

		<p>Customer has a problem. They solve it by using sharing flags. Now they have two problems.</p>
<p>I always open with FILE_SHARE_READ | FILE_SHARE_WRITE | FILE_SHARE_DELETE and live with the consequences. Been burned too many times by trying to be more restrictive and running into sharing violations. Sharing violation is a very user-hostile error code. Let the user open the file if they want. Deal with it.</p>

		<p>If you have log files in mind, yes. But if the files are used as a interface between programs (app A is writing it, app B is detecting this and reads it then) then no. As app A, don&#39;t allow app B to read the file as long as you haven&#39;t closed it. And as app B, open the file without FILE_SHARE_WRITE: You want to read the file in a consistent state, not an incomplete fragment.</p>
<p>Also, when your app is a database, don&#39;t allow all this bad backup applications to read your file. The admins will think all is well when in reality, they have a file with inconsistent data in the backup.</p>
