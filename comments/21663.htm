		<p>Salesmen are crooks. &nbsp;So are politicians&#8230; and most lawyers&#8230;and all crooks.</p>

		<p>I know someone who regularly gets suckered by salespeople and it drives me nuts. &nbsp;He&#8217;ll tell me how proud he was that the salesperson had to go ask the manager to get such a &quot;good&quot; price. &nbsp;Or how he didn&#8217;t have to pay $50 on a support visit simply by paying $100 for a support contract. &nbsp;Or how the salesperson extended an &quot;expired&quot; offer just for him. &nbsp;The worst was biting my tongue during the &quot;I bought a timeshare!&quot; discussion.</p>

		<p>Yeah, but that was over a year ago. &#8230;They are much better now.</p>

		<p>Someone once told me a salesman is nothing but a liar with a nice tie. Sometimes they don&#8217;t even wear ties.</p>

		<p>I wonder why Senate, Banking and Trade Federation members in Star Wars are portrayed as ugly greedy bastards?</p>
<p>Perhaps George Lucas was actually trying to tell us something?</p>

		<p>How did you happen to come across this random piece from over a year and a half ago? &nbsp;Is the suggestion box that backed up? :)</p>

		<p>All this talk about sneaky and underhanded behaviour kind of reminds me about the parking ticket I was handed yesterday.</p>
<p>I parked at the office, go inside, plug in my computer, go outside with the parking permit and there&#8217;s a guy taking pictures of my car.</p>
<p>I wave my permit with a big smile, and then I notice that the bastard has already issued me with a ticket.</p>
<p>My colleague says I was gone for, at most, two minutes. Windows&#8217; event viewer says my machine booted at 9:27. (I pressed the power button as I left my computer and my computer&#8217;s clock runs about three minutes too fast)</p>
<p>Parking ticket says I was parked at that spot from 9:06 to 9:23. At 9:06 I had barely left my own apartment&#8230;! The guy had parked his car in front of my car. He obviously hadn&#8217;t bothered checking the other cars, but only those parked with the windshield visible from the road. (that way he didn&#8217;t have to get out of his car and walk around)</p>
<p>I have already written a lengthy complaint and I&#8217;ll post it today. I won&#8217;t rest until that guy&#8217;s life is in total ruins and all his children are sold off as slave laborers.</p>

		<p>@Rune,</p>
<p>I was once ticketed at university for &quot;parking on the grass&quot;. &nbsp;I had actually parked at the back of a parking lot on a section of gravel. &nbsp;I&#8217;m guessing that if they want grass there, they should try removing the gravel first (they, of course, never did). &nbsp;University poles at their finest.</p>
<p>And the car dealer stuff is spot on&#8230; they didn&#8217;t even hit the worst stuff.</p>
