		<p>Useless&#8230; and that integer array is simply dangerously designed. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve found also GetEffectiveClientRect in the doc while looking this one up. &nbsp;Baffling API design style, even for early 1990s. &nbsp; That one is passing two integer for each control, just to be able to know where the array ends! Or perhaps to match some kind of internal data structure while it was written. &nbsp;Doesn&#8217;t like this was meant to be published. :)</p>

		<p>&#8220;It no longer exports every little helper function and custom control for third parties to use.&#8221;</p>
<p>Then every developper will develop their own sligthly different control that mimics the one the Shell uses (like the preview pane in XP folders), so you end up with another problem instead.</p>
<p>For example, why isn&#8217;t DirectUI documented? It&#8217;s used in a lots of places (LogonUI, MSN Messenger, etc&#8230;). Instead we&#8217;re stuck with WPF which only works with .NET&#8230;</p>

		<p>Yeah, this brings up a good example of where law and software engineering meet.</p>
<p>Before software research ever brought up contract programming, the Windows API was already a contract. &nbsp;It became one just by virtue of being born and then by Windows growth and popularity.</p>
<p>So it is prudent for these API developers to not just export everything (which adds it to the contract), but to release things in different ways.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you&#8217;ll have no choice but to expose some functionality.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you aren&#8217;t sure if people need this functionality. &nbsp;Maybe you try it yourself in a few projects (like MSN Messenger or Office) and see if it&#8217;s working out. &nbsp;Maybe there is a need for the functionality to be exported, but it could be improved upon first, before casting it in the everlasting mold of backward compatibility.</p>
<p>The problem is some stupid people went crying to the DOJ and convinced non-engineers that MSFT perfectly designs everything on the first try and if they don&#8217;t export and document everything, then they are a ruthless monopoly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a no-win situation for MSFT. &nbsp;I&#8217;m impressed with the quality of people who work there under those conditions.</p>

		<p>I remember reading that window handles just use 16-bit under 32-bit Windows in order to better support Win16 apps. 64-bit Windows dropped support for Win16 apps, so now window handles use 32-bit in order to support Win32 apps better. (a huge overkill given a window manager that starts sweating bullets at 20000 windows)</p>
<p>Which brings me to my question: Is a 64-bit HMENU value really 64-bit? (Given 64-bit Windows &#8212; I understand Win128 will probably change things)</p>

		<p>&quot;The problem is some stupid people went crying to the DOJ&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>Not stupid people but rather people coming from a background of open source, operating system ending in ux and programming language ending in va. For them backward compatibility and not breaking existing clients are (or at least used to be) not a big priority as evidenced by their own products. Coming from such background any attempt on the part of MS to not document something is viewed as simply malicious.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Do people complain to Lotus&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymond, Lotus doesn&#8217;t make an operating system with undocumented dynamic libraries which only their own programs can use, so your comparison is not valid.</p>

		<p>Re: the 64-bit issue with this function&#8230; couldn&#8217;t it have been changed to operate on an array of INT_PTRs? &nbsp;It would have no effect when compiling for x86, and would enable the function to work correctly in 64-bit. &nbsp;I imagine the time to convert INT to INT_PTR would have been trivial.</p>
<p>Re: DirectUI&#8230; I&#8217;ve mentioned it before on this blog. &nbsp;There&#8217;s two sides to the coin: 1: Someone at Microsoft has developed some technology, and since it is property of Microsoft, any product in Microsoft should have the right to incorporate that source code. &nbsp;2: Microsoft doesn&#8217;t want to commit to a publicly-available (and supported forever) implementation of the technology, so to sidestep around antitrust requirements, it doesn&#8217;t implement it as an exposed API but simply duplicates all the code in each relevant product.</p>
<p>My personal view? I&#8217;d love to see DirectUI documented, because it seems like cool technology (for those who don&#8217;t want to use WPF for the same reasons that Windows itself doesn&#8217;t want to use WPF). &nbsp;But I think they have the right to keep it private; as Raymond said it doesn&#8217;t use any undocumented Windows APIs so in theory any ISV could have, with the right skills and knowledge, created the same thing.</p>
<p>That said, just because you *can* keep it private, doesn&#8217;t mean you should. &nbsp;And that leads to&#8230;</p>
<p>Re: APIs and helper functions/controls. &nbsp;I&#8217;m one who loves APIs because they allow me to 1) minimize the cost of developing my own apps, and 2) be most consistent with the OS.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a balance between ISV usefulness, platform longevity, and affect on cost (for both the ISV and Microsoft).</p>
<p>With XP, I was definitely seeing a trend about reducing helper functions and exposed controls (especially compared to the ComCtl32 updates brought by IE3/4). &nbsp;However with Vista, I was pleasantly surprised by what I perceived as an excellent set of new Shell APIs (not quite as much with comctl32 since there isn&#8217;t much new there). &nbsp;There are hundreds of new shell/property system functions/interfaces, ranging from large pieces like ExplorerBrowser and NamespaceTreeControl, to simple helper functions like SHCreateItemXXX. &nbsp;There&#8217;s also some good SDK samples. &nbsp;(However, the SDK documentation itself is still quite sparse.)</p>
<p>That said there are still pieces missing&#8211;we waited for years for SHCreateShellFolderView/Ex (and company) to be officially documented. &nbsp;It took the DOJ to bring it about, but it finally happened in 2002. &nbsp;Now there&#8217;s deprecation warnings on nearly all of these &quot;settlement&quot; APIs, which disappoints, but doesn&#8217;t surprise, me.</p>
<p>Anyways, overall it&#8217;s a balance to find which APIs are the correct ones to expose. &nbsp;Generally Microsoft does a pretty good job in determining this balance.</p>

		<p>“Misinformed FUD?”</p>
<p>Well just take a peak on the loaded DLLs of “MS-Windows XP<br />
Add/Remove Programs” applet on the Control Panel, if you do so (with<br />
the help of Process Explorer for example) you will see that the<br />
software (which starts with the help of &nbsp;the well known<br />
“rundll.exe”) uses the “duser.dll”. </p>
<p>Now if you check “duser.dll” exports you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s a much<br />
useful and quiet undocumented system oriented DLL (titled in it’s<br />
version info as “Windows DirectUser Engine” wow!!) that only MS<br />
software can use and benefit from ;-)</p>
<p>Now, if Raymond can explain us this, then ok… </p>
<div class="post">[<i>This is a lose-lose discussion for me.<br />

		<p>It is not a &quot;lose-lose discussion&quot;, if you want to explain this&#8230;</p>
<p>Believe me, I would be glad to read your opinion on this matter and so help me correct my misunderstanding about this DLL (there is much hype on the net about it), as your book helped correct some of my mistakes on Windows API programming (by the way it’s a nice book :-)).</p>
<p>But since you do not feel this way, “End of Discussion” from me also, I am sorry for pointing about “DUSER.DLL” in the first place, I will not trouble you again.</p>
