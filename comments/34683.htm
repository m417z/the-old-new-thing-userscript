		<p>Oooh!  A rant thread!   How fun!</p>
<p>My pet peeve is the use of the word &#8216;partner&#8217; as a verb.  Since when is &#8216;partner&#8217; a verb?  For some reason, that just gets under my skin.  My mind rebels at the use of this word in this manner.</p>
<p>As Calvin said, verbing weirds language.</p>

		<p>Never heard that one before. By which I mean I&#8217;ve never &quot;leveraged&quot; that one before.</p>

		<p>&quot;Partner&quot; can be a transitive verb according to my dictionary&#8230;<br />
<br />1 : to join or associate with another as partner<br />
<br />2 : to provide with a partner</p>

		<p>My father has a particular distaste for the use of the word &#8216;key&#8217; without its article.</p>
<p>As in:</p>
<p>&quot;This is key to understanding the product&#8217;s feature.&quot;</p>
<p>I find a lot of people seem confused as to which words are adjectives, and which words are adverbs or perhaps even nouns.  In particular, &#8216;good&#8217; vs. &#8216;well&#8217; truly confuses many American speakers of English.  As in:</p>
<p>&quot;I did that real good.&quot;</p>
<p>Or, most commonly:</p>
<p>&quot;How are you?&quot; &quot;I am good.&quot;</p>
<p>This doesn&#8217;t stop at good vs. well, either.  One may see sentences like the following:</p>
<p>&quot;That ball rolled down the hill quick.&quot;</p>
<p>as opposed to the more correct:</p>
<p>&quot;That ball rolled down the hill quickly.&quot;</p>

		<p>Sounds like, &quot;did you delegate any responsiblities in this area&quot;..</p>
<p>And what on earth is wrong with &quot;did you do it yet?&quot; Sounds like something that will be declared correct usage soon enough, alongside &quot;have you done it by now&quot;, etc.</p>

		<p>&quot;I am good&quot; is perfectly acceptable. Am is a linking verb connecting the noun &quot;I&quot; with the adjective describing it &quot;good&quot; It&#8217;s just like saying &quot;the sky is blue&quot;</p>
<p>Saying &quot;I am well&quot; implies that you are performing some action &quot;aming&quot; in a particularly good fashion, which doesn&#8217;t make a whole lot of sense.  More common is &quot;I feel badly&quot; which implies that you are doing a bad job of feeling something (ie pick up a soccer ball and say &quot;I think I&#8217;m touching a walrus&quot;)</p>

		<p>cshowe:<br />
<br />&quot;I am good&quot; while gramatically correct is a little ambiguous, though it is not any more ambiguous than &quot;How are you?&quot;.  It would be better to say &quot;How are you doing?&quot; and reply &quot;I am doing well.&quot;</p>

		<p>Ahh, linguistic rants&#8230; My current pet peeves are related to certain blog environs which are a little less professional and rather more colloquial than this one, but here they are:</p>
<p>1: Obsession with the idea of &quot;memes&quot;. The whole meme thing is a meme itself, and it&#8217;s gotten way too popular.</p>
<p>2: Overuse of the word &quot;asshat&quot; as a substitute for more standard and meaningful insults.</p>
<p>3: Overuse of the phrase &quot;kthxbye&quot; by illiterate &quot;asshats&quot; who want put on an air of dismissiveness and superiority. </p>
<p>Luckily I have not run into Larry and Raymond&#8217;s peeves of &quot;asks&quot; as a noun. It&#8217;s only a matter of time though, I&#8217;m sure!<br /></p>

		<p>I have one grammatical pet peeve, and I am inclined to let others slide until it is repaired: the common use of apostrophes to form plurals.  As far as I am aware, there are NO cases in the English language in which to so use them is correct.</p>

		<p>As a displaced Southerner living in New England, the list of grammatical abuses that I encounter on a daily basis is staggering &#8212; not that the Southern dialect doen&#8217;t have its own &quot;nuances.&quot;  Probably the most heinous one that I hear regularly is &quot;So don&#8217;t I&quot; to mean &quot;So do I.&quot;</p>
<p>I guess I should counter that with &quot;I am fixin&#8217; to lose my mind if y&#8217;all don&#8217;t stop sayin&#8217; that.&quot;</p>

		<p>The &quot;apostrphe-s&quot; for pluralizing numbers and single letters is definitely common use.  Whether it&#8217;s grammatically correct is probably debatable, but I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a better was to do it.</p>
<p>&quot;I got all A&#8217;s.&quot;<br />
<br />&quot;She had big hair in the 80&#8217;s.&quot;</p>
<p>You can actually write pluralized numbers without the &quot;s&quot;, though.  e.g. &quot;80s&quot;  Both ways are fairly common.</p>

		<p>My biggest gripe right now is &quot;I, for one.&quot;</p>
<p>The *only* time &quot;I, for one&quot; is acceptable is if you&#8217;re part of a group and you, personally, disagree with the general opinion of the group.  For instance, &quot;everybody on this project likes C++ but I, for one, prefer Java.&quot;  But now you&#8217;re seeing it used *everywhere* for every purpose, and sometimes just to replace &quot;I.&quot;</p>
<p>On Slashdot, &quot;I, for one&quot; is being used so often that people are starting to leave out the comma, making it just &quot;I for one think that you all suck.&quot;</p>

		<p>Going back to the original post, which asked: &quot;Since when is &#8216;partner&#8217; a verb?&quot;</p>
<p>The 1920s UK dictionary that I keep beside my computer has it; checking in the OED indicates that that usage probably started in the 1850s or so.</p>
<p>Interestingly, according to the OED, there are at least occasional uses of &quot;ask&quot; as a noun going back to the 1200s.</p>
<p>(Larry, meanwhile, can perhaps take perverse comfort in the fact that the noun is also used to refer to a Scottish newt.)</p>

		<p>re: Xavier</p>
<p>I *think* that it might be correct in English to use an apostrophe to pluralize a single letter, such as &quot;This sentence has two i&#8217;s.&quot; It might also be appropriate for a number in a similar context, although I&#8217;m not as sure about it.</p>
<p>But yes, an aprostrophe does not mean that &quot;an s is about to come&quot;, despite its increasingly prevalent usage that way.</p>

		<p>This is something that has bothered me for awhile.  What the hell does &quot;go it alone&quot; mean?  I understand &quot;go in alone&quot; and even &quot;do it alone&quot; makes sense.  But &quot;go it alone&quot;?  That makes no sense whatsoever, and yet I see it constantly.  Am I missing something obvious?</p>

		<p>the &quot;I, for one&quot; that you see on slashdot is actually a meme based on a Simpson&#8217;s quote. The quote is made from the news reporter &quot;Kent Brockman&quot; in reference to an apparent invasion of giant ants. where is is quoted as saying:</p>
<p>&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, uh, we&#8217;ve just lost the picture, but what we&#8217;ve seen speaks for itself. The Corvair spacecraft has apparently been taken over- &#8216;conquered&#8217; if you will- by a master race of giant space ants. It&#8217;s difficult to tell from this vantage point whether they will consume the captive Earthman or merely enslave them. One thing is for certain: there is no stopping them; the ants will soon be here. And &lt;b&gt;I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords.&lt;/b&gt; I&#8217;d like to remind them as a trusted TV personality, I can be helpful in rounding up others to toil in their underground sugar caves.&quot; &#8212; Kent Brockman</p>

		<p>While we&#8217;re at it, those signs in supermarkets that say &quot;10 items or less&quot; really wind me up.  It&#8217;s FEWER, dammit!  (Thus far I&#8217;ve not seen one saying &quot;10 item&#8217;s or less&quot;, but it&#8217;s only a matter of time&#8230;)</p>

		<p>I love the common use of &quot;quantum leap&quot;, because it&#8217;s so often accidental truth. The salescretins mean &quot;a huge increase&quot;, but what they&#8217;re actually saying is &quot;the smallest possible change&quot;. And generally they&#8217;re correct to do so.</p>
<p>I assume you&#8217;ve all read &quot;Eats, Shoots and Leaves&quot;?</p>

		<p>I have a number of grammatical peeves, for example when co-workers inform me that their printer is &quot;broke&quot;. Explaining that this means it has no money, not uncommon in printers, seems not to help.</p>
<p>As for signs, I particularly appreciate shops which show &quot;Everything must go&quot; in the window. Well, duh, surely that&#8217;s the point of a shop? Why would you have a shop where you don&#8217;t want to sell everything?</p>

		<p>This is more of a spelling mistake than a grammatical error, but I saw a sign outside a pub once which changed its grammar in an interesting and possibly insightful manner.</p>
<p>It announced</p>
<p>&quot;We have a wide range of premium largers.&quot;</p>
<p>I can only assume it was referring to the women.</p>

		<p>I was once in a local sporting goods store, and someone had made a sign for the &quot;Sweet Water&quot; water filters, only they misspelled it as &quot;Sweat Water.&quot;  That changed the meaning a little bit.</p>

		<p>Today&#8217;s German seems to borrow many words from (US) English. This is not nearly as bad as some people here in Germany claim (somebody even calls it &quot;cultural imperialism&quot;), because most of the English words in general use are very useful and fill a hole in the language; something that couldn&#8217;t be easily expressed without it (&quot;Notebook&quot;, &quot;shoppen&quot;, &quot;Comedy&quot;). What&#8217;s funny is that German managers, being in love with buzz words just like the managers everywhere else in the world, seem to have an interesting presence for *English* buzz words.</p>
<p>The one I&#8217;ve revently heard is &quot;Leverage-Effekt&quot;. The first part is, of course, English and translates to &quot;Hebel&quot;. But saying &quot;Hebeleffekt&quot; sounds like physics and will thus scare people away, whereas saying &quot;Leverage-Effekt&quot; will earns you a &quot;knowing&quot; nod by the audience and a promotion. I, for one detest weasel words in any language.</p>

		<p>Oh man.. The local one that really hurts is the removal of &quot;to be.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;That feature needs checked.&quot;</p>
<p>instead of:</p>
<p>&quot;That feature needs to be checked.&quot;<br />
<br />or<br />
<br />&quot;That feature needs checking.&quot;</p>

		<p>My English grammar is probably not the best there is but I cannot help that my eyes hurt whenever I see the word then in the meaning than, e.g. &quot;I earn more then you!&quot; Ouch!<br />
<br />What disturbs me is that I see it crop up everywhere, even in papers written by professionals. I almost fear that it soon will be accepted as correct English and I will go blind!<br />
<br />Another English pet peeve is using u instead of you, which hurts my eyes equally much but luckily it&#8217;s easier to steer clear of it: just don&#8217;t visit web sites with an adolescent audience!</p>

		<p>I have a couple of customers who have a new and interesting way of using exclamation and question marks. The basic idea is to use a question mark on anything you don&#8217;t understand, and an exclamation mark on anything that is alarming. For more intense alarm/confusion, increase the number: It asks me to login but I don&#8217;t know the password? Isn&#8217;t this wrong!!!</p>
<p>Also, &#8216;yourself&#8217; and &#8216;myself&#8217; as a way to make &#8216;you&#8217; and &#8216;me&#8217; sound more important. Mostly sales people.</p>
<p>&#8216;Then&#8217; interchanged with &#8216;than. I don&#8217;t understand this one, but it seems to be common with young Americans (Livejournal&#8217;s Brad, and Slashdot&#8217;s CmdrTaco are two common culprits).</p>
<p>Once at a trade show, I saw a presentation by a laptop vendor, describing his company&#8217;s product as the &#8216;most dependent laptop around&#8217;. I guess it was always bumming rides and borrowing money from you.</p>
<p>And finally, the Best Sign Ever: XMA&#8217;S TREE&#8217;S NEXT LEFT</p>
