		<p>Re-&quot;that I never wanted to be on video&quot; </p>
<p>I stand corrected. :-) </p>
<p>Why don&#8217;t you have a C9 account?</p>

		<p>I enjoyed your talk quite a bit!  One thing you mentioned was how apps will probably look messed up due to the new high DPI stuff in Vista, so perhaps your next talk can be over getting that right.  But, you might wind up covering that sort of thing here on your blog. ;)</p>

		<p>Ignoring the fact that this could be classified as an interview question, why don&#8217;t you do interviews?</p>

		<p>for some reason I also thought that you were american&#8230; I was really off</p>
<p>so how about your next PDC talk on &quot;Raymond&#8217;s debugging techniques&quot;?</p>

		<p>Ah, no his logic is correct Raymond, but it contains some assumptions.</p>
<p>He assumes that you know that Channel 9 is an MSDN site and that it&#8217;s primary purpose is to increase communication between Microsoft employees and their users. </p>
<p>He also assumes that Channel 9 fills some void in that purpose that your weblog does not.</p>
<p>For your next talk how about a topic like &quot;the evolution of the Windows API&quot;?</p>

		<p>Raymond,<br />
<br />For some reason I always pictured you as an old man with a long white beard, dispensing the acrued wisdom of the generations to earnest seekers of knowledge. Imagine my dissapointment to see you&#8217;re young (ish) and beardless. Somehow my level of awe was diminished, or at least it was until you finished your pre-amble and got on with the talk proper. I&#8217;d also like to admit that I too have links to your blog in my code, just in case my boss reads it and asks why I did A instead of B.</p>

		<p>what do you think the title of my next talk should be?</p>
<p>How about the top ten interesting/humorous antidotes regarding the development of Windows 95/98?</p>

		<p>Your question is backwards. You should be telling me why I should *get* a C9 account. There are a zillion web sites out there; you don&#8217;t expect me to have an account on every single one do you?</p>

		<p>BlackTigerX: I see no evidence that Raymond is American or that he isn&#8217;t. Well . . . that&#8217;s not entirely true. He seems to have a better command of English than most Americans. But he&#8217;s also psychic. Maybe he gained facility in English during the same meteor strike that gave him his spooky mental powers. Or was it a freak electrical storm? I&#8217;ll have to re-read my copies of the early Raymond comics to remind myself.</p>

		<p>next year, you should name your talk &quot;Raymond&#8217;s Greatest Hits&quot;</p>

<p>So I weren&#8217;t the only one who had similar image in the head before! Why? I think I got the image of an old guy from the name of the blog and the color scheme on it brings to mind an old engineer with a beard!</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  the buzz in the crowd was that I&#8217;m so short.<br />
  <br />&gt; Well, in my defense</p>
<p>You stated your defence a few weeks ago.  You said you wouldn&#8217;t sign anything.  So you still get one more significant bit by being an unsigned short.
