		<p>For those who enjoy crosswords enough to do 5-10 per day, I recommend trying the Crossword Tournament hosted by Will Shortz (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.crosswordtournament.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.crosswordtournament.com</a>). If you only do 1 or 2 per day, it may still be fun, but don&#8217;t kid yourself &#8212; you&#8217;ll probably not make it into the top 300.</p>
<p>The joke about Ellen Ripstein is that she&#8217;s known as the Susan Lucci of crossword puzzles. Susan Lucci is a soap opera star who had been nominated for an Emmy award something like 18 years in a row before winning. Ellen finished in the top 5 at the tournament every year since 1983. When Susan finally won an Emmy in 1999 we knew Ellen was due for a win, and she came through in 2001.</p>
<p>And for the record, I would have to say Merl Reagle is my favorite crossword constructor.</p>

		<p>Will Shortz is a pale imitation of Eugene. T. Maleska, unfit to sharpen his pencil.</p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>To<br />
each his own. Many years ago, I got a book of Maleska crosswords and<br />
hated them. Governor of Alaska in 1960? Opera singers from the 1900&#8217;s?<br />
Booooooring! It was the Shortz school that made crossword puzzles fun<br />
again. Merl Reagle discusses this <a href="http://siff.hollywoodreviews.com/interviews/merl_reagle_on_wordplay_and_cr.phtml" rel="nofollow">in this interview</a>: &#8220;There are two kinds of solvers in the country: People who solve crosswords as a <u>test</u> and people who solve crosswords as a <u>game</u>.<br />
Now, the people who solve crosswords as a test like the<br />
vocabulary-building ones. &#8230; Unfortunately, they can&#8217;t solve the<br />
&#8216;tricky&#8217; ones. The people who solve crosswords as a game can solve the<br />
ones that are a test, they just don&#8217;t like them.&#8221; Thanks to Ellen<br />
Ripstein for the link to the Merl Reagle interview. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I agree wholeheartedly with Raymond&#8217;s response to RevMike. &nbsp;I love puzzles of the Will Shortz era. &nbsp;In college, in the early 80&#8217;s, I used to refer to Eugene. T. Maleska as &quot;the most hated man on the Eastern seaboard,&quot; &nbsp;I was so frustrated, I thought everyone must have felt the same way.</p>
