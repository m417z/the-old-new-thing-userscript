		<p>I lost my watch. &nbsp;Can you use your psychic powers to help me find it? (I am, of course, kidding.)</p>
<p>I do find it strange that their app was checking the last access time. &nbsp;I deal more with UNIX/Linux stuff, but the only one of the three Linux file timestamps that&#39;s genuinely useful is last modified. &nbsp;&quot;Creation time&quot; is actually the least useful of the 3, as in Linux it&#39;s actually the last time any of the file&#39;s metadata (owner, permissions, etc&#8230;) were changed.</p>

		<p>&quot;Upon learning that my psychic powers once again were correct, I realized that my prize for being correct was actually a penalty: Now even more people will ask me to help debug their mysterious problems. &quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s where the phrase &quot;It&#39;s a gift, it&#39;s a curse&quot; comes from.</p>

		<p>&quot;While the others were off doing their investigations, my head shuddered and I was sent into a trance state. A hollow voice emanated from my throat as my psychic powers manifested themselves.&quot;</p>
<p>Must be awesome to behold! You should film it! (I imagine a noise resembling Tuvan throat singing.)</p>
<p>Of course, your real mistake is using such powers as source materials for this &quot;crappy&quot; blog rather than something much more profitable ($$$)!!</p>

		<p>You really have to wonder why they were using the last access time. On systems where that timestamp is updated, this would mean that the contents might be unnecessarily read from the source file instead of the cache if it&#39;s been accessed but not modified. Yes, the application might also check the last modified time in that case, but why not just do that in the first place?</p>
<p>Every so often, I see a needlessly stupid design and just scream &quot;WHY?????&quot;</p>

		<p>@Paul &#8211; &nbsp;if you have a problem with 3rd party software running on Microsoft software we&#39;re often faced with the &quot;prove it&#39;s not you doing this&quot; argument. So, in the interest of providing customers with a quality support experience, we often have to identify the root cause to show it&#39;s not us before we can begin to take a hard line on requiring the customer to engage their vendor. A side effect of this is that we often have to do enough investigation to not only prove it&#39;s not us, but to also provide a general idea to the vendor where their problem resides.</p>
<p>Pre-recorded response for Nit Pickers: I will probably ignore any comments regarding our decision to staff our first line of support out of low cost labor markets, your individual support experience that counters my generalization above, your suggestions as to how we should modify our internal processess to accomodate your specific support needs, the cost of opening a support request with Microsoft, etc.</p>

		<p>Every time a program is trying to be unnecessarily &quot;smart&quot; it end up stupid. Happens to all vendors. Usually it&#39;s a feature &quot;somebody got a bonus for&quot;. Today, it&#39;s &quot;smart&quot; way to show selected file information in Windows 7. Select many enough files (&gt;15), it won&#39;t show even their total size; you have to click &quot;Show more details&quot;. Does that even if you select the files one by one. But I guess, it&#39;s done because it has to support offline files.</p>

		<p>You mean your penalty didn&#39;t include writing a compatibility shim on Vista for the program that gives it the file&#39;s modified time timestamp when it asks for the last access time?</p>
<p>More babbling: &nbsp;If last access time tracking is disabled (for perf reasons), shouldn&#39;t it at least still be updated to the last modified time when a file is modified? You&#39;re performing &nbsp;a write to a file attribute anyway, so the performance impact shouldn&#39;t be large, and it would prevent this type of confusion for applications that look at last access time.</p>

		<p>Brian: If the last access time was the last time the file was read, why is it called something ambiguous instead of LastReadTime? According to MSDN (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724320.aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/ms724320.aspx</a>), &quot;The last access time includes the last time the file or directory was written to, read from, or, in the case of executable files, run.&quot;</p>
<p>Based on the documentation, I would have no reason to expect that after writing to a file its last access time would not be changed.</p>

		<p>My psychic debugging powers tell me Brian is wrong. If access time was only updated when file is read, that clipboard app would fail even on XP. The only reason the problem with this clipboard app does not occur on XP is that access time *is* updated (on XP) when the file is modified.</p>
<p>But on Vista it seems like access time is not updated even when file is modified. I think this is wrong, and agree with mikeb &#8211; it is good optimization to not update access time on reads, but it would not hurt at all to update it on writes, and would do much better for compatibility.</p>
<p>In other words, Vista did equivalent of older &#39;noatime&#39; Linux option, while better &#39;relatime&#39; would be preferable (this option updates atime on *writes* only if current atime is older).</p>

		<p>I always found the last access time to be pretty useless, for example just looking at the properties in Explorer seems to cause a read of the file (presumably to look for summary data) so I have to remember to use dir instead.</p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>I disagree that this situation is clearly a bug in Vista. &nbsp;I would think this is clearly a failure of the third party vendor to update their software or of the customer to ensure they are using a compatible version of the program with the version of the OS they have.</p>

<p>a) Become untalented yourself or at least pretend to be</p>
<p>b) Alternatively, accept that there are untalented people who need your help</p>
<p>And please, talented people, try to help friendly. This is very much asked, I know, but letting them feel how untalented they are just increases the overall amount of bad feelings &#8211; nothing won. Also note that maybe their untalentedness only spans a certain area of expertise.</p>

		<p>You go through all that trouble telling us about the issue but don&#39;t tell us what the extra &quot;clipboard tool&quot;, the root cause of the problem, is?</p>

		<p>ok well, while I can agree that the program in question had a bad design it just screams WTF to me that last access time is disabled by default, especially as it was enabled before. Backwards compatibility problems coming up, also if I am looking at a bunch of files that I read before but didn&#39;t change anything in &#8211; maybe I want to see the last one I accessed?</p>
<p>This sounds to me like Someone found there were performance problems with NTFS and disabled a feature as the solution. Premature feature disabling is the root of all my yelling.</p>

		<p>@bryan: You will notice Linux distributions are also disabling (or at least reducing) atime updates by default, where before they were enabled. The reason is the same as in Windows: performance.</p>
<p>In particular, an atime update changes a read (potentially from the cache) into a read plus a *write*. Not only are writes slower, you are also wasting disk bandwidth, and on some kinds of media can even cause premature wear (flash-based media has a limited number of writes, which is why it needs wear leveling).</p>
