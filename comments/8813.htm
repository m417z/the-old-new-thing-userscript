		<p>What I find interesting is: why does Unix not need this optimization? Looking at a popular Unix filesystem (the ext2 family of filesystems), I see that the only things in a directory entry are the inode number, the file name, and optionally the file type (regular file, directory, symbolic link, device, &#8230;). And yet Unix does not seem to have any slowdown because of it.</p>
<p>I believe the real cause is a difference in the API. On Unix, the API to list the contents of a directory (opendir/readdir/closedir) returns the exact same things the filesystem has in the directory entry: inode number, file type, and file name. On the other hand, the Windows API (FindFirstFile/FindNextFile/FindClose) returns much more data (see the WIN32_FIND_DATA struct for the details). That data includes the file size.</p>
<p>The NTFS designers had no choice. The level of detail returned by the Unix directory enumeration API would be a better match to what they wanted to do, but they had to maintain compatibility with a DOS-era API which also returned the file size. They could create a better API, but nobody would use it. Unix systems never had this problem, because the inode was always a separate thing, and software written for Unix already knew it had to stat() every file (for those who do not know Unix, stat() returns much of the inode metadata, including the file size and times), and that stat()ing every file could be expensive.</p>

		<p>@Henke37:</p>
<p>And this (antivirus) is what caused VB6 (?) disapppearing files debacle, years ago.</p>
<p>And for what it&#39;s worth, the search indexing service occasionally interfers with the file deletion and write access. You may have seen once in a while that you cannot delete a file because it&#39;s opened by SYSTEM.</p>
<p>Why CreateFile always gets the most recent file size &#8211; because all FILE_OBJECT&#39;s for an open file (no matter which hardlink was used) refer to the same metadata copy in memory, maintained by the FS driver. This also allows to maintain file sharing and locking semantics, and also APPEND access semantics.</p>
<p>If required, FindFile could be changed to see if there is such a cached metadata record. Though I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s much requested feature.</p>

		<p>I would have used it, but I ended up calling GetFileInformation myself on every file.</p>
<p>@Cesar: Modern UNIX systems keep the inode physically near the directory on which the file was first created, which ends up being good enough.</p>

		<p>There is another explanation; namely that just because a program is writing data to a file doesn&#39;t mean that data is being committed to a disk. Point being that even if the file size was reporting something other than zero on a regular basis, it still wouldn&#39;t be accurate for a file that is still being written!</p>

		<p>@Joe: I use it as something like a progress bar for a program that doesn&#39;t normally have it.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve always wondered about that behavior. It did bother me somewhat, being that I use a lot of progs whose only progress is in log files. I usually use an &nbsp;implementation of tail, which shows a streaming log.</p>
<p>I&#39;d expect the API to show a coherent picture of the FS, regardless of any lazy-writing or caching effect. When processing FindFirst, I imagine NTFS could lookup whether any dir entry points to a file that&#39;s currently open and take the size from there, no disk access needed. Don&#39;t know how complex that would be though.</p>

		<p>I work in environment where my simplest option to track behavior, communications and data flow, is to view many log files at once (I even wrote myself notepad-like tail, called dynamic log viewer ;-)). The change in NTFS behavior in Server 2008 was slightly inconveniencing at first, but because of it I eventually stopped looking at file sizes and started using more reliable displays. So&#8230; positive for me in the end.</p>

		<p>First: Raymond, thank you for an awesome blog entry. This actually may help to explain quite a bit about the FindFirstFileEx API, which I&#39;ve previously found strange. (In particular, why is there a flag you can pass to suppress returning short file names which is documented to perhaps substantially increase speed, but giving the size is fast anyway.)</p>
<p>@Cesar: &quot;What I find interesting is: why does Unix not need this optimization? &#8230; And yet Unix does not seem to have any slowdown because of it.&quot;</p>
<p>I think it goes beyond what you say to the UI.</p>
<p>A typical mode of looking at the directory contents in Linux is by running &#39;ls&#39;, which doesn&#39;t show you the size. In theory, &#39;ls -l&#39; can be substantially more expensive than a plain &#39;ls&#39;. (The docs even warn about this potential problem in the context of the flags which tell &#39;ls&#39; to color the results or mark directories and executable files with / and *. The former can be done on dt_type-supporting systems with just the information from readdir(), but the latter needs a stat().) In contrast, Explorer will often (always?) need the size.</p>
<p>I actually already want, for independent reasons, to run some statistics about how much time the extra lookup costs, so if you&#39;re interested in how much difference it makes on Unix to do just a sequence of readdir calls compared to readdir+stat, or how much difference the FindExInfoBasic flag to FindFirstFileEx makes, I&#39;ll post back here if I do that investigation and this discussion is still open or you can email me at <a href="mailto:evaned@gmail.com">evaned@gmail.com</a>.</p>
<p>@Joshua: &quot;Modern UNIX systems keep the inode physically near the directory on which the file was first created, which ends up being good enough.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s not good enough if you&#39;re on a networked file system though. I sometimes have &#39;ls&#39;s take several seconds; I have recently started to wonder if the fact that I use the &#8211;color flag (which causes those stat()s) is the main cause of that.</p>

		<p>&quot;Now you&#39;ve created this environment of distrust. Why stop there? Why not also verify file contents?&quot;</p>

		<p>Raymond, I think the argument is that the last 1% shouldn&#39;t cost 1500x as much. Since the incorrect sizes are only for files that are currently open, the correct information should be somewhere in the computer&#39;s memory. For every enumerated file, NTFS just has to look in its dictionary of cached files to see if there&#39;s more recent metadata. Since that information is probably in RAM, it should be substantially cheaper than 1500x more. I&#39;d expect that this lookup would cost no more than 5% additional.</p>

		<p>Raymond: If getting the latest metadata costs 150000% more, then a flag for it makes sense (assuming anybody would bother to use it). But if the latest metadata can come from cache instead of hitting the disk (adding, say, only 5%), why bother with a flag &#8212; why not just do the lookup for every enumerated file?</p>
<p>If people really object to the slight perf hit, they could create a registry entry for disabling the lookup, like they did for creating 8.3 filenames and updating last access times.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>The 1500x cost is if Explorer decides to ignore the file size that comes out of FindFirstFile and gets the current size directly. If it happens inside NTFS, then it would naturally be cheaper. But it would also introduce other weirdness. &quot;When I type <code>dir</code> I get the correct size of the file as it is being generated, but when the program finishes, the size reverts to the incorrect value again!&quot; (Because the file closure updates the directory entry only for the hard link that was used to open it, and you were observing it through a different hard link.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>@cesar: Actually, a fairly valid reason why things aren&#39;t necessarily *that* slow for most common usage scenarios is that the inode table can be cached. So actually, most of the time, you don&#39;t go for a walk around the whole filesystem looking for that annoying inode.</p>

		<p>I have a somewhat offtopic question. &nbsp;FAT did not have anything like inodes, and mostly didn&#39;t need them, because the directory entry contains everything the inode would have had: where to find the file on disk, file size, etc. &nbsp;This means no support for hard links, which makes me wonder: how are . and .. implemented? &nbsp;In particular, how do you solve the problem you mentioned, of keeping the metadata consistent? &nbsp;A directory can have many directory entries, one for each child, plus one from itself, and one from its parent. &nbsp;I can only think of two solutions. &nbsp;One is that the relevant data is stored in the direcotry itself, instead of as file system metadata. &nbsp;That seems ugly. &nbsp;Another way might be that whenever somebody wants metadata for directory stuff, we look it up in stuff. and whenever somebody asks for stuff.., we use stuff&#8230; &nbsp;That&#39;s not so ugly, but is this what was actually done?</p>

		<p>The shell does have its own bugs for reporting file size like the infamous Vista status bar bug which misreports size (reports the double size and it keeps multiplying) as many times as you press Refresh. Explorer status bar also is going progressively worse in each version of Windows: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsdeveloperpreviewgeneral/thread/69de0cc1-b91b-4fd8-96c3-8299f8ed0488" rel="nofollow">social.msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/69de0cc1-b91b-4fd8-96c3-8299f8ed0488</a> Hiding useful info under the pretense of some insignificant performance gains has been in-fashion starting with the Vista shell, so users take double the number of steps for simple tasks like viewing size.</p>

		<p>@Mark:</p>
<p>Win32 tracks the current directory (SetCurrentDirectory). A partial path may go through conversion to a canonical path, by appending a current directory to it. But the filesystem driver might be able to do relative open by a partial path, because OBJECT_ATTRIBUTES includes a handle to the base directory. If you ask for &quot;stuff&quot; while in C:, the base directory in C:, and the relative path is &#39;stuff&#39;. If you&#39;re in C:Stuffthings, &#39;..&#39; entry in this directory points to c:stuff.</p>

		<p>Strangely enough, I observe on XP (I&#39;ll let others try other incarnations) that first findfile after boot certainly accesses MFT. It can be very slow, proportional to the number of files in the directory. Once the MFT entries are in the RAM is findfile fast.</p>

<p>So you&#39;re saying that it keeps track of the whole path, and to resolve .. it basically does simple string manipulation? &nbsp;And DOS worked this way too? &nbsp;Then why bother having .. appear as a directory entry in the first place, if you don&#39;t actually use it? &nbsp;This sounds like it would make resolving .. pretty slow, if you&#39;re in C:dir1dir2dir3dir4dir5dir6dir7dir8dir9, and you want .. then it would have to go all the way from c: to dir8. &nbsp;I suppose that this is not too slow, and perhaps it is fast enough to seem instantaneous, but it seems a bit wasteful. &nbsp;Or am I misunderstanding?</p>

		<p>So, is FindFirstFile the best way to access this &quot;fast&quot; metadata, for when you don&#39;t need all metadata?</p>

		<p>I like the original behavior better, imo half of the changes post XP64/Server 2003 are steps backwards. You keep saying &quot;..the file system folks say it wouldn&#39;t be too hard to add the feature, but nobody has asked for it&#8230;&quot;, but who asked for a feature of not showing the file size at all? I seriously doubt someone asked to make something that previously worked &quot;ok&quot; to not work at all.</p>
