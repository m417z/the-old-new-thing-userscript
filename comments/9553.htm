		<p>So, the problem is that WM_DESTROY is a notification, while WM_CLOSE is a command, and they were sending the notification as if it were a command?</p>
<p>Perhaps this was not obvious to them and they were thinking that WM_DESTROY was a command. That is, they probably were thinking that all DestroyWindow does is send or post or whatever is the correct term a WM_DESTROY message and that all the window deletion code was within DefWindowProc when called with WM_DESTROY.</p>
<p>This is why I like looking at the source code whenever I use a function I am not used to (or, when programming for Windows, look at the Wine source code, which should act similar enough).</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve long thought that Windows should have made more of a distinction between those messages that are commands and those that are notifications (WM_DESTROY vs WM_DESTROYING vs WM_DESTROYED). Obviously, that would involve inventing a time machine &#8212; it&#39;s way too late to fix it now. It just means that you can&#39;t assume that this is obvious from the message name.</p>

		<p>The last link goes to the top of the suggestion page rather than the specific comment. &nbsp;Looks like the redirect is dropping the target.</p>

		<p>Fortunately you can search for &quot;Arno&quot; on the suggestion box: &nbsp;An app with a window and a modal dialog box. &nbsp;If another app sends WM_DESTROY while the dialog is active, the app crashes, and the question is &quot;I mean, what is the standard way for an application to close wheter it has a modal box or not ? &quot;</p>
<p>I would assume the answer is an extension of the same&#8211;have both the parent window and the dialog box accept WM_CLOSE, or a user-defined message. &nbsp;If the dialog gets it, it would have to communicate to the parent window that it was told to shut down externally, probably by something like a certain value from nResult in EndDialog().</p>

		<p>That error is very easy to make. I remember making it as a beginner, until I read the documentation saying &quot;WM_DESTROY tells the window that it&#39;s being destroyed&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Cesar: The problem with doing that is that you don&#39;t know what&#39;s supposed to be a contract (maintained between versions) or an implementation detail (changes between versions). You need documentation to tell the difference.</p>

		<p>This is a good topic. Cause we involved with developers with big argument about the memory leak which cause the embedded system crash. We can see leak in the testing tool. Then we told the developer, he attacked our testing tool rather than fix the problem. Although the leak was getting better, but it was not resolved at all. But the system got crashed a less frequently then everybody was happy?</p>

		<p>Why not just make a rule that only the owner can send events from a window and prevent the error from being made in the first place? We seriously need to write a note about thinking about the long long term effects of the design for when the timemachine is completed.</p>

		<p>@henke37: I&#39;m pretty sure that the completion of the time machine will herald the end of thinking about design. &nbsp;After all, if our design is sub-optimal, we can always use the time-machine later, to fix it retroactively.</p>
<p>At least, that&#39;s the argument all managers will use to justify firing all architects, designers, and in fact any programmer who actually understands their trade and expects to be compensated correspondingly.</p>

<p>Hmmm. Last time I tried it it worked just fine, but that was in a 16 bit program on Win95.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure Raymond would agree that calling DestroyWindow on a window owned by another process is a bad idea.</p>

		<p>I notice that (on Vista at least) you can&#39;t send WM_CREATE from one thread to another, even within the same process. Odd that WM_DESTROY doesn&#39;t have the same restriction.</p>

		<p>Joshua:</p>
<p>Were you checking for memory leaks? While sending WM_DESTROY does work fine in that it provokes the window destroy action, it doesn&#39;t do the rest of the actions that calling DestroyWindow does.</p>
<p>So yes, sending the message even in Windows 7 &quot;works fine&quot; in the sense that the window is destroyed, it doesn&#39;t work fine in that none of the associated cleanup takes place.</p>

<p>For Win16 app in Windows 9x, there is only one thread (effectively) in the whole system. One can say that even Win32 apps in Win9x might not have had this DestroyWindow restriction, because the whole USER system was pretty much serialized.</p>

		<p>Caching the page doesn&#39;t help because the page doesn&#39;t actually have the comments on it. (Try visiting the blog with a browser with scripting disabled.) The target doesn&#39;t even exist until the (presumed) XHR has completed and the page populated. At this point you can then click Go again and the browser should just scroll to the link. (I&#39;m sure that this step could be automated.)</p>
<p>Earlier versions of the blogging software would output a number of comments (with a more link) and then XHR the rest (deleting the link) so you could at least link safely to a comment that made the cut.</p>
