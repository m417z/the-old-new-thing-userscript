		<p>&gt; UpdateIcon</p>
<p>So you push UpdateIcon onto your stack of search terms.</p>
<p>There&#39;s a much simpler way, though, which doesn&#39;t require source access. Just fire up a VM and put it into every possible state, while watching for balloons.</p>

<p>Halting Problem aside, that does sound like the correct solution. Once you&#39;ve covered 2^&lt;a few GB of typical RAM&gt; states, you even identified the corner cases where some applications coincidentally reimplements the whole shell or OS and displays its balloon tips in that.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m guessing the user thought they could look through the list and decide if there were any others they wanted to ask about disabling as well.</p>
<p>Since you&#39;re firing up the VM enumerator to get that list, you might as well save yourself some time and when you find the one with Windows 9 running in a VM then go ahead and make a copy. You should probably make a list of any notifications that it comes up with as well.</p>

		<p>For the benefit of those to come, Maurits was obviously joking.</p>
<p>Also: Do machines with finite storage have a halting problem? I am pretty sure they don&#39;t. (Modern computers are not UTMs because they have finite storage.) </p>
<p>I take it this is just shorthand for saying &quot;can only be solved by enumerating all possible states&quot;, which I am guessing would exceed the Bremmerman limit for the entire universe. (For all practical purposes the same thing as being incomputable.)</p>
<p>But is that true? Is it proven the minimum amount of computation needed to solve the halting problem for a computer with finite storage? We know it&#39;s finite, and also that it is smaller than enumerating all the states because lots of states solve easily, so you only have to enumerate the others&#8230; sounds like a log time operation to me. So I am not sure it is a valid objection in theory. (Obviously it is a valid objection in practice&#8230;.)</p>

		<p>it&#39;s not really 2^&lt;size of internet&gt;, but rather 2^&lt;size limit of the balloon tip (in bits)&gt; (probably considerably smaller).</p>
<p>You could simply write a 5 line program that enumerates all the possible balloon messages and ask the customer to run it in order to get a comprehensive list.</p>

		<p>@ dirk</p>
<p>Given that Windows handles managed code and given that managed code allows one to keep source code in a database and &quot;compile&quot; it at run time, I don&#39;t believe there is any scenario where one could enumerate all ballons or all aything else for that matter.</p>

		<p>Being programmers, I suppose we are all jumping to answer precisely what the customer asked &#8211; but as you note, there are actually ways to solve their problem (disabling annoying balloon tips).</p>
<p>Seems like over time Windows has built solutions just that problem &#8211; I can set preferences for each app in the notification bar. Really I think that&#39;s what they wanted, they just didn&#39;t know how to ask for it.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s simple, you run the code through an emulator that performs a brute force of every single starting condition and then watch for the messages that appear. Tell them you&#39;ve started looking and you&#39;ll get back to them once the list is complete.

		<p>It&#39;s part of the OS if the OS has been corrupted in such a way that the &quot;You are low on disk space!&quot; balloon text was replaced with &quot;Don&#39;t eat the yellow snow.&quot;, and the filesystem driver is corrupted so that it always reports low space, and whatever digital signatures exist were corrupted so that they are still valid.</p>

		<p>@Ben:</p>
<p>&gt; But is that true? Is it proven the minimum amount of computation needed to solve the halting problem for a computer with finite storage?</p>
<p>No, if only because for most interesting programs you would be able (and would want to *be* able) to submit a proof of termination that is far shorter than an enumeration of all possible states. However, it is true that enumerating all states is the only *general* solution that can work (that is, for any state space size you can devise a pathological machine that runs through all possible states before halting or repeating).</p>
<p>Determining the minimum amount of computation needed to solve the halting problem for any given finite state machine is probably undecidable. That is to say, I haven&#39;t the time or the immediate insight to prove you could reduce a solution for this to an undecidable problem, but I would be highly surprised if it was decidable. If it is, though, I would in turn be surprised to learn that the time/storage requirement for that algorithm isn&#39;t also exponential (so you&#39;ve gained nothing). My brain&#39;s too tired to back up my gut right now, maybe someone else has a proof handy (or a general theorem).</p>

		<p>I had a related demand to log in user readable form all possible errors in a .Net program heavily dependent on external apis and datafeeds. Task with this required feat, I wrapped every atomic operation the customer could understand and logged: Exception occured during XXXXX, dump exception details&#8230; When asked to work on clarifying every exception detail, I made a list of all possible exceptions in one component (at least a hundred) and asked them how many months/years they wished I work on this logging project, breaking it down component by component easily reaching an estimation in the hundred thousands possible errors. I then showed them some cryptic exceptions and asked them how should I put it in readable form or how much time they have to study computer science in order to understand them. Sometimes you really have to lose a lot of time in order to make someone understand.</p>

		<p>Let&#39;s play Defend The WTF:</p>
<p>* Maybe the customer was allowed to ask one question only for some weird reason but the problem they face would actually require a question and a follow-up. So they make the question very general in hope that they can deduce the answer in one go.</p>
<p>* Maybe the customer got this brilliant idea for an app that will make them millions &#8211; but if their question is too specific, Microsoft will guess what they&#39;re up to and write the app themselves! By asking a very general question, they won&#39;t give away any ideas.</p>

		<p>I am writing a web page, which will display in internet explorer 9, 10, and 11. Can you give me a list of the web pages IE can display? Even a partial list would be helpful. Thank you.</p>

		<p>I checked and fortunately for me, my pin is the only one missing from the list. So I am safe.</p>
<p>It&#39;s pretty lucky as I picked a random one.</p>
