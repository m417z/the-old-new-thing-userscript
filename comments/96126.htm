		<p>The one thing that I wonder is in Windows 10, does explorer use the universal crt?<br />
If I remember correctly, that problem was caused by everything using msvcrt.dll, including kernel32.dll, that caused the crt unload stuff to happen after just about everything.<br />
If explorer uses the universal crt for its runtime instead of msvcrt, wouldn&#8217;t this problem be non existent again because ucrtbase.dll would unload much earlier. (Unless of course if kernel32.dll also uses the universal crt.)</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think that can have been the problem, because unless you&#8217;re using a dodgy third-party product or a VERY old version of Visual Studio, you don&#8217;t get linked with msvcrt.dll, you get linked with msvcrtNNN.dll.</p>

		<p>Link tag on &#8220;link to&#8221; is corrupted. I only knew it was there because my mobile device highlighted it even though tapping it went nowhere.

		<p>Can you say this is true for the internal Windows components and the build process for Windows?<br />
The thing to remember here is that Windows never shipped with any version of the CRT pre-installed. So on a freshly installed system, there were no files named msvcrNNN.dll available. So that would mean that explorer couldn&#8217;t run, right? But it is the default shell, so it had to somehow run.<br />
Anyway, since the gcc compiler that comes with mingw normally linked against msvcrt.dll, are you calling gcc a dodgy third party product?<br />
Finally, your last sentence is no longer true. Visual Studio 2015 and newer no longer link to a library named msvcrNNN.dll. Probably as an effort to stop so many people from linking against msvcrt.dll, they introduced the universal crt, so new versions of Visual Studio link against ucrtbase.dll.</p>

		<p>Ah, I misunderstood what you were saying, you&#8217;re talking about the case where Explorer itself is experiencing the lackey problem.  I thought you were talking about third-party applications.  Careless reading on my part, sorry.</p>
<p>MinGW was indeed the dodgy third-party product I was alluding to.  Although I should note that the only reason I consider it dodgy is precisely because it links against msvcrt.dll, so I suppose this could be considered a &#8220;no true Scotsman&#8221; argument. :-)</p>
<p>And yes, I&#8217;m aware that the newer versions of Visual Studio use the uCRT.  I thought that could go without saying.  The important part of the sentence was &#8220;don&#8217;t get linked with msvcrt.dll&#8221;.</p>

		<p>No circular reasoning flaw here.<br />
It&#8217;s true that MinGW is dodgy because it uses the dodgy practice of linking to MSVCRT.DLL.<br />
But circular reasoning only kicks in if the argument that linking to MSVCRT.DLL is dodgy is made because only dodgy software does it.  And that&#8217;s not the argument, because there&#8217;s a better one.  Namely, that Microsoft rather officially said something along the lines of &#8220;MSVCRT is for Microsoft and not for thee&#8221;, but then MinGW went and linked to it anyway.  It&#8217;s the ignoring of the API contract that makes it dodgy.</p>
<p>(See Raymond&#8217;s earlier post for links to and explanation of the official statement, which I have only paraphrased <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140411-00/?p=1273/" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140411-00/?p=1273/</a>)</p>

		<p>Where is the famous time machine? Raymond/ms &#8220;official statement&#8221; was issued long after applications started to link against msvcrt.dll.</p>

		<p>There was no &#8220;official statement&#8221; because none was needed. msvcrt was never part of the Windows SDK. Anybody who was using it was doing so without any documentation. Do you need to make an official statement that you shouldn&#8217;t do undocumented things?</p>
