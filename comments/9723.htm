		<p>If those bushes were on private property, I would say that&#39;s more than enough reason to go question the guy and ask him to move along.</p>

		<p>Ah it&#39;s no fun being suspicious any more, what with all the cameras and stuff. I think I&#39;ll just go menace a tree somewhere instead.</p>

		<p>I can&#39;t help but wonder what exactly &quot;suspicious-looking&quot; means.</p>

		<p>It probably means &quot;hiding in the bushes.&quot;</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t understand the point of this story. Is it supposed to be funny/strange that the security guards are doing their job?</p>
<p>What did I miss?</p>

		<p>I think the point is that Security is aware of a suspicious-looking person lurking in the bushes outside of their secure building, but has apparently not questioned them as to their intentions, or done anything about it.</p>
<p>Just simply walking up to them and asking &quot;Can I help you?&quot; is generally sufficent- Of course, doing so with sufficent care in case the situation rapidly degrades.</p>

		<p>@Mark Sure, but then it sounds like an awfully boring job and watching someone &quot;stealthily&quot; sneak around outside seems like a somewhat fun occupation. It&#39;s not as if he could do much harm outside the building while being watched.</p>

		<p>It could be like the cow I saw on the side of the road. &nbsp;I was driving through rural Oregon and saw a cow outside the fence line right next to the road. &nbsp;Concerned about someone hitting the cow, I called the cops. &nbsp;The operator gave me the total brush off&#8230; &quot;Cow, road, got it. Bye&quot;</p>
<p>Only later did I learn that the cow was exactly where she was supposed to be&#8230; tethered to a long ground-level steel cable along the side of the road to trim the grass. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe the &quot;suspicious guy&quot; was the gardener.</p>

		<p>My son is (sadly, but it&#39;s a job after all) a security guard. One of the first things they are taught (and the main thing) is their job is to &quot;observe&quot;, not interfere. Perfect job for my boy&#8230;&#8230;..</p>

		<p>Recently a couple filmmakers were stuck overnight in an airport (DFW) when their flight was cancelled, so having nothing better to do and $30k worth of camera equipment, they made a short film. It caused a bit of a ruckus that they were able to run around the airport all night with nary a guard in sight.</p>
<p>Except the guards were watching them from the cameras &#8211; they just didn&#39;t care.</p>
<p>&quot;It&#39;s important to note that security agents observed the two filmmakers at several points during the making of the video. Because the filmmakers were presenting no threat to themselves, to others or to flight safety, and were causing no damage, there was no imperative to curtail their activities,&quot; Maga√±a said in a statement.</p>

		<p>Back in the day, when I worked at a defense company, we* were doing some tests of a not-a-network-but-a-switch and had left a cable running from one office bay to another. That evening, a security guard came across the cable, and not having been notified about it, took action. As in chop-chop with a fire axe. &nbsp;As far as he knew, that wire went straight to the Kremlin. &nbsp;(Though it wasn&#39;t actually a wire, but a very expensive fiber-optic cable.)</p>
<p>(* I say &quot;we&quot;, but I wasn&#39;t there &#8211; this was just a story that was passed down to me.)</p>

		<p>Alas, too bad that&#39;s not what the public wants&#8230; &quot;They did all that?!?! Why didn&#39;t you stop them?!?!&quot;.</p>
<p>A sucky job, really &#8211; damned if you do, damned if you don&#39;t. It may be the right thing (don&#39;t interfere), but I suppose people want blood because they had to suffer at airports and now a few yahoos were running amok in one.</p>

		<p>The opposite of my recent encounter with a suspicious looking guy who came in unwelcomed &#8211; I had to go and prompt security and nobody else even seemed to notice. The first people I mentioned it to actually tried to imagine that he was someone who was supposed to be there and discouraged me from doing anything about it(!).</p>
<p>It wasn&#39;t the security guard&#39;s fault this happened though &#8211; one guy can&#39;t see everything all of the time. Its whoever thought one security guard and a few cameras might be good enough&#8230;</p>
