		<p>When you say &quot;If you ran into a problem with a Western language, like say, German, then you were out of luck, since there was no German Windows code base&quot;, do you mean a problem that requires a code change specific to German?</p>

		<p>@Gabe,</p>
<p>For example in English we say &quot;one hat&quot; &quot;two hats&quot; or sometimes &quot;one hat(s)&quot;. &nbsp;That doesn&#39;t work in every language. &nbsp;Especially languages that have multiple plural forms (i.e. different words for hat when talking about two hats or three hats).</p>
<p>An example in German might be that 22 is &quot;twenty two&quot; in English, but &quot;two and twenty&quot; in German. &nbsp;It is very possible that the English UI team puts something together that cannot work like that.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt; do you mean a problem that requires a code change specific to German?</p>
<p>Raymond gave an example of something that would require a code change to fix things for German:</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>a command line tool asked the user a yes/no question, promting [sic] &quot;J/N&quot; (Ja/Nein), but if you wanted to answer in the affirmative, you had to type &quot;Y&quot;.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>The code change wouldn&#39;t have a noticeable effect in English; however, the change wasn&#39;t German-specific (other languages might benefit).</p>
<div class="post">[<i>That didn&#39;t require a code change. The German localizers merely forgot to localize the Y to a J (probably because the Y was not clearly documented as to what it represented, so they played it safe and left it alone). -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>@SimonRev: Grammatical number formats are a pain. There are at least four grammatical forms you have to handle (&#39;one, two, many, lots&#39; as an approximation) and the exact rules for which form to use for each number is different for different languages.</p>

<p>&#8230;yes I have implemented this! Kind of. We have the framework but right now we&#39;ve only implemented the English number-&gt;form mapping.</p>

		<p>@Joshua:</p>
<p>Distributing the patches that you need is great until you find that the same patch breaks someone else&#39;s software. (They don&#39;t need the patch, so they never tested against it.) At least when patches come from MS through (say) Windows Update, the end-user will blame MS rather than you.</p>

		<p>@Raymond: &quot;Or are you suggesting that we take the Internet and send it in a time machine back to 1992?&quot;</p>
<p>What you meant to say is that the internet did exist in 1992, but that a) Windows/DOS didn&#39;t support TCP/IP, SLIP, PPP, etc directly, and b) the general population did not have access to the internet yet.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been around long enough to remember BITNET and ARPANET. RELAY was the name of the &quot;chat&quot; program over BITNET, and was popular with us college kids back then. We distributed a lot of files back then too (of questionable educational and moral benefit).</p>

		<p>Back to topic, I remember that there were lots of 3rd party patching software for Win3.1/Win9X to support Chinese. Some will even translate even menu item to (sometimes non-sense) Chinese. I wonder how did they do that at that time.</p>
<p>Also, was installing hooks not allowed for the teams doing localization works? I think it could effectively modify Windows behaviour without affecting the stability of English version of Windows. (Evade reset escrow bar) The language supplements could be sold as seperate package like &quot;Plus!&quot; at that time.</p>

		<p>&quot;A menu item Sort was translated as Art (as in &quot;What sort of person would do this?&quot;) rather than Sortieren (&quot;put in a prearranged order&quot;)&quot;</p>
<p>That reminds me of a mistranslation in Star Wars, Episode 2. Cliegg Lars there talks about how, after losing a leg, he &quot;cannot ride any more&quot; (i.e. speeder bikers etc.). In the German translation, he literally says &quot;Seit [&#8230;] kann ich kein Pferd mehr reiten&quot;, which means &quot;Since [&#8230;] I cannot ride a horse&quot;. Except that in Star Wars there are no horses at all, and the translator apparently did not know this.</p>
<p>After a while I came to the conclusion that whenever possible, I watch movies and play games in their original English version. Some translations are mediocre, some are good, but very few are really stellar and able to capture the original, and a lot are a mixed affair. For example, in the series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, sometimes a joke is translated in a way to perfectly convey the literal meaning and a hidden joke or allusion, while other times there are conversations between the characters that make little sense until you imagine what they would have sounded in English, and after a while I got a pretty good grasp on what the original text was before a bad translation.</p>
<p>A stellar example of English-to-German localization, however, is the British series &quot;Little Britain&quot;. For the localization, they hired two (very good) German comedians who even managed to convey jokes that would only make sense for a British, like replacing names of movie actors or musicians not known outside of the UK with the names of German actors/musicians with a very similar reputation.</p>

		<p>@Mephane: Did they localise the title as well? ;-)</p>
<p>Obligatory rant: WFW3.11&#39;s TCP/IP sucked, based on the speed of a third party database client/server compared to either a different third party TCP/IP stack or Windows 95.</p>

		<p>Speaking of &quot;Patches didn&#39;t exist back then, there being no mechanism for distributing them&quot;, I remember when Windows Update debuted. &nbsp;Many Web sites were vehemently against the whole idea. &nbsp;I read comments like &quot;This is a horrible idea&quot;; &quot;I want to update my software, not Microsoft&quot;; &quot;Who do they think they are, trying to update MY computer&quot;; &quot;I&#39;ll decide what patches need to be applied&quot;; advice to not turn on automatic updates; and so on.</p>
<p>The whole industry has come a long way since then in making good use of automatic software updates and security patches.</p>

		<p>@Mephane: the problem is that you need to know a language quite well before watching movies (reading books) in that language is better for understanding than having a mediocre to good translator. only if you yourself know that language pretty well you have a *chance* to grok the hidden meanings. If you still struggle with it by any means watch in this language (read it) to improve that language skills but don&#39;t expect to understand everything in all layers. Most translations are in fact quite good, especially if the translator had enough time (i.e. not releasing the same day worldwide) </p>

		<p>@Wolf does the data you are looking in indicate how Y/N is handled in any of them? (Are there any of them that are large enough to have locale use cases, either on windows, in any unix OS, or in CLDR?)</p>

		<p>@David Walker: Indeed. Especially after once or twice accidents that updates breaks some computer in production after rollout.</p>
<p>The patch testing process has been much much more rigid since that, however I still know some I.T. staffs prefer to hold the updates 1 month before approving them in their WSUS servers.</p>

		<p>@Wolf: I think it&#39;s better to leave it as (Y/N) then. Just like in Chinese version, the &quot;choices&quot; are always shown as &quot;是(Y)/否(N)&quot; or &quot;確認(O)/取消(C)&quot;.</p>

		<p>I remember a small but painful bug in Win98 First Edition PL.</p>
<p>ipconfig /? listed all the /switches as usual, in English, but some (all? don&#39;t remember) of them didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>After a while of trying to find out why &quot;ipconfig /all&quot; didn&#39;t work, I&#39;ve had a crazy idea&#8230;</p>
<p>ipconfig /wszystko</p>
<p>Worked.</p>
<p>Someone over-eagerly translated the switch (bye-bye, script compatibility), and to add insult to injury, didn&#39;t translate it in the /? listing.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: Distributing the patches that you need is great until you find that the same patch breaks someone else&#39;s software. (They don&#39;t need the patch, so they never tested against it.) At least when patches come from MS through (say) Windows Update, the end-user will blame MS rather than you.</p>
<p>When the applications which breaks is developed by MSFT, it justified. I will not namn any but atleast two *server* softwares has been totally incompatible (endless crashing) with Windows Server OS hotfixes. These problems often results in a very obvious cash loss. One would expect MSFT software to be more Windows compatible.</p>
