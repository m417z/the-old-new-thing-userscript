		<p>You seem to enjoy a lot of quality music.</p>
<p>Do you have a hi-resolution sound system such as SACD or DVD-Audio?</p>

		<p>Do you still pursue performing/playing in a local group ? (active versus passive attending other performances). And what instrument(s) did you play ?</p>

		<p>The most amazing thing is that you made a note for something to do in 4 years. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t know where I could put a note that would remind me in 4 years. &nbsp; I guess if I ever get transported to far in the past and need to save myself by sending future me a warning, I&#8217;m screwed.</p>

		<p>Just make an Outlook reminder dated in 2011. &nbsp;I&#8217;m guessing that Raymond keeps a continuous &quot;.pst&quot; that goes from computer to computer when he upgrades.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m consistently amazed at some of the things that are pre-emptively addressed in the nitpicker&#8217;s corner. Might I suggest that anyone who feels it answers important issues stay where they belong by reading other blogs instead, such as Steve Gillmor&#8217;s or Dave Whiner&#8217;s?</p>

		<p>Thanks, Raymond, for telling it like it is (was). Kids need adults to be honest about their strengths and weaknesses.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m curious to know whether the audience gave a standing ovation. In my community (central PA) this is standard procedure at every high school concert. When I remain seated, everybody looks at me like I&#8217;m a schmuck.</p>
<p>If we give every performance a standing ovation, then how are we supposed to act when we hear something truly great? All of the superlatives in our spoken and body languages are becoming meaningless.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, every student gets a 95% in band or chorus if they just show up. 100% if they try out for districts. I&#8217;m not making this up.</p>

		<p>Tentative playing is always an issue for strings.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just been to a local youth players gala performance, with the age and experience of the players increasing during the evening. The younger players bow slowly and carefully, giving a horrible grating sound on quiet pieces, or on muted entries. The older players seem to bow with more gusto, and have a cleaner sound as a result.</p>
<p>There does seem to be this dread of being first &#8211; I suspect a row of musicians wait for one to come in, and then pile in afterwards. Yuk!</p>
<p>(experience &#8211; never progressing beyond 3rd Clarinet in a Junior Band many years ago).</p>
