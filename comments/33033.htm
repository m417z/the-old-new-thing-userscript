		<p>Have you seen &quot;The Ed Helms Report: College Recruiting Edition?&quot; It&#8217;s hillarious! He tries to argue that MS is evil, interviewing people who on Microsoft&#8217;s campus who work there, and comes up with nothing.</p>
<p>Classic moments:</p>
<p>Ed says he first turned to his anonymous sources for information. Just after that, you see him going to Google and searching for &quot;Microsoft evil&quot; or something like that. ;)</p>
<p>&quot;You called it&#8230; the X-BOX?!?!?! &#8230;. HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!&quot;</p>
<p>Ed goes around and steals a bunch of free drinks and junk food.</p>
<p>Any chance that video will find its way onto Microsoft&#8217;s site? ;)</p>

		<p>Excellent articles &#8212; thanks for the links.  I love the Daily Show, and that piece by Samantha Bee on bullying was brilliant.</p>

		<p>We were cracking up at the &quot;Rick James&quot; segment from Hattiesburg, MS when it aired a few months ago.  I&#8217;m not surprised he didn&#8217;t win the election.  I figured not many (voting) people in the area watched the daily show.</p>
<p>In my opinion, the funniest segment ever was Stephen Colbert&#8217;s &quot;Storm Tracker Tracker.</p>

		<p>A good friend of mine was interviewed by a Daily Show reporter. Friend asked what he was supposed to do &#8212; try to be funny? Reporter said, &#8216;just play it straight&#8217;, and the reporter did his schtick while my buddy played the straight man.</p>
<p>Same friend was interviewed by a newspaper. Article was about being interviewed on the Daily Show. Another thing Friend said, which came from said article: the Daily Show doesn&#8217;t look to make idiots out of people they interview, so if someone comes off like a complete dolt, it might not be because of the Daily Show.</p>
