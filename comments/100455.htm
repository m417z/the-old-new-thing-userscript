		<p>Once again, your article is timed perfectly with something I&#8217;m about to deal with. Thanks!</p>

		<p>I found out some of the above by accident (not the low-privilege process part though; being prepared for future exploits there is pretty clever). I have a setup where most[1] of the profile of User A is stored on a special drive[2] and I must log in as User B to enable the drive before logging in as User A[3]. I had the clever idea of setting the login screen background to a picture on the special drive so it would fail to show up if the drive was unavailable. Pretty soon I found that the image is cached so my clever plan doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>[1] Windows provides a UI button in all the special profile folders&#8217; properties boxes to let you move the normal folders that hold their content. I found that moving &#8230;/AppData/Local to another drive causes many programs like the start menu and Edge to be not-runnable after next login, so I&#8217;ve kept that on the normal drive. It&#8217;s a pity because the web cache within &#8230;/AppData/Local is just the sort of thing I&#8217;d want to move.</p>
<p>[2] It&#8217;s a Truecrypt volume mounted at a drive letter. I&#8217;d encrypt the whole drive but for some reason me attempting to encrypt the whole volume causes Truecrypt to do its preliminary install, but after rebooting roll back the change, presumably because a check in the preliminary install indicated full encryption would make the machine unbootable.</p>
<p>[3] Also I have to log out of User A and log in as User B to shut down the machine so at next startup Windows doesn&#8217;t try to (AFAICT) pre-fetch User A&#8217;s profile and end up caching the &#8220;missing&#8221; files. I&#8217;m kinda surprised that Windows doesn&#8217;t handle missing drives better in this situation because of situations like profiles being on network drives, though I guess in that case the drive is *defined* and inaccessible, as opposed to a non-mounted Truecrypt volume which is just not defined yet.</p>

		<p>&lt;&gt; the system uses a low-privilege process to decode the image. . . . . The result is then re-encoded and saved in a protected location.&lt;&gt;<br />
How is a &#8220;low privilege&#8221; process able to save a file to a &#8220;protected location?  Doesn&#8217;t that defeat the purpose of a low-privilege process and protected location?</p>

		<p>Use your imagination. One possibility: The low-privilege process hands the decoded pixels back to the high-privilege process. The high-privilege process re-encodes the pixels and saves them in a protected location.</p>

		<p>I figured this one out for myself when I tried to replace that drab beach-and-cave image of Windows 10 without users screaming at me for having lost Windows Spotlight.</p>
<p>Of course, now that the Spotlight is permanently lost, I think I can use group policy without reverse-engineering Windows and committing copyright violation (even though the violation is <i>de minimis</i>).</p>

		<p>Spotlight hasn&#8217;t been &#8220;permanently lost&#8221;. It works for me and everyone I support.</p>

		<p>Microsoft servers have ceased serving contents in two dozens of countries in the world. Spotlight is host on those servers and I live in one of those countries.</p>

		<p>So, is this also the reason that my perfectly beautiful BMP gets mangled into an JPG of questionable compression?</p>
