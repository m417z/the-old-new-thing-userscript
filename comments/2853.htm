		<p>@Peter: </p>
<p>Totally agree. If you have to give any installer that you&#39;ve downloaded from some site all privileges, it&#39;s rather scary. I&#39;d rather prefer to not allow a non-MS signed (or unsigned) installer to install any privileged services or write to privileged directories, or install drivers.</p>

		<p>&quot;Um, if you have write permission in C:Program Files, you can pwn the machine. That&#39;s why we have per-user install. -Raymond&quot;</p>
<p>Right. &nbsp;That&#39;s really my point. &nbsp;I always get a chill when I install a new program and Windows asks me &quot;Do you want to allow program X to make changes to your computer? &nbsp;Yes/No&quot; &nbsp;I do, but I&#39;d really like a say in what changes it&#39;s allowed to make. &nbsp;Copy files to a new directory in under C:Program Files? &nbsp;Sure. &nbsp;Install services and device drivers? &nbsp;Not so much. &nbsp;That being said, I do like UAC. &nbsp;I think it&#39;s a huge improvement over what we had previously, but it&#39;s not enough.</p>
<p>@Joshua: I&#39;m not sure why this is a &quot;dark corridor.&quot; &nbsp;It sounds like a great idea to me.</p>

		<p>@Peter: Well, here is the problem: Even if there was more granular security that issued different prompts for different administrative task (say, one prompt for writing in Program Files folder and one prompt in Windows Registry), the user would zealously answered both prompts the same and thought &quot;who the hell designed this granular UAC?&quot;</p>
<p>If you like such a system, there are third-party security suites that add such a feature. But I personally find testing unknown apps in virtualized testbed more promising.</p>

		<p>&gt; I do, but I&#39;d really like a say in what changes it&#39;s allowed to make.</p>
<p>But then we end up with the mess like we have for mobile app permissions. &nbsp;Eventually 90% of the apps will just request all permissions because it makes things easier (for them to use and abuse, not at all for you).</p>
<p>The only reasonable answer is what Raymond said. Look for a &quot;portable&quot; archive or per-user installer. If you can&#39;t find one, ask them for one. If you can&#39;t or they won&#39;t offer one, there are still a few options.</p>
<p>&#8211; Extract the installer&#39;s contents using something like 7-Zip (which can open almost any archive format)</p>
<p>&#8211; Use the installer software&#39;s built-in switches (can require some detective work to determine the kind of installer and/or guessing of switches).</p>
<p>&#8211; Install in a virtual machine and install the software there. Then copy and paste the extracted program onto your computer.</p>
<p>An awful lot of &quot;installers&quot; are completely spurious and do little more than add a shortcut to the desktop and an entry to the Add/Remove control panel.</p>

		<p>UAC is not a security boundary, it&#39;s merely a convenience feature that allows compliant applications to elect to run with lower privileges. An Administrator running with UAC enabled is *still* an Administrator and thus the various mechanisms to supposedly bypass it aren&#39;t classed as vulnerabilities &#8211; they will all fail if a non-Administrator is logged on, because the process can&#39;t elevate without an Administrator providing credentials.</p>

		<p>Well, sorry, security and covenience rarely go along. Some people remove password protection from the SSL&#39;s private key on their servers because &quot;I can&#39;t enter the password for every bloody packet now can I?&quot;</p>
<p>However, I agree about the option &quot;Try to run the program even without permissions it asked for&quot;, but what, say, GetContactList should do without a permission? Return ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED or pretend that the contact list is empty?</p>

		<p>Joker_vD: Funny you should ask.</p>
<p>If you make GetContactList return ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED, iTunes may refuse to run (even though you&#39;re not actually using its &quot;social&quot; features). Maybe it&#39;s intentionally being malicious, preventing you from using the app without its viral features, or (more likely) it goes to initialize the feature on startup and nobody thought to catch the exception.</p>
<p>On the other hand, what happens if you just pretend the contact list is empty? You end up with a randomly broken app. Whenever the app goes to use the feature you disabled, it won&#39;t work and the app won&#39;t be able to tell you why. All you&#39;ll know is that you can&#39;t email your playlist to your friend. You won&#39;t know that it&#39;s because you denied access to your contact list.</p>
<p>What app author wants the support hassles of trying to debug random breakage. If I ask to use 10 privileges, that means 1k different configurations!</p>

		<p>@Nick, comparing snapshots after installing in a virtual machine, you can theoretically create manifests for registry-free com.</p>
<p>.NET could almost be used this way, if it weren&#39;t for WXP+ treating .NET PE&#39;s specially on process creation.</p>
<p>It could at least probably allow having a small custom application launching .NET through COM and loading the atual assembly with the Main() method. (Remember how 32-bit .NET EXE&#39;s still have a stub that is run in W2K?) For isolated applications, this could be just enough.</p>

<p>Except .NET isn&#39;t just a set of libraries. .NET is hooked into the system, and .NET code is compiled at runtime. .NET depends on other system updates, which depend on other system updates, etc etc.</p>
<p>Having individual versions of .NET libraries floating around would cause other problems, too:</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m getting errors running .NET 6.2 applications, they throw exceptions on a random set of obscure.function calls.&quot;</p>
<p>*40 hours later*</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, I installed Poorly_Designed_Widget, and it put Obscure.Function.Assembly.DLL v5.1.6827-Tiny.NET in my path, got rid of that and everything else works, but how do I get Poorly_Designed_Widget to run alongside .NET 6.2?! It is critical, we can&#39;t get updates since the author died in a freak accident involving a shark, two unicyclists, and some spray cheese. Stupid Microsoft, always breaking things with their updates!&quot;</p>

		<p>&gt; What other framework allows you to do such a thing? Java? Python? Ruby?</p>
<p>All of them. Those are implemented as normal programs. Just copy the interpreter binary (and maybe the shared libraries it needs) to some directory and execute it with a Perl/Python/Ruby/Java program as an argument. Done. I can imagine this would be perfectly possible with NET, too. I don&#39;t know that much about it, though.</p>
<p>Giving up on nice automatic updating as a system component would be a major downside IMHO. All recent Windows variants ship with NET by default anyway, right?</p>

		<p>@lsl: It&#39;s included as Windows feature, but not a default installed one. Someone has to enable (install) it to use it.</p>
<p>If the company doesn&#39;t use .NET internally, and doesn&#39;t use ATI display cards (their control center uses .NET framework), you cannot expect their technical support to enable it be default.</p>

		<p>@Anon: That&#39;s why I said &quot;trimmed down version&quot;.</p>
<p>You know the Windows Server Core versions doesn&#39;t ship with GDI+ libraries so the original .NET runtime won&#39;t install on that? However that also means these servers cannot serve ASP.NET pages, therefore Microsoft release a trimmed down copy of .NET runtime that doesn&#39;t require GDI+ to enable .NET runtime be installed there.</p>
