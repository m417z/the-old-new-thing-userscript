		<p>This year, your method is probably just as good as most. I hear from all my friends who play that it&#8217;s almost a complete crap-shoot.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m a bit disappointed here. Since this professor showed that seeds (which is the team ranking, right?) become useless once only eight teams remain, you give up your method and do the coin flips instead, as suggested. This expert was talking about the regular seeds, not Raymond-optimized seeds!</p>
<p>What if your ponderated seeds didn&#8217;t suffer the same shortcomings as the regular ones?</p>
<p>I guess we&#8217;ll never know, since YOU GAVE UP! ;)</p>

<p>You could assign &quot;heads&quot; to the team with the most hits, and then do a coin flip&#8230;</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Because Raymond hits a nerve of truth by poking fun &amp; exposing the train wreck that is all other supposedly-serious-and-legitimate-but-just-as-flawed systems of selecting winning teams.</p>
<p>And I like basketball. &nbsp;I just can&#8217;t stand most fans&#8217; &amp; even commentators&#8217; ridiculous predictions of how a 65 team bracket is going to play out. &nbsp;If any one of a billion fans truly could pick a majority of the winners, they&#8217;d make enough money gambling to own one or more of the teams &#8212; I mean schools.</p>

		<p>I was waiting for this post too, don&#8217;t know why but I was.</p>
<p>With that said, I think a post should be made about last years results, I don&#8217;t think you ever followed up.</p>

		<p>Flipping coins&#8230; &nbsp; If you flip a coin 20 times in a row, and record the results, and then calculate the odds that you would have gotten the sequence you just saw, you can conclude that a miracle just happened.</p>
<p>Speaking of miracles, I&#8217;m wishing that either one of the New Mexico schools would do something here&#8230;</p>

		<p>I think the &quot;divided by seed&quot; element is a bit extreme. &nbsp;I know it&#8217;s designed to give the better teams the advantage, but it seems to be working too well, generally making the top 4 seeds, the final four in that division. (only 3 of the final 16 weren&#8217;t seeded 1&#8230;4 in their division)</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>The odds that that particular sequence would come up will always be 2^20, or roughly, 1 in a million. &nbsp; (Your point is still valid; I just wanted to save you some time on that middle step&#8230;)</p>

		<p>By &#8220;ponderated seeds&#8221;, I meant &#8220;weighted seeds&#8221;. Ponderated was a bad translation from French.</p>
<p>And by &#8220;we&#8217;ll never know&#8221;, I meant &#8220;knowing whether your formula would have worked until the end will require work from us, which is intolerable&#8221;</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s still something I don&#8217;t understand about your method, for instance:</p>
<p>Cornell/12=5000</p>
<p>Temple/5=6520</p>
<p>Why does Cornell win?</p>

		<p>I find it extremely interesting that Texas A&amp;M and Cornell have the most hits overall, even more than traditional powers like Kansas, Duke, and Kentucky. Does anyone have any possible explanations for this?</p>
