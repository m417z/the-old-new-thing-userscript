		<p>I had heard of the place before by spotting one of their billboards out on the interstate, possibly at the end of their advertising network, merely a yellow defaced [THE THING?] on my way towards Vegas.</p>
<p>I visited this roadside store and museum just last year, it was pretty interesting in the way most of the &#8216;odd desert roadside&#8217; attractions are. &nbsp;Pay two dollars to see The Thing?&#8230;who could pass up that deal? &nbsp;(I might have been able to save a buck if I&#8217;d closed one eye.)</p>

		<p>The real mystery: &nbsp;How do we even know if the thing is real or not?</p>
<p>If the thing ever did explode at someone, it should have been detected by seismographs world wide.</p>
<p>There even used to be a photo of me somewhere on the web. &nbsp;But is there a photo of the thing? &nbsp;Nooooo. &nbsp;I&#8217;m suspicious.</p>

		<p>Raymond how could you! &nbsp;I live within 30 minutes of &quot;The Thing&quot; and for the last 25 years have driving by that exit at least 100 times. &nbsp;I have never stopped to see what it was and never asked anyone what it was. &nbsp;I would just let my imagination go wild. &nbsp;Now I know what it is! &nbsp;Oh well I guess I will now have imagine where in the rocky crevices of the Dragoons Cochise&#8217;s was laid to rest a few miles west of The Thing.</p>

		<p>Is it an old or new thing, though?</p>
