		<p>&gt;As one of my colleagues noted, &quot;I&#39;m glad all of this happened before YouTube.&quot;</p>
<p>Sounds like this colleague is the guilty party. Anyone else would want to see it</p>

		<p>I bet it was Todd. &nbsp;Some time ago, the company I was working for moved into a new building. &nbsp;Before they built out the warehouse, though, our Todd took his Corvette for a few laps inside. &nbsp;He left a few tire marks; I don&#39;t remember who was stuck with cleaning them up. &nbsp;Probably things had to be cleaned before the build out anyway.</p>

		<p>I have searched in vain for years for the photograph *I know I still have* of the motorcycle/rider in the hall of building 2. &nbsp;It&#39;s my white whale of MS mementos. &nbsp;Also FWIW, I thought it was Dave at the time.</p>

		<p>I worked in a building next to the Win95 building(s) during that time but unfortunately as a contractor. I remember a whole lot of activity that day.</p>

		<p>I was a summer intern then. &nbsp; &nbsp;I remember the motorcycle burn marks in a hallway, I think it was in Building #5.</p>
<p>I also have a vague memory of something being thrown from the upperlevel of the building lobby and smashing a coffee-table sitting in the lobby.</p>
<p>It was pretty crazy.</p>

		<p>I was thinking about Windows 95 coming up on 20 years ago (released Aug 24, 1995) just a few days ago. &nbsp;If it&#39;s crazy for me to think about that, I can only imagine what it&#39;s like to look at it from the perspective of a developer who&#39;s still working on the next, next, next, next, next, next generation of the operating system :) &nbsp;Congrats on such success kicking off the first of what most people today would still probably recognize as &quot;Windows&quot;. &nbsp;</p>
<p>If you were so inclined, I know I would be very interested in reading an introspective on the progress from Windows 95 to Windows 10 from your point of view &#8212; what&#39;s changed on the development side, the user side, your favorite highlights, what&#39;s better, what&#39;s worse, and everything in between.</p>
<p>This also must mean that you&#39;ve been at Microsoft for at least 20 years. &nbsp;I hope you got a fancy belt buckle or sword [1] or something else nice!</p>

		<p>@Nico: &nbsp;The 20 year award at Microsoft is a clear glass obelisk, kind of quartz-looking, with a horizontal yellow/amber tint stripe through the middle. &nbsp;You can see the awards by doing a Google image search for &quot;Microsoft 20 year award&quot;.</p>
<p>@Cheong00: &nbsp;A couple Excel developers wrote that. &nbsp;They&#39;d been spending time playing Doom and wanted to write their own 3D game.</p>
