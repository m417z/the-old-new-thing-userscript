		<p>SHGetLocalizedName is too low level and was added to Vista because of the changes to SKU/languages but you had special folder names before this, XP had custom names for the document folders that included the username when you view them in My Computer IIRC.</p>
<p>The correct way of thinking about this is that you want the same name as Explorer and this is the shell displayname and various settings controls what this name looks like (with or without file extensions etc.) and it would be possible for MS to add a setting so you could disable the fancy userprofile name.</p>

		<p>Every time I read a question like this I wonder if the real problem is a lack of abstraction around the filesystem.  Explorer already &#8220;wraps&#8221; the underlying files and directories, so maybe it would make sense for there to be a virtual layer which automatically handles translations like this which could be used by Explorer as well as third party programs.  After all, while there are times a program does want to know the &#8220;real&#8221; file and folder names, don&#8217;t users usually want to see and interact with the localized and customized view?</p>
<p>Is that crazy? (or does it already exist and nobody uses it?)</p>

		<p>This layer of abstraction exists; it&#8217;s called &#8220;shell namespace&#8221;. It&#8217;s mentioned in the article you are commenting on.</p>

		<p>It does exist; IShellFolder &amp; IShellItem. The downside is that this is shell+COM and there are a lot of undocumented interfaces, try hosting those fancy control panel items that take over the whole view etc. (IExplorerBrowser solves some of these issues but removes too much control over the UI).</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p>They used SHGet­Localized­Name on the user profile folder and it failed. Why the fail case (&#8220;use the raw file system name&#8221;) didn&#8217;t work for them? Let&#8217;s say a user is called Sara Kerrigan and her profile folder is QueenOfBlades.WINDOWS. Explorer shows the latter, not the former.</p>

		<p>It depends on where you see the folder in the namespace tree. Sure, inside c:\users it is a normal folder like any other but the folder might appear in other places (FOLDERID_UserFiles etc.) and is not the exact same thing when you stay in the PIDL/IShellFolder domain but once you convert the PIDL to a path you end up in filesystem land and there is no way back.</p>
