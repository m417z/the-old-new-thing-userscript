<p>Along the lines of  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/08/25/54700.aspx">  Windows as Rorschach test</a>,  here's an example of someone attributing malicious behavior  to randomness.</p>
<p>  Among the logon pictures that come with Windows XP is  a martial arts kick.  I remember one bug we got that went something like this:  </p>
<p>  "Windows XP is racist.  It put a picture of a kung fu fighter  next to my name - just because my name is Chinese.  This is an insult!"  </p>
<p>  The initial user picture is chosen at random from  among the pictures in the "%ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Application  Data\Microsoft\User Account Pictures\Default Pictures" directory.  It just so happened that the random number generator  picked the martial arts kick out of the 21 available pictures.  </p>
<p>  I'm also frustrated by people who find quirks in spellcheckers  and attribute malicious intent to them.  You know what I'm talking about.  "Go to Word and type in &lt;some name that's not in the  dictionary&gt; and tell it to spellcheck.  Word will flag the  word and recommend &lt;some other word that is somehow opposite  to the first word in meaning&gt; instead.  This is an insult!  Microsoft intentionally taught the spellchecker to suggest  &lt;that word&gt; when you type &lt;this word&gt;.  This is clear proof of &lt;some bad thing&gt;."  </p>
<p>  More on spell checking tomorrow.  </p>

		<p>I always wondered about the &quot;random&quot; picture assigned to you by Windows XP.  It seems to me that the selection is not as random as it could be.  I do a lot of unattended installs and every time I install with the same unattend.txt file I get the chess pieces.  If I modify it slightly I tend to get another picture.  How are the pictures assigned really?  Is there some way to pre-select a picture?</p>

		<p>So are you saying that Microsoft don&#8217;t do a lexical analysis on the user name and then use the results to look up the correct stereo type for that name in a large data base and use the results to select the &#8216;correct&#8217; icon?  How lazy are you people?</p>

<p>One of the really great things about conspiracy theories is that they can&#8217;t be disproven. If someone is convinced that the Word spellchecker is communicating secret messages about how Strom Thurmond was actually Hillary Clinton&#8217;s illegitimate daughter (&quot;See, if you type in &#8216;Strom&#8217; and then convert his name to WingDings and then &#8230;&quot;), by golly, nothing that anyone says can disprove that. On the contrary, any discussion is obviously just part of the coverup. :-)

		<p>Sometimes the spell checker &quot;bugs&quot; can be intentional.  In Adobe PageMill (anybody remember it?  Early web page editor, c. 1996) the spell checker would flag &quot;FrontPage&quot; as a misspelling and suggest &quot;PageMill&quot; as a replacement.</p>

		<p>I always get a chuckle when XP picks the palm trees picture for me. I figured it looked at my time zone (Pacific), guessed that I live in LA (based on probability and the relative population size of LA to other major cities in the time zone), and picked the palm trees. ;)</p>

<p>Unfortunately no.  They got garbage complaints about the garbage, instead of getting real complaints about the real broken stuff.  So they didn&#8217;t get what they deserved.  They got an opportunity to continue to ignore the real broken stuff and instead complain about the garbage complaints about the garbage.</p>

		<p>I find it curious that Windows just assigns the icon randomly.  The downside is that if I set up the same accounts on multiple machines, I won&#8217;t have the same icons for the same people by default.</p>
<p>(Yes, I know how to change the icons in the user settings page, but I&#8217;d bet that many &quot;typical&quot; users dont.  Plus I&#8217;m lazy.  &lt;g&gt;)</p>
<p>It would make more sense to me if the icons were assigned randomly, but consistently for any particular name.  E.g., a good algorithm might be:</p>
<p>1.  Get a hash of the user name.</p>
<p>2.  If there are 24 icons, assign the icon of (hash value) mod 24.</p>
<p>Then the icon would be pseudo random, but a user would get the same &quot;random&quot; icon on every computer.</p>

		<p>Robert: your algorithm would still suffer from the problems which are described by Raymond.  Whenever the Chinese user created an account using your hash they may always be presented with the Kung-fu fighter (depending on their name, of course).</p>
<p>At least Microsoft can currently claim it is completely random.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
