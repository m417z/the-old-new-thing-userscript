<p>         I understand that Kinder Surprise eggs are illegal in the US for two reasons.      </p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>                 Small parts. But that can be fixed by labelling the egg as "for ages 3 and up".              </p>
</li>
<li>             The FDA has a rule banning "inedible material completely enclosed by edible material".             Apparently they think somebody is going to stupidly pop the entire egg in their mouth             and try to swallow it hole? Psst, FDA, maybe you should ban peaches, too. I understand             the pit is inedible.          </li>
</ol>
<p>         Whenever I go to Germany I smuggle some Kinder &Uuml;berraschungen into the States. (Yes,         they're also available in Canada, but if you got them from Canada, they wouldn't be         in German now would they?) (Yes, I know that the candy is originally from Italy.)      </p>
<p>         I'm told that in Germany, children will often buy &Uuml;berraschungen on the playground         from a street vendor, who asks them whether they prefer "Etwas zu sammeln oder etwas         zu bauen?" - "Something to collect (a figurine) or something to build?" But how do         they know?      </p>
<p>         They guess by shaking the egg and listening to the rattling.      </p>
<p>     If you ask for something to build and you end up getting something to collect, the     excuse is, "Well, our regular shaker is sick today."  </body></p>

		<p>I love Kinder Eggs :-) But the shake-method is far from fail-proof (backward error recovery would be nice here :P). Often if you shake the egg and you can&#8217;t hear something it&#8217;s a building-project (that&#8217;s my favourite!!) with lot&#8217;s of parts (oh yeah!) &#8211; but it can also be a big stupid figure :(.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had a lot of fun with kinder-eggs, but it&#8217;s very sad that some too young children have died because of them :(.</p>

		<p>If you dry and crack the peach pit, you&#8217;ll find an edible part inside.<br />
Kinder Surprise toys are remarkably well designed. I thought I saw some sold in bodegas in NYC.</p>

		<p>Kinder toys are popular decorations on engineer&#8217;s screens and desktops here in France.</p>
<p>The yellow plastic eggs are also great for entertaining cats; either as they come or after pinching the two halves shut over the end of a string. My cat is named Kinder, for that reason.</p>

		<p>Hi there. I&#8217;m German. :) It&#8217;s Kinder-&#220;berraschungen, which a dash, but they&#8217;re more commonly called &#220;berraschungseier (surprise eggs).</p>
<p>Well, I was going to say, when I was young I really liked &#220;berraschungseier, but I&#8217;ve never heard of this &quot;Etwas zu sammeln oder etwas zu bauen?&quot; thing (or at least I&#8217;ve never been asked that by a street vendor). It was usually us (the children) who would do the rattling to guess what&#8217;s in it, which I suppose was easier to do in a supermarket than at a street vendor.</p>
<p>Why do you Americans have so many incredibly weird laws? :)</p>

		<p>Thanks for the tip! I&#8217;ve been in Toronto for a few months, moving back to the States in a month. I bought two eggs at a market down the street. Got a weird, cactus-like, plastic toy in about 20 tiny pieces with stickers for some of them, and in the other egg was something like a rubber octopus. The chocolate was good.</p>

		<p>Timwi; I understand Germans have to get approval for the names that they choose for their children? Now that&#8217;s weird! :-)<br />
Here in the good ol&#8217; US of A, I can name my child Flatulent Bastard if I want, and no one can do a thing about it!</p>

		<p>I think the Germans find it just as weird that in the USA you&#8217;re *allowed* to name your child Flatulent Bastard and no one can do a thing about it.</p>
<p>Mit dieser Sache bin ich mit den Deutschen derselben Meinung.</p>

		<p>Raymond, I agree with him, and you, it&#8217;s a bizarre intrusion that we aren&#8217;t allowed to buy them. I was just teasing Timwi. ;-)</p>

		<p>Hi,<br />
they have a pretty cool web-site too: <a href="http://www.magic-kinder.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.magic-kinder.com</a><br />
There is a voucher in every egg witch allows you to play some games at that site. The games are simple but kids just love it.<br />
Never heard of the &quot;Etwas zu sammeln oder etwas zu bauen?&quot; either. But there are lots of collectors of these figures (mostly adults :) who only buy the eggs for the figures. They try all kind of stuff to make sure the only buy eggs with figures (shake, weigh, &#8230;).</p>
<p>ciao&#8230;<br />
&#8230;manilius</p>

		<p>Raymond, check out those small &quot;european-deli&quot; stores around (usually family owned), you&#8217;ll be surprised&#8230; I know that some Russian-food stores have the candy (even different kinds).</p>

		<p>I recall there is a picture of an antipersonnel hand grenade, an egg-shaped type, painted in Kinder Surprise style, only the inscription goes, in a kind of straightforward humor, &quot;Killer Surprise&quot;.</p>

		<p>Yet another cool thing we can&#8217;t have in the US because some parents are too dumb to make sure their kids don&#8217;t swallow something.  Raymond, thank you SO much for the egg (I&#8217;ll come show you my cute little bug in a box sometime!).  And I was really excited about it, my husband was wondering why I was so obsessed with that egg  </p>
<p>But here&#8217;s what I don&#8217;t get.  I opened it up and pulled out the little capsule part inside. It took me a good few minutes to get that darn thing open,and I felt like an idiot.  So, now, I&#8217;m not sure why they think this is such a problem with really ilttle kids &#8211; they can&#8217;t swallow the capsule, and hell, most kids who could open it are probably old enough to know not to swallow stuff.  I think this is just another way for some parents to avoid responsibility.  Land of the free indeed, covered in foam padding so no one hurts themselves.  ;)  </p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
