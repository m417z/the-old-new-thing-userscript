<p>A customer wrote a program that calls <code>Dwm&shy;Extend&shy;Frame&shy;Into&shy;Client&shy;Area</code> to extend the frame over the entire client area, but then discovered that this made programming difficult:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I have a window which I want to have a glassy border but an opaque body. I made my entire window transparent by calling <code>Dwm&shy;Extend&shy;Frame&shy;Into&shy;Client&shy;Area</code>, and I understand that this means that I am now responsible for managing the alpha channel when drawing so that the body of my window remains opaque while the glassy border is transparent. Since most GDI functions are not alpha-aware, this management is frustrating. Is there a better way? In pictures, I only want the red portion of the diagram below to be on glass; the inside yellow part should be opaque like normal. Is there an API that can do this?  </p>

<p> This customer's excitement about the glass frame is like somebody who buys a pallet of tangerine juice even though he only wanted two glasses. And now he has questions about how to store the rest of the tangerine juice he didn't want. </p>
<p> This customer, it appears, passed &minus;1 as the <code>MARGINS</code> to <code>Dwm&shy;Extend&shy;Frame&shy;Into&shy;Client&shy;Area</code> which means "Bring it on, baby! Give me all tangerine all the time everywhere!" If you only want the glass to extend into part of your client area, then say so. Set the <code>MARGINS</code> to the thickness of the glass border (the thickness of the red portion of the above diagram). </p>

		<p>Yeah this article confused me at first because I know what that API does&#8230; and I assumed the customer did too since he was using it. &nbsp;Clearly I don&#39;t have what it takes to do tech support. &nbsp;Which is fine by me.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m pretty sure it should be &quot;pallet&quot; &#8211; took me two reads to figure out the example was not about painting &#8211; </p>

		<p>If you use -1 for the margins you get one clear piece of glass. With regular margins there is a bright line about 25% from the top. Depending on your needs that may or may not be a problem. For example if you want to extend the glass on the left side and put some text or graphics there, you will get a line right in the middle of your stuff.</p>

		<p>I am trying to imagine the situation where someone would actually say &quot;Bring it on, baby! Give me all tangerine all the time everywhere!&quot; Such a person would probably be quite entertaining. :)</p>

		<p>Well, in fairness to the poor programmer, the docs (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa969512.aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/aa969512.aspx</a>) *do* say &quot;Use negative margin values to create the &quot;sheet of glass&quot; effect where the client area is rendered as a solid surface with no window border.&quot; which could be read as a command rather than simply one way to use the function. Much the way &quot;Pack gel-filled bras in your checked baggage.&quot; could be read as a command rather than simply a way to transport certain types of bras.

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
