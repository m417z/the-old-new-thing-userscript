		<p>Reference: The Service Pack Shuffle</p>
<p>There&#39;s one other case for needing to detect whether or not a particular update has been installed.</p>
<p>I had a case where on Windows XP SP2, installing a specific component of my application would result in a bluescreen that could not be easily cleared from safe mode (Windows Installer doesn&#39;t run in safe mode on XP). There was a particular update required to be able to install, so I checked for it by checking the version number of one of the files in the update (I believe it was kernel32.dll but that&#39;s not important). I got lucky and it wasn&#39;t one of those dual-mode updates (released between SP2 and SP3) so a simple greater-than version check did the job. Had it been such an update I don&#39;t know what I would have done. Calling Windows Update Agent would have been out of the question as I had to function without internet access (meaning WUA could theoretically not know of the update&#39;s existance) and the problem was so bad that I couldn&#39;t allow the install to continue.</p>

		<p>If you are to read only one of these, go for ‘The Lying Disease’. It was truly shocking and weirdly interesting and sad at the same time. Sometimes I feel like I&#39;m living in a world partially filled with aliens masquerading as humans. Sigh.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re in for something shorter, I recommend the one about Best and Schadenfreude. I still remember seeing his cringe-worthy Spiel on Penn and Teller.</p>

		<p>@Neil: Nothing I can do about it. It&#39;s an MS component that&#39;s causing the bluescreen so I can&#39;t fix the bug in the component. Microsoft opted to fix the bug in Windows instead so that&#39;s what it is.</p>

		<p>@ &nbsp;free Windows Media Center add-on for Windows 8 Pro</p>
<p>to bad the site just says &quot;We couldn&#39;t process your order&quot; whenever you try to get a key (email address, used os and browser don&#39;t matter). well actually it does this since about a month: <a href="http://www.extremetech.com/computing/141052-microsoft-accidentally-gifts-pirates-with-a-free-windows-8-pro-license-key" target="_new" rel="nofollow">http://www.extremetech.com/&#8230;/141052-microsoft-accidentally-gifts-pirates-with-a-free-windows-8-pro-license-key</a>. it is a shame that ms isn&#39;t able to put up a notify that they disabled the key process for now and will activate it later on again (maybe this time you have to use your valid win 8 key?).</p>

		<p>@ Undercover air marshals, you’re now welcome to board</p>
<p>I&#39;m confused by that line in the article&#8230; shouldn&#39;t they be on board like other aircraft passengers? If they&#39;re allowed to board earlier, people could have guessed who are possibly one of them, and therefore kind of defeat its purpose.</p>

		<p>@Ray</p>
<p>Watched the video about speech recognition twice and I still don&#39;t get the punch line you say it choked you at 7:30. It must be a Chinese related and since I don&#39;t speak Chinese can you elaborate a little bit please?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
