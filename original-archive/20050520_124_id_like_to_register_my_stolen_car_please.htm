<p> On <a href="http://www.npr.org">NPR</a>'s <i><a href="http://www.npr.org/programs/atc/">All Things Considered</a></i> Robert Siegel reported on <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4514002"> the curious status of legally stolen cars in Gaza</a>. </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p> Gaza license plates can be red for official, green for taxis, and white for private vehicles. The lower the number on the red plates, the higher the position of the official. The number 30 designates a truck. All this is pretty conventional stuff for licence plates. But then... </p>
<p> "And then the cars which are written in Arabic the letters M and F, those are the stolen cars. And then there is these plates with MHF, it is a stolen car, but  working for the authorities.  It is a stolen government car. There is also another kind, but it is the same plate, just the numbers are different. If the number starts with 25, then it is a stolen car, but it is allowed to work as a taxi." </p>

		<p>Given that trafficking in cars stolen from Israel is one of the largest industries in PA, no one should be surprised.</p>

		<p>Do you mean somehow that cars from Israel are ending up in Bethlehem and Nazareth, Pennsylvania?</p>

		<p>Don&#8217;t let the folks in California know, or they&#8217;ll approve registration and insurance for stolen cars, as well as allowing the taxation of proceeds from stolen cars.</p>

		<p>Hold on, people might notice that California has taxed and spent its way to the eight largest economy in the world.  Then the libertooneans will really have to STFU.</p>

		<p>Lots of countries legalize the use of stolen property, they just don&#8217;t display licence plates on the things.  Most common is land stolen from previous owners, but other common cases include stolen cash, stolen intellectual property, stolen humans, etc.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
