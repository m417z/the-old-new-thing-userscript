<li>     Windows 8 comes with a data compression API.

		<p>Even though the 6502 wasn&#39;t a real RISC architecture, it certainly was when you compared it to something as baroque as the 8086. Initially, I had trouble understanding how my Commodore 64 would occasionally outstrip my friend&#39;s XT on some computational tasks, even though the XT&#39;s CPU was clocked higher. After I got a look at the instruction set of the 8086 and the timings, I didn&#39;t wonder as much. (Of course, the XT had an 8088 with an 8-bit bus that seriously handicapped it compared to an 8086, which I also didn&#39;t factor in.)</p>

		<p>My first job as a professional programmer was writing games for Apple IIs using 6502 assembly. I had to learn C at that job to write some utilities to compile game data sets. It stumped me for a day until I turned on the &quot;create assembly output&quot; in Turbo C and had the epiphany that C was just a super Macro Assembler.</p>

		<p>What makes this new compression stuff any better than either A.Various compression stuff Windows has already had for ages (lzexpand and others)? And what makes it better than using zlib?</p>
<p>i.e. why does this new compression code (and the MS-specific algorithms it seems to support) actually exist?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>lzexpand supports decompression, but not compression. zlib is a static library. In other words: What&#39;s new is that it&#39;s a DLL and that it can do compression at runtime. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>That new compression API is really well-designed (like much of Win32). &nbsp;It&#39;s a little complicated to use, but it&#39;s extremely powerful and supports streaming compression, a method to compute the maximum possible compressed size of any possible data, and user-provided allocators to avoid the need to know a priori how much memory to allocate and without using a fixed system-provided allocator.</p>
<p>As the &quot;Worse is Better&quot; philosphy goes, &quot;simplicity of implementation is better than simplicity of interface.&quot;</p>

		<p>Wow (the 6502 code). &nbsp;Clear, well-commented source code, with the comments explaining the circumstances and expectations around what the code is doing. &nbsp;I STILL talk to people who say &quot;The code is its own documentation&quot;. &nbsp;No, it&#39;s not.</p>

		<p>[lzexpand supports decompression, but not compression.]</p>
<p>So the real question is: Any idea on why Windows does not ship with LZ compressor while it ships with decompressor since the time of Win2.X? (My Turbo Pascal for Windows reference point to Win2.0 as earliest only, so no idea whether it ships with Win1.X)</p>

		<p>@640k: Did you know Windows also contains libraries for cryptography, HTTP/FTP/Gopher, Unicode handling, font rendering, common controls, and media decoding? Should they not have those?</p>
<p>And almost every Linux distribution has tons of stuff that could be left to applications.</p>
<p>While I agree that it&#39;s probably a bad idea to include these things in the operating system&#39;s API, because it creates additional compatibility constraints (they still have a Gopher library!), it&#39;s also a good service to applications (less external dependencies) and also it&#39;s not without precedent.</p>
<p>I also suspect Microsoft want to eliminate as many external dependencies as possible. I would if I was in their position. Too many things to potentially be sued over.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
