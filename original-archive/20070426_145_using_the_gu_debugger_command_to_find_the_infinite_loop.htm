Somebody says, "Your program is consuming 100% CPU"
and hands you a debug session.
Usually, this happens because one thread has gotten stuck
in an infinite loop.
And if you're lucky it's the type of infinite loop that's
easy to diagnose because it's just one function that isn't
returning.
(The more complicated types are where a function does some work
and then returns, and then some of that work has a delayed effect
that causes the function to run again, and so on.)
Let's assume we're lucky because, well,
<!-- backref: assume code is mostly good -->
debugging is an exercise in optimism</a>.
</p>
<p>
The first step is to find the thread that is using all the CPU.
That's actually pretty easy with the help of the
<code>!runaway</code> debugger extension.

Wow, thread 0x192c has sure used a lot of CPU time,
but that doesn't mean that it's the thread that is in a 100% CPU loop,
because the CPU time is cumulative over the lifetime of the thread.
Maybe that thread has a lot of CPU time because it's been around
the longest.
What you need to do is resume execution for a little while, then
break in again and see whose CPU time has <strong>increased</strong>.

Aha, we see that thread 0x192c is the only one who gained
any noticeable amount of CPU time.
That's probably the one that's responsible for the 100% CPU usage.

<p>
Now this is where
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/doronh/archive/2006/05/05/591195.aspx">
the magical "gu" command</a>
comes in.
You type "gu" to run the current function until it returns.
If you get another prompt back, then type "gu" again,
to run <strong>that</strong> function until it returns.
And so on, until you find the function that doesn't return.
</p>
<p>
That's the one with the infinite loop.
</p>
<p>
Now you can start investigating why that function is stuck.</p>

		<p>Process Explorer will show you CPU time per thread &#8211; just look at the Thread tab for the process which is consuming lots of CPU. If you have a recent version of the debugging engine and debugging symbols (or set up _NT_SYMBOL_PATH to point to a symbol server), you can then hit the Stack button to show the stack of that thread. You still need the debugging tools to use the &#8216;Go Up&#8217; command, though.</p>

		<p>I am confused. Maybe I am not a Windows expert, but under gdb you just attach to the process, switch to the thread context, ctrl-c to interrupt, and type &#8220;where&#8221; to see the stack.</p>
<p>Why is it so complicated on Windows?</p>
<div class=post>[<i>It&#8217;s just as easy on Windows. You use the tilde command to switch to the thread context and the k command to see the stack. But that&#8217;s now what this entry is about. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Hi Raymond,</p>
<p>Glad to see some great examples of what can be done with a lot of experience of the Windows Debugger like cdb etc&#8230;</p>
<p>These tools really seem powerful and I&#8217;m trying to learn more about them these days: while they&#8217;re properly documented, sometimes the message gets more straight to the point using real life examples, especially because advanced debugging requires lots of experience and insight that can not be usually found in &quot;dumb&quot; documentation&#8230;</p>
<p>Just wanted to let you know it was very interesting (to me, at least) and that I wouldn&#8217;t mind to see more entries like this (if you feel like writing them for your audience, of course)&#8230;</p>

		<p>Is &quot;gu&quot; the same like hitting F11 in windbg?</p>
<p>Being fairly experienced with the Windows Debugging Tools, I must say they are NOT well-documented. Their documentation is like man page &#8211; all the info is there, but not in a way mere mortals (=people who want to get their job done, not study the intricacies of these tools) can understand. They also lack in consistency &#8211; for example, there are several syntaxes to toggles (.enable_unicode 1, .lines+, etc)</p>

		<p>Woh, cool. &nbsp;I did not even know that Windows had a command line debugger. &nbsp;That (amongst other reasons) is one of my reasons for preferring to do development under Linux environments. &nbsp;The Visual Studio graphical debugger is nice, until I need to get my hands dirty, then it gets in the way&#8230;</p>
<p>I wonder if there is a Microsoft made equivalent to the Data Display Debugger. &nbsp;DDD is the most ugly graphical debugger in the world, but insanely powerful because it can be used to graphically show data structures, unlike the VSS debugger, which just has this annoying flat layout of all my data (makes finding bugs in multi-dimension arrays a pain!).</p>
<p>Though to be fair, the only reason I know about all the *nix command line based tools is because the graphical utilities tend to be so buggy as to be unusable (with the exception of DDD, which is just painful to use!).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
