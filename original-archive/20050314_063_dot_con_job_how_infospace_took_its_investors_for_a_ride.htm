<p> The stock underwent a 10-1 reverse split in September 2002; values have been adjusted to pre-split values for comparison purposes.</p>
<p> Some boxes list two numbers. The top number is the value reported at the time of the press release. The bottom number is the value reported the following year. For example, in 1999&nbsp;Q2, the press release claimed that they earned 1&cent;/share pro forma, but one year later, in the 2000&nbsp;Q2 filing, they reported a 2&cent; loss per share for 1999&nbsp;Q2. [Years fixed, 10pm.] Why change the amount? Because it makes the 2000&nbsp;Q2 results look better when compared to the "same period last year". I have no idea which set of numbers (if any!) is correct. </p>

		<p>Some of the Seattle Times articles that you linked to are interesting too.  A judge (overruled after 2 years) and a US government agency (not overruled) acted in assistance of the fraud.  This is the kind of thing one expects to see in Japan and China.</p>

		<p>&quot;This is the kind of thing one expects to see in Japan and China.&quot;</p>
<p>I suppose you mean to imply &quot;and not the U.S.&quot;?  I think there&#8217;s plenty of it here, but most people don&#8217;t care that much about it.</p>
<p>The current US President engaged in insider trading as an executive of Harken Energy, and up until the most recent election cycle, his largest lifetime corporate campaign contributor was Enron.  And of course he&#8217;s in his second term now.</p>
<p>Given the extent to which politicians have a vested interest in serving the corporate interests that fund so much of their campaigns, the only thing that&#8217;s really surprising is that this sort of thing isn&#8217;t even more rampant.<br /></p>

  <br />&gt; I suppose you mean to imply &quot;and not the<br />
  <br />&gt; U.S.&quot;?</p>
<p>Sometimes there are newspaper articles about US government agencies enforcing laws especially when related to securities.  For some reason I interpreted that as meaning that the US tends to enforce its securities laws.  I should have remembered that it means something different.</p>
<p>Here is why news does mean something different:</p>
<p>Sometimes there are newspaper articles about Japanese government agencies enforcing laws.  In these cases I know exactly what it means.  Ordinary common events, like &quot;dog bites man&quot; or &quot;Japanese government agency ignores laws and assists criminals&quot; aren&#8217;t news.  Highly unusual events, like &quot;man bites dog&quot; or &quot;Japanese government agency obeys law&quot;, that&#8217;s news.

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
