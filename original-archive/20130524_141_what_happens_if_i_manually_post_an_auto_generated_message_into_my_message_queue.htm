<p>As we well know, the window manager <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/05/23/10420741.aspx"> generates various messages on-demand</a> rather than posting them into the queue at the time the event occurs. But what happens if you manually post one of these messages, like <code>Post&shy;Message(<wbr>hwnd, WM_<wbr>PAINT, 0, 0)</wbr></wbr></code>? Does that clear the internal flag that says "This window needs a paint message?"</p>
<p> Nope. </p>
<p> The window manager <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/09/26/10216420.aspx"> does not have a prank call detector</a>. If you post a fake <code>WM_<wbr>PAINT</wbr></code> message, then a fake <code>WM_<wbr>PAINT</wbr></code> message shows up in the message queue. The part of the window manager which manages the "Does this window need to be repainted?" does not wiretap every telephone call to see if somebody is prank-calling a window with the <code>WM_<wbr>PAINT</wbr></code> message, and then say, "You know what? I'm going to make that prank call a reality and make it act like a real <code>WM_<wbr>PAINT</wbr></code> message." </p>
<p> Imagine if the act of prank-calling somebody <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20070912174540AAHge9P"> caused Prince Albert to stop by for a visit</a>! </p>
<p> In particular, the posted message goes into the posted message queue and will rise to the front of the queue as messages are retrieved. On the other hand, the auto-generated message will remain in its proto-message state until the queue is finally empty. </p>
<p> It then follows as a consequence that if you post one of these auto-generated messages, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/12/19/10249000.aspx#10250473"> like <code>WM_<wbr>TIMER</wbr></code> message</a>, you don't get any magical coalescing behavior because the coalescing happens as part of the auto-generation, not as part of the <code>Post&shy;Message</code>. These prank-call messages also appear in the message queue in posted order rather than being generated at low priority like normal auto-generated messages. </p>

<p>These kids today. &nbsp;The Prince Albert prank phone call is right up there with &quot;Is your refrigerator running? &nbsp;Then you&#39;d better go catch it!&quot; or asking the operator of a department store to page your friend, Jim Naseum.</p>

<p>Aside from the search tools and archive index, one might realise that there&#39;s a pattern with all the pages ending in &quot;.aspx&quot;.

		<p>&#8212;PART 1&#8212;</p>
<p>OK, so, there&#39;s NO WAY to contact Raymond!</p>
<p>* &quot;Contact Me&quot; link? nope! it links to &quot;Suggestion Box 4&quot;: blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/20/10040074.aspx</p>
<p>* &quot;Suggestion Box 4&quot; is closed for comments (like EVERY SINGLE POST he&#39;s EVER made)</p>
<p>Hmm, let&#39;s start over at the beginning (home page of blog)&#8230;</p>
<p>blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing</p>
<p>* &quot;Contact Me&quot; link? Hmmm&#8230;different URL? (progress?): blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/232903.aspx</p>
<p>* &quot;How to contact Raymond&quot; page: &quot;you can send email using the Contact page&quot;: blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/contact.aspx &#8212; or NO you CAN&#39;T &#8212; &quot;Update 25 March 2007: The contact page has been disabled&#8230;&quot;&#8230;so that&#39;s a dead end too!</p>
<p>* &quot;Contact&quot; page: instead of being NOT being linked to or showing an error msg, you just get a &quot;blank&quot; page! Then entire Blog &quot;chrome&quot; (header, footer, sidebar) loads, but it has a blank main area with no information explaining the problem. Useless!</p>
<p>So, what&#39;s left? I know, I&#39;ll post an off-topic Comment on the newest blog entry!, sure it&#39;ll get deleted, but at least it&#39;ll get read! Sorry, but YOU left me no other choice than to post here!</p>
<p>In any case, the REAL REASON I wanted to contact Raymond&#8230;</p>
<p>On this post (which has comments disabled {like EVERY SINGLE POST you&#39;ve EVER made})&#8230;</p>
<p>What happens when you get dllimport wrong?</p>
<p>blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/26/679044.aspx</p>
<p>&#8230;it says&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;Now that we&#39;ve learned what the dllimport declaration specifier does&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>&#8230;wait wait wait: &quot;Now that we&#39;ve learned&quot;??? I haven&#39;t learned anything yet, where&#39;s the PREVIOUS BLOG POST, that this one assumes I&#39;ve read? There&#39;s NO LINK ANYWHERE.</p>
<p>Since there&#39;s no LINK to the post where we DIDN&#39;T LEARN &quot;what the dllimport declaration specifier does&quot;, let&#39;s try to brute-force it out of the Blog&#8230;</p>
<p>We are here&#8230;</p>
<p>blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/26/679044.aspx</p>
<p>Perhaps the Archive for 2006-07-26 is here? (logical URL, if I do say so myself)&#8230;</p>
<p>blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/26</p>
<p>Nope: redirect to error msg: blogs.msdn.com/msgs/?messageid=9</p>
<p>Archive for 2006 07?&#8230;</p>
<p>blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07</p>
<p>Nope: redirect to LOGIN: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=11&amp;ct=1369642939&amp;rver=6.0.5286.0&amp;wp=MBI&amp;wreply=http:%2F%2Fblogs.msdn.com%2Fb%2Foldnewthing%2Farchive%2F2006%2F07%2F&amp;lc=1033&amp;id=271611" rel="nofollow">login.live.com/login.srf</a></p>
<p>WTF does it want me to login for??? I&#39;m just trying to guess the &quot;archive&quot; URL.</p>
<p>Archive for 2006?&#8230;</p>
<p>blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006</p>
<p>Nope: redirect to LOGIN again: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://login.live.com/login.srf?wa=wsignin1.0&amp;rpsnv=11&amp;ct=1369643027&amp;rver=6.0.5286.0&amp;wp=MBI&amp;wreply=http:%2F%2Fblogs.msdn.com%2Fb%2Foldnewthing%2Farchive%2F2006%2F&amp;lc=1033&amp;id=271611" rel="nofollow">login.live.com/login.srf</a></p>
<p>&#8230;so, since I obviously tried, can you plz link me to the post where it explains what &quot;Now that we&#39;ve learned what the dllimport declaration specifier does&quot; was talking about???&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;Please shorten the content to 3072 or less&quot;&#8230;oh dear GOD you are trying to limit me! CANNOT COMPLY! MUST. TYPE. MORE. Well, now you just get MORE TEXT!!!</p>

		<p>My favorite is always the outrage expressed when somebody&#39;s free time isn&#39;t spent solving the problems of others in a way that makes the other people happy. I hope you don&#39;t let this sort of response convince you to quit blogging, Raymond.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
