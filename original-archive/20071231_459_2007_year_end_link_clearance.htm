<li><a href="http://worsethanfailure.com/Articles/The-Opposite-of-Backup.aspx">The Opposite of Backup</a> and other stories of "backups that didn't"     reminds me of somebody who has a policy of,     once a week,     asking for a randomly-selected file to be restored from backup.     "<a href="http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/15.43.html#subj5">It is amazing what you learn by doing this</a>."

		<p>I have to say that out of all of the links, I found the backup ones most interesting. Time to randomly restore some files, now that I&#8217;ve read that! (And I think I&#8217;ll restore one that&#8217;s larger than the drives at the time of those articles&#8217; subjects!)</p>

		<p>re: The Opposite of Backup. I&#8217;ve read/seen similar stories, and used many backup softwares. Some are downright unreliable &#8211; think crashing just because a filename is &quot;too long&quot; (but still legal in Windows)</p>
<p>It amazes me that some IT folks, the ones are responsible for their company&#8217;s data, would blindly trust anything without verification.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m making the rounds of &quot;last post of 2007&quot; posts and I have to say I enjoyed the eclecticism of this one Raymond. I don&#8217;t really know what to make of some of them, and I think it best to enter 2008 in a state of childlike wonder&#8230;.which you have provided :).</p>
<p>Happy New Year!</p>

		<p>It turns out I&#8217;m going to visit an old friend in February who works at Tekniska Verken in Linkoping. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I wonder if any samples ever get taken to their office parties?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
