<p>
A term that is gaining currency at Microsoft is
<i>placemat review</i>.
I was unfamiliar with this term, so I asked around.
</p>
<p>
A <i>placemat review</i> is a meeting which gives
upper management detailed status on
a feature that
is of critical importance.
The meeting covers topics such as what progress
has been made since the last review,
what obstacles are preventing progress from
taking place,
what teams have been involved in resolving
those obstacles,
and how the feature is proceeding against its
schedule.
</p>
<p>
There's also a somewhat more cynical definition
of a placemat review:
A <i>placemat review</i> is a way for upper
management to manage a feature that is in trouble.
The threat of a periodic review forces the team to
be more explicit in monitoring its progress,
identifying obstacles, and engaging other teams
to help clear those obstacles.
</p>
<p>
Without this threat of review, the feature team
may simply declare,
"Oh, we can't make progress until team Y
gives us the ability to do Z."
But the reality of the obstacle may be that
nobody on team Y has been informed of this need.
Or that team Y has already provided the ability to do Z,
but the feature team didn't realize it.
</p>
<p>
I have yet to find anyone who can provide an etymology
for the term <i>placemat review</i>.</p>

		<p>I would have thought &#8216;placemat review&#8217; would be an informal update, something done over lunch, drawings on the back of the placemat.</p>

		<p>So when I first saw the headline I read &#8220;placement review&#8221;, which is a thing in electronics. Then when I read the summary I saw what it really said. That said before I actually clicked through I was expecting the etymology to have to do with a drawing on a placemat.  (IIRC the story of the original Compaq portable involves a drawing on a placemat.)<br />
After clicking through though I have no idea where that usage might have come from :)</p>

		<p>My guess is that &#8220;placemat&#8221; implies &#8220;informal&#8221; or &#8220;unstructured&#8221;, in the same way as drawing a quick sketch on a placemat.</p>

		<p>It seems to me that &#8220;management review&#8221; gets the point across more clearly than &#8220;placemat review&#8221;; but oh, silly me, thinking that language and grammar is meant to communicate ideas clearly&#8230;</p>

		<p>Emmm&#8230; I thought when the feature team need team Y to provide Z to continue, they should add that to progress tracker as dependency item and their PM should modify the Gantt Chart to reflect that dependency addition. The idea should be carried forward without the need for a meeting session, unless the point is to point fingers.</p>

		<p>Sure, Z is on the feature team&#8217;s Gantt chart, but is it on Team Y&#8217;s Gantt chart? (Why would it be? It&#8217;s not on team Y&#8217;s agreed-upon list of deliverables.) Or maybe the issue is simply &#8220;We think it&#8217;s a bug in Z, so we asked team Y to look at it.&#8221; Do you create a deliverable for that? Or the problem could just be that the feature team is disorganized.</p>

		<p>It depends. If both team uses the same ticket tracking system, the original team filing workitem for Team Y will be seen by Team Y, and the staff responsible for assigning task for Team Y should assign it to someone there. It works even better if the PM is responsible for assigning tasks (which is common for small to mid sized SI firms).</p>

		<p>At Atlassian, we have a similar system we call Project Central and of course, it&#8217;s all managed through JIRA.  But the idea is for each issue to represent a project and is provide regular updates and has a custom workflow to quickly glance if a project is off track or not.</p>

		<p>Someone at MS should do a placemat review of this new feature in Windows 10 preview builds, and they should ask Raymond &#8220;what if everyone did this?&#8221; ::</p>
<p>&#8220;When an app window enters compact overlay mode it’ll be shown above other windows so it won’t get blocked.&#8221;  How many windows can be shown above other windows?  :-)</p>

		<p>They fight it out the same way the WS_EX_TOPMOST windows fight things out: The user picks the winner. (In other words, more precise phrasing would be &#8220;above other non-compact-overlay windows.&#8221; But this was a casual discussion, not a formal specification.)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
