<p>I signed up for the annual <a href="http://www.cascade.org/EandR/stp/"> Seattle-to-Portland</a> bike ride, known to Seattle-area bicycling dorks as STP. My bicycle riding is mostly just commuting to and from work, nothing even approaching the 200-mile trek that STP entails, but one of my friends who recently started bicycle-commuting inspired our little bicycle commuting group to sign up.</p>
<p> One of my colleagues rode the STP last year, and when he returned, I asked him how it went. He conceded that he was riding with a group that wanted to go faster than he was prepared to ride, and the ride was not quite as enjoyable as it could have been. </p>
<p> "I should've trained better." </p>
<p> <i>Oh? What was your training?</i> </p>
<p> "I sat around and drank beer." </p>

		<p>Has a great training regimen!</p>
<p>I have to harass friends who are snooty about fitness.</p>
<p>&quot;Only a marathon ? You should come out for the XXX mile ULTRA marathon&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;You rode a 50 miles today ? I do centuries every other day.&quot;</p>
<p>etc. I&#8217;d rather drink beer, and run/bike to keep the fat off.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s basically how we trained for the Whiskey Off-Road, a 50-mile mountain bike event in Prescott, AZ last month. Let&#8217;s just say that it didn&#8217;t end well. But we had a lot of fun while we were failing miserably! Heh heh.</p>

		<p>That also sounds like good training to recreate the &quot;Bandit Run&quot; from the movie Smokey &amp; The Bandit. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>We just had about 25 people complete a tour from last Thursday to Sunday &#8212; with the posted distance more than 100 miles each day. &nbsp;Some of the directionally challenged riders managed to turn some of the days into 150 milers.</p>
<p>Much Canadian beer was consumed at the end of each leg. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The first two days were essentially flat; the second two fairly hilly.</p>

		<p>I have a friend who has given up beer until he completes the STP. He&#8217;s drinking red wine instead and his diet seems to consist solely of hot wings and corn dogs. I&#8217;ll let him know that he&#8217;s on the right track!</p>

		<p>How long is the distance from home to work for you? Do you use the bike evry day?</p>
<p>I have 20km to work, and usually I doit every day with my bike. I drive a recumbend bike (HP-Streetmachine GT). Very fast and comfortable!</p>

<p>They bus you, and your bike, back to Seattle. It&#8217;s part of the package.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Actually, it&#8217;s a separate optional package. If you want to get home some other way (e.g., friends are picking you up, you live in Portland), then you don&#8217;t have to buy a bus ticket. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Ah good times. I did the STP with my wife several times in the early 90s. She is not athletic and was diabetic at the time, but with regular training rides (app 20 miles a day during the week and 50-70 mile rides on the weekend) we both survived.</p>
<p>Some less fun times:</p>
<ul>
<li>riding the first half in the pouring rain</li>
<li>
<p>some nitwit clipping into clipless pedals at a stop light and falling over onto my wife (hint: clip only one foot until you are moving, then clip the other foot)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>finishing in Portland with a badly warped wheel after crashing somewhere in the last few miles</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Hope you have a good ride!</p>

		<p>At least some Amtrak trains from Portland to Seattle offer the option of checking bicycles as baggage, for (if memory serves) a $10 surcharge. You can take your bike to the baggage car, hang it from a hook, and pick it up at the end of your journey. I&#8217;ve done this successfully when traveling from Seattle to Portland to visit friends for a weekend. I have no idea if there&#8217;d be sufficient capacity on the days following a major event like the STP, though.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s similar to how my old Sea Scouting group prepared for the Harlingen-Terschelling rowing race: we generally didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Our worst performance ever was when we didn&#8217;t even make it to the *start* line (we ran aground before reaching the start location).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
