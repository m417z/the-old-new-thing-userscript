<p>Locations in the shell known folder system  can be marked as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb762512.aspx"> <code>KF_<wbr>CATEGORY_<wbr>FIXED</wbr></wbr></code></a>, which makes them immovable. Conversely, if a file system folder is not immovable, then it can be moved.</p>
<p> This dichotomy appears simple and unworthy of discussion, except that customers sometimes have trouble incorporating this concept into their world view. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I have some code that calls <code>SHSet&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code>, and it works for most of the folders I'm interested in, but for some <code>CSIDL</code> values like <code>CSIDL_<wbr>COMMON_<wbr>APPDATA</wbr></wbr></code>, it fails with <code>E_INVALIDARG</code>. Doesn't matter if I run elevated or not. What am I doing wrong? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The difference is that <code>CSIDL_<wbr>COMMON_<wbr>APPDATA</wbr></wbr></code> (known under the New World Order as <code>FOLDERID_<wbr>ProgramData</wbr></code>) is marked as <code>KF_<wbr>CATEGORY_<wbr>FIXED</wbr></wbr></code> so it cannot be moved. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Is there a way that we can override the <code>KF_<wbr>CATEGORY_<wbr>FIXED</wbr></wbr></code> flag and move it anyway? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Nope. It's immovable. Sorry. You'll just have to accept that that folder will not go where you want it. </p>
<p> The very next day, we got a complementary question from an unrelated customer: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We have a program that monitors a known folder, and it goes haywire if the user changes the location of the folder while it's being monitored. Is there a way to prevent the user from moving the folder? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> If a known folder can be moved, then you have to accept that it can be moved. You can't override its category and force it to be <code>KF_<wbr>CATEGORY_<wbr>FIXED</wbr></wbr></code> just because your life would be easier if it were. </p>
<p> I found it interesting that we got two requests on consecutive days asking for what appear to be opposite things: "I want to force this folder to be movable" and "I want to force this folder to be immovable." I can only imagine what would happen if both programs are running at the same time! </p>
<p> What the program can do is register an <code>IFile&shy;Is&shy;In&shy;Use</code> on the directory so that it will be called when somebody wants to move it. At least that way it knows when scary things are about to happen and can prepare itself for the changes that lie ahead. I'm told that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ee330722(VS.85).aspx"> a sample program illustrating <code>IFile&shy;Is&shy;In&shy;Use</code></a> is in the Windows&nbsp;7 SDK under the directory <code>winui\<wbr>Shell\<wbr>AppPlatform\<wbr>FileIsInUse</wbr></wbr></wbr></code>. There's also <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070429124756/http://shellrevealed.com/blogs/shellblog/archive/2007/03/29/Your-File-Is-In-Use_2620_-Demystified.aspx"> an old article on the subject</a> over on the now-defunct Shell Revealed blog. </p>

		<p>KF_CATEGORY_FIXED only mean fixed for the current system boot. (Approximately.) OTOH, it also flags the folder as being very hard to move successfully. You can move c:users, but it&#39;s very hard as you have to update a lot of references to it, a lot of registry entries, etc. So even if it didn&#39;t have KF_CATEGORY_FIXED, moving it is not as simple as you seem to think.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>The shell folder system has become quite complex over the years. IMO, the whole concept of virtual folders hasn&#39;t been a good idea from the beginning. Mixing a regular file system objects with virtual items (Desktop) is source of confusion for many users. I&#39;d prefer a situation where there would only be regular folders, and programs would only be allowed to write to folders</p>
<ul>
<li>in which the user explicitely installed them (somewhere in the user&#39;s profile),</li>
<li>
<p>to which the user moved them by hand,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>which the user specified in an &quot;Open&quot; or &quot;Save&quot; dialog box.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything else should be kept in the pagefile, as it is probably not data the user wants to keep on the long term.</p>

		<p>@Joshua &quot;Unfortunately C:Users is KF_CATEGORY_FIXED&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m imagining some lazy developer trying to rename C:Users to C:Documents and Settings so that his app designed for XP with a hardcoded path would work.</p>
<p>Also for the person who wanted to make the folder immovable he could use a ACL on the folder. though quite frankly how often does an end user rename this &quot;Known Folder&quot;. I&#39;m assuming this isn&#39;t a folder located on the users desktop or my documents so if they start moving it for no good reason they deserve the program to crash.</p>

		<p>Well, you can set the paths for the profile root, program files etc at install time with tools like nLite, after that if you move them there is too much fixup needed in the registry and config files</p>

		<p>+1000000 for start a new shell revealed blog. It was far better than OldNewThing (don&#39;t mind Raymond). Unfortunately, we never got the opportunity to really give any feedback on that blog as it started and closed down in an era when Vista&#39;s uptake was miniscule and there was no service pack (the abomination that was Vista RTM).</p>

<p>Completely agree, it&#39;s a pain, and likewise for all of the program files folders. You can actually move them and use links from c:Users to someOtherLocationUsers, but it was a damn pain (and I didn&#39;t have the courage to go through it again for program files, program files (x86) and programdata)</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve used junctions on XP for many years to move my user folder inside &#39;Documents and Settings&#39;/&#39;Users&#39; off to a second drive. Actually, all discrete user accounts are junctioned off to another drive.</p>
<p>Are we saying this can&#39;t be done on Vista/7? I somehow very much doubt this. All the drivers are in place by this time. It&#39;s a hassle to log in to the Administrator account to run a mklink, sure, but there&#39;s a reason you&#39;re a power-user that cares about these things.</p>
<p>Isn&#39;t some user-profile location stuff also a GPO?</p>
<p>@Superdude THOSE junctions it can&#39;t follow, sure. But I have several junctions on my Win7 workstation that point my Outlook folder to a mapped drive-letter which in-turn is mapped to a network fileserver. I can follow the links just fine just double-clicking on the junction-ed folder in Explorer. Explorer even shows that it&#39;s a &#39;shortcut.&#39; Shared workstations breeds ingenuity.</p>
<p>I have a feeling that the Docs&amp;Settings and other related junctions are &#39;special,&#39; and were created that way to not forward for various reasons (as noted by the &#39;padlock&#39; overlay when unhidden in Win7)</p>

		<p>The comments regarding the Users folder are very interesting. &nbsp;I got into trouble with that not too long ago. &nbsp;My system volume was failing (getting S.M.A.R.T. warnings). &nbsp;I wanted to get a backup of everything in Users, so I used (either robocopy or xcopy, can&#39;t remember which) to copy to a backup volume. &nbsp;It went into some kind of an infinite recursion (I assumed due to junction points &#8212; psychic debugging??). &nbsp;The weird issue I have now is that I cannot delete the directory structure from my backup drive! &nbsp;(path too long &#8212; many repeating subtrees). &nbsp;I assume that if I can find the junction points, I can delete them and then remove the path. &nbsp;I&#39;m not completely sure how to proceed, though.</p>

		<p>JM: I had that exact same issue. If you&#39;re using Robocopy (the one I used) to back up your /Users folder, *do not* run it as Admin.</p>
<p>With Administrative permissions, it&#39;ll successfully follow the Documents and Settings junction continuously, eventually creating a folder structure much, much longer than Explorer can cope with, making it a huge pain to delete. (I actually just formatted the entire drive to get rid of the damned thing, since it was a blank drive anyway.)</p>
<p>Without Administrative permissions, the protection Raymond talked about in the comment here applies: [Explorer tries to follow them, but those junctions deny list-contents permission. -Raymond] and the recursive loop doesn&#39;t occur.</p>

		<p>Actually, you can just run robocopy with /XJ (exclude junctions). But seriously, a real backup program (the one in Windows should be fine) is what you need here.</p>

		<p>On XP, I rename &quot;Documents and Settings&quot; folder to &quot;Users&quot; prior to OS install with Program XYZ since 2006, just for the brevity of it, and never had any problem. Sure, there were some apps hardcoded to &quot;Documents and Settings&quot;, but they happily created the structure and wrote whatever they wanted to and worked fine. I abandoned them ASAP, but it wouldn&#39;t have been too hard to live with it or bug the developers. Also, Microsoft could have written a few shims for its most important partners/business apps.</p>
<p>Just compare that with the mess on Vista+.</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
