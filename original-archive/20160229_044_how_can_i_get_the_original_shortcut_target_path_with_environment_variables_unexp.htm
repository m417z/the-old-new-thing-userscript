<p>
A customer wanted to be able to get the target of a shortcut
with environment variables unexpanded.
The <code>IShellLink::Get&shy;Path</code> method
will expand environment variables.
</p>
<p>
The way to get the unexpanded target path is to go for the
<code>EXP_SZ_LINK</code> data in the shell link data list.
We
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20071219-00/?p=24103">
briefly encountered the shell link data list a while back</a>.
Now we'll dig in a little more.
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;shlobj.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt; // Horrors! Mixing stdio and C++!
#include &lt;atlbase.h&gt;
#include &lt;atlalloc.h&gt;

int __cdecl wmain(int argc, wchar_t**argv)
{
 <a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040520-00/?p=39243">CCoInitialize</a> init;

 CComPtr&lt;IShellLink&gt; lnk;
 CoCreateInstance(CLSID_ShellLink, 0,
                  CLSCTX_ALL, IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;lnk));
 CComQIPtr&lt;IPersistFile&gt; pf(lnk);
 pf-&gt;Load(argv[1], STGM_READ);

 CComQIPtr&lt;IShellLinkDataList&gt; list(lnk);
 DWORD flags;
 list-&gt;GetFlags(&amp;flags);
 if (flags &amp; SLDF_HAS_EXP_SZ) {
  CHeapPtr&lt;void, CLocalAllocator&gt; rawData;
  list-&gt;CopyDataBlock(EXP_SZ_LINK_SIG, &amp;rawData);
  auto linkData = reinterpret_cast&lt;EXP_SZ_LINK *&gt;(static_cast&lt;void *&gt;(rawData));
  printf("Unexpanded target = %ls\n", linkData-&gt;swzTarget);
 }
 return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
After loading the shortcut file,
we ask the
<code>IShell&shy;Link&shy;Data&shy;List</code> to inspect the
shortcut flags.
If the <code>SLDF_HAS_EXP_SZ</code> flag is set,
then the path to the target contains an environment variable reference.
To get the original unexpanded path, ask for the
<code>EXP_SZ_LINK_SIG</code> data block.
That returns a data block in the form of a
<code>EXP_SZ_LINK</code> structure,
from which you can extract the unexpanded paths.</p>

		<p>IShellLink will automatically save c&#8221;:\program files\&#8230;&#8221; as &#8220;%ProgramFiles%\&#8230;&#8221; in this extra block but this causes WOW64 issues when a 64-bit app reads this information if it was written by a 32-bit app, %ProgramFiles% will expand to the wrong directory. The shortcut properties change icon feature has this issue for example.</p>

		<p>I do wonder if this was one of the many cases where the customer is asking the wrong question. Here,  only for our information, you answered their wrong question (at least, for a blog post) rather than telling us what the customer really wanted to do.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
