<p>A customer observed that when they opened a Zip file containing an Excel spreadsheet saved as XML, the icon for the spreadsheet in the Zip folder is just a plain XML icon rather than a fancy Excel-XML icon. "Is there any way to invoke a shell icon handler on an item inside a Zip folder?"</p>
<p> Even if there were a way, you wouldn't like it. </p>
<p> Think about it: In order to determine whether the XML file should get a plain-XML icon or an Excel-XML icon, the Office icon handler needs to open the XML file and sniff around to see if has whatever it is that makes an XML file an Excel-XML file. </p>
<p> This means that the Zip folder has to extract the file so that the icon handler can sniff it. </p>
<p> This means that opening a Zip folder would result in <i>decompressing every file in it</i> just so that it can give the decompressed file to the icon handler so the icon handler can say what icon to show. </p>
<p> You probably wouldn't like that. </p>
<p> Therefore, Zip folders do not use icon handlers to obtain icons for items inside Zip files. It just <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/06/01/145428.aspx"> uses the generic icon for the file extension</a>. </p>

		<p>Well, it&#39;s good that the icon handlers at least peek into the &quot;real&quot; files. I can only imagine how much resistance this feature met, because, heaven forbid, what if the files are in the offline storage and have to be brought back!</p>

		<p>Ok, not showing XML-Excel icon inside Zip files is acceptable, frankly, I would be fine if those icons didn&#39;t exists at all!</p>
<p>But technically it is not that hard, while the zip format is far from perfect it allows for decompression of individual files and, if the Office icon handle just need the start of the file to identify and XML-Excel then it can stop decompression just after identification.</p>

		<p>@Simon: that&#39;s if you assume every icon handler is well behaved and will not try and load the whole file. Or maybe some handler does need data at the end of the file to make its choice.</p>
<p>@alegr1: I haven&#39;t checked, but maybe Explorer uses the generic icon for offline files too ?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>It also assumes that icon extractors never need to seek (since virtual streams are not seekable in general). And as you noted, many file types put the interesting information at or near the end (MP3, EXE).

		<p>It&#39;s a good thing that zip files (unlike compressed tarballs) have the property that individual files can be decompressed without needing to read the entire archive, so that if Explorer did want to sniff certain files (say, all .xml files), it could reasonably do so.</p>

		<p>And if it did decompress files to show the icons, the question would instead become &quot;How come per-item custom icons only work in Zip files that don&#39;t have passwords?&quot; or &quot;How come I have to provide a password just to look at the list of files in a Zip archive?&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Macrosofter &#8212; the real security issue happened whenever Microsoft decided that the default should be to hide file extensions. &nbsp;It is pretty obvious if you see the .exe on the end of the filename.</p>

		<p>@SimonRev How is this a security issue? The default explorer view also tells you these are type &#39;Application&#39; That might be more obvious than .exe to non-tech person. Not to mention situation where you have something like naked.jpg &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;.exe and the .exe part might not visible. You could go MacOS finder style which shows you beginning &amp; end of filenames where there is not enough space, but I&#39;m not convinced that is necessarily better.</p>

		<p>Well, it&#39;s not terribly costly to decompress the first 1k or so of the files in the folder you&#39;re viewing, so it&#39;s not a *technical* reason this isn&#39;t possible, just an engineering and cost/benefit one. I&#39;m remembering something about Explorer using COM interfaces to navigate and read virtual (and probably physical?) folders and sniff their content, so I&#39;m guessing this may even be possible to do as an extension, but what do I know about Windows?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Right. But the number of icon extractors that know how to read virtual content is zero, to within experimental accuracy. And other container formats may not be so easy to create invididual virtual streams from. (Try it for an FTP folder!) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>It is a security vulnerability whenever extension!=content. In those cases you can&#39;t trust explorer.</p>
<p>And it wouldn&#39;t be impossible to create a cache featuer/component/service which displayed the right icons after the user had extracted the files. Why not try to do the right thing instead of finding corner cases?</p>

		<p>@alegr1: Was that facetious or did you miss IconCache.db? %USERPROFILE%AppDataLocalIconCache.db (on Vista+) and %USERPROFILE%Local SettingsApplication DataIconCache.db (on 2003 and earlier) do exactly that for standard icons.

<p>The same way antiviruses avoid zip bombs when they are set to &quot;scan files in archives&quot; so does explorer can. It&#39;s not a big deal to avoid them.</p>

		<p>@Josh:</p>
<p>These caches don&#39;t seem to work, because the thumbnails are rebuilt every time. And it looks so ugly, when you log in, and all the icons on the desktop are cleared, and then rebuilt. It looks like very amateurish programmer wrote that.</p>
<p>It&#39;s possible, also, that the caches are using wrong timestamps instead on unadulterated NTFS timestamps.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
