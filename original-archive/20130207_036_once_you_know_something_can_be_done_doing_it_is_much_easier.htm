		<p>Interesting story, and I&#39;m sure there are plenty of other examples.</p>
<p>The word &quot;notable&quot; in my browser was hyphenated no-table, which took me a bit of reparsing to figure out what it was trying to say. I&#39;m no grammar expert, but I would have expected &quot;not-able&quot;. Looks like the auto-soft-hyphen script isn&#39;t perfect, or my expectations are wrong.</p>

		<p>It seems fairly natural that proving a falsehood would be more likely to end in failure than proving truth.</p>

		<p>@Chris B</p>
<p>Why? To prove a falsehood you&#39;ll only have to come up with 1 example that doesn&#39;t match the theory. To prove truth you&#39;ll have to prove such an example cannot exist.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of 8th grade. Starting with the speed of light is fixed and deriving special relativity. Doesn&#39;t make me Einstein but knowing it could be done by simple geometry made it easy enough for an 8th grader.</p>

		<p>@Chris B &#8211; I&#39;m not so sure that proving a falsehood is more likely. There are many straightforward proofs where assuming premise A leads to an obvious logical contradiction. This proves that A is false. There are also many proofs by counterexample, where a single case that contradicts a premise can be found.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always been curious if there was a general way to classify problems into easy or hard to solve and what type of approach would be more effective in coming up with a proof.</p>

		<p>In an assembly language class I took in college, assignments were graded by the size of the code in bytes (well, correctness counted too). &nbsp;Some years, the instructor would tell the size of his solution when handing out the assignment, and some years he&#39;d wait until after. &nbsp;In the former case, the top students would consistently match or beat theA size of his solution. &nbsp;In the latter, the top students often would produce significantly larger solutions. &nbsp;Pretty amazing how knowing a better solution exists opens the path to finding it.</p>
<p>(And of course if a student beat the instructor&#39;s code size, that solution would become the instructor&#39;s solution, making it considerably harder to beat in later years. &nbsp;But yet it would happen when the code size was announced beforehand.)</p>

		<p>Hyphenating &quot;notable&quot; is tricky.</p>
<p>The etymological school would have you hyphenate it &quot;not-able&quot; since it derives from &quot;note&quot;. But &quot;not-able&quot; looks a lot like &quot;not able&quot; and the notable mathematician in question might take objection.</p>
<p>The phonetic school would have you hyphenate it &quot;no-ta-ble&quot; which resulted in the &quot;no-table&quot; hyphenation.</p>
<p>My question is, why is it being hyphenated at all? I would expect hyphenation to prefer sending &quot;notable&quot; down to the next line in its entirety since hyphenating it only extends the line by three characters, and we&#39;re dealing with fairly long lines anyway.</p>

		<p>&quot;I&#39;ve always been curious if there was a general way to classify problems into easy or hard to solve and what type of approach would be more effective in coming up with a proof.&quot;</p>
<p>In its most general form, the answer to your question is &quot;no&quot;. That runs afoul of various incompleteness theorems. However, the less formal notion of what is complex and what is simple, and whether we can distinguish between the two and how, is probably one of the deepest issues in mathematics &#8212; and computer science, for that matter.</p>

		<p>@Kevin: no syntactic ambiguity with &quot;nota-ble&quot;; it&#39;s fine (assuming you are tolerant of the phonetic school.)</p>
<p>There&#39;s a visual payoff you get from adding hyphens which varies depending on how much whitespace you avoid (either at the end of the line, or between words if you&#39;re justifying.) There&#39;s also a visual penalty you get from adding hyphens because the reader has to glue the pieces of the word back together in their head.</p>
<p>I posit that soft hyphens should only be added when the payoff is greater than the penalty. For example, if you&#39;re reading a newspaper with three-inch-wide columns, and someone uses a three words in a row that are two inches long, hyphenating the word in the middle has a high payoff and a low penalty.</p>
<p>I further posit that when hyphenating a short word on a blog with wide columns, the payoff is low and the penalty is high.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
