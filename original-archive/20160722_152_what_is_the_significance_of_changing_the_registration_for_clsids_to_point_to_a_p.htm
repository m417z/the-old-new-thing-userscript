<p>
A customer reported that several of their applications
stopped working after they installed a third-party
program, let's call it Contoso Deluxe.
They found that the Contoso Deluxe program,
as part of its installation,
rewrote some CLSID registrations.
For example,
<code>HKEY_<wbr>LOCAL_<wbr>MACHINE\<wbr
>SOFTWARE\<wbr>Classes\<wbr>CLSID\<wbr
>{F5078F37-C551-11D3-89B9-0000F81FE221}\<wbr>InProcServer32</code>
is normally
<code>%SystemRoot%\<wbr>System32\<wbr>msxml3.dll</code>,
but installing Contoso Deluxe changes it to
<code>C:\Program Files\<wbr>Contoso<wbr>\Common\<wbr>msxml3.dll</code>.
</p>
<p>
The customer wanted to understand the significance of this change.
</p>
<p>
The significance of this change is that the Contoso Deluxe program
hijacked a bunch of objects that normally belong to the
<code>MSXML3.DLL</code> that comes with the operating system,
redirecting requests for those object to the private copy of
<code>MSXML3.DLL</code> that comes with the Contoso Deluxe program.
</p>
<p>
I have two theories for why the Contoso Deluxe program does this.
The
<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanlon%27s_razor">
more charitable theory</a>
is that the developers wanted to redistribute
<code>MSXML3.DLL</code> and didn't know that there were
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc507441(v=vs.85).aspx">
specific instructions on how to do it correctly</a>.
Instead, they just packaged the DLL with their program and blasted
the registry keys as part of installation.
</p>
<p>
If that's the case, then they should have followed the
installation and redistribution instructions,
so that the <code>MSXML3.DLL</code> file gets installed properly.
Part of that proper installation is "If you see an
existing copy of <code>MSXML3.DLL</code> that is newer than the
one you are trying to install, then use the existing copy."
</p>
<p>
Another theory is that the developers found some sort of problem
with newer versions of <code>MSXML3.DLL</code> and decided to
solve the problem by locking
their program to a specific version of <code>MSXML3.DLL</code>
by packaging it with the program and directing all MSXML objects
to their private copy of <code>MSXML3.DLL</code>.
</p>
<p>
If that were indeed their intention, then they tried to apply
a global solution to a local problem.
Because what they did was redirect all MSXML objects
<i>for all applications in the system</i> to their private
copy of <code>MSXML3.DLL</code>,
even though they really wanted to redirect the object
only for their program.
The proper way to do this is to use an application manifest
and registration-free COM to redirect the classes just
for their program.
(Of course, the real proper way to solve the problem is
to figure out why their program doesn't work with
newer versions of <code>MSXML3.DLL</code>.)
</p>
<p>
Note also that a private copy of <code>MSXML3.DLL</code> will
not get serviced by Windows Update,
which means that machines with that private copy will not receive
<a HREF="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms02-008.aspx">
security fixes to <code>MSXML3.DLL</code></a>.
(More accurately, they will receive security fixes to
<code>C:\<wbr>Windows\<wbr>system32\<wbr>msxml3.dll</code>,
which is useless because the system is using
<code>C:\Program Files\<wbr>Contoso<wbr>\Common\<wbr>msxml3.dll</code>.)
</p>
<p>
We advised the customer to engage with Contoso
and work with them to fix the Contoso Deluxe program
so that it neither breaks every program that uses <code>MSXML3.DLL</code>,
nor prevents Windows Update from fixing security issues
in
<code>MSXML3.DLL</code>.</p>

		<p>I wonder what the bleep I would do if I found myself in a case where an update from MS was breaking my program and I could trace it to a bug in the update and I had no hope of getting a fix out of MS quickly.</p>
<p>Trying to work out how to pin a specific DLL version seems surprisingly reasonable, as does doing it wrong as this stuff is so non-discoverable.</p>

		<p>I remember some old versions of a well-known &#8220;portable document&#8221; viewer which modified the registry keys of the DWebBrowserEvents2 interface and locked down their permissions. These changes to the registry and a bug in the Internet Explorer 7 setup program contributed to installation failures on localized Windows XP and Windows Server 2003 systems.</p>

		<p>Am I correct that (Linux-side, not Windows) NixOS (programs) and Docker (containers) attempt to eliminate dependence of programs on global configuration?</p>

		<p>In Windows-world, global configuration has been going away for a while. COM has supported &#8220;registration free COM&#8221; (referenced by Raymond) since, if I remember correctly, XP.  There was an earlier version in Win2k I think.  Nearly all apps based on the .NET Framework generally do not include global configuration in their installation, and the move to local config has become more pronounced over time.  I haven&#8217;t used the Universal Windows stuff yet, but I&#8217;d be *very* surprised if any global configuration was required in that Framework.<br />
With containers, you can do all the global configuration you want &#8211; no one else will see it &#8211; the &#8220;global&#8221; world your app sees is local to your app.</p>

		<p>&gt; With containers, you can do all the global configuration you want – no one else will see it – the “global” world your app sees is local to your app.</p>
<p>Even within a container, it is a lot more reliable to do local configuration than pseudo-global configuration, because it makes it safer to fiddle with the container&#8217;s base image and/or install multiple applications into one container (which is unideal but may be necessary to deal with a variety of practical concerns).</p>

		<p>Huh.  I have used msxml from C++ and been pretty pleased with it.  I haven&#8217;t used PugiXml, but plenty of other XML libraries, and never one that made me want to not use msxml when it was an option (ie, any Windows-only project).</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
