<p>Today is <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Luther_King,_Jr._Day"> Martin Luther King, Jr. Day</a>, a <a href="http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-103hr1933rs/html/BILLS-103hr1933rs.htm"> federal holiday in the United States</a> honoring the civil rights leader and formally serving as a day to <a href="http://216.92.59.93/toa/codes/usc/titles/TITLE36/36USC169j.html"> reflect on the principles of racial equality and nonviolent social change</a> and more generally to <a href="http://mlkday.gov/"> honor Dr. King's legacy through service</a>.</p>
<p> At Microsoft, the day has been recognized with an event whose name is, um, well, the name keeps changing. Here are the names from recent years: </p>
<ul>
<li>2006: Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Event </li>
<li>2007: Martin Luther King, Jr. Celebration </li>
<li>2008: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day Event </li>
<li>2009: MLK Day Event </li>
<li>2010: Celebration to Honor Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. </li>
<li>2011: Martin Luther King Day of Celebration </li>
<li>2012: Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Celebration </li>
<li>2013: Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. Day of Celebration Event </li>
</ul>
<p> I like to think this is done intentionally just to keep people on their toes. </p>
<p> Ironically, although the event "celebrates diversity and inclusion," the email announcing the event inadvertently excludes people with visual impairments because it consists of a giant JPG with no ALT text. </p>
<p> (No dream report from me today. That would be disrespectful to <a href="http://www.americanrhetoric.com/speeches/mlkihaveadream.htm"> the man himself</a>.) </p>

		<p>So, here&#39;s M$ once again changing the name and even naming convention of a feature for no reason, solely because they are 2 TerraHitlers evil.</p>
<p>This name changing is why I&#39;m using Linux and it will be the death of M$ as a whole!!!</p>
<p>And now taking my tongue out of my cheek&#8230;</p>
<p>Why all the name changing? Any history out there?</p>

		<p>MLK first rose to fame by leading the protest when Rosa Parks was arrested for trying to sit in the front of a city bus.</p>
<p>In honor of his holiday, my city isn&#39;t running the shuttle bus I take to work, so no one can sit up front&#8230;.</p>

		<p>My city celebrates diversity and inclusion by having not one, but two MLK Day parades, because the two factions representing the parades have been squabbling over ownership rights to be &quot;The&quot; parade for almost 20 years. &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.defendernetwork.com/why-does-houston-have-two-mlk-parades/" rel="nofollow">http://www.defendernetwork.com/why-does-houston-have-two-mlk-parades</a></p>

		<p>Neither do I&#8230; Look: |||||||||| One of those isn&#39;t lined up like the others!</p>
<p>I&#39;d have thought that a big company would have had a policy for everything. Including a policy on the naming convention and formatting of social and/or celebratory events within the company.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;m just too used to the a very policy-mad Commission this side of the pond that mandates policies to the degree of &quot;Dish washing policy&quot; which names the sole brand of washing up liquid to be used.</p>
<p>Or, looking at it from another way, I would have thought that there would have been the same team responsiblke for organising this, and they would remember what they called it last year and called it the same this year (with the added benefit of them being able to reuse things from year to year)</p>

		<p>@Skip &#8211; I like to think of Houston&#39;s two MLK day celebrations as separate, but equal.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m actually amused that the problem is not with using the Hitler as the SI measure of evil, but spelling the prefix wrong.</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to save face here and point out I meant a dictator from Earth, as opposed to MoonHitler (insert insanity prawn boy laugh here)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
