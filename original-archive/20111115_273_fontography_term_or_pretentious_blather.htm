		<p>After reading audiophile-speak, fonto-phile-speak is almost as direct, as API documentation.</p>
<p>At least the typography industry is not trying to sell super-expensive power and USB &quot;magic&quot; cables for the printers.</p>

		<p>Humanist is a real one.</p>

<p>It&#39;s a perfectly good font that just happens to have been used in a ton of places that weren&#39;t appropriate for it. &nbsp;It&#39;s still really good for its intended use.</p>

		<p>Hah! Real old-time type snobs mock Souvenir, not Comic Sans. There was a Zippy comic strip from the 1980s that did this, I recall, though it incorrectly assumed that Souvenir was not only obnoxious but new.</p>

		<p>Humanist stood out a little too much from the others to be challenging, although international came close (there is a font family called Eurostile). Maybe I&#39;m biased however, since I know the history behind that name. But you could have thrown in some more like antique, grotesque, insular, prestige and rotund to blur the boundary a bit. (Gjb ner pybfr ohg abg dhvgr: nagvdhr fubhyq or nagvdhn naq ebghaq ebghaqn.)</p>
<p>@Miff: There is actually some truth to that. Helvetica has been used so much that simply not being Helvetica is becoming a plus.</p>
<p>@Merganthalersaurus: I personally don&#39;t like the (to my eyes) slightly uneven baseline and mean line, but other than that it&#39;s actually not a bad font.</p>

		<p>I know typography uses humanist and open, and I&#39;m guessing neutral, assertive and international as well. I&#39;m pretty they don&#39;t use aloof, cuddly and no-nonsense, but I&#39;m not sure about cold or quirky.</p>
<p>@frymaster: &quot;perfectly good&quot; is overly strong, but the hate it gets is misdirected, you&#39;re right.</p>
<p>Now to (attempt to) highjack the thread! Are the only reasons typographer&#39;s dislike Arial due to the idea it&#39;s ripping off Helvetica? Or are there real typographical reasons Helvetica is considered better? (I ask because I prefer Arial where they differ significantly)</p>

		<p>@Simon Buchan: there are historical reasons behind Helvetica&#39;s popularity. When it was released, not as varied a selection of fonts was available, and companies liked Helvetica because it has a rigid appearance (with which I mean that it prefers axis-aligned elements to slanted ones, and centres to off-centres) and this was taken to convey seriousness rather than playfulness. Companies wanted to express that they were business like, organisations that you can trust.</p>
<p>A whole generation of typographers (especially in the marketing segment) has more or less grown up on Helvetica. Use something enough and you become an advocate. It&#39;s why the Windows versus Mac flames exist, why Muslims never extol the virtues of Shintoism, and why people cling to Emacs and VI in a world with dozens of (depending on your use, probably better) editors. And don&#39;t forget that fans tend to be a lot more vocal than others.</p>
<p>Now, I don&#39;t hate Helvetica, and one argument against Arial does hold some water. Arial is based on a rather different family but takes on the metrics of Helvetica for non-aesthetic reasons. Turns out that the impact of that decision on the font&#39;s overall look is minimal to non-existent, but it is true. Other than that, Arial is well-designed and the differences between it and Helvetica are a matter of taste and perhaps context.</p>
<p>One last bit of advice: a widely distributed Helvetica True Type font (I won&#39;t say which one because this blog has a policy against that) is extremely badly hinted. If you, as a web designer, use Helvetica, there is a good chance that it will look very beautiful and solid on your screen, but simply horrid for most end-users.</p>

		<p>It is a shy white font, with typical characteristics of light spices, red berry, raspberry, cigar box and mint with a hint of plum. &nbsp;The gentle colour of this font indicates the intenseness of flavour lurking within. &nbsp;The complex nose is a combination of pistachios and pine smokiness with a hint of sweet vanilla. &nbsp;These in combination with crisp citrus aroma of the sans-serif taken from our exclusive typesetting portfolio enhance the length of flavour on the printed page, which is exceptional and exhibits an exquisite sweetness that is surprisingly full and dry. &nbsp;The 2008 vintage imports solid ligatures ensuring longevity and suggesting aging should be for at least 5 years. &nbsp;Ideally suited to cream-coloured 100gsm paper.</p>

		<p>Simon Garfield&#39;s recent book &#39;Just My Type&#39; is an entertaining populist survey of fontography. I&#39;m sure font pedants would find much to disagree with on every page of the book, because that&#39;s what that type of personality does on principle, but I found it fascinating.</p>

<p>@Frank: How about by actual characteristics of how the font looks?</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure that if you were to take ten fonts with descriptions in the style Raymond criticises and jumble them up, no one could link up font to description with any degree of reliability.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
