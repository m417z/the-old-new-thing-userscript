<p>A colleague of mine forwarded me some status mail from his team's internal bug push. (This is a push to fix bugs, not a push to introduce new bugs.) Apparently, one of the ways the developers lifted the tension was to discover some new <a href="http://www.chucknorrisfacts.com/"> Chuck Norris Facts</a>, two of which were shared in the status mail:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  Chuck facts today: </p>
<ul>
<li>Chuck Norris has never needed     <a href="http://www.wired.com/politics/law/news/1997/01/1484">     more than 640K of memory</a>. </li>
<li>Chuck Norris taught Raymond Chen Win32 programming. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p> Happy birthday, Chuck! </p>
<p> (Remember, don't let the facts get in the way of a good story.) </p>

		<p>&quot;Chuck Norris taught Raymond Chen Win32 programming.&quot; is really a nice one.</p>

		<p>No surprise &#8211; Chuck Norris also has the social skills of a thermonuclear device.</p>
<p>Actually, Chuck Norris has many of the skills of a thermonuclear device.</p>

		<p>I removed my formerly cherished Chuck Norris poster from the kitchenette after learning of his shenanigans. &nbsp;To paraphrase Mssr Chuck Norris: &#39;our poster as we know it may be lost forever.&#39;</p>
<p>I did not realize that you knew him: I would have tithed it to you. :)</p>

		<p>Chuck Norris may write to upper 2GB from user mode, but he never did this. He simple modify memory direcly &#8211; by knocking DIMMs by his little finger.</p>

		<p>Chuck Norris doesn&#39;t use CTRL + ALT + DEL. He uses CNTRL + C + N.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris does not require a paging file for crash dumps. &nbsp;If his computer crashes, it gets dumped. &nbsp;Therefore, his computer never crashes.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris calculated the last Mersenne Prime. &nbsp;He got tired of waiting on all those slow computers.</p>
<p>Chuck Norris dictated to Raymond Chen the entire series on scrollbars on Raymond Chen&#39;s blog.</p>
<p>All malware authors program their malware to never infect Chuck Norris&#39;s computer.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
