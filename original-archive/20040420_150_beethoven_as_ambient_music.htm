<p>Who knew that  <a href="http://www.notam02.no/9/">Beethoven wrote ambient music</a>?</p>
<p>  The people at NOTAM took Beethoven's 9th Symphony and slowed it down  so that the entire performance takes 24 hours.  It's actually quite nice  to listen to.  (I like  <a href="http://varpid.simnet.is/9bs/b921.mp3">2.1</a> myself.)  </p>
<p>  [Rats,  <a href="http://www.metafilter.com/mefi/32510">scooped by MetaFilter</a>.  Honest, it was in my queue!  Nobody will believe me; they'll think  I swiped it from MeFi...]  </p>
<p>  A few months ago,  <a href="http://www.npr.org/features/feature.php?wfId=1724372">  NPR covered a similar experiment with the movie <i>Psycho</i></a>.  I think it was a little less successful.  </p>

		<p>I saw &#8217;24 hour Psycho&#8217; when it was on at the CCA (<a target="_new" href="http://www.cca-glasgow.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cca-glasgow.com/</a>) in Glasgow . As a video installation it was amazing, I went many times during the 24 hour period. </p>
<p>The idea was that the movie is so well shot that each frame of it is a work of art as a still. Fairly inspired.</p>

		<p>Why is this surprising?  The music was initially intended for an ambient listening audience, magnifying duration by 20-30 factor just means a difference in human perception.  I forget the original length of a intended paced performance of the piece.</p>
<p>Sounds reminds me of the vangelis sound tracks of the late 70&#8217;s earlier 80&#8217;s slowed way down and with out the square wave emphasis.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m on dial-up and so can&#8217;t download it at the moment &#8230; but I&#8217;m just curious: how do they accomplish this? Do they slow it down and hold everything out forever, or do they just constantly add in repeats?</p>
<p>BTW, Peter, I&#8217;m not sure of the &quot;exact&quot; intended time&#8211;if there is one&#8211;but my (normal, of course) recording of this piece is just less than an hour long.</p>
<p>I really like this symphony, especially the fourth movement, but I&#8217;m not quite sure I could take this. :-)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
