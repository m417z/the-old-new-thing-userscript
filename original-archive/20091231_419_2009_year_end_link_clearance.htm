		<p>&quot;Technically the decade doesn&#8217;t end until next year, but try convincing anybody to care.&quot;</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t a &quot;decade&quot; just a periode of ten years, so it all depends what you set as the starting point?</p>
<p>If you start with year 0 instead of 1 (and who&#8217;d ever start counting from 1?) it works perfectly fine.</p>

		<p>I know it&#8217;s a sinkhole of an argument to get into but I would say that today ends the tenth year that began with Jan 1 2000.</p>

<p>Yes, now I remember hearing that before somewhere. And, that makes sense. But, I guess raymond was right in that I wasn&#8217;t convinced last time I heard it. Maybe this time it&#8217;ll stick.</p>
<p>I was thinking in terms of my daughter not being 1 until the end of her first year. So, I guess voo had a more valid comment.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Setting up automatic payments is easy. &nbsp;Stopping them is hard.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Not for my recent car payments &#8211; I went through the carmaker&#8217;s credit branch, and in September they made some changes to their website&#8230; which dropped my 4+ year old automatic monthly payment.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t notice until they called in November to say &quot;hi, we haven&#8217;t gotten your money, we&#8217;re dinging your credit&#8230; oh, you were doing it through our site? yeah, we made some changes two months ago and wiped out all the existing automatic payments. Still, your fault. Now where&#8217;s our money?&quot;</p>

		<p>John: My clock goes from 1:00 to 12:00, so does that mean the day doesn&#8217;t start until 1:00? Of course not! So whatever rationale you use to explain how 12:00 is really time 0, you can easily adapt it to explain how 1 BC is really year 0.</p>
<p>Alternatively, you can reason that since you still accept 00:00 as the start of the day even though leap seconds sometimes make days not exactly 24-hour periods for the sake of easy rounding, you can also accept that the first decade/century/millenium was just a year shorter than the current one to enable easy rounding.</p>

		<p>Gabe: your clock goes from 12:00 to 1:00, NOT 1:00 to 12:00&#8230;</p>
<p>And &#8216;popular misconception&#8217; does NOT create a fact. &nbsp;People celebrated the end of the 19th century at the end of the year 1900. &nbsp;So it would seem that &#8216;popular misconception&#8217; ended the second millennium a year early, NOT ending the first millennium early. &nbsp;Millennia, Centuries and decades all start/end with the same alignment.</p>
<p>Yes a &#8216;decade&#8217; is a span of 10 years, and can start and end whenever. &nbsp;HOWEVER, &#8216;the&#8217; decade must align with century etc, and will not end until the end of 2010. &nbsp;I&#8217;m with Raymond on this, 100%&#8230;</p>

		<p>Gabe: &nbsp;All I&#8217;m saying is that there is a valid technical reason why a few people whine about it every 10 years, not that I agree with them. &nbsp;I think it makes much more (common) sense to consider decades as starting and ending in years evenly divisible by 10. &nbsp;Can&#8217;t we all just agree that the first decade had an off-by-one error?</p>

		<p>So, if for some odd historical quirk, we started at year 3 when going into AD, would we say recent decades started in 1993, 2003, etc? &nbsp;No, that&#8217;s absurd. &nbsp;The idea of a decade is based on the nature of the numbering system (in our case, base 10) and not one when it started way back in the mists of history. &nbsp;When a unit carries over into the tens place, we have a new decade. &nbsp;Period. &nbsp;That&#8217;s it. &nbsp;If you want to talk about an arbitrary period of ten years, then that&#8217;s something else.</p>

		<p>My preference is a slider with &#8216;off&#8217; at the bottom. I grant you that it doesn&#8217;t hold the dim state when turned off, but I find it&#8217;s the easiest thing to use&#8230;</p>

		<p>Sorry, Raymond, I must have misunderstood your parenthetical remark. &nbsp;It seemed to suggest an opinion of when &#8216;the&#8217; decade ends that matches my education. &nbsp;I, too, have been accused of having the social skills of a thermonuclear weapon&#8230;</p>
<p>The fundamental concept is that there was no year &#8216;0&#8217; in the &#8216;modern era&#8217; (AD). &nbsp;So 1000 years passed at the end of year 1000. &nbsp;Simple&#8230;</p>
<p>I can remember (when I was less than 10), when the year 1960 ended and the &#8216;end of the 50&#8217;s&#8217; was celebrated on TV. &nbsp;I asked about it at that time, as it seemed confusing, and was informed by my elders that that is how it worked. &nbsp;Some research (no internet at that time) seemed to confirm their statements. &nbsp;As it was Walter Cronkite that was presenting the show, I was somewhat inclined to believe him, unlike modern &#8216;journalists&#8217;.</p>
<p>Hey, I got to celebrate the current millennium TWICE! &nbsp;Once when the masses celebrated, and once, a year later, when it actually occurred.</p>

		<p>Not accusing Raymond of taking any position (not arguing with the blog just adding a comment), but I think that it is perfectly fine to say the decade is ending.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just far more convenient if you want to break things into ten year periods that we can talk about.</p>
<p>For example, it&#8217;s easy to talk about the best baseball player of the 80s when you just look at the stats from the 80s (yes there is a little complication for the winter sports that roll over, but I&#8217;d argue they finished up with their 2009 championships).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easy to look at how the stock market did in the 80s.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to mess around saying &quot;Well the 80s are 1981-1990. &nbsp;No they aren&#8217;t they don&#8217;t have the 8 in the tens place.</p>
<p>A new decade is starting tomorrow. &nbsp;But then a new decade starts every year. &nbsp;So does a new century and millenium.</p>
<p>Certainly, 2001 was the start of THE third millenium (by the common calendar I am using for the example) because there was no year zero. &nbsp;And certainly THE 202nd decade of the calendar doesn&#8217;t start untill 2011.</p>
<p>But for purposes of common conversation about ten year periods, especially those in the 20th and 21st centuries, it&#8217;s just easier to use the tens digit.</p>

		<p>The difference is that phrases like &quot;20th century&quot; and &quot;21st century&quot; are common (and those <em>do</em> properly refer to 1901-2000, 2001-2100), whereas nobody says &quot;199th decade&quot; for 1981-1990.</p>

		<p>Years aren&#8217;t a consistent length and nobody has a problem with that, so nobody should really have a problem with the first decade/century/millennium being short a year either.</p>

		<p>My light switches are about as complicated. (They are Miros &#8211; I&#8217;ve mentioned them in a comment before.)</p>
<p>If off, tap up once to fade to preset.</p>
<p>If not off, tap up for full brightness.</p>
<p>Hold up or down to change brightness *and* preset.</p>
<p>Tap down once to turn off.</p>
<p>The trouble is that, for the 99% of the population, either they press and hold to turn them on &#8211; which changes my preset &#8211; or when the lights don&#8217;t come on instantly, they hold the button to *make* them come on &#8211; which changes my preset. And then they will press and hold to turn them off which sets the preset to off, which trains the next person to use the switch that press-and-hold is the only way it works.</p>
<p>If I could just figure out a way to lock in the preset&#8230;</p>

		<p>My version of GO.COM contained three NOP instructions, because the CP/M applications I once used had a feature that if you jumped to address 0x0103 then they would attempt to recover their state. (For instance, the BASIC interpreter would return to the Ready prompt.) Failing that you could simply press ^F to invoke the BIOS debugger and j(ump) directly to 103. (This was useful when you had disabled ^C.)</p>

		<p>@John Elliott: COM files are raw program images, they are plopped at 0x100 and jumped there.</p>
<p>@anon: My first guess would be Creative Labs&#8230; whose cards really just throw in a bunch of DSP stuff to do fancy effects. But looking at my Vista machine with generic Realtek audio, its drivers provide &quot;Environment&quot;, &quot;Voice Cancellation&quot;, &quot;Pitch Shift&quot;, and &quot;Equalizer&quot; effects. Plus there are the two Microsoft ones, &quot;Virtual Surround&quot; and &quot;Loudness Equalization&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing Analog Devices has their own bunch as well.</p>

		<p>&quot;Because the Windows Me team typed all filenames in CAPS (EXPLORER.EXE and NOTEPAD.EXE).&quot;</p>
<p>Nope, that is the nature of all 8.3 filenames, they are always in all caps, and don&#8217;t forget that Windows Me is still installed using DOS where there is no LFN support.</p>
<p>&quot;Regarding prettified filenames, I remember Windows 98 had this in folder options: &quot;Allow all uppercase filenames&quot;. I searched frantically for the DontPrettyPath option to work on Windows Me but it didn&#8217;t work. &quot;</p>
<p>Probably because WinMe Explorer is based more on the Win2000 Explorer which also don&#8217;t have that option, while Win98 Explorer comes from the IE 4 Shell Update that do have that option.</p>

		<p>The no year zero reason is a red herring. I hate it when people try to explain it that way. Non-programmers don&#8217;t start counting at zero anyway. Zero is just a point in time. Anything on either side of it is non-zero, so on a 24 hour clock one second from zero is already 0:00:01, which is the first second of the day. The reason English-speakers don&#8217;t get that year 2000 is in the 19th century, is that years are numbered in the cardinal, while centuries, millennia, and days are numbered in the ordinal. This is why nobody has a problem with December 31st being the last day of December, rather than December somehow ending as soon as &quot;day 31&quot; is reached. I suspect that in languages where this inconsistency does not exist (Russian comes to mind) this kind of misconception should not happen.</p>
<p>Now this does create a problem with BCE because the year numbers (and centuries and millenia) are counted backward in time, while months and days are still counted forward, so it is not at all clear when the first century BCE ends (or should that be begins?). The system is contradictory and actually makes the hypothetical year zero illogical. If there were a year zero, which century would it belong to? Neither or both? This is different from, say, the temperature scale where the negative numbers get less negative as it gets warmer.</p>

		<p>Some people think time itself didn&#8217;t exist enough far back in &quot;time&quot;. How do you count decades then?</p>

<p>Yes, the current decade and some days of the last one.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
