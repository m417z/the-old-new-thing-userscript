As a mental exercise, let's combine two mind-numbing facts about
pointers to member functions,
namely that
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/03/23/400938.aspx">
all pointers to virtual functions look the same</a>
and that
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/09/70002.aspx">
pointers to member functions are very strange animals</a>.
The result may make your head explode.
</p>
<p>
Consider:
</p>
<pre>
class Class1 {
 public: virtual int f() { return 1; }
};

class Class2 {
 public: virtual int g() { return 2; }
};

class Class3 : public Class1, public Class2 {
};

int (Class3::*pfn)() = Class3::g;
</pre>
<p>
Here, the variable <code>pfn</code> consists of
a code pointer and an adjustor.
The code pointer gives you the virtual call stub:
</p>
<pre>
 mov eax, [ecx]             ; first vtable
 jmp dword ptr [eax]        ; first function
</pre>
<p>
and the adjustor is <code>sizeof(Class1)</code>
(which in our case would be 4 on a 32-bit machine).
The result, then, of compiling a function call
<code>(p-&gt;*pfn)()</code> might look something like this:
</p>
<pre>
 mov ecx, p
 lea eax, pfn
 add ecx, dword ptr [eax+4] ; adjust
 call dword ptr [eax]       ; call
-- transfers to
 mov eax, [ecx]             ; first vtable
 jmp dword ptr [eax]        ; first function
-- transfers to
 mov eax, 2                 ; return 2
 ret
</pre>
<p>
Okay, I lied.
It's really not all that complicated after all.
But you can probably still impress your friends with this knowledge.
(If you have really geeky friends.)</p>

		<p>The pointer can be larger than that depending on the compiler options used (see <a target="_new" href="http://www.codeproject.com/cpp/FastDelegate.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/cpp/FastDelegate.asp</a> for a good discussion). Also, the only way to get the address of a member is &amp;Class3::g. The other ways Class3::g and &amp;(Class3::g) are explicitly not allowed in the C++ standard.</p>

		<p>asdf:<br />
<br />I knew about Class3::g being illegal but I&#8217;d never thought about trying &amp;(Class3::g) with the parenthesis like that.  Why is that illegal?  Is it something with Class3::g not being a proper reference on its own or something?</p>

		<p>How come my keyboard&#8217;s asdf keys are still working and it&#8217;s the jkl; keys that got barfed on?  Not fair!</p>
<p>Sure asdf, I know it&#8217;s not your fault, but you should have warned us not to look at that link after eating.</p>
<p>Hmm.  Anyone need a slightly used copy of INCITS+ISO+IEC+14882-2003.pdf for a nice low cheap price?</p>

		<p>That was adjustor *thunks*, which are related to but not the same as pointer-to-member-function adjustors.</p>

		<p>Err. May be I missed something but I believe this ANSI document should be a good substitute for ISO 14882:2003</p>
<p><a target="_new" href="http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/product.asp?sku=INCITS%2FISO%2FIEC+14882-2003" rel="nofollow">http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/product.asp?sku=INCITS%2FISO%2FIEC+14882-2003</a></p>
<p>And it is only $18 for PDF.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
