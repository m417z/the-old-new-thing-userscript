<p> At Microsoft, this common English language idiom is treated as a normal part of the language. The metaphorical <i>plate</i> has become a synonym for <i>assigned tasks and responsibilities</i> and can be used as a basis for new idioms. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  That feature moved off their plate onto ours. </p>
<p> Feature&nbsp;X got postponed to the next release, so there's room on our plate for Feature&nbsp;Y. </p>

<p> <b>Update</b>: Apparently there are some people who believe that Microspeak should restrict itself to jargon used at Microsoft and nowhere else. I employ a broader definition which includes the use of existing jargon which is used in an unusual way or used much more heavily than in the general population. Today's entry is one of the latter: I already pointed out that <i>to have a lot on one's plate</i> is a standard English idiom. What makes it Microspeak is how the word <i>plate</i> has taken on a life of its own at Microsoft, to the point where the original idiom is almost lost. </p>
<p> I apologize to those for whom this explanation was not necessary. </p>

		<p>Indeed, the concept of moving tasks off of someone&#8217;s plate is common where I work. However, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve heard people refer to room on the plate itself.</p>

		<p>I think everyone everywhere in the world has said this. &nbsp;Yes, even the one&#8217;s that don&#8217;t speak English. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t ask me how, but it&#8217;s that common. &nbsp;Somewhere it&#8217;s a baby&#8217;s first words out of the womb right now.</p>
<p>Next month&#8217;s Microspeak: the word &#8216;the&#8217;</p>
<p>I think I&#8217;ve made my point. &nbsp;Now I&#8217;m just beating a dead horse.</p>
<p>&#8230;THAT&#8217;S IT! &nbsp;Beating a dead horse! &nbsp;That can be Microspeak next time. &nbsp;No one ever uses that.</p>

		<p>A fairly good sign that someone spends too much time in one sphere/group of people is when the lack of exposure to outside/additional references results in a belief that something that occurs in that sphere/within that group is actually specific to that sphere or group.</p>
<p>Here &quot;The Plate&quot; referenced directly in such a way is more likely to derive from baseball (I think?). &nbsp;As in&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;If we are going to get this done in time someone needs to step up to The Plate&quot;</p>
<p>Not that I am immune to making such suppositions about exclusive ownership of idioms myself of course.</p>
<p>Being an ex-pat POM in NZ it&#8217;s a fairly common mistake &#8211; even after 3+ years &#8211; to assume that certain idioms are unique to UK English where in fact they are known in NZ, just not used perhaps quite so often among the group of Kiwis that I have come to know.</p>
<p>&quot;Got a PS3 last week &#8211; it&#8217;s the dogs bollocks &#8211; as we say back in the UK&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Yeah mate, we say it here too&quot;</p>
<p>(but the equivalent &quot;puppies privates&quot; doesn&#8217;t seem to have made it here, well not until I arrived anyway)</p>
<p>Often more surprising though are those things that you might expect to be common, but which are in fact not.</p>
<p>Talk about a &quot;lorry&quot; here in NZ and you&#8217;ll get nothing but blanks looks and confusion.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s TRUCK, dummy.</p>

		<p>Gene&gt; Well you&#8217;re completly wrong.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a native ebglish speaker but I&#8217;ve been working for quite some time now in the UK, and I had never heard anyone saying that before.</p>
<p>Everyone who says stuff like that are just taking for granted something that is not.</p>

<p>&#8216;having a full plate&#8217; and &#8216;stepping up to the plate&#8217; have two different roots. &nbsp;dinner plates vs baseball</p>

<p>Indeed &#8211; we could even characterize &quot;some people&quot; more precisely as &quot;people who noticed that &#8216;Microspeak&#8217; and &#8216;Microsoft&#8217; share a root word.&quot;</p>
<p>Even if they haven&#8217;t read 1984.</p>

		<p>@Maurits:</p>
<p>Maybe if you read more than the first sentence of the update, you&#8217;ll understand how Microsoft is still related to Microspeak without it being unique to Microsoft. &nbsp;In the same way that a word in American English can also be in UK English, but nevertheless used more or differently.</p>
<p>The 1984 reference blows me away. &nbsp;Newspeak was about two things:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Absolute precision in communication.</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Removing the ability to communicate certain ideas unfriendly to the Party.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Which is basically the opposite of what happens here.</p>
<p>And if you&#8217;re just non-sequitor referencing the &quot;we have always been at war with Eastasia&quot; theme, well, I&#8217;d say that attacking the word Microspeak based on selectively ignoring the text which explains it is a prime example of doublethink.</p>

		<p>The 1984 reference was indeed to Newspeak, but only the sense of a compound noun ${foo}speak.</p>
<p>If the ${foo}speak meme predates 1984, I withdraw the reference.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
