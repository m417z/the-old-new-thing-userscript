<p>As part of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/07/04/435286.aspx"> going-away festivities for my friend</a>, a group of us went to <a href="http://www.theherbfarm.com">The Herbfarm</a>, the local restaurant referenced in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/07/04/435288.aspx"> Clue&nbsp;I of Puzzle&nbsp;#3</a>.</p>
<p> The restaurant is nestled in the Sammamish Valley, right next to the <a href="http://www.willowslodge.com/">Willows Lodge</a> resort and its restaurant, <a href="http://www.willowslodge.com/barkingfrog/"> The Barking Frog</a>. Less than a kilometer down the road is the <a href="http://www.ste-michelle.com/"> Chateau Ste. Michelle Winery</a>. All the high-falutin' wine-snob destinations in one convenient location. (Right behind is the <a href="http://www.redhook.com/"> Redhook Brewery</a>, if you tire of the whole urbane ambience and just want a beer and a sandwich.) </p>
<p> Actually, the word "restaurant" doesn't do the Herbfarm justice. It's really a "total dining experience". The evening begins at 4pm with a tour of the herb garden. After heading inside, you are introduced to the evening's menu and the restaurant staff. (This restaurant has a staff mushroom forager!) Once the introductions are complete, the nine-course five-hour meal begins. </p>
<p> For posterity, I record the menu below. </p>

<p> Between the duck and salad courses, we stepped outside to <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/sherrygrindeland/2002348121_grin25e.html"> feed the pigs</a>. </p>
<p> The preliminary tour of the herb garden primed me to appreciate the extensive range of herbs employed in the various dishes. (We also learned herb trivia&mdash;daylilies are edible, as are zucchini and chive blossoms. I found this part most fascinating, learning about herbs and how the various elements were chosen for the dishes to come.) The garden salad, it seemed, didn't have two leaves from the same plant! </p>
<p> If you're considering paying the Herbfarm a visit, be warned: You need to make reservations months in advance, and the evening will set you back a pretty penny. </p>
<p> And we did pay the bill before we left. </p>

		<p>My personal favorite at the Herbfarm is the festival for a Copper King.</p>
<p>And the festival of mushrooms in the fall is also wonderful, especially if you&#8217;re a vegitarian.<br /></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
