<p>Last year, in honor of Mother's Day (the United States version), the John F. Kennedy Library <a href="http://jfklibrary.tumblr.com/post/49522191320/in-honor-of-mothers-day-heres-an-entertaining"> shared a letter sent by President Kennedy to his mother</a>.</p>
<p> Mrs. Kennedy had contacted Premier Khrushchev asking for an autographed photo, copies of which were subsequently forwarded to the White House so that the President could sign them as well. President Kennedy tries to express in the politest language he can muster that the mother of a sitting president directly contacting a foreign dignitary is "subject to interpretations", and that in the future, it would be greatly appreciated if she would let the White House clear any future such contacts. </p>
<p> It so happened that this particular letter-writing incident occurred very close to the Cuban Missile Crisis. I can imagine President Kennedy burying his hand in his face upon realizing that his mother may have inadvertently exacerbated a major international crisis, just by doing what moms do. </p>

		<p>I like how his mother told him that when she was going to ask for Castro&#39;s autograph she would let him know beforehand.</p>

		<p>And Rose Kennedy replied &quot;I understand very well your letter, although I had not thought of it before. &#8230;When I ask for Castro&#39;s autograph, I will let you know in advance!&quot; Now, this is a bit hilarious.</p>
<p>Anyway, I fail to see what&#39;s embarrassing about that. Maybe catastrophic, but embarrassing? No way.</p>

		<p>&quot;President Kennedy burying his hand in his face&quot;</p>
<p>Was this supposed to be &quot;burying his face in his hand&quot;? &nbsp;The current phrasing, however, has a much more interesting visual.</p>

		<p>@GregM,</p>
<p>I think both are acceptable but suggest different meanings. &quot;Burying his face in his hand&quot; suggests that his head tilts downward into his face. However, &quot;burying his hand in his face&quot; suggests that his hand presses into his face.</p>

		<p>&quot;However, &quot;burying his hand in his face&quot; suggests that his hand presses into his face.&quot;</p>
<p>Exactly. &nbsp;It made me think of him punching himself in the face.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
