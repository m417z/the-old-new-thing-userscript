<p>I actually came back Thursday night, but I've been too lazy to jot down some reactions until now.</p>
<p> There are signs on the street directing you to a tram connecting the Monte Carlo hotel with the Bellagio. but once you follow the first sign (that takes you into the casino), there are no more signs telling you how to get to the tram. <a href="http://www.vegasfreebie.com/bellagio-monte-carlo-tram.html"> The tram is a lie</a>. </p>
<p> Actually, the tram does exist, but it's not marked. You have to <a href="http://lasvegas4newbies.com/chap4-5.html"> walk through the entire Monte Carlo casino to the Street of Dreams shops</a>, and then past them and up a flight of stairs to the tram station. When you reach the Bellagio, you then have to do the reverse, walking through the Bellagio to get your way back to the street. I'm not sure if it's actually faster than just walking the regular way. </p>
<p> Note to people who choose swag for conferences: if people are flying into your conference, a toy gun is probably not a good choice for a giveaway. </p>
<p> A word of warning to Japanese tourists: The people in costumes standing around enticing you to pose with them for a picture? After you take your picture, they're going to ask you for money. And apparently, <a href="http://vegasphotographyblog.com/2011/01/las-vegas-street-performers-what-to-watch-for/"> the practice has spread to helpful "volunteer" photographers</a> who will just shrug and walk away if they break your camera. </p>
<p> The <a href="http://www.marqueelasvegas.com/"> Marquee</a> bills itself as a "Nightclub and Dayclub." Doesn't that just make it a "Club"? </p>
<p> I didn't win a Niney, but I did get to meet Lady Gaga (or a least a Lady Gaga impersonator). As a courtesy, I called her "Your Grace." I knew it wasn't the correct honorific, but she seemed okay with it. </p>
<p> Man, that <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Forums/Coffeehouse/Please-join-us-for-the-Nineys"> Niney</a> award is <i>heavy</i>. And Scott won two of them! If he packs them both in the same suitcase, he's going to get a hernia. </p>
<p> At the urinal is a small shelf, presumably a place to put your drink while you make room for your next drink. </p>
<p> Let me get this straight. If you visit the Paris Hotel and take a picture of the fake Eiffel Tower, you'll also capture in the frame a U.S. flag. I guess that's sort of like the fake streets mapmakers add so they can detect copyright violations. </p>
<p> One of the figures atop the Paris Hotel is a statue with the simple label <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abbot_Suger"> Suger</a>. Once again proving that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/13/58200.aspx"> if you know Swedish, the world is funnier</a>. In Swedish, <i>suger</i> means <i>sucks</i>. </p>
<p> When airline pilots come onto the speaker to tell you the weather at your destination, why do they all assume they're talking to other pilots? "The winds are out of the south-southwest, and the cloud ceiling is 10,000 feet, with visibility of five miles and air pressure of 30.05 inches." The only way this could be made more useless would be if a passenger shouted out, "But <a href="http://weather.noaa.gov/weather/metar.shtml"> what's the dew point</a>?" One of my friends suggested that airline pilots are simply frustrated that they couldn't make it as a weatherman. </p>
<p> My clothes smell like cigarette smoke, so I guess what happens in Vegas doesn't always stay in Vegas. </p>

		<p>&quot;The tram is a lie.&quot;</p>
<p>The tram between the Excalibur and Mandalay Bay is at least better located, but it wasn&#39;t actually running the two times I needed it.</p>
<p>&quot;At the urinal is a small shelf.&quot;</p>
<p>Isn&#39;t that normal?</p>
<p>&quot;When airline pilots come onto the speaker to tell you the weather at your destination&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>Really? I&#39;ve never heard an airline pilot just give a straight METAR report. Usually they just say &quot;partly cloudy and 20 degrees Celcius&quot; or something like that.</p>

		<p>The Eiffel tower observation reminded me about the US Post Office issuing new stamps with a photo of the Statue of Liberty. &nbsp;It&#39;s funny, because it&#39;s a photo of the replica in Vegas rather than the one in New York.</p>

		<p>The airline pilots are just reading out the METAR that they&#39;ve just received from the Air Traffic Controllers at the destination (or maybe some en-route controllers), with some minimal METAR-to-natural-language translation. &nbsp;See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/METAR" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/METAR</a></p>

<p>Raymond calls a Lady Gaga impersonator &quot;Your Grace&quot; (and blogs about it) so you don&#39;t have to! (Thanks for the service!)</p>

<p>Well, I suppose that STD&#39;s don&#39;t stay in Vegas either (so, things could be worse!).</p>

		<p>&quot;I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s actually faster than just walking the regular way.&quot;</p>
<p>Most definitely, it&#39;s not (faster) since you and it travel a longer distance. But it sure as hell is better than walking the regular way during the 110-degrees summer months, unless you like to be cover in sweat by the time you reach your destination. It also works during the &quot;winter&quot;, in case you are wearing a skimpy mini-dress/skirt and you don&#39;t like the feel of the cool breeze.</p>

		<p>RE: &quot;One of my friends suggested that airline pilots are simply frustrated that they couldn&#39;t make it as a weatherman.&quot;</p>
<p>Having taken some pilot training, I can assure you that pilots know as much or more about weather than &quot;weathermen.&quot; Fully half of learning to fly is learning about weather. Considering mother nature can really mess you up in an airplane, it&#39;s good to know how she works.</p>

		<p>Next time the pilot does that, ask for the full report&#8230; you want the full wind direction, speeds and gusts. And ask about any remarks too. You can get cloud breakdowns and such&#8230;</p>

		<p>I believe Lady Gaga would hold the rank of Baroness, and should be therefore addresses has &quot;Your Ladyship&quot;. &quot;Your grace&quot; is, as you say, for Duchess, which is a significantly higher rank, and so I&#39;m not surprised she was OK with it.</p>

		<p>Pilots and weather: It&#39;s kind of like when a non-geek asks us why their computer is slowing down. When we mention RAM, Registry, Hard Drives, Operating Systems, Installed program, Trojans, Ad-ware, Plug-ins&#8230;&#8230; we do it accidentally because we have had large parts of that knowledge for a long, long time, and can&#39;t really remember how it is NOT to know this.</p>
<p>Most pilots learn to fly around the age of 20 (many start earlier, down to around 13 or 14 if they start with flying gliders) and when they say only what Raymond mentioned in the post they are already simplifying it down to what feels like child level.</p>

		<p>And here I thought smoking had been banned in Nevada in public places so that I could finally visit. A bit of searching shows that it&#39;s only banned where food is served, so lots of bars have stopped serving foods and the casinos are fair game.</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
