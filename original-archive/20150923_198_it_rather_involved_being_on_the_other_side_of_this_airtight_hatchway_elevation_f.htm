<p>
A security vulnerability report arrived that took the following form:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
I have discovered a critical security vulnerability in Windows
which I intend to present at the XYZ conference.
It allows any user with administrator privileges to
perform operation Q, something that should be
available only to SYSTEM.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I think you know how this story ends.
If you have administrator privileges, then you are already
on the other side of the airtight hatchway.
That you can use administrator privileges to pwn the machine
is not interesting,
because by virtue of being an administrator
<i>you already pwn the machine</i>.
</p>
<p>
There is formally a distinction between Administrator and SYSTEM,
seeing as they are some things which are ACL'd so that SYSTEM
can do them and not arbitrary adminitrators,
but that distinction is formal and not practical.
An administrator who wanted to get some code running as SYSTEM
could install a service that runs as SYSTEM.
Or
use Debug Privilege
to take over a process (say, a service)
running as SYSTEM.
Or simply
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/adioltean/archive/2004/11/27/271063.aspx">
open a command prompt as SYSTEM and go to town</a>.
No need to go through the complex operation Q to get SYSTEM access.
</p>
<p>
So yes, a user with administrator privileges can use operation Q
to do things that are normally limited to SYSTEM.
But so what?
Users with administrator privileges already have plenty of easier ways
of doing things that are normally limited to SYSTEM.
The distinction between the SYSTEM and Administrator accounts
is a roadblock to make it harder to mess up your
system by mistake.
You can still mess up your system, but you have to try harder.
</p>
<p>
Before dismissing these reports, you have to verify that
the attack is
effective only against the current machine.
In other words,
that obtaining administrator privileges on the computer
gets you nothing more than administrator privileges on the computer.
And in this case, that was true.
The attack described gives the user access to the local machine,
but had no effect on other machines.

		<p>But according to restricted tokens and deny-only SIDs, you&#39;re not longer supposed to be, unless something is forbidden to admins, then you still are.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it means UAC actually is crap like the detractors said, and power users who can afford two accounts should still run as a fully limited user like they did in Windows XP.</p>

		<p>@Joshua:</p>
<p>But does that work from a limited administrator token without triggering UAC when the UAC settings are set to always notify? That is when it is a true security vulnerability.</p>
<p>Remember, that the default UAC setting is in response to people complaining that UAC was still too chatty during Windows Vista&#39;s lifetime. So Microsoft allowed some programs to elevate without prompting. It was these programs that were generally the cause. I think the COM elevation moniker was also one potential path too. It has been too long since I looked into it myself that I have forgotten a lot.</p>
<p>The UAC settings make this really clear. The default settings for UAC are recommended if you use mostly familiar programs and visit familiar websites. If you set it to always notify, then it suddenly starts notifying for these white listed applications. This is also recommended if you install unfamiliar applications or visit unfamiliar websites.</p>
<p>So while the default UAC setting reduces noise in some situations, a malicious developer could use that to their advantage. For the airtight hatchway, this is similar to leaving a remote opening device outside, hidden in a place that only people inside know where to find it. It doesn&#39;t stop people who are allowed onto the other side from misusing it, and it doesn&#39;t stop people who aren&#39;t supposed to be on the other side from stumbling across it.</p>

		<p>@Darran Rowe: yes it does.</p>
<p>For those who care about my attitude about UAC, as a developer I only want two easy fixes: whatever permissions on the Users group should not require elevation to use (I&#39;m looking at SeCreateSymbolicLink) and a LOGON_USER_INTERACTIVE_ELEVATED (for services that serve login sessions. I know otherwise how to deal with it with no penalty to users whenever I can avoid architecturally stupid product requirements (e.g. Office automation) when handling sensitive data.</p>
<p>As a USER it bugs the heck outta me for things I can&#39;t even figure out what fix would be appropriate (darn that command typed into cmd.exe needed elevation). I&#39;ve taken to making the main cmd.exe shortcut &quot;run with highest privileges&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Medinoc: the point of UAC, as I see it, is that you *can* now run two separate accounts, because developers have (mostly) been forced to actually make their programs work without admin privilege.</p>
<p>It&#39;s annoying as heck, but it did the job. &nbsp;I look after computer labs at a University, and before Vista came along, I often had to mess about to get software to work for the students. &nbsp;Nowadays, well, it still happens now and then, but only very rarely.</p>

<p>Well, the whole thing that it creates a restricted token by removing a set list of privileges rather than checking what you have set on the users group is daft. It is like they didn&#39;t take into account that limited users could have the privileges changed. That has always irked me too.</p>

		<p>Dear Mr Chen,</p>
<p>I am afraid I know of no other way of contacting you and hence apologize for the offtopic posting. I have just acquired an old AlphaServer DS20 and I am playing around with the old Windows 2000 pre-release versions that exist for Alpha. Now I have stumbled across your posting (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.08.windowsconfidential.aspx">technet.microsoft.com/&#8230;/2008.08.windowsconfidential.aspx</a>) which suggests there might be a Windows Server 2003-Version for Alpha as well. Is there any way of obtaining that version &#8211; even if it means to pay for it? I would be very grateful if you (or anyone else knowing something about this) could answer here or drop me a short line: <a href="mailto:laserdrome@gmail.com">laserdrome@gmail.com</a></p>
<p>Kind regards</p>

		<p>There was one time when I accidentally started the Task Manager as SYSTEM. It was Windows 7, probably pre-SP1. I could not reproduce it anymore after SP1. It might have been that Ctrl+Shift+Esc got handled through a top level window of a process which ran as SYSTEM. </p>

		<p>@yurikus</p>
<p>You can write an app that if running as Admin, that can launch apps as SYSTEM.</p>
<p>From memory: Run app as admin, elevated if UAC is eneabled -&gt; Open a process running as SYSTEM and duplicate its token -&gt; Use SetTokenInformation() to set the token session id -&gt; Launch another process with using CreateProcessWithToken().</p>
<p>I&#39;ve not tried this, but I guess you could use this to launch Windbg as SYSTEM to debug services which only misbehave as SYSTEM.</p>

		<p>@Myria: No, that&#39;s just malware resistance. You can bypass the EV certificate requirement easily, but it&#39;s noisy. Device Guard is also easily defeated, but only if the hardware is in front of you.</p>

		<p>Whenever a security vulnerability is found in any of the safety nets or so called security boundaries in windows, the answer is always that it was not intended to protect they user. We&#39;re told it&#39;s a feature, not a bug. But next version of windows usually try to fix it.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
