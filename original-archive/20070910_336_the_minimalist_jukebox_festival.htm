<p>Last year, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5297326"> NPR covered The Minimalist Jukebox Festival</a>, a <a href="http://wdch.laphil.com/minimalism/"> week-long exploration of the school of minimalist music</a>. The NPR story includes a clip of my favorite minimalist work: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000006E4C?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tholneth-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B000006E4C"> <i>Music for 18 Musicians</i></a>, as well as a telling of the classic minimalism knock-knock joke.</p>
<p> I remember reading somewhere that the world premiere of <i>Music for 18 Musicians</i> was performed by an ensemble of only <i>seventeen</i> musicians by doubling up a vocalist with an instrumental line. This was done to reduce the cost of travel. If true, it would make for another one of those "Unfair trivia questions" like "How many years did the Hundred Years' War last?" </p>
<p> One last story about <i>18 Musicians</i> before I let you go. One of the managers in my group needed an audio CD to demonstrate some feature or other, so he came into my office and borrowed my copy of <i>18 Musicians</i>, unaware of what lay in store. When he returned the CD afterwards, he told me that when he popped in the CD, he thought it was skipping, since the opening of the piece consists of a single note repeated. That's what you get when you borrow a CD of minimalism... </p>

		<p>In a similar vein to the &#8216;skipping CD&#8217; problem, about a week ago my main home PC hit an unexplained I/O error, playing music from my NAS system. Because of the I/O error, the music player looped playing the last buffer contents &#8211; which happened to sound exactly like the &#8216;click&#8230;whir&#8217; of a dying hard drive. Combine that noise &#8211; from a speaker near the RAID array &#8211; with the I/O error on screen: result, me spending several minutes trying to figure out which drive has failed and why it produced this result&#8230;</p>

		<p>I wish I could come up with some &quot;work free&quot; way of bilking individuals out of their wealth by calling my creations &quot;art.&quot; Get snooty and and saying critics aren&#8217;t smart/capable/avant-garde enough to understand it. Profit! If I&#8217;m really good, maybe I&#8217;ll get some grants too, or that British prize, the Turner&#8230;</p>
<p>A-flat for 15 minutes. Since I think &quot;defecate in a box&quot; and it&#8217;s various incarnations have won too many times.</p>

		<p>A co-worker had that network-timeout buffer-cached-loop skipping problem come up once upon a time, but it was techno music, so it was several minutes before he realized there was a problem.</p>

		<p>As is happens, Music For 18 Musicians is one of my very favorite pieces of orchestral music. Yes, at a shallow level it may sound like endless repetition (apropos &quot;the CD player&#8217;s skipping&quot; comment; I have heard that said about the piece whan I&#8217;ve had it on in a semi-public work area), but the subtle variations are where this music breathes for me. And unbeknownst to me, it introduced my mind to a very common 6/8 bell pattern from Afro-Cuban folkloric music, a pattern that became explicit for me when I started studying that genre of music. Anyways, great music for working to, or riding a stationary bike.</p>

		<p>Heh&#8230; I have trouble when I need an audio CD at work, because the only time I do is when I buy one and haven&#8217;t brought it home.</p>
<p>Alas, people know me as the tech guy, so they ask me for MP3s and videos&#8230; but the don&#8217;t realize I don&#8217;t have mainstream music tastes. I basically ask my coworkers for generic music, since it beats responding with something strange.</p>

		<p>Eventually, I grew to love &quot;Music for 18 Musicians.&quot; &nbsp;Great to work to, but I&#8217;ve seen it give one person a headache.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
