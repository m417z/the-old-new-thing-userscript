		<p>Being born and raised in Renton during the late 70&#8217;s that Almost Live skit skit is spot on.</p>
<p>Almost Live was a great show, they started playing reruns again.</p>

		<p>The idea that working-class people and their neighborhood could ever be respectable&#8230; sheesh!</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t live anywhere near Seattle and I get the gist of what you meant to say, but it does come off as a bit&#8230; demeaning?</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t object to the euphemism in general, but I think your particular phrasing was poor. &nbsp;To me it reads as thus: &quot;LOL! &nbsp;Those working-class losers are a bunch of schmucks! &nbsp;I laugh at the peasants from my ivory tower!&quot;. &nbsp;Obviously I know that&#8217;s not what you meant, but the phrasing could have been better. &nbsp;What&#8217;s wrong with &quot;bad part of town&quot; or the venerable &quot;sh*t-hole&quot;?</p>

		<p>For those keeping score at home, that&#8217;s three people who aren&#8217;t from Renton yet take issue and one from Renton who does not.</p>
<p>Recklessly speaking on behalf of the entire population of Kent, Raymond is correct. It is a very funny sentence.</p>

		<p>Have they seen what&#8217;s going on in Youngstown, Ohio? A working-class city devastated by the loss of manufacturing is in a decade-long process of revitalization, centered around a completely rewritten city plan. All their hard work is starting to show its results. You can see the city plan and the neighborhoods at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youngstown2010.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.youngstown2010.com/</a></p>

		<p>While watching a Seahawks game the other night, I was shocked to see a commercial for Renton (it&#8217;s now apparently &quot;Ahead of the Curve&quot;) staring John Keister from Almost Live. &nbsp;I think this might be a sign of the Apocalypse.</p>

		<p>I think the word &quot;respectable&quot; is referring to the price of houses? See the note about the value of houses can be more than $400,000.</p>
<p>I have no idea about the housing prices in the area. Is that price &quot;respectable&quot;? :P</p>

		<p>@Chris &#8212; Renton has been &quot;Ahead of the Curve&quot; for a long, long time. The slogan is a play on words. It is a reference to the &quot;S Curves&quot; on Interstate-405.</p>
<p>From Wikipedia &quot;I-405 is known for its meandering &quot;S-curves&quot; through Renton.&quot; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_405_%28Washington%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interstate_405_%28Washington%29</a>)</p>
<p>To the north of Renton there were big S-shaped curves in the highway. So, Renton is &quot;ahead&quot; of the s-curves.</p>
<p>Often a traffic congestion bottleneck occurred in the s-curves because of the need to slow down, and there was a major construction project to straighten the curves in the early 1990s. The highway isn&#8217;t totally straight now, but much better and the highway gets all the same rights and privileges as straight highways.</p>
<p>PS: As a native of Bellevue, the only respectable Seattle suburb, Renton is &quot;behind the curve&quot; when you&#8217;re driving the other direction. I wish they&#8217;d bring back Almost Live.</p>

		<p>By the way &#8211; do any of Raymond&#8217;s readers from the Renton area have a link to the original Renton &quot;Ahead of the Curve&quot; jingle circa 1997/98? &nbsp;That thing was hilariously atrocious &#8211; Dave Ross even made note of how awful it was when it aired as a commercial on his show.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
