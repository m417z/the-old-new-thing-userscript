<p>There are 64 bits of styles in the parameters to CreateWindowEx. Which ones belong to whom?</p>
<p> Windows defines the meanings of the high word of the dwStyle parameter and all of the bits in the dwExStyle parameter. The low 16 bits of the dwStyle parameter are defined by the implementor of the window class (by the person who calls RegisterClass). </p>
<p> In Windows 95, we found several apps that noticed that some bits in the dwExStyle weren't being used, so they decided to use them for themselves. Then when we added meanings to those bits (such as WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW), these programs started acting funny. </p>
<p> So don't be like those programs.  Don't use bits that don't belong to you. </p>
<p> If you need more than 16 bits of style information, you can design your class so additional information is passed in the lpParam parameter (the last one) to CreateWindow/Ex, which can be received from the lpCreateParams member of the CREATSTRUCT structure. Alternatively, you can set additional styles with a custom message, such as listview's LVM_SETEXTENDEDLISTVIEWSTYLE message. </p>

		<p>Well if the bits are invalid and reserved, then why don&#8217;t you make Windows fail if someone tries to use an extended style bit it doesn&#8217;t know about?  Then a person has to check for capabilities before specifying a bit, and it&#8217;ll fail if they try something stupid.  You can&#8217;t worry about people using a system in a way you don&#8217;t intend if you don&#8217;t let them.</p>

		<p>Because CreateWindowEx was designed back in the days when programs were trusted not to be stupid (Windows 3.0).</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s enforced now, so at least nobody will make this mistake in the future. I hope.</p>

		<p>BTW, what is the reason for it&#8217;s not being possible to drop stuff on taskbar buttons?</p>

		<p>Because there is no GetDropTargetFromWindow API.</p>

		<p>This has always bugged me (not being able to drop onto taskbar buttons). I try to do it several times a week, even though I know it won&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t buy the explanation about why it can&#8217;t be done. A drop onto a taskbar button could&#8211;and should&#8211;be treated the same as a drop onto the corresponding titlebar.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll have to write a hack to fix this, just to prove it can be done! :-)</p>

		<p>Each window class defines its private style bits, and you can&#8217;t just mix-and-match.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
