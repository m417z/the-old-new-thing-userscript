<p>One of my friends introduced me to <a href="https://www.billmonk.com/"> Bill Monk</a>, which is like <a href="https://www.paypal.com/"> PayPal</a> but without the money. You and your friends sign up, and then you can let the site keep track of who owe whom how much.</p>
<p> Of course, whether this is useful to you depends on how you and your friends actually deal with money and small debts. With some of my friends, we use the "It'll all even out in the end" strategy. We'll take turns paying for dinner and events based on the "I think it's my turn" honor system. </p>
<p> With another group of friends, the bills are neatly tabulated and reckonings sent out by email for settlement. They use this system since they've known each other since college (I joined later), back when money was in short supply, and in order to accommodate group members of varying financial means. For this group, Bill Monk works great (and replaces a similar system some of us had set up to do exactly this). </p>

		<p>My friend and I kept talking about making exactly this, but now that you point it out I don&#8217;t have to do the development. Thanks.</p>

		<p>Me and my friends do the honor system too until we noticed one guy that never seemed to pay&#8230; ever&#8230; so we stopped inviting him to come to lunch with us. &nbsp;Problem solved.</p>

		<p>My favorite method of paying the dinner bill is credit card roulette. &nbsp;Everyone puts a card in the hat and you let the waitress pick the winner!</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m the co-founder of BillMonk. Raymond, thanks for the kind words! We couldn&#8217;t agree more that BillMonk helps many, but not all, social money situations. If you have a system that already works for you, that&#8217;s great. As to BlakeHandler&#8217;s comment about iou.com being taken&#8230; a lot of the obvious domain names were taken, which in retrospect was a good thing because it forced us to pick what I think is a more fun name. (It&#8217;s also a nod to our favorite watering hole, the Stumbling Monk bar in the Capitol Hill area of Seattle).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
