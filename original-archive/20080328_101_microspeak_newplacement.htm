		<p>Markety? &nbsp;I don&#8217;t think so. &nbsp;Stupidy maybe. &nbsp;A markety word would at least sound catchy. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve got a novel idea, how about additions?</p>
<p>Some computers are replacements for existing computers and others are addtions to the existing computing base.</p>

		<p>No, no, this is all so obvious.</p>
<p>Replacing a computer is like getting divorced and remarried to a hot young secretary (male or female, whatever). In other words, a mid-life crisis.</p>
<p>New computers with no previous computers are virgin weddings (technical virgins).</p>
<p>New computers with previous computers are polygamy, or adding concubines to the harem.</p>
<p>Mail-order brides, meeting someone on Match.com, getting stuck with the dud, making babies&#8230; it all fits.</p>

		<p>This is garbage. &nbsp;You don&#8217;t go around telling people you got a &quot;new placement car&quot; when you trade in your old one for a new one. &nbsp;Likewise, you don&#8217;t say you got a &quot;replacement car&quot; when you don&#8217;t trade in your old one. &nbsp;It&#8217;s always a &quot;new car&quot;.</p>
<p>For some reason, it seems that logic and reason break down when computers / technology are involved. &nbsp;On the other hand, I&#8217;ve made the cardinal mistake of making a car analogy&#8230;</p>

		<p>John, isn&#8217;t your example backwards?</p>
<p>The group of people who are needs these terms aren&#8217;t the receiver of the new product, but the placer. &nbsp;Somebody like GM who cares about market growth does have a need to talk about how many of their cars are replacing old rundown cars v. how many are &quot;new placements&quot;.</p>

		<p>If it&#8217;s a replacement then it implies you&#8217;re doing the same thing with it, so unless it&#8217;s broken why replace?</p>
<p>Most people replace a PC to do new things, whether that be running Vista, Video Editing or just doing things more quickly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s called an upgrade. I can see myself replacing an old machine, upgrading, or buying an additional machine. No fancy terms needed :)</p>

		<p>In real estate, the term &#8216;first home buyer&#8217; is used to refer to someone who is purchasing a house for the first time.</p>
<p>So perhaps &#8216;First computer&#8217; could be used to mean &#8216;new computer that does not displace an old computer&#8217;.</p>

		<p>&#8230; and if that computer for the spouse was &#8216;a new computer that did not displace an old computer&#8217;, it would still be a &#8216;first computer&#8217;.</p>

<p>Not really. When it matters, context can tell you what I&#8217;m talking about. No reason to be absolutely precise &#8211; english isn&#8217;t really good at that, anyway.</p>

		<p>If I have a market strategy document, it will be intended for human readers: I will explicitly identify my campaign for new installs vs. upgrades. Newplacement is the sort of mangled english that inflate weak ideas, obscure pure reasoning, and inhibit clarity. With a little practice, writing can be an intimidating and impenetrable fog, to quote a certain 6 year old.</p>

<p>Okay, point taken. I still refuse to invent jargon or use existing jargon (if I can help it) except when talking to the primary users of that jargon &#8211; newplacement is fine among MS geeks, but not outside (in the &#8216;real world&#8217; :))</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
