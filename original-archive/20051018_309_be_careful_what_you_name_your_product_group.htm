<p>They thought they were so clever when they named the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1996/Oct96/re-org.asp"> Desktop Applications Division</a>. "And the abbreviation is 'DAD', isn't that cute? Complements the Microsoft Office Manager toolbar (MOM)."</p>
<p> And then the troubles started. </p>
<p> Shortly after the new product group was formed, everybody in the product group started getting email talking about strange non-business things. How's the garden doing? Did you get my letter? When will the twins be coming home from college? </p>
<p> The reason is that the email address for sending mail to the entire division was&mdash;naturally&mdash;"DAD". But it so happens that many people have a nickname for their father in their address book, named&mdash;of course&mdash;"dad". People thought they were sending email to their dad, when in fact it was going to DAD. </p>
<p> The email address for sending mail to the entire division was quickly changed to something like "deskapps" or "dappdiv". </p>

		<p>I remember the first email to &quot;dad&quot;. It was actually extremely profane, and written by someone in the mailroom who had apparently typed &quot;mom and dad&quot; in the &quot;TO:&quot; box as a joke. As this was back in the days before spam, people were not used to getting email that wasn&#8217;t intended for them, so it was a lot more shocking than the average vulgar, misdirected email is today!</p>
<p>Nobody stopped talking about that one until Mike Maples announced the Shit It Awards in company-wide email.</p>

		<p>I once worked on a product with the acronym &quot;SAG&quot;. That sounds innocuous enough until you realize that to many people, this sounds just like &quot;SHE&quot;. Oh, sure, you can make them sound different if you try, but most people speak quickly enough that it can be confusing.</p>

		<p>&#8230; the application MAY NOT change it behavior without the user&#8217;s permission.</p>
<p>How&#8217;d you think, would users remember what DAD stands for if they manually and personally added it to the addressbooks? Hell yeah.</p>
<p>But they did not. It was added automatically at the centralized location. Havoc ensues.</p>

		<p>For about three weeks I had a DL in the company called &#8216;alias.&#8217; Now, the &#8216;alias&#8217; alias started getting a lot of spam, and so I promptly blocked any external emails to it. Didn&#8217;t matter. Everyone on it (seven of us) were getting tons of mail from PSS, MS IT, and so forth. We finally killed the alias and started a new one with a slightly more unpredictable name.</p>

		<p>I think the bigger issue is email clients that treat expansions of what you actually typed as being more important than the nicknames you added to your address book (that directly match what you typed).  Presumably you added the nickname to your list so that you could, you know, just type the nickname, and the email would go to that person?</p>
<p>Most email clients I&#8217;ve used mess this up, and it&#8217;s maddening.</p>

<p>I believe you can change the order of expansion in Outlook so that your local address book is search before the global one.  But I guess most people don&#8217;t bother since there isn&#8217;t usually going to be any collisions.

<p>Oh come on. By that logic, a system administrator shouldn&#8217;t be able to add new email addresses to the central list when anyone joins the company without getting everyone&#8217;s permission, which is ridiculous. (Even if there&#8217;s no conflict, it would now match a name that would previously have been rejected, which is a change in behaviour.)</p>
<p>And&#8230;</p>
<p>&lt;i&gt;I believe you can change the order of expansion in Outlook so that your local address book is search before the global one.&lt;/i&gt;</p>
<p>Yes, that&#8217;s exactly right. If you&#8217;re using Outlook 2003, then go to the Address Book, then click &quot;Tools | Options&#8230;&quot; The list at the bottom says &quot;When sending mail, check names using these address lists in the following order:&quot;, and on my machine it has &quot;Contacts&quot; then &quot;Global Address List&quot;. There&#8217;s similar functionality in older versions, although you get to it a different way (e.g. &quot;Tools | Services&quot; in the main screen).</p>
<p>So, I think that in this situation it made sense for that group of people (who happened to work for Microsoft) to choose a different address, but I really don&#8217;t think you can hold it up as an example of the Evil Empire at work. Sheesh.</p>

<p>No. Don&#8217;t skew the logic. A system administrator should be able to do that. But the user should specificly express interest in having his addresses autocompleted from central list.

		<p>Way back a few years we had a list of error messages for error codes (as you do) but one of the codes was for internal use only as a flag. Since there was no way for that code to ever generate an error message I changed it to an obscure phrase from the Terry Pratchett novel &#8216;Eric&#8217;. The error message for code 6 became &quot;Mr. Beekle is a Poo&quot;.</p>
<p>One day we got a puzzled support call from a client..</p>
<p>Such is life :)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
