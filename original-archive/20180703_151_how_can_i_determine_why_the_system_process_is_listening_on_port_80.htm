<p>
A customer observed that the System process was listening
on port 80 and couldn't figure out why.
</p>
<p>
The
<code>netsh http show urlacl</code>
command will show which URLs have been reserved,
as well as the access control lists (ACLs) associated with them.
</p>
<pre>
Reserved URL : http://+:80/Temporary_Listen_Addresses/
  User: \Everyone
    Listen: Yes
    Delegate: No
    SDDL: D:(A;;GX;;;WD)

Reserved URL : http://+:80/0131501b-d67f-491b-9a40-c4bf27bcb4d4/
  User: NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE
    Listen: Yes
    Delegate: No
    SDDL: D:(A;;GX;;;NS)

Reserved URL : http://+:80/116B50EB-ECE2-41ac-8429-9F9E963361B7/
  User: NT AUTHORITY\NETWORK SERVICE
    Listen: Yes
    Delegate: No
    SDDL: D:(A;;GX;;;NS)
</pre>
<p>
At this point, you have information you can enter into a search
engine to see what they're about.
</p>
<p>
The first URL is used by the Windows Communication Framework;
<a HREF="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/wcf/feature-details/how-to-replace-the-wcf-url-reservation-with-a-restricted-reservation">
this web page tells you how to modify or delete it</a>.
</p>
<p>
The second one is assigned to
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd359780.aspx">
[MS-PCHC]: Peer Content Caching and Retrieval: Hosted Cache Protocol</a>,
which appears to be used for
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa964314(v=vs.85).aspx">
subnet-level peer caching as part of Windows BranchCache</a>.
</p>
<p>
The third one is assigned to
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd303297.aspx">
[MS-PCCRR]: Peer Content Caching and Retrieval: Retrieval Protocol</a>,
which also part of Windows BranchCache.
</p>
<p>
The customer confirmed that disabling BranchCache caused Windows to
stop listening on the second and third URLs.</p>

		<p>When running the command on a non-English system (German in my case; tested and reproduced on Windows 7 and Server 2016), I noticed that while the output is localized (i.e. &#8220;Benutzer&#8221; instead of &#8220;User&#8221;), the &#8220;Yes&#8221;/&#8221;No&#8221; for the listen and delegate properties are not.<br />
Were these two values missed when translating or has some important-enough application tried to parse the output and relied on it being English?</p>

		<p>Team responded that this is unfortunate, but <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/networking/technologies/netsh/netsh" rel="nofollow">netsh is deprecated in favor of PowerShell</a>, so there no real benefit to improving a deprecated technology.</p>

		<p>Cool. Except that there is no first party PowerShell equivalent to netsh http.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately netsh is so much better documented.</p>

		<p>I guess it&#8217;s some kind of a Murphy&#8217;s law, that the current things are always underdocumented, so if there is a thing that is properly documented, it must be deprecated.</p>

		<p>So what is the comparable PowerShell command to the given netsh ones? If we&#8217;re at it the one for sslcert would be useful too.</p>
<p>It certainly looks like they deprecated a tool without having replacements for most of its functionality.</p>

		<p>Maybe the word deprecated is an unfortunate choice?</p>
<p>Could we consider netsh to be &#8220;done&#8221; instead? No further changes short of fixing critical bugs. That is, all issues start with -1000 points instead of the usual -100.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
