<p>By default, users can debug only processes that they own. In order to debug processes owned by other users, you have to possess the SeDebugPrivilege privilege. But don't grant this privilege casually, because once you do, you gave away the farm.</p>
<p> If you let users debug processes owned by other users, then they can debug processes owned by System, at which point they can inject code into the process and perform the logical equivalent of <code>net localgroup administrators anybody /add</code>, thereby elevating themselves (or anybody else) to administrator. </p>
<p> If SeDebugPrivilege is equivalent to granting administrator privileges, why does it exist at all? It's not so much to protect the system as it is to protect the user. It's like the safety cover over the emergency power-off button. The purpose is merely to prevent you from pushing the button by mistake. If you're a developer debugging a service, you can turn on SeDebugPrivilege so you can debug the service, without turning on all the other administrative privileges. That way, you can't accidentally delete a critical file, for example. </p>
<p> The security investigations team have to deal with people who fail to understand that SeDebugPrivilege is (from a security perspective) equivalent to administrator. In one case, the finder contacted not the <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/msrc/"> Microsoft Security Response Center</a> but rather sent their "exploit" to high-level executives, who then had to transfer the issue to MSRC. And when informed of the misunderstanding, the finder just responded with a one-page rambling manifesto. As much as you are tempted to "just ignore the crazy guy", every reported security vulnerability must still be taken seriously. There might be something in there buried inside all the craziness. After all, they said Galileo was crazy. </p>

		<p>I was going to argue that code injection would be impossible if you strip the debug privilege off the process in this article:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/02/03/524071.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/02/03/524071.aspx</a></p>
<p>Except that don&#8217;t prevent hooks from doing hook injection, which don&#8217;t require debug privilege.</p>

		<p>And MSVisual Studio 2003 requires the Debugprivilege to just debug your own app. We cannot use the installed compiler on our uni computers because they are restricted &#8211; of course. And the admins are to lazy to install the new version. BAH!</p>

<p>Yes, and no number of qualifications, witnesses and evidence can ever tip the balance in such cases, as once someone is labelled as &quot;crazy&quot;, they are never allowed to present a case.</p>
<p>It is amazing how many &quot;normal&quot; people perpetuate this denial of reality out of some perverted sense of &quot;loyalty&quot; to their employers.</p>
<p>I wish I could say this was uncommon, but I have witnessed it first hand so many times I suspect that it is more often the first recourse for any complaint of real significance than any legitimate process of investigation.</p>

<p>No it doesn&#8217;t. &nbsp;It requires that the users be added to the &quot;Debugger Users&quot; group (or something like that). &nbsp;This is a group made up by Visual Studio, and has no purpose other than allowing connection to the Machine Debug Manager.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nigelwa/archive/2005/07/29/445155.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/nigelwa/archive/2005/07/29/445155.aspx</a></p>
<p>&quot;So if you’re just hitting F5 in Visual Studio there shouldn’t be a problem. You will need to be in the “Debugger users” group for Visual Studio 2003 but this is a VS03 thing not a Windows thing. This group is created when VS is installed and allows access to the Visual Studio Machine Debug Manager component.</p>
<p>Note things are a bit different in Visual Studio 2005 – there is no Debugger users group (nor the VS Developers group for creating web sites) and the whole LUA experience is much, much better.&quot;</p>

		<p>Raymond, I&#8217;m so glad that you wrote this. &nbsp;It&#8217;s sad how often things like this are misunderstood.</p>
<p>Privileges like this are root-complete: if you have any root-complete privilege, you can acquire them all. &nbsp;Granting only one or a few root-complete privileges can only be considered a safety feature, not a security feature. &nbsp;Please consider them as such in your code. &nbsp;The real security is to protect against these privileges being acquired maliciously, and not granting them when unnecessary.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not just SeDebugPrivilege, either. &nbsp;Here are some other ones that are root-complete, but is probably not all of them:</p>
<p>SeCreateTokenPrivilege &#8211; create LocalSystem token out of thin air then impersonate it</p>
<p>SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege &#8211; overwrite any of a number of critical registry keys or system files</p>
<p>SeLoadDriverPrivilege &#8211; load kernel driver</p>
<p>SeRestorePrivilege &#8211; same idea as SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege</p>
<p>Linux&#8217;s &quot;capabilities&quot; are essentially the same idea, and the same caveats apply.</p>

<p>Thanks, for your information. I was told that it needs Debugprivilege. However I did not challenge the statement. Today I tested it again, and now I am cured :)</p>
<p>But I am a little bit curious about the description of the debugger group. Why does it say, that it only should be added to trusted users?? Is it safe to add the group to users in an university?</p>

		<p>&gt;That is paranoid mindset. &quot;If you let </p>
<p>&gt;users debug processes owned by other users&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>&#8230; then you might as well not have bothered implementing a security system in the first place.</p>
<p>Note that, on *your* Windows system, you&#8217;re perfectly free to give SeDebugPrivilege to all users, if you believe this is a pointless restriction.</p>
<p>&gt;Restrict, restrict, restrict&#8230; With every </p>
<p>&gt;new Windows release, more restrictions, </p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure this is no new restriction; it&#8217;s been that way since the first release of Windows NT, as far as I recall.</p>
<p>Of course there was no such restriction in DOS-based Windows, since it had no security system to start with.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
