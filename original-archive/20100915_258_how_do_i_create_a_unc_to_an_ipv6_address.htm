<p>Windows UNC notation permits you to use a raw IPv4 address in dotted notation as a server name: For example, <code> net view \\127.0.0.1</code> will show you the shared resources on the computer whose IP address is 127.0.0.1. But what about IPv6 addresses? IPv6 notation contains colons, which tend to mess up file name parsing since a colon is not a valid character in a path component.</p>
<p> Enter the <code>ipv6-literal.net</code> domain. </p>
<p> Take your IPv6 address, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa385353.aspx"> replace the colons with dashes, replace percent signs with the letter "s", and append <code>.ipv6-literal.net</code></a>. This magic host resolves back to the original IPv6 address, but it avoids characters which give parsers the heebie-jeebies. </p>
<p> Note that this magic host is resolved internally by Windows and never hits the network. It's sort of a magic escape sequence. </p>

		<p>Does this magic resolving of ipv6-literal.net extends to everything or just the networking filesystem? I don&#39;t know any literal ipv6 address to test it. (And in fact i&#39;m pretty sure my current external connection doesn&#39;t support ipv6.)</p>
<p>Since the documentation you mentioned is specifically about network resources, I doubt it, but maybe the documentation is only relaying a feature of the address resolving sub-system.</p>

		<p>Interesting, doing a DNS lookup on IPV6-literal.net for A records (an IPv4 address) takes you to bing, with &quot;your-subdomain ipv6-literal&quot; as the search string. Doing an AAAA (IPv6 address) lookup returns no records, somewhat ironically.</p>

		<p>Soundman32, I assume that it or something like it will work, but colons in pathnames make a lot of software sit in a corner and cry. (Remember that colons are only supposed to signify the volume, and recently the protocol for the web which just happened to be mostly compatible. So much software assumes there can only be one colon and that everything in front of it is the volume or web protocol.)</p>

		<p>asf: the important thing to remember is that in your example, the colon is a separator, and not part of any actual filename.</p>

		<p>@asf, quit being pedantic. Of course saying &quot;colons are not valid in path components&quot; is *technically* incorrect, just because &quot;c:foo.txt&quot; is a valid path. They should also be allowed from within the POSIX subsystem.</p>
<p>You know what Raymond means; don&#39;t make him bring back the nitpicker&#39;s corner.</p>

		<p>@Soundman32:</p>
<p>The issue with the RFC2732 format is that it breaks a huge number of existing RFC&#39;s. &nbsp;This sort of an approach is what IP v6 should have used in the first place, and let me explain why in detail.</p>
<p>Adding the bracket syntax breaks every existing URL parser, as of when the RFC was submitted. &nbsp;Any software that performs user-interface level validation of inputs (i.e. most software) or configuration file level validation of inputs isn&#39;t going to work correctly with RFC2732. &nbsp;The argument there, from the RFC&#39;s point of view, is who cares because the app doesn&#39;t support IP v6 in the first place.</p>
<p>But pretend that you are using APR or WinINet for a minute. &nbsp;When the shared library/DLL gets updated to support IP v6, your application gets the upgrade, too. &nbsp;Except, since you&#39;re doing validation of the user&#39;s data entry, the user cannot actually enter literals. &nbsp;Anything using a domain name works, on existing programs, without changes (provided they&#39;re going through one of these library stacks), but you can&#39;t do anything involving a literal &#8212; and you can&#39;t do it simply because of your own UI validation.</p>
<p>Now &#8212; lets say that you convert an IP v6 address to numbers, letters and dashes &#8212; as the Microsoft domain is doing. &nbsp;Then you register a valid domain name on the Internet, and you implement a rule in your resolver that parses it. &nbsp;Instantly, you have the ability to connect to any IP v6 host, by address, without breaking any existing RFC &#8212; the names are fully compliant with the DNS spec.</p>
<p>But the advantage doesn&#39;t end there &#8212; the resolver can actually cover for IP v4 applications that are not IP v6 aware. &nbsp;Whether Microsoft&#39;s resolver actually does it or not is another story, but when a process requests one of these addresses, the resolver can instantly parse it and return an AAAA record, obviously. &nbsp;However, the resolver could also set up an IP v4 port on a private-use subnet, and could return that as an A record. &nbsp;If the OS later sees an attempt to connect to the private use address, it could transparently forward the port.</p>
<p>And that can be done on up at the switch level, at a firewall level, at a proxy level, etc. &nbsp;You can transparently proxy outbound IP v4 applications, so that they can connect to IP v6.</p>
<p>So far as the RFC being around since 1999, if you check out Wikipedia, you&#39;ll see there was no production IP v6 support on any operating system until 2004, and the RFC became a STD much later than 1999. &nbsp;Since IP v6 is still not widely deployed at an ISP level, and since many mobile systems cannot get IP v6 even with the current transition technologies, it isn&#39;t a priority for application authors to support it, and so support is very spotty at best still &#8212; especially in consumer entertainment applications such as videogames. &nbsp;Even if you want to say that since Windows Vista/7 tries to enable IP v6 on every computer, and since the FCC is mandating it, that IP v6 is going to be widely supported in the near future.</p>
<p>So far as does Windows support the [] syntax:</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
