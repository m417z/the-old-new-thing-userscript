		<p>He&#8217;d already called PostQuitMessage, so the modal message loop set up by MessageBox just quit out straight away (and presumably reposted the quit flag to the message queue). MessageBox has to return something, so it returns IDABORT. (Returning 0, IDOK, would be bad.)</p>

		<p>ASSERT is not particularly well designed. It should run its message box in a separate thread instead, otherwise any WM_TIMER messages (and other posted messages, too) will get handled and might then cause unexpected recursion. And G-d forbid you ever get ASSERT in WM_PAINT handler context&#8230;</p>

		<p>Alexandre,</p>
<p>If your program is asserting, surely the battle is lost at that point, so does it really matter?</p>

		<p>Joe Butler,</p>
<p>How do you debug a program that recursively spews ASSERT dialogs, without waiting for you to click on them? Showing a modal dialog box also changes the main window state, which you may not be able to handle. If the dialog were created in a separate thread, while keeping the offending thread blocked, it would be better, as the offending code state would be preserved.</p>

		<p>Alexandre Grigoriev,</p>
<p>The way I do it is to set breakpoints to home into the general area of such a recursive or itterative assert. &nbsp;Then it&#8217;s normally obvious what&#8217;s going on and it can be fixed. &nbsp;If you want a debugging message like you describe, it&#8217;s not that difficult to knock one up &#8211; I have a logger that runs a gui in a separate thread that I&#8217;ve found quite useful, and also a large &#8216;tooltip&#8217; window that i can write status info into that gets updated on a separate thread. &nbsp;But regardless, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s fair to say that the assert box is &#8216;badly designed&#8217;. &nbsp;It does what it does and it does it the way it does it.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
