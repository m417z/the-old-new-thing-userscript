		<p>There is actually a parody song of &quot;Start Me Up&quot; by Wierd Al Yankovic called &quot;Windows 95 Sucks&quot; making fun of how windows 95 was expensive and how it required a lot of people to buy new hardware and stuff.</p>
<p>Having come through from Windows 3.x up through Windows 95, a lot of what the parody song says is actually true (the whole &quot;need a bunch of new hardware&quot; thing for one)<br /></p>

		<p>Just a note&#8230; Weird Al didn&#8217;t write the Windows 95 song. &nbsp;Just because someone labels a song that way on a file sharing network doesn&#8217;t make it true!</p>

		<p>Jonathan,</p>
<p>Despite the hardward upgrades required, surely you&#8217;re glad the general public isn&#8217;t still running Win 3.x, eh? :)</p>

<br />You make a grown man cry!&quot; :) &quot;</p>
<p>Yep &#8211; it came to mind every time the ad played for me, and I expect everyone else who knew the lyrics. &nbsp;Especially as the ad left the song hanging with that as the very next line.</p>
<p>This illustrates the dangers of using a song on the basis of one line taken out of context being superficially similar to what you want to say.</p>
<p>I wonder if the ad campaign planners realised this would happen?</p>

		<p>I feel quite nostalgic now &#8211; I remember being really excited about the &#8216;new Windows&#8217; and how cool it looked.<br />
<br />Funny really, given that now I&#8217;d rather use Windows 95 over having red-hot needles run into my eyes, but it&#8217;d be a close run thing :-)</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t want to bet on Vista having any ads even 1/10 as cool as those ones.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
