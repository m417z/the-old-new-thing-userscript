<p> A friend of mine happened to have a chat with a fire fighter who used to be assigned to the fire station nearest to Microsoft main campus. According to him, the top three reasons for being called to a Microsoft building are (in no particular order) </p>
<ul>
<li>Burnt popcorn. </li>
<li>Somebody has a panic attack and mistakes it for a heart attack. </li>
<li>Somebody pulls the fire alarm     because they are under a lot of stress because they missed a deadline,     and they think pulling the fire alarm will buy them some time.     (Where do they think they are, college?) </li>
</ul>

<p>Interesting use of stylesheets to use either the Webdings font with the private use code point U+F066 or the real Unicode character to maximize accessibility, though I&#39;m not convinced it wouldn&#39;t be better to just use an image here. &nbsp;The usual arguments (search engines &amp; text-to-speech) don&#39;t seem to apply here.</p>

		<p>We had a similar incident here, but it wasn&#39;t popcorn, it was a burnt poptart. There was a freak out while we tried to find the source of the &#39;burning smell&#39; and the building was evacuated. Needless to say that was the last time that particular person left their poptart unattended.</p>

		<p>@Joe, there are not many things that smell worse than burnt popcorn. &nbsp;I don&#39;t mind the smell of popcorn in a movie theater, but whenever anyone makes microwave or stove-top popcorn at home, even when it&#39;s not burned, the smell seems kind of unpleasant to me.</p>

		<p>We get free popcorn at our office, from a fair-style machine (none of this microwave popcorn nonsense). One of the many little perks (indicative of how employees are treated) that makes me love working here.</p>
<p>I&#39;m glad no one here is bothered by the smell :)</p>

		<p>I think it&#39;s important to highlight the fact that the enumerated top reasons were in no particular order, which means that the 3rd bullet may in fact be the most frequent cause. Since there is also no information on the frequency of the occurrences, it may also be the most frequent cause by a very large margin. I now think of life on the Microsoft campus differently than I did before this post.</p>

		<p>@Lockwood, are you a UK person by any chance?</p>
<p>Lots of countries have combined paramedic/firefighter services. This makes sense as they are often called out to the same incidents. Fires often (usually?) require paramedics in attendance, and RTAs often require firefighters to help extract patients.</p>
<p>TRWTF is not combining them.</p>

		<p>@Ben Combining them makes no sense; the London Ambulance Service back in 1990 dealt with more calls on a Saturday than the London Fire Brigade dealt with in a month, and I doubt the ratio of calls has changed much since then. By separating them, you can have the fire service use big heavy vehicles equipped with heavy kit, and firefighters trained in their specialities all brought along to any incident. The ambulance service needs to be more agile &#8211; it attends many more calls, for a wider variety of problems.</p>

		<p>A few years back I worked in the basement of one of my company&#39;s buildings (they prefer to call it the &quot;Lower Level&quot;). Our security department was also located in the basement. At the elevators&#39; call button there was a placard that said &quot;In case of fire, use stairs&quot;, complete with a graphic of a person walking down the stairs.</p>
<p>The head of the security department didn&#39;t appreciate when, while both waiting for the elevator, I pointed to it and declared &quot;You know, if there&#39;s ever a fire, I think I&#39;m going to go UP the stairs, not down.&quot;</p>

		<p>@Joe: One place I worked used extremely small cameras, think pin-hole with wide-angle lense, in the normal course of their business. Some people apparently had a bad habit of setting the time too long on microwave popcorn and walking away, intending to return to get their popped popcorn after they visited the bathroom, etc. When the bag in the microwave caught on fire, triggering the fire alarm, the people would of course not own up to what they had done.</p>
<p>So, the logical thing to do would be to install one of the extremely small cameras to monitor each microwave oven and identify the people incapable of properly operating microwave ovens. Instead, the company removed all the microwave ovens from the campus. And the company wondered why people felt like they were being treated as small children instead of adults.</p>

		<p>At my old company there was a guy who traveled to work in heavy rain and was uncomfortable in his soaked socks, so he decided to put them in the microwave to dry them. I told him it was a bad idea before he did it, but he went away and did it anyway. Needless to say the kitchen smelled of burning and feet for several days afterwards.</p>
<p>When things like this happen I&#39;m not surprised that companies treat employees as children rather than adults.</p>

<p>Whatever happened to handling the problem individuals instead of punishing everyone? There were over 3,000 employees on the campus where I worked. Is it proper to punish 3K people who did nothing wrong rather than the few that did?</p>

		<p>@simon, that may (possibly) make sense in London where the density of incidents of both types is high. In Yorkshire it makes no sense at all.</p>
<p>Actually I doubt it makes sense at all anywhere. In London the fire service is horrendously overmanned, and by sharing space with the ambos could probably be cut to a fifth of its current size with no detriment to service. But of course it is all about dinners at the Cinnamon Club for fire brigade union chiefs and nothing to do with helping people.</p>
<p>Dangerous Jobs: Fire service distantly trails lumberjack, deep sea fisherman, soldier, travelling salesman, and policeman. It&#39;s barely more risky than the average deskbound commuter&#39;s drive to work &#8211; but bu heck, the ladies love &#39;em!</p>

		<p>In Germany, you call 112 for both (see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/112_%28emergency_telephone_number%29" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/112_%28emergency_telephone_number%29</a>).</p>
<p>The statement &quot;Lots of countries have combined paramedic/firefighter services&quot; just mean that there is only one telephone number for both types. They do not use a big fire truck to rescue someone with a heart attack, and they do not send ambulance cars to deal with a burning recycle bin.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>In the United States, fire stations vastly outnumber hospitals. (For example, when my friend <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/06/19/636824.aspx" rel="nofollow">took a nasty spill off his bicycle</a>, there was a fire station less than a mile away, but the nearest hospital was 26 miles away.) Therefore, if you want to have quick response from &quot;people with medical training driving a vehicle capable of transporting a person to a hospital&quot;, you can do that by placing ambulances at each fire station and training two fire fighters as paramedics. -Raymond</i>]</div>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
