<p>
Crack open open the champagne:
Batch File Week is finally over!
</p>
<p>
Variations on the
<code>for /f %%i in ('dir /b ...')</code>
will let you repeat an operation on the contents of a directory,
possibly even recursively if you add the <code>/s</code> option,
with some basic attribute-level filtering if you add the
<code>/a</code> or </code>/a-</code> flags.
</p>
<p>
For your fancy recursive file operations,
there's a tool called
<code>FORFILES</code> which iterates through the contents of a
directory (recursively if requested),
executing a command on each item it finds.
It also has additional filtering capability,
like selecting files based on their last-modified time.
For example,
you could copy all files in the current directory which were
modified today:
</p>
<pre>
forfiles /D +0 /c "cmd /c copy @file \\server\today"
</pre>
<p>
Unfortuantely, the <code>/D</code> option is not as flexible
as one might like.
For example, while it can pick files modified today,
it can't pick files modified in the last week,
because the relative-date-picker knows only how to pick
<i>files modified on or before a date in the past</i>
or
<i>files modified on or after a date in the future</i>.
(Who the heck wants to operate on files modified in the future?
Except perhaps the Microsoft Research folks who are working
on that time machine.)
</p>
<p>
You can type <code>FORFILES /?</code> for more information on what
you can do (and by seeing what's omitted, what you can't do).
</p>
<p>
If the command you want to execute is rather long,
you can offload it back into the batch file being executed:
</p>
<pre>
@echo off
if "%1"=="/callback" goto callback
forfiles /D +0 /c "cmd /c call "%~f0" /callback @isdir @file @fsize"
goto :eof
:callback
rem %2 = @isdir
rem %3 = @file
rem %4 = @fsize
if %2==TRUE echo Skipping directory %3.&goto :eof
echo Copying file %3 to \\server\today (%4 bytes)
</pre>
<p>
One gotcha here is that since each command runs in a sub-shell,
it can read environment variables, but any modifications it makes
to environment variables will be lost since the command is modifying
only its local environment variables.
A workaround for this is to use <code>FORFILES</code> to select
the data to operate on,
but use <code>FOR</code> to actually perform the operation.
Since <code>FOR</code> runs inside the main command interpreter,
it can modify environment variables.
</p>
<pre>
set TOTALSIZE=0
for /f %%i in ('forfiles /d +0 /c "cmd /c if @isdir==FALSE echo @fsize"') <a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/06/8835317.aspx">^</a>
do set /a TOTALSIZE=TOTALSIZE + %%i
</pre>
<p>
Here, we use <code>FORFILES</code> to enumerate all the files
(not directories)
modified today
and print their sizes.
We wrap this inside a <code>FOR</code> which reads the sizes
and adds them up.
</p>
<p>
If the operation you want to perform on each file is complex,
you can of course offload it into a
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/08/02/10334559.aspx">
subroutine call</a>.
</p>
<pre>
for /f %%i ^
in ('forfiles /d +0 /c "cmd /c if @isdir==FALSE echo @fsize"') ^
do call :subroutine %%i
</pre>
<p>
I'm cheating here because I know that <code>@fsize</code> doesn't
contain spaces.
If you are processing file names, then you need to be more careful.
</p>
<pre>
for /f "tokens=*" %%i ^
in ('forfiles /d +0 /c "cmd /c if @isdir==FALSE echo @fname"') ^
do call :subroutine %%i
</pre>

<p>Nooooooooo!!!! At least, it&#39;s only 51 weeks for next years Batch File Week.</p>
<p>I actually enjoyed it: I learned a few tricks that may make my life easier. I wish it had been more variated, instead on focusing so much in fors. But, hey, it&#39;s Raymond&#39;s blog, and Raymond writes what he wants to.</p>

		<p>Unix equivalent: find(1). &nbsp;For example, to copy all files in the current directory to /server/today which were modified today:</p>
<p>find . -maxdepth 1 -type f -daystart -mtime 0 -exec cp -t /server/today &#39;{}&#39; +</p>
<p>Remove -maxdepth 1 to recurse into subdirectories. &nbsp;The variety of file time tests, along with the -a (AND), -o (OR) and ! (NOT) operators, allow for pretty much any time you can imagine, including finding files modified after a date in the future.</p>
<p>Like any Unix process, find can&#39;t modify environment variables in its parent shell. &nbsp;If you really wanted to do that (which by its very nature is not idiomatic), you could produce as output a set of NAME=VALUE mappings and pipe that into the &#39;source&#39; shell builtin, e.g.:</p>
<p>source &lt;(command which produces a set of NAME=VALUE mappings)</p>

		<p>A neat trick for a common case: &quot;for %i in ([file pattern]) do [command]&quot;, and &quot;for /d %i in ([dir pattern]) do [command]&quot;, useful to do things like &quot;for %i in (*.flac) do @ffmpeg -i %i %~ni.mp3&quot;</p>
<p>I too think Batch File Week was fun: the only problem with it is that I needed to know some of this a couple of weeks ago :)</p>

		<p>How come I&#39;ve never heard of FORFILES before? I actually had to try it out myself because I couldn&#39;t believe this comes preinstalled with Windows. Always used PowerShell or a short C# snippet because I find it hard to remember the verbose FOR syntax.</p>

		<p>This is a great series Raymond, I hope you see fit to continue it! I&#39;m a Windows batch file veteran and I still learned a thing or two.</p>
<p>By the way, the forfiles.exe is included in Vista/7/2K8 but for W2K3 and earlier it was in the Resource Kit. The W2K3 version runs fine on WXP. But you need the W2K version on W2K.</p>

		<p>It does not show up in the list of commands whey you type &quot;HELP&quot;. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In MSDN it is documented as Applies To: Windows Server 2003, Windows Server 2003 R2, Windows Server 2003 with SP1, Windows Server 2003 with SP2</p>
<p>so probably won&#39;t work for @xpclient</p>

		<p>Does anyone know how old &quot;forfiles&quot; is? On the MSDN pages I can&#39;t find any mention of the earliest verison of Windows (or DOS?) that it was shipped with. It says &quot;Applies To: Windows Server 2008, Windows Vista&quot;, but it says the same thing about &quot;cd&quot;, which definitely shipped with earlier versions than that! :-)</p>

<p>For completeness, as someone pointed out in a previous post&#39;s comment, tokens=* doesn&#39;t work, you need to use delims= to properly handle file names including spaces.</p>

		<p>Thanks for this series! I only read the last one and I learned something already. It&#39;s a real pity this command isn&#39;t more obviously available. Any idea where I could&#39;ve learned about it without knowing it exists? I&#39;ve looked at the output of &#39;help&#39; in the command line, but it isn&#39;t there.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
