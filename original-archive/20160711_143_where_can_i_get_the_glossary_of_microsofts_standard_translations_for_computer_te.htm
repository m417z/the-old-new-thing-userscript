A customer wanted to know
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd374098(v=vs.85).aspx">
where to get a glossary of Microsoft's standard translations
of computer terms</a>.
</p>
<p>
The
<a HREF="https://www.microsoft.com/Language/">
Microsoft Language Portal</a>
has a bunch of localization resources, including
</p>
<ul>
<li>
    <a HREF="https://www.microsoft.com/Language/en-US/Search.aspx">
    Interactive search</a></p>
<li>
    <a HREF="https://www.microsoft.com/Language/en-US/Terminology.aspx">
    Terminology collection</a></p>
<li>
    <a HREF="https://www.microsoft.com/Language/en-US/StyleGuides.aspx">
    Style guides</a>
</ul>
<p>
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110706-01/?p=10233">
I mentioned the style guide before</a>,
but I never linked to the other resources available on the Language Portal.
</p>
<p>
So there you go.
In case you ever wanted to know Microsoft's standard translation
of
<i>planned intercompany demand</i>
into Swedish,
or whether
the Microsoft style for Swedish prefers
<i>n&aring;n</i> or <i>n&aring;got</i>, or
<i>bli</i> or <i>bliva</i>.
</p>
<p>
(By the way, the answers are
<i>planerad koncernintern efterfr&aring;gan</i>,
<i>n&aring;got</i>, and <i>bli</i>.)</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s good, because &#8220;nån&#8221; is very informal and &#8220;bliva&#8221; is very dated.</p>
<p>Anyhow: thanks!!</p>
<p>Being bilingual (English and Swedish), I have had many questions about Microsoft terms in English/Swedish the last twenty years, but I never knew this resource existed!</p>

		<p>I remember how in Russian Windows, in MIDI documentation, &#8220;notes&#8221; (as music notes) were translated as &#8220;заметки&#8221;, which means text notes. I could not get what that means.</p>

		<p>Yeah, sadly some recent software has had quite a few bad translations of this kind, like <a href="http://specials.rejbrand.se/msfeedback/heltal.png" rel="nofollow">http://specials.rejbrand.se/msfeedback/heltal.png</a> (integral: integral, not heltal (integer)) and <a href="http://specials.rejbrand.se/msfeedback/vidarebefordra.png" rel="nofollow">http://specials.rejbrand.se/msfeedback/vidarebefordra.png</a> (forward: framåt/nästa [månad], not vidarebefordra (forward an e-mail)). And Windows Media Center used to confuse [star] rating (betyg) by [parental] rating (föräldraklassificering).</p>

		<p>Nån is a shorter version of någon, it&#8217;s not &#8220;proper&#8221; but used in informal writing and talking. I guess the short version of något would be nåt but it&#8217;s not used as often in writing, quite frequently when talking.</p>

		<p>We have an *old* copy of the Microsoft Style Guide &#8211; an actual book. From that book i&#8217;ll always remember that e-mail has a hyphen in it.</p>

		<p>And not only Swedish. Windows 10 in German on my phone has some strange translations as well.</p>

		<p>Yes. Mine. They were very grateful.</p>
<p>Also Raymond has so far accepted and implemented five of my feedbacks.</p>
<p>So, the only one who has problem with me, is you. I don&#8217;t know why. And I don&#8217;t care. Nasty comments like this are as close as you can get to me.</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t really speak for other people but his problem might be that you have the tact of a bulldozer. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen a lot of your comments and there&#8217;s nothing really wrong with the things you say but you say them in a very antagonistic way.</p>
<p>For example, &#8220;looks like Microsoft badly needs some feedback there.&#8221;. That statement is very negative. It gives the impression that you think the current state is absolutely terrible which belittles the work of everyone that has ever worked on the site.. Some people might call that an &#8220;Arrogant&#8221; attitude which other people may find insulting.  </p>
<p>You could have said &#8220;I see some ways this can be improved&#8221;. It gives a more positive impression. Like you think the current state is okay but could be better. You want to build on top of what&#8217;s currently there rather than tearing it all down.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my perspective at least.</p>

		<p>Thanks. I appreciate your comment.</p>
<p>But there is something else too: This place has a significantly higher tact requirement that say, Wikipedia. In Wikipedia, there is a common saying &#8220;There are no angry Mastodons&#8221; which discourages people from attaching non-existent negative connotation to someone&#8217;s comments. When I said &#8220;looks like Microsoft badly needs some feedback there&#8221; all I was doing was to encourage community feedback.</p>
<p>Now, the reader has two choices: The angry Mastodon response (fight) or assuming good faith and if time permits, giving feedback. With the former, you create yourself an enemy. With the latter, no enemies and maybe a friend. The point is: It is your fate, all in your hands. Choose friend!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
