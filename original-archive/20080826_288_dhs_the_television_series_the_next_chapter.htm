<p>Okay, so first there was the story about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/10/87248.aspx"> the planned DHS television series</a>. And then there was the follow-up reporting that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/29/475299.aspx"> the whole thing was an investment scam</a> and there was no such show after all. Following through on the story, it looks like the ringleader behind the scam has been <a href="http://www.tvsquad.com/2007/01/27/woman-sentenced-to-prison-over-reality-series-scam/"> sentenced to one year in prison</a> and an accomplice to five years probation and $250 a month in restitution. The TV Squad article says <i>retribution</i>, which would be strange if true. <a href="http://www.nypost.com/seven/01292007/tv/reality_tv_scam_ends_in_jail_time_tv_.htm"> But it's not</a>. (Read the announcements of the accomplice's <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/cac/pressroom/pr2006/023.html"> indictment</a> and <a href="http://losangeles.fbi.gov/dojpressrel/pressrel06/la041906usa.htm"> guilty plea</a>.) At $250 a month, it's going to take a long time to repay the court-ordered $3.4 million in restitution.</p>
<p> Two years later, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that the judge who imposed the one-year sentence for the ringleader <a href="http://cbs2.com/local/Joseph.Medawar.scheme.2.677842.html"> failed to follow sentencing guidelines</a> (which call for a minimum of 57 months), and ordered that he be sentenced again. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, the accomplice appears to have violated the terms of her probation, so she was <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/25/local/me-homeland25"> sentenced to ten days in jail</a>. </p>
<p> Who knows what'll happen next? This story may never reach its final chapter. </p>

		<p>Actually this kind of makes sense. &nbsp;DHS as a whole is a scam, so why would a TV show about DHS ending up being a scam surprise us?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
