<p> Every culture has its strange food that is used to scare away the foreigners. In Sweden, it's <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1469413"> surstr&ouml;mming</a>. (Surstr&ouml;mming is even classified as hazardous material <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4867024.stm"> by some airlines</a>.) And, you know, when you dig into your plate of surstr&ouml;mming, I bet the first thing that goes through your mind is, "Wow, this would go great with some ice cream." </p>
<p> Well, your wish has been answered. <a href="http://www.svd.se/dynamiskt/noje/did_14687560.asp" lang="sv"> Surstr&ouml;mmingsglassen &auml;r h&auml;r</a>. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>Surstr&ouml;mming ice cream is here</b> </p>
<p> (Caption: Ice cream with V&auml;sterbotten cheese, cloudberry, and flatbread.) </p>
<p> Let's see. A carton of Rocky Road, a little Cookie Dough, a Stracciatella, and... mmm... surstr&ouml;mming. No really, soon you will find it in the frozen food aisle. Surstr&ouml;mming ice cream, brought to you by cook Peter &Ouml;hmann, is intended as a dessert plate served with deep-fried V&auml;sterbotten cheese, deep-fried parsley, warm cloudberries, and a stick of flatbread. It is expected to be available for purchase starting in December 2007, according to the Surstr&ouml;mming Society's chairman Ruben Madsen. He believes that the ice cream can beat out fish preserves. "Ice cream has no aroma, just taste." </p>
</blockquote>
<p> But don't hold your breath; you won't be able to get it until December. On the other hand, given the strong aroma of surstr&ouml;mming, maybe you should hold your breath after all. </p>

		<p>Ikea sells a milder version of this and it doesn&#8217;t taste that bad. A glass of vodka before and after helps, but if you&#8217;re the type that think oysters are gross then there is no hope.</p>

		<p>Better still on Wikipedia &#8211; and this says it all, I think:</p>
<p>&quot;&#8230;several people have liked its taste on the first try [citation needed].&quot;</p>
<p>Good luck finding those people.</p>

		<p>Brrr, shudder. Here I was expecting some more Win32 spelunking och now I&#8217;m remembering (as a young boy) my father and grandfather opening the swollen cans and my only thought was: &quot;Get out of this apartment *now*&quot;.</p>
<p>I live in Stockholm and down here surstr&#246;mming is considered a bit exotic as human food goes. But it still has its own day in the Swedish calendar, look up August 16th this year and you&#8217;ll find it marked &quot;Surstr&#246;mmingspremi&#228;r&quot;. Something for you to translate, Raymond!</p>

		<p>According to Raymond&#8217;s opinion, every culture has its strange food that is used to scare away foreigners. He points out that in Sweden, it&#8217;s surstr&#246;mming, where in Malaysia, it probably is Durian.</p>

		<p>Right now, I&#8217;m listening to a Swedish rock band called K&#246;ttgrottorna. Which means &quot;Meat caves&quot; I guess.</p>
<p>/Never tried Surstr&#246;mming.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve tried surstr&#246;mming twice and I&#8217;m not giving it a third try. I&#8217;ve also eaten durian twice and it&#8217;s nothing compared to surstr&#246;mming. Eating durian is like eating mashed onions mixed with butter, eating surstr&#246;mming is more like eating something that has passed through a dog.</p>

		<p>In the Seattle area there are two places that I know of that can provide this:</p>
<p>*Ikea</p>
<p>*Olsens Scandinavian foods in Ballard</p>
<p>Speaking of Lutefisk; In Poulsbo I saw a sign that advertised for &quot;World famous Lutefisk TV-dinner&quot;</p>

		<p>My mother is from the northen part of Sweden where surstr&#246;mming is considered &quot;mandatory&quot; food. I have some terrible childhood memories when my mother and her relatives would set up tables outside and feast on this horrible dish. I could never get close enough to try it myself because of the smell&#8230;</p>
<p>To think of this combined with ice cream gives me the creeps.</p>
<p>That said, some of Sweden&#8217;s most famous chefs designates surstr&#246;mming as a true delicacy. They claim that the smell disappears if you air the surstr&#246;mming once you have opened the can. It is typically served on cripsbread with onion and boiled potatoes.</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a story on German Wikipedia. The court decision is referred, which is also quoted on other places, like here (a pdf document on German <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.mietgerichtstag.de/downloads/pfeifer.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.mietgerichtstag.de/downloads/pfeifer.pdf</a>) so it is authentic:</p>
<p>More than 20 years ago, one woman who rented an apartment in Cologne (Germany) shared the Surstr&#246;mming sauce on the staircase for Christmas. The landlords terminated the lease immediately. She sued them for the termination without notice and lost. The court decision stated: &quot;We are convinced that the offensive odor is beyond the acceptable limits of the cohabitants since the defendants opened one can in the court&quot;.</p>
<p>The story reminded me to the Chapter IV of the 1889 Jerome K. Jerome&#8217;s classic &quot;Three Men in a Boat (To Say Nothing of the Dog)&quot;. Free e-text available via Project Gutenberg.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
