<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/11/14/6188257.aspx"> Last time</a>, we traced an <code>IP_ON_HEAP</code> failure to a shell extension that used an older version of ATL which was not DEP-friendly. But that led to a follow-up question:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Why aren't we seeing this same crash in the main program as in the shell extension? That program uses the same version of ATL, but it doesn't crash. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The reason is given in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/prodtech/windowsxp/depcnfxp.mspx#ETJAC"> this chart</a>. Notice that the default configuration is OptIn, which means that DEP is off for all processes by default, but is on for all Windows system components. That same part of the page describes how you can change to OptOut so that the default is to turn on DEP for all processes <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/security/prodtech/windowsxp/depcnfxp.mspx#EGCAC"> except for the ones you put on the exception list</a>. There's more information on <a href="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=35495"> this excerpt from the "Changes to Functionality in Microsoft Windows&nbsp;XP Service Pack&nbsp;2" document</a>. </p>
<p> The program that comes with the shell extension is not part of Windows, so DEP is disabled by default. But Explorer is part of Windows, so DEP is enabled for Explorer by default. That's why only Explorer encounters this problem. </p>
<p> (This little saga does illustrate the double-edged sword of extensibility. If you make your system extensible, you allow other people to add features to it. On the other hand, you also allow other people to add bugs to it.) </p>
<p> The saga of the DEP exception is not over, however, because it turns out I've been lying to you. More information tomorrow. </p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve configured my Vista machine to use DEP by default for everything and only a handful of things crash on it. From memory, just a couple of games so far had needed adding to the whitelist to prevent crashes during startup.</p>
<p>Of course, YMMV and it may just be I&#8217;ve been lucky with the things I run.</p>
<p>I can see why it&#8217;s off by default for non-system processes but tech-savvy people who want that extra bit of protection, or to know when things are going wrong so they can fix/report the problems, probably shouldn&#8217;t fear turning it on. Of course it could cause you to lose some work when using a program that otherwise would have continued okay but my experience is that DEP rarely kicks in except when something was about to crash anyway, or in cases where it always happens. (In the latter case you add the program to the whitelist the first time you use it, or ditch the program, and carry on.)</p>

		<p>sorry, not securom, safedisc and starforce(even worse;)</p>
<p>&quot;The second check it performs is to look in the application database for the process to see if NX support should be disabled or enabled. Lastly, it checks to see if the DLL that is being loaded is flagged as having an NX incompatible section (such as .aspack, .pcle, and .sforce)&quot;</p>

		<p>One problem is that protection code may (definitely does in some cases) run as a privileged service. In those cases, disabling DEP would make it easier for something to exploit bugs in the protection code in order to escalate privileges.</p>
<p>(I do not know whether or not there are protection systems which both disable DEP on themselves and run with high privileges but if there are then that is a bothersome combination.)</p>

		<p>Leo: That&#8217;s certainly a problem. But most copy protection applications have more security problems than just being easy to exploit ;)</p>

		<p>ak: but DEP is not *trying* to protect against those sorts of programs anyway. I&#8217;m not sure what the problem with having safedisc and starforce in the &quot;compatibility whitelist&quot; is..?</p>

		<p>I read an IE team blog a couple of months ago, and IIRC IE runs with DEP disabled by default. It seems the Java Runtime Engine does not run too well with DEP enabled, and so the IE team was forced to bow out. :(</p>
<p>I hate Java. I really do. Nasty language, nasty class library and worse performance than a cat in water.</p>

		<p>I thought (old versions of) ATL and MFC thunks are all recognized by the DEP exception handler? Otherwise using DEP on user processes would be a disaster, considering all the VC6 compiled apps.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
