<p>The dying logging town of <a href="http://www.leavenworth.org/"> Leavenworth, Washington</a> reinvented itself in the 1960's as a faux-Bavarian village. Today, over a million tourists visit annually to enjoy the scenic mountain views, soak in the fake Bavarian atmosphere, and revel in events like the <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2009328901_accordion12.html"> Leavenworth International Accordion Celebration</a> which starts tomorrow, or the three-weekend-long <a href="http://www.leavenworthoktoberfest.com/"> Leavenworth Oktoberfest</a> every October. (Mind you, the Leavenworth Oktoberfest doesn't actually start until the Munich Oktoberfest is nearly over, because Oktoberfest starts in <i>September</i>.)</p>
<p> I found during a brief visit to Leavenworth that the people there may dress like they're from Bavaria, but they don't actually speak German. </p>
<p> But at least I was there undercover. </p>
<p> Some years ago, a colleague of mine was on assignment in Redmond from his home country of Austria. One weekend, he decided to pay a visit to our fake Bavarian village, and when he returned, we asked him what he thought of the town. </p>
<p> "Well, for a <a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20030430&amp;slug=leavenworth30m"> fake Bavarian village</a>, it's not too bad. I mean, nobody would for a moment think it was the real thing, but I appreciate the effort they went to, and it was quite a pleasant little town. But the weird thing was what happened whenever I opened my mouth to speak: People recognized that I spoke with a German accent and a flash of panic crossed their faces, as if I was going to blow the cover off their little ruse and reveal it to be a fraud." </p>
<p> [Update 8:00AM: Various typos fixed.] </p>

		<p>Minor typo. &nbsp;I assume &#8220;According&#8221; is supposed to be &#8220;Accordion&#8221;?</p>
<p>My brother just picked up a four record set of accordion music at a second hand shop. &nbsp;Sadly one of the LPs was missing. &nbsp;Maybe that&#8217;s why it was there.</p>

		<p>Nitpick warning!</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to go to the trouble of spelling Oktober with a K and fretting about the lack of German speakers in said faux-Bavarian village, you should also try to get the right spelling when doing the obligatory comparison to M&amp;uuml;nchen. &nbsp;And there&#8217;s a stray &#8216;t&#8217; in half of your instances of Oktoberfest (yes I know American English spell check flags both variants equally).</p>
<div class=post>[<i>That&#8217;s what happens when I rush a blog entry into print. I wrote that entry up just yesterday (to catch the start of the Accordion Festival), so it didn&#8217;t get a year of proofreading that most articles get. Sorry. (And by the way, I thought Leavenworth was cute. The not-speaking-German thing was just a little joke.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>One could forgive the fakery, maybe even the accordions, if the beer is reasonably authentic.</p>

		<p>As for beer in 2007 they had Warsteiner.</p>
<p>The weirdest thing is how they decide to split german words they are using. &nbsp;Some are combine words correct in german some split so they are word by word translations.</p>
<p>But if you want a good german fest in the US head down to New Braunfels, Texas and thier Wurstfest at the end on October through November.</p>

		<p>kbiel, I don&#8217;t want the real thing, I want the authentic faux experience! (Also where people speak a language I understand.) :)</p>
<p>Like how I&#8217;d rather watch the US remake of The Italian Job than the UK original. (I&#8217;ll probably be forced out of the country for saying that in public about the nation&#8217;s most treasured film.)</p>

		<p>Ich war 2003 mit ein paar Freunden dort und wir sind gleich als Deutsche erkannt, in gutem Deutsch angesprochen und in ein Restaurant eingeladen worden.</p>
<p>Bier, Wei&#223;wurst und Brezel waren gut, der s&#252;&#223;e Senf eher nicht.</p>
<p>Der Ort selbst ist recht h&#252;bsch, auch wenn (oder gerade weil) es nicht wirklich typisch bayerisch ist, sondern eher viele Stile aus der europ&#228;ischen Alpenregion verbindet.</p>

		<p>If the beer is Warsteiner, then it&#8217;s not a true Oktoberfest. At the M&#252;nchener Oktoberfest only beer from M&#252;nchen (Munich for English speakers) is allowed. Warsteiner is from Northern Germany (or Preu&#223;en, to Bavarians).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
