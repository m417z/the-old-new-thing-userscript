		<p>It wasn&#8217;t just the project manager who was trapped in the lift. Also trapped were the head from the construction company and the chief engineer from the company responsible for the lift! Nothing like eating your own dog food, eh?</p>
<p>Some VIPs were also trapped in the lift a week or two ago and had to be rescued. The cost to go up the tower is &#163;4.95 with a &#163;2 surcharge to use the panoramic external lift. I guess that goes towards the cost of keeping abseiling engineers on standby.</p>
<p>Still, I can see it from my office window and will go up it myself once it&#8217;s settled into the useful life part of the bathtub curve.</p>

		<p>I live there, see it every day&#8230; Funny as heck&#8230; The thing is hideous too and ruins the sky line&#8230; But that is what happens when you give the civil service an opportunity to build something with no /real/ financial benefit except to celebrate some generic date roll over (see millennium dome).</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s nothing to do with the Civil Service, I don&#8217;t know where you got that idea from. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s hideous at all.</p>

		<p>From a guy that spends 20minutes looking in its general direction a day trust me, it is hidious&#8230; Maybe you don&#8217;t think so because all you can see is the top of it? Or maybe you never saw the Gunwharf skyline before they shoved it right in the middle.</p>

		<p>They should publish the &#8216;risk&#8217; of being met by  abseiling (US = Rappling)Engineers as a potential highlight of the tower experience.  For example,  one in every 1000 trips YOU may be LUCKY enough to meet one of our amazing dare-devil abseiling engineers&#8230;    I&#8217;d go up for that!  Maybe they could even offer Abseiling training lessons from the tower.  A liaison with portsmouth University&#8217;s mechanical engineering department could lead to an  innovative field-work coure in practical engineering and abseiling.  I&#8217;d want to sign-up!</p>

		<p>It reminds me cases when Windows crashes in Bill Gates hands right in the middle of presentations.</p>
<p>:)) I guess it always happens when too much effort is put into &#8216;managing&#8217; instead of getting competent people.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m always impressed how many german words make it into the english/american language. &quot;Abseilen&quot;&#8230; At first I thought I misread the word ;-)</p>

		<p>Yes, it&#8217;s open, stop knocking it and get in the lift to the first floor for a wonderful view.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
