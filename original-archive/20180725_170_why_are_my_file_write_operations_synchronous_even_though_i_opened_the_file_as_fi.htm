<p>
A customer found that even though they opened a file with the
<code>FILE_<code></code>FLAG_<code></code>OVERLAPPED</code>,
their calls to <code>Write&shy;File</code>
were nevertheless synchronous.
Why are their overlapped writes completing synchronously?
</p>
<p>
As currently implemented, there are at least
<a HREF="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/156932/asynchronous-disk-i-o-appears-as-synchronous-on-windows">
three things which will
cause a write to be forced synchronous</a>:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Writing to an NTFS-compressed file.</li>
<li>Writing to an NTFS-encrypted file.</li>
<li>Extending a file.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The first two are easy to understand.
The third is trickier.
</p>
<p>
You might think you can avoid extending the file with a write
by seeking to the desired final file size,
performing a
<code>Set&shy;End&shy;Of&shy;File</code>,
seeking back to position 0,
and then performing the desired write operations.
</p>
<p>
It turns out this doesn't work because setting the end-of-file
extends the logical file size,
but the physical file size is unchanged.
There are two obvious ways to change the physical file size:
</p>
<p>
First, you can use
the <code>Set&shy;File&shy;Valid&shy;Data</code> function.
This allocates space for the file on disk but does not zero-initialize
those bytes.
You just get whatever garbage was lying in those sectors at the time.
This is naturally a violation of security
since it allows a user to access data that belonged to another user,
so this operation
requires <code>Se&shy;Manage&shy;Volume&shy;Privilege</code>
which is normally assigned only to administrators.
</p>
<p>
Less scary is seeking to the desired end of file position minus one,
then writing one byte.
This write will be synchronous, and it may take a while since the
system needs to zero-initialize all the bytes in between,
but it does finish with the desired state,
and it doesn't require administrator privileges.
</p>
<p>
Once you've caused the file to be extended to the desired size,
you can seek back to position 0 and perform your overlapped
write operations,
which will now complete asynchronously,
assuming you haven't encountered any other obstacles.</p>

		<p>In some previous code that created a lot of files whose size were known ahead of writing time, I used SetEndOfFile to pre-set the size, hopefully to avoid fragmentation or at least give a hint to the OS about it, are you telling me it was pointless?</p>

		<p>In trying to do this on a pipe, I came to the conclusion the OS could always just up and decide to make an async call synchronous whenever it felt like it and gave up. I&#8217;ve seen documentation of people who have gotten it to work, but it&#8217;s touchy.</p>

		<p>In the beginning of days, all disk I/O are synchronous.</p>
<p>The CPU itself executes instruction in synchronous way too. When it&#8217;s executing your code, you can be certain it&#8217;s not doing other things.</p>
<p>Asynchronous operations are things that added later.</p>

		<p>Uh, no? The disk driver sends the read request to the hardware, and then <i>what</i>, busy-waits for the interrupt? Polls the hardware register until it sees the data?</p>

		<p>At the early days of DOS DMA was not a thing yet. To read data from disk your code calls corresponding interrupt then wait until the interrupt returns the control to your code. At that time your CPU is busy executing whatever code the BIOS tells it to do, and in the later dates whatever code injected to overtake the interrupt vector. (Like that &#8220;Ontrack Disk Manager&#8221; that allows you to use harddisk &gt; 500MB)</p>
<p>Windows logicially copies all functionality of existing system, so it&#8217;s the default operation it supports. WinNT logically need to support all non-depreciated/obsoluted API of non-NT Windows therefore supports it too.</p>

		<p>&#8220;When it’s executing your code, you can be certain it’s not doing other things.&#8221;  Yes, when it&#8217;s executing your CODE.  When the kernel wants to read data from disk, it can certainly send that request to a disk drive, then while the disk head is in the (relatively slow) process of moving (seeking) to the right cylinder, the kernel can and should be doing other things &#8212; executing other code for other users, or executing other code for you.</p>

		<p>Before DMA, all we have is PIO mode that, the CPU is involved in any input/output process of devices, busy moving data from their corresponding Ports to memory.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why on WinXP, when your harddisk behaves unstably and the system decided to fallback from DMA mode to PIO mode, even access to your harddisk makes your CPU scream (usage jump to 100%).</p>

		<p>When DMA is not a thing yet, all we have is PIO mode where CPU needs to be involved in copying data from your I/O port to your main memory. So you can say it&#8217;s &#8220;busy&#8221; while not &#8220;busy waiting&#8221;. (You can see CPU goes up to 100% for every I/O when your harddisk falls back from DMA to PIO mode for whatever reason)</p>

		<p>Remember kids, it&#8217;s always legal for the OS to convert asynchronous I/O to synchronous I/O. It&#8217;s rather common actually, the OS will do it for reads when the data is already in cache, such as due to prefetching.</p>

		<p>Nonsense! File reads are not always synchronous. All file I/O is inherently asynchronous &#8211; the read or write is issued to the hardware, and then we have to wait for the hardware to respond. That can be a busy-wait, or a wait for an interrupt or event. Depending on the hardware, you can have multiple outstanding I/O requests (SCSI, for example, supports this), even against the same hardware.</p>

		<p>When DMA is not a thing yet, all we have is PIO mode where CPU needs to be involved in copying data from your I/O port to your main memory. So you can say it&#8217;s &#8220;busy&#8221; while not &#8220;busy waiting&#8221;.

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
