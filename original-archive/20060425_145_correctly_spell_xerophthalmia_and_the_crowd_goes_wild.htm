<p>One of the things I did <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/04/13/575742.aspx"> in San Francisco</a> was attend a performance of <a href="http://www.spellingbeethemusical.com/"> The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee</a>. I went into the show with some trepidation, fearing that it would recall painful memories from my own career on the spelling bee circuit as a middle-schooler. Fortunately, my experience as a spelling bee participant only served to make the show more enjoyable.</p>
<p> Each performance is different because four volunteers from the audience are invited to join the six student characters on the stage to participate in the bee. Things got off to an unexpected start when the first audience member misspelled "Mexican", which threw the script for a minor loop since one of the characters complains later about that "easy" word. A second audience member dropped out shortly thereafter, but the last two managed to hang on a bit longer. <a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=sMB1x6KQGIA"> The third eventually dropped out on "dengue"</a>. </p>
<p> The last audience member, on the other hand, kept spelling words correctly. It was obvious that we had reached the point in the script where all audience participants were to be eliminated, because they kept calling him to the microphone for another word. He was doing so well that the cast members had trouble keeping straight faces. The crowd went nuts when he spelled <a href="http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861706811/xerophthalmia.html"> <i>xerophthalmia</i></a> correctly. (You could tell who the spelling bee veterans in the audience were, because we were the ones who cheered wildly as soon as he finished spelling, before the judge ruled him correct. After all, <i>xerophthalmia</i> is not a difficult word, being a simple combination of the Greek roots <i>xeros</i>, meaning dry, and <i>ophthalmos</i>, meaning eye.) After <i>xerophthalmia</i>, he got the "word" <i>pharmacologi<font size="-1" color="#808080">cal</font><font size="-2" color="#C0C0C0">mum</font></i>. (Yes, the judge mumbled the end of the "word".) And as soon as he started spelling with "p", the judge eagerly rang the bell and declared "no, it's an f." </p>
<p> The first half of the show was extremely funny, for it is then we are introduced to each of the (cast member) spellers and their quirky spelling techniques. That's also where the bulk of the spelling takes place, and where we are treated to the wickedly twisted sample sentences, two examples of which can be found in the clip I linked to above. (We also get Olive's sweet <i>My Friend, The Dictionary</i> and the wonderfully out-of-control <i>Pandemonium</i>.) The second half drags a bit, but <i>I Speak Six Languages</i> injects some long-absent freneticism, including a little fourth-wall breakage when Marcy displaces the orchestra pianist and starts playing her own accompaniment! </p>
<p> If this show ever comes into your area, I wholeheartedly recommend seeing it. </p>

		<p>I went to see this in San Francisco, too, and it&#8217;s great &#8212; just plain fun. Hearing a squeaky-clean boy scout sing at the top of his lungs about the problems caused by &quot;&#8230;hiiis e-REEEEEEEC-tion&quot; is absolutely hilarious.</p>
<p>I wished I&#8217;d volunteered to be one of the audience spellers. They worked hard to eliminate the last one, too, but he got out on &quot;lysergic acid diethylamide&quot;. I did come in fifth in my state spelling bee in eighth grade, but LSD is actually quite easy to spell &#8212; it&#8217;s long but utterly predictable, as long as you know it&#8217;s &quot;lysergic&quot;, not &quot;lycergic&quot;. </p>
<p>Anyway, the audience involvement is a brilliant stroke. It probably just made it all the more fun to watch someone keep it going that long&#8230;</p>

		<p>Sounds like it was a lot of fun! &nbsp;Of course, just about anything that&#8217;s on Broadway (or your local equivalent ^_^) is usually a lot of fun. &nbsp;When my girlfriend and I spent four days in New York City back in February, we saw three others: &nbsp;&quot;Wicked,&quot; &quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,&quot; and &quot;Avenue Q.&quot; &nbsp;We *almost* saw &quot;Spelling Bee&quot;, but opted for &quot;Avenue Q&quot; instead &#8212; you can&#8217;t see them all, after all. &nbsp;Still, she&#8217;s a theater buff, so I think we&#8217;ll seriously consider catching this the next time we&#8217;re up there. &nbsp;Thanks for the tip!</p>
<p>(And all three of &quot;Wicked,&quot; &quot;Scoundrels,&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are great shows, and all very different, for those who are curious. &nbsp;&quot;Wicked&quot; is a huge full-scale classic musical drama about the Wicked Witch of the West. &nbsp;&quot;Dirty Rotten Scoundrels&quot; is an hilarious musical comedy based on the 1980s movie of the same name, all about con men trying to out-con each other. &nbsp;And &quot;Avenue Q&quot; is, of course, &quot;the dirty Sesame Street&quot; &#8212; and with song lyrics like &quot;What do you do with a B.A. in English?&quot; and &quot;The Internet Is for Porn,&quot; how can you go wrong? :)</p>

		<p>Speaking of spelling, you always spell &quot;accomodate&quot; not &quot;accommodate&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not a native English speaker. I&#8217;m studying English now (It&#8217;s really tough for me by the way.) So I&#8217;m not sure it is acceptable or not.</p>
<p>And I didn&#8217;t know this word when I first saw it on your blog so I tried look this word up on my dictionary, but I couldn&#8217;t&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, your blog is really attractive and helpfull to improve my knowledge of English.<br />
<br />(My English is still stupid though. I will glad if someone correct this comment!)<br /></p>

		<p>Sorry. &quot;Accommodate&quot; is one of my weak words. &quot;Minuscule&quot; used to be another, but I overcame that one.</p>

		<p>My dad (not native english speaker) failed an English high-school equivalent Chemistry exam for &#8216;childish use of the language&#8217;. &nbsp;The example they gave him as feedback was writing that &#8216;Water solidified&#8217; (Ice). &nbsp;I think he should have been given extra marks for ingeniuos use of the language &#8211; he obviously knew what he was writing about and could communicate it. &nbsp;At least he can spell (unlike me, native English miss-speller).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
