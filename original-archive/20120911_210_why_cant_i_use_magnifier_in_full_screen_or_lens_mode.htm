<p>A customer liaison asked why their customer's Windows&nbsp;7 machines could run Magnifier only in Docked mode. Full Screen and Lens mode were disabled. The customer liaison was unable to reproduce the problem on a physical machine, but was able to reproduce it in a virtual machine.</p>
<p> Full Screen and Lens mode <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Make-items-on-the-screen-appear-bigger-Magnifier"> require that desktop composition be enabled</a>. Windows will enable desktop composition by default if it thinks your video card is capable of handling it. (Finding the minimum hardware requirements for desktop composition is left as an exercise.) </p>
<p> This was visible in the screen shots provided by the customer liaison. In the screen shot where Full Screen and Lens modes were enabled, the Aero theme was being used, whereas in the screen shot where they were disabled, the theme was Windows&nbsp;7 Basic. The Windows&nbsp;7 Basic theme is used when desktop composition is disabled. </p>
<p> A quick way to check whether desktop composition is enabled is to hit <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> and see whether windows get the Aero Peek effect when you select them. Aero Peek is a feature that is provided by the desktop compositor. </p>

		<p>TRWTF is that in Windows 7 high contrast themes are not implemented in Aero. Why?</p>

		<p>@Macrosofter: I forced it on (it&#39;s not as hard as it sounds). The result is certain system panels are painted in a completely incompatible color set because not all color bases in Aero can be customized. A slightly modified high contrast white should work (the default one is damaged).</p>

		<p>I for one wish that desktop composition wasn&#39;t coupled with Aero. I like the classic (Win2K-like) look, and wish I could have desktop composition while maintaining that look.</p>

		<p>Muzer: That&#39;s not entirely unheard of. I wanted my car with a navigation system, which only comes in the &quot;sport&quot; model &#8212; but only with an automatic transmission! Why would the &quot;sport&quot; model even have the automatic transmission option, let alone require it to upgrade to the satnav?</p>

		<p>@Gabe:</p>
<p>A tangential question:</p>
<p>When was the last time somebody bought a Sport Utility Vehicle with a manual transmission? Anyway, some &quot;sport&quot; cars are also &quot;chickmobiles&quot;, therefore an automatic.</p>

		<p>Lol? Wanting to use two completely different and incompatible pieces of software in harmony is *slightly* different than wanting something that&#39;s supposed to be better than what existed before to be a little more customisable in terms of themes&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#39;d &nbsp;be like if some car company releases a new car that&#39;s faster, more efficient and more comfortable than all their previous ones, but it&#39;s only available in bright pink. Wouldn&#39;t it be nice for the same car to be available in the old colours?</p>

		<p>alegr1: The term SUV is primarily used in North America, where such vehicles generally don&#39;t come with automatic transmissions. That said, Jeeps (CJ and its successor the Wrangler) traditionally have stick shifts, though can be ordered with an auto. I think that SUVs which people actually use for &quot;sport&quot; (e.g. hunting, fishing, or off-roading) are the ones that are likely to have manual transmissions, while the ones you most often see are autos because usually people get SUVs to drive around suburbia.</p>
<p>Contrast that with the &quot;sport&quot; in my car&#39;s name, which refers to the idea of motorsports. For my car (a tiny station wagon with a mere 7&quot; ground clearance), being &quot;sport&quot;-y means it has bigger tires, a tighter suspension, and a spoiler (among the other trappings of a higher trim level).</p>
<p>The manual transmission is available on regular and &quot;sport&quot; versions (except the ones with satnav), while the automatic is available on both but has paddle shifters on the &quot;sport&quot; version.</p>

		<p>Even if you have the hardware, incompatible software will cause windows to revert to the basic theme as well!</p>

		<p>@Jonathan: Windows 8 finally fixes this &#8211; but you still need to enable high-contrast to be able to customize colours (even if the colours you choose aren&#39;t high contrast). This unfortunately makes certain browsers (IE and Firefox) render webpages in high-contrast mode, which makes certain elements invisible (luckily Opera and Chromium don&#39;t try to be smart).</p>

		<p>@ender: Thanks, I&#39;ll check that out when I move to Windows 8 (soon). I don&#39;t want to customize colors &#8211; I use the &quot;Windows Classic&quot; theme unmodified (save for a black background).</p>

		<p>@Gabe: Just buy the manual sport version, and an aftermarket sat-nav (they are usually better and cheaper than manufacturer-fitted options).</p>

		<p>@Jonathan I hate to be the bearer of bad news but Windows 8 removed support for the &quot;Windows Classic&quot; aka the look of windows 2000 and under.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
