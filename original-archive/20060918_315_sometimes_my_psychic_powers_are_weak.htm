Why does my MFC program exit unexpectedly?
The stack trace at the point we hit <code>ExitInstance</code>
goes like this:
</p>
<pre>
CClientConsoleApp::ExitInstance
CWinThread::Run+0x88
AfxWinMain+0x84
_wWinMainCRTStartup+0x138
BaseThreadInitThunk+0xe
_RtlUserThreadStart+0x23
</pre>
<p>
Thanks.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You can already see some of what's going on, but clearly
more information is needed.
My first psychic suggestion was to examine MFC's message
pump to see what causes it to exit.
Then follow the money backwards.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
That's what we want to know and what we want to find out.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
MFC comes with source code so you can do this yourself.
Don't expect somebody to do your debugging for you.
You have the tools to do it yourself:
You have the source code and you have a brain.
</p>
<p>
Once you figure out what conditions make MFC's message pump exit,
then try to figure out which of those conditions is actually
occurring, and then set breakpoints to try to catch the
condition being achieved.
</p>
<p>
I don't have the MFC source code memorized and I didn't feel
like installing it just to help somebody solve their own problem,
so I resorted to wild guessing in the guise of psychic powers:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
I don't know what MFC's message pump looks like
but my psychic powers tell me that it stops when it gets a
<code>WM_QUIT</code> message.
My psychic powers are losing strength
from being so heavily stressed so early in the morning...
I see a shadow, a vague form,
it's not all that clear, kind of hazy,
it might be... yes I think it says
"<code>PostQuitMessage</code>"...
hard to tell... connection fading...
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(Sorry, I can't finish up this story with a snappy ending.
It happened so long ago I forget what the problem was.)</p>

		<p>You&#8217;d expect PostQuitMessage() to be the root cause of this, but wouldn&#8217;t calling PostMessage() with WM_QUIT message cause it too? </p>
<p>And what would happen if the message to post was stored in a variable, and just happened to (accidentally or otherwise) evaluate to WM_QUIT at that one point?</p>
<p>Yes, the MSDN documentation says &quot;don&#8217;t do this&quot;, but that doesn&#8217;t stop some people&#8230;</p>

		<p>yup, Ritchie is right, most of the time people end up posting WM_QUIT when they should be posting WM_CLOSE to terminate their application appropriately. The windows message loop shuts up when it catches the WM_QUIT because GetMessage(&#8230;) returns 0 when it gets the WM_QUIT from the message queue. It will be same in mfc.</p>

		<p>I love bug reports like this. It means either the person is so fundamentally lazy that they don&#8217;t deserve help, or, they are so fundamentally stupid no amount of help will make a difference.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d call this person fundametally inexperienced. After all, he/she knows about the call stack. I remember dealing with guy who got an assert in the debug build and didn&#8217;t know where it came from.</p>

		<p>Sometimes call stack in itself don&#8217;t tell the entire story,especially with GUI model on windows. Windows being fundamentally an event driven stuff, a message posted to a queue from nowhere could cause something(random) like this to happen and you won&#8217;t be able to trace back to the original culprit unless you do some code level tracing by greping and figuring the possible WM_QUIT posting code.</p>

		<p>I had a similar problem with 100% of pure my own win32 code &#8211; no MFC no any other library. I wasn’t pumping messages at the same rate as I was initiating them. There was a loop, there was a PeekMessage() call and there was a progress bar.</p>
<p>Every iteration of the loop shaved one message only and incrementing the progress bar generated more than that. So, after a few hundred iterations Windows decided to get rid of me and my loop and it just sent me WM_QUIT so my application properly saved settings and terminated.</p>
<p>I was staring at my code in debugger in total disbelief and after several hours of pulling my hair off I removed the progress bar and it all stopped. No more WM_QUIT messages.</p>
<p>At that point I decided to reorginize the message pumping part somehow.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
