<p>From Windows&nbsp;XP to Windows&nbsp;7, the Start menu showed the programs it thinks you've run most frequently, by employing <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/06/11/3215739.aspx"> a conceptually simple but complicated-in-practice algorithm</a>. You can right-click an item on the menu and select <i>Remove from this list</i>. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/11/08/10087413.aspx#10088182"> What exactly does this option do</a>? Does it reset the points back to zero, or does it ban the program from the Start menu for all eternity, or something in between?</p>
<p> It resets the points back to zero and marks the program as <i>has never been run by the user</i>. </p>
<p> This causes it to vanish from the frequently-used list, but if you start running it, it will start earning points again, and if you keep running it enough, it will claw its way back onto your frequently-used list. </p>
<p> If you want to ban a program, you can mark it as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/06/15/3301004.aspx"> No&shy;Start&shy;Page</a>. </p>

		<p>This doesn&#39;t seem to be the case on Windows 7. I had Calculator somewhere in the middle of my list, then I selected &quot;Remove from this list&quot;. Of course it disappeared. But after I started Calculator just once, it re-appeared again in the middle of the list. Shouldn&#39;t it take a few launches to get back, or at least show at the bottom? Looks like the program got all of its points back.</p>

		<p>The order or position on the list isn&#39;t affected, once it &quot;makes the list&quot;, it&#39;s displayed there. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t move ever higher with rank until it&#39;s the top of the list (or would you prefer most-frequent be at the bottom to support Fritt&#39;s law?).</p>

		<p>I agree with George. I like to remove document-driven programs (like Word) from the MRU list, because I only launch them by opening documents. In XP, when I removed an icon, it took some time to reappear, and when it did, it slowly crawled from the bottom. In Windows 7, sometimes (maybe after launching the program from the Start menu?) the program instantly reappears in the former position. I use the small icons view, which gives space for about 20 icons in both OSes, and that allows the effect to be clearly seen.</p>

		<p>@LtCmdrKeene: what you proposes about Fritt&#39;s law is interesting. I also thought for some time about inverting the Start menu MRU list. After all, it made a lot of sense after moving the &quot;All programs&quot; item to the bottom for the very same reason. Then I realized that we scan a list top-bottom, so the first items we read are the top ones. The time and cognitive load of having to scan all the list to find the most recent programs (which would be in the last positions) would negate any benefit gained by Fritt&#39;s law.</p>

		<p>Have you verified this on Windows 7, Raymond? Because as others have said, Windows 7 MFU list behaves differently than what you described in the article. Also the NoStartPage trick doesn&#39;t work.</p>

		<p>Curiously, when you get to the support.microsoft.com link for the &quot;How To Prevent a Program from Being Displayed in the Most Frequently Used Programs List in Windows XP&quot; article, there is a System Tip:</p>
<p>This article applies to a different version of Windows than the one you are using. Content in this article may not be relevant to you. </p>
<p>Visit the Windows 7 Solution Center</p>
<p>That visit link takes you to the Support for Windows 7 home page. Good luck finding the equivalent article for Windows 7 there.</p>

		<p>NoStartPage does not work for the Windows 7 menu. I first thought it didn&#39;t work only for shortcuts that used AppUserModelIDs but it doesn&#39;t work at all. NoAppUserModelIDs works but it was easier to just add NoStartPage for the EXE than finding the shortcut&#39;s AppUserModelID.</p>
<p>TweakUI which could add NoStartPage worked on Windows Vista/7 x64 via a compatibility shim but the shim broke on Windows 8 x64 and MS is denying the shim broke. :(</p>

		<p>Lots of companies have such a policy where you can&#39;t make the company look bad. Look at Adria Richards formerly of SendGrid. <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2013/03/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks/">arstechnica.com/&#8230;/how-dongle-jokes-got-two-people-fired-and-led-to-ddos-attacks</a></p>
<p>It doesn&#39;t matter what your opinion is on that situation, SendGrid HAD to fire her. She was a developer evangelist for the company, meaning she was a public face for them. After that, no one would want to make contacts with her for SendGrid. That hurts SendGrid and thus she was fired.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
