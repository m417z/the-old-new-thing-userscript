<p>Sometimes, when I'm debugging a problem, I'll ignore a particular thread and somebody will ask, "What is that thread doing, and how did you know to ignore it?"</p>
<p> My reply: "I have no idea what it's doing, but whatever it's doing, it's normal." </p>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tess/"> Tess</a> has been running an excellent series of posts on debugging the CLR, but one of the most important lessons is where you learn about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/tess/archive/2005/12/20/505862.aspx"> things to ignore when debugging an ASP.NET hang</a>. </p>
<p> Hangs and deadlocks are tricky to debug because there is no unhandled exception that says, "Look at me, I'm a bug!" Instead, the program just grinds to a halt and you have to go spelunking to figure out why. What you are looking for is anything out of the ordinary, but in order to recognize what that is, you first need to know what is ordinary. </p>
<p> So do that. Run your program, let it do its thing, then break in with the debugger and take a look around. Make a note of what you see. Those are things that are going on when nothing is wrong. <em>This is what your program looks like when it is running normally</em>. Now that you know what normal operations look like, you can recognize the abnormal stuff. </p>
<p> Note that you don't even have to know what all those normal things are. For example, when I connect to a process with the debugger, I often find threads lying around which are waiting inside RPC or the kernel thread pool. I don't know what they are doing, but since they are always there, I don't pay much attention to them. </p>

		<p>A&amp;B: (looking at a hex dump of some kernel-mode memory)<br />
<br />A: Lets see where this pointer goes.<br />
<br />B: How do you know it&#8217;s a pointer (as opposed to any other random bunch of bits)?<br />
<br />A: It looks like one.</p>
<p>Happens to me all the time.</p>

		<p>Speaking of RPCs&#8230; &nbsp;there are times when I&#8217;m looking at the server side of an RPC call and would like to know what the situation is on the client side (to keep things simple, let&#8217;s say both are on the same machine). &nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m thinking there has to be a relatively easy way to find the client-side stack trace, but the best answer I&#8217;ve found so far is the rcpexts.dll extensions for ntsd/cdb or the closely related DbgRcp tool. &nbsp;These tools are by no means simple and straight forward, and I feel like I&#8217;m missing some obvious simple technique.</p>
<p>Does anyone know a simple technique to dump the stack for the thread on the other side of an RCP call?</p>
<p></p>

		<p>&quot;There&#8217;s way too much information to decode. You get used to it. I don&#8217;t even see the code. &nbsp;All I see is Blonde, Brunette, Redhead&#8230;.&quot;</p>

		<p>Thanks Dean, it&#8217;s hidden so well I wouldn&#8217;t spot it :). Steveshe, why you falsely assume I&#8217;m going to try get him to do something for me?</p>
<p>And sorry for the off-topic comment, but aricle I have a question about is old and comments there are disabled.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
