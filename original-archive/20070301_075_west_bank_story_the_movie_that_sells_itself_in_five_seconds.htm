<p>This weekend, I attended an <a href="http://www.oscar.com/">Oscar</a>-watching party, and when the clips from the nominees for Live Action Short Film were run, I was completely won over by <a href="http://www.westbankstory.com/"> <i>West Bank Story</i></a>. Five seconds of dancing, finger-snapping Jews and Arabs is all I needed.</p>
<p> When filling out your Oscar party ballot, "Live Action Short Film" is one of those categories you just close your eyes and pick randomly since you don't know anything about any of the movies. It felt like everybody else at the party felt the same way I did: If we had seen that clip, we would all have voted for it. In our minds, it won the award before the envelope was even torn open. </p>

		<p>I agree 100%. &nbsp;When I saw the clip I immediately thought &quot;what a brilliant idea&quot;.</p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>I have a question about the book, todo with WM_MOUSEMOVE message and a paragraph on page 116, where can I send you a query?</p>
<p>Cheers</p>

		<p>I was quite excited to see &#8216;West Bank Story&#8217; (as well as several other of the shorts available for sale at the iTunes Music Store. I picked it up as well as the winning short animation, &#8216;The Dutch Poet&#8217;. Both were great, and well worth the couple of bucks!</p>

		<p>You can do anything improbable in a play or movie as long as it involves music and dancing! &nbsp;(Springtime for Hitler in The Producers comes to mind&#8230;)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
