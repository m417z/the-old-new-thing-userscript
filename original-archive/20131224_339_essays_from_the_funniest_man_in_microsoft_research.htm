<p>James Mickens has written a number of essays for <i>;login:</i> magazine. The wall-of-text presentation is kind of scary, and the first time I encountered them, I skimmed the essays rather than reading them through. As a result, my reaction was, "I got tired." But if you follow the path and read the essays through, you realize that they are all brilliant.</p>

		<p>I had no idea that nerd humor like this could even exist. It&#39;s as if I had always been blind, and all of a sudden I was able to see. Thank you, Raymond, and of course, thank you, James. I wonder if he performs stand-ups somewhere?</p>

		<p>Here&#39;s a funny one: How come Microsoft products still haven&#39;t figured out how to stop spyware from infecting their systems ? For about 12 years now, MS products get rooted from a few lines of malformed javascript. The latest, cryptolocker, steals your data and holds it for ransom! Ha ha hah! I guess they have no intention of doing anything for their users. Just a crap mill that churns out defective products and imitation knock offs. Just hilarious, isn&#39;t it?</p>

<p>How is that Windows&#39; fault? When someone sends a sh-file to a Linux user with &quot;rm -rf ~/*&quot;, and the user launches it, that&#39;s the user&#39;s fault, not the Linux&#39;s. And well, if you run a program under your user account, there is nothing surprising it can thrash all files owned by that user account. Don&#39;t run executable files of dubious origin, duh.</p>

<p>The operating system has nothing to do with allowing malicious software on the machine. That&#39;s all the user. Indeed, most every major vulnerability which has been exploited over the past 15-20 years was patched well before it was exploited, and was only exploited by virtue of people who refused to apply the patches.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
