A user of the imaginary
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/04/17/9551818.aspx">
Program&nbsp;Q</a>
program wanted to write an automated test that created a table,
then ran various sub-test which communicated among each other
by updating that table.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
When my test tries to create a table,
the program asks the following question:
</p>
<pre>
q install server -r testdb

Setting up this machine to be a registered table server...

Registered table servers must adhere to Microsoft information 
security policies. See http://programq/policy for details.
If you have questions, contact mailto:qpolicy.

Do you agree to adhere to Microsoft policies regarding
registered table servers (y/n/q)?
</pre>
<p>
Is there a way to suppress the question?
I can't pre-create a single server that all the tests
connect to,
because multiple tests running simultaneously would
end up colliding with each other.
I would prefer that each test run on its own isolated
table server,
but when I try to install a table server on the machine
being tested,
I get the above prompt.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS=m><p>
Why not just create an unregistered table server instead?
Just leave off the <code>-r</code> flag.
Give your problem description, there appears to be
no need for the table server to be registered.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
Ah, didn't know about the ability to create an unregistered
server.
Works great!
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The user was apparently so accustomed to creating
registered table servers that he didn't realize that there
was any other kind.
My guess is that he had no idea what the
<code>-r</code> flag did;
he just cargo-culted it from somewhere.
</p>
<p>
<b>Remember</b>:
The target audience for Program&nbsp;Q is not
non-technical end-users.
The target audience is <i>other programmers</i>,
and this person was clearly a programmer since he
was writing an automated test!</p>

		<p>Everybody is conditioned to run &quot;!debugextensionQ -s&quot;, when really &quot;!debugextensionQ -r -t&quot; is closer to what most people want. &nbsp;I guess nobody ever ran &quot;!debugextensionQ -?&quot; to see all the cool options available.</p>
<p>The challenge is to design your software to be discoverable <em>by busy people</em>, without nagging the user or adding giant blinky arrows to the UI. &nbsp;I frequently cringe when I see others using software that I&#39;ve designed &#8212; that&#39;s a difficult challenge!</p>

		<p>Well to be fair a lot of programmers have little idea how to install things. They have IT lackies for that especially if they&#39;ve worked for large shops with a team for testing a team for dev, a team for UI a team for infrastructure etc they just know their piece. It is management Henry Ford style why have diverse skilled people that know how to build a car when you can hire people of the street that all they know how to do is put tires on?</p>
<p>I worked in IT with devs and would get support calls on how to connect to wifi for people working in the same org for the past 5 years. Also they didn&#39;t know how to create a svn repository even though they were the primary users of svn. We&#39;d have to create it for them and tell them were to point their client too.</p>

		<p>I was trying to learn rsync last night, and I noticed that most web tutorials recommend the -a (&#8211;archive) flag. &nbsp;In the spirit of trying to be a good programmer, I decided I&#39;d check the &#8211;help and see what that flag did:</p>
<p>-a, &#8211;archive &nbsp; &nbsp; archive mode; equals -rlptgoD (no -H,-A,-X)</p>
<p>Suffice it to say, it was a lot more tempting to just blindly use the flag than to actually look up each of those other flags and try and tease out the subtleties of how they interacted with each other.</p>
<p>(Turns out it&#39;s a good thing I checked, because that flag actually WASN&#39;T something I wanted to be using. Luckily, a better programmer than me had already done the analysis: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://nb.nathanamy.org/2012/04/rsyncing-jekyll/" rel="nofollow">nb.nathanamy.org/&#8230;/rsyncing-jekyll</a>)</p>

		<p>stuartd: I&#39;d assume that &quot;n&quot; acts as if you hadn&#39;t passed -r (since if you&#39;re not going to abide by the policies, you should get an unregistered table server in the first place), and &quot;q&quot; just quits. &nbsp;At least, for this hypothetical example.</p>

		<p>You, as a developer, always has a choice to NOT being in a hurry. If you can&#39;t be bothered to learn to use your tools right, please leave the software industry. NOW.</p>
<p>With that said, most CLI apps has stupid syntax. For many common utils in both dos/windows/unix it&#39;s not hard to develop better ones yourself, especially when it comes to input syntax. When I develop one, I always write the usage message first, and optimize the syntax to be intuitive.</p>
<p>Another mistakes people, especially developers without much CLI experience, do, is assuming that complex syntax means that applications can do anything. It a non sequitur.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
