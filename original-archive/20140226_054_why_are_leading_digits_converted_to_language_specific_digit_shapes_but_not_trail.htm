<p>If you have a string like <code>12345ABCDE67890</code>, and you render it on an Arabic system, you might get <span dir="ltr">&#1632;&#1633;&#1634;&#1635;&#1636;ABCDE67890</span>. The leading digits are rendered as Arabic-Indic digits, but the trailing digits are rendered as European digits. What's going on here?</p>
<p> This is a feature known as <i>contextual digit substitution</i>. You can specify whether European digits are replaced with native equivalents by going to the <i>Region</i> control panel (formerly known as <i>Regional and Language Options</i>), clicking on the <i>Formats</i> tab, going to <i>Additional settings</i> (formerly known as <i>Customize this format</i>), and looking at the options under <i>Use native digits</i>. The three options there correspond to <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20120119031036/http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2005/09/09/462920.aspx"> the three values for <code>LOCAL_<wbr>IDIGIT<wbr>SUBSTITUTION</wbr></wbr></code></a>. </p>
<p> Programmatically, you can override the user preference (if you know that you are in a special case, like an IP address) by <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd317791%28v=vs.85%29.aspx"> following the instructions in MSDN</a>. </p>
<ul>
<li>Uniscribe: <code>Script&shy;Apply&shy;Digit&shy;Substitution</code> </li>
<li>DWrite: <code>IDWrite&shy;Text&shy;Analysis&shy;Sink::<wbr>Set&shy;Number&shy;Substitution</wbr></code> </li>
<li>GDI: <code>ETO_<wbr>NUMERICS&shy;LATIN</wbr></code> or     <code>ETO_<wbr>NUMERICS&shy;LOCAL</wbr></code>. </li>
</ul>
<p> As a last resort, you can stick a Unicode NODS (U+206F) at the beginning of the string to force European digits, or a <!-- A HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2011/05/12/10163685.aspx" --> Unicode NADS (U+206E) to force national digits. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: What's the point of contextual digit substitution anyway? </p>
<p> Suppose you have the string "there are 3 items remaining." (Let's say that all text in lowercase is in Arabic.) You want this 3 to be rendered in Arabic-Indic digits because it is part of an Arabic sentence. On the other hand, if you have the string "that's a really nice BMW 350." you want the 350 to be in European digits since it is part of the brand name "BMW 350". </p>
<p> Contextual digit substitution chooses whether to use Arabic-Indic digits or European digits by matching them to the characters that immediately precede them. (And if no character precedes them, then it uses the ambient language.) </p>

		<p>The Unicode standard says that U+206A through U+206F are deprecated and that their use is strongly discouraged. &nbsp;That&#39;s consistent with &quot;As a last resort&quot;, so the other 3 methods should definitely be preferred.</p>

		<p>The bonus chatter doesn&#39;t address why any number that is longer than a couple of digits doesn&#39;t get ENTIRELY left alone. That is, it&#39;s fine to convert a single digit, but for a longer string, is it that hard to leave the entire string in &quot;European digits&quot;?</p>

		<p>Is there such a thing as rendering hexadecimal numbers in national digits? =)</p>
<p>If Marco Polo had remembered that they write in the opposite direction and flipped the significance order when importing the system to Europe, maybe people wouldn&#39;t be so terribly confused by little-endian computer systems today. &nbsp;Little-endian really is more natural.</p>

		<p>I think any alteration of the string while rendering it violates the principle of least surprise. It would be more proper to require each string to be generated with the proper digits. To this end, there could either be an extra flag for %d, something like %Ld, or %d could work in the current locale by default.</p>
<p>This way, </p>
<p>&quot;there are %d items&quot;, 3 -&gt; &quot;there are ٣ items&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;This is a %s&quot;, &quot;BMW 350&quot; -&gt; &quot;This is a BMW 350&quot;</p>

		<p>Didn&#39;t you mean &quot;BMW350&quot;? because I honestly don&#39;t see how a computer can distinguish between &quot;This is a BMW 350&quot; and &quot;You have to add 350&quot;</p>

		<p>@Myria I don&#39;t usually write at a low enough level for endianness to matter at all, so I&#39;m shooting in the dark a bit here, but I can see at least why reason why little endian is worse than big endian. If you interpret a little-endian number at a memory location but with the wrong size (e.g. cast to a int32_t* instead of a int64_t*), then for small positive numbers you will read the correct result. Many numeric values are almost always small positive numbers, so this bug might slip through testing.</p>

		<p>@Sam: What I&#39;m talking about is the space between BMW and 350. As I understand, if there is a space before the number, local digits are used but if the number is directly appended to other characters the original digits are used.</p>
<p>The point is, that in his example, there is no difference between the 350 and the 3 (&#8211;&gt; So either it&#39;s a mistake in the example, or I didn&#39;t get the point)</p>

		<p>@Daniel: you understood wrong, it has nothing to do with spaces. Local digits are used when preceded by local script, &quot;European&quot; digits if preceded by latin characters. Look again at Sam&#39;s example to see how this looks when not written in English (so you can understand the sentences), but with a different script.</p>

		<p>I think the first glyph in the ٠١٢٣٤ABCDE67890 is actually an arabic 0 (i.e. what you have is 01234ABCDE67890). The 5 is ٥‎, so it should be ١٢٣٤٥‎AVCDE67890.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
