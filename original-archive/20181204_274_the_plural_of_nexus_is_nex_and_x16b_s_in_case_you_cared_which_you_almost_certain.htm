Nexus</a> is a trusted traveler program
operated jointly by the United States and Canada,
and in casual conversation, the word Nexus is often
used to refer to the Nexus card itself.
</p>
<p>
One of my college classmates
visited relatives who lived in a state along the Canada/US border,
and they made a road trip to Canada.
Everybody in the car was a member of the Nexus program
except for my classmate.
During the conversation, he had need to pluralize
the term Nexus,
which raised the question:
What is the plural of Nexus?
Is it second declension: Nex&#x12b;?
Or third declension: Nexera?
</p>
<p>
Note that this is a question that is raised
only by Latin and grammar nerds.
</p>
<p>
Let's hear it for the Latin and grammar nerds!
</p>
<p>
Unlike many Latin-sounding brand names,
<a HREF="http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0059%3Aentry%3Dnexus2">
<i LANG=la>nexus</i></a>
is an actual Latin word,
meaning "binding together".
And it is fourth declension:
The plural is
<i LANG=la>nex&#x16b;s</i>,
pronounced as "nexoos".
(At least, that's what I gathered from the Latin nerds.)
</p>
<p>
The Nexus program is an outlier in the cost/benefit graph
of
<a HREF="https://www.dhs.gov/trusted-traveler-programs-comparison-chart">

<p>
The listed benefits are cumulative as you go up the <var>y</var>-axis,
and the prices along the <var>x</var>-axis increase as the benefits increase,
except for Nexus, which grants more benefits than
Global Entry despite costing less than even TSA Pre&#x2713;.
Furthermore, Nexus has no application fee for those under age 18.
</p>
<p>
Nexus is clearly the sweet spot in the graph.
Why?
I'm not sure,
but I'm not complaining.
</p>
<p>
The complications for Nexus are that the approval process takes
longer, since you need to pass background checks by both
United States and Canadian authorities,
and interview locations are available only near the Canada/US border.
But if you are okay with those constraints,
the choice is pretty clear.
</p>
<p>
When my family travels across the Canada/US border in the Nexus
lane, we play a game:
As we approach the border, we pick a vehicle in the
general lanes,
and we see if our car can clear the border
before the other vehicle does.
</p>
<p>
We have yet to lose.
Even if we pick a car that is only a few lengths from the border
as we approach, we still end up winning.
</p>
<p>
In one of the early instances of this game,
after the border officer cleared us to enter,
my young daughter exclaimed, "We did it!"
That strikes me as a rather suspicious thing to say
immediately after a border officer lets you across.
I had to caution my kids not to get too excited about
winning the game.
</p>
<p>
&sup1;
The total benefits are not strictly cumulative, however.
Most of the Trusted Traveler programs are operated solely
by the United States, but
Nexus is jointly operated with Canada,
which means that you get
Canadian benefits, too:
faster land, sea, and air entry into Canada.
But that just makes the sweet spot even sweeter,
especially if you take advantage of

		<p>Just in case you care&#8230; (which you almost certainly don’t)<br />
It depends on which language you are speaking. Latin is a dead language. While many people study Latin, including myself, there are no more native Latin speakers. They died out many centuries ago.<br />
Latin (among other languages) influenced English. Many words were borrowed from Latin to become new English words.<br />
As an English word, native speakers know the plural of &#8220;nexus&#8221; and need not be taught it.<br />
For non-native English speakers (such as centuries-dead native Latin speakers), they can look in any old dictionary.<br />
Such as here: <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nexus" rel="nofollow">https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/nexus</a><br />
There they can determine that the plural of the English word nexus is &#8220;nexuses&#8221; or &#8220;nexus&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Hello, a Latin nerd here!<br />
You&#8217;re quite right about the plural of nexus in Latin being nexūs, pronounced &#8220;nexoos&#8221;. The horizontal accent above the &#8220;u&#8221; means the vowel is &#8220;long&#8221;, so it&#8217;s pronounced like the &#8220;u&#8221; in &#8220;user&#8221; and not the short &#8220;u&#8221; in &#8220;us&#8221;. The Romans didn&#8217;t actually use these accents &#8211; they are there for us know how words were pronounced (it&#8217;s particularly important in poetry.</p>
<p>As for virus, the Latin plural is in fact viri because virus is a &#8220;2nd declension&#8221; noun. That basically governs the rules of how it is spelled, as opposed to nexus which is a 4th declension noun, so different spelling rules. Most words ending in -us are 2nd declension &#8211; 4th declension nouns are fairly rare. </p>
<p>As to how you want to spell these things in English, ignore all the Latin stuff! It&#8217;s people trying to apply Latin rules to English that have led to madness like saying split infinitives are wrong, which is complete nonsense. So nexuses and viruses are perfectly fine.</p>

		<p>And there is also a fact about Latin word &#8220;virus&#8221; that it was an uncountable noun, so the plural for it didn&#8217;t, strictly speaking, exist at all.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s an unusual in being a second (or possibly fourth) declension -us neuter noun though, and there is no classically attested plural.<br />

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
