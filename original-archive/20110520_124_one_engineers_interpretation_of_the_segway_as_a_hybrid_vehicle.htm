<p>In a discussion of commuting options (in which I was primarily an observer), the following exchange took place:</p>
<p> A: I would rather get kicked in the shins every morning than bike up the <a href="http://www.bicycleclimbs.com/ClimbDetail.Aspx?ClimbID=17"> massive hill</a> that sits between my apartment and main campus. </p>
<p> B: Have you tried an electric bike? </p>
<p> C: If you're going to eliminate pedaling, then you may as well go all the way and get a Segway. </p>
<p> B: Actually, I used to own a Segway. I was floored by the engineering achievement of creating a device that combined the speed benefits of walking with the exercise benefits of driving, and for <i>just</i> the cost of a used Honda! </p>
<p> Note, of course, that this is just one engineer's opinion. Some people at Microsoft are <a href="http://microsoftjobsblog.com/blog/the-golden-helmet/"> quite enamored of the Segway device</a>. </p>
<p> <b>Public Service Announcement</b>: Today is Bike to Work Day. A number of <a href="http://www.cbcef.org/btw/btw_stations.html"> commute stations</a> will be set up along popular bike routes in the greater Seattle area to hand out bicycling information and snacks. And if you pass a guy creeping up the 520 hill at around 8:00am, that was probably me. Sorry I forgot to wave. </p>

		<p>Every day is Bike to Work Day! &nbsp;I even bike FROM work as well.</p>
<p>20 minutes of Spanish sunshine &#8212; or torrential rain, in the winter months &#8212; each day whilst cycling is great for the soul AND the waistline.</p>

		<p>E-Mail in the form of the telegraph did exist before the telephone.</p>
<p>Imagine a world where every child was taught Morse code instead of typing and each home had a telegraph station. Teens would wear out their fingers using their battery-powered portable telegraph to chat with friends.</p>

		<p>David Walker, I refer you to the book &quot;Peopleware&quot; by deMarco and Lister &#8211; Chapter 11 The Telephone.</p>
<p>&quot;And that&#39;s the beauty of the BellOPhone,&quot; says A.G. &quot;It never gives you the chance to wonder whether to answer it or not.&quot;</p>

		<p>Huh&#8230; TIL that Bike to Work Day/Week is different in different parts of the country. It was last Thursday in the SF Bay Area.</p>
<p>But really, every day should be Bike to Work Day! &lt;/zealot&gt;</p>

		<p>That&#39;s funny! &nbsp;The speed benefits of walking with the exercise benefits of driving&#8230;.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t help but believe that if e-mail was invented first, and the telphone later, that the telephone would be considered quite revolutionary. &nbsp;You can talk to someone *in real time*!</p>

		<p>Telegraphs have a pile of codewords actually, plus shortenings and abbreviations that make it similar to texting.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s teens would probably love a Morse texter though &#8211; imaging texting without having to look at the screen &#8211; just use the key in their pocket to text away discreetly. Responses also need not be read, but the phone can vibrate instead. They can send all their texts without anyone knowing. Perfect.</p>

		<p>&gt;Teens would wear out their fingers using their battery-powered portable telegraph to chat with friends.</p>
<p>And on a noisy night, it would give meaning to the question, what the *beep* is going on in there?</p>

		<p>Re texting without looking, and getting the results as vibrations: &nbsp;Eventually we&#39;ll have implantable electrodes to allow communication with other people. &nbsp;I hope we get to control who can listen to our thoughts&#8230; &nbsp;Yay, a whole new morass of privacy settings to deal with!</p>

		<p>Oh, I forgot to mention: the electrodes will allow unwanted ads coming directly into our brains, unless we buy an ad-blocker.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
