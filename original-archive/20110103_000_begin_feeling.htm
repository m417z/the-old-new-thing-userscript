<p> A few years ago, the gas station near Microsoft's main campus (the one which had been <a href="http://jobsblog.com/blog/zeke/"> run by my colleague</a> in a previous stage of his career) appeared to have suffered some problems with the LCD unit on one of its pumps. Instead of "Please insert card", it said "<a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Wosld-Besu-Saodwici.aspx">@leace incebd cabd</a>". As a geek, I quickly determined that bit 4 got wiped out in the ASCII codes for the characters in the message. Undaunted, I set about going through the usual steps for purchasing gasoline, though it took a little longer than normal because I first had to decode the corrupted strings. And then after I thought I had finished all the necessary preliminaries, the panel said, "Begin Feeling".</p>

		<p>That&#39;s some slick inference there. It would have taken me a lot longer to figure out what was causing the strings to be garbled in just that way.</p>

		<p>For those who were initially confused: Raymond is counting bits from the most significant side, not the least significant. &nbsp;It&#39;s &amp; ~0x10, not &amp; ~0x08 as I initially assumed he meant.</p>
<p>For those who didn&#39;t immediately get what turned into &quot;Begin Feeling&quot;: &#39;e&#39; is 0x65, while &#39;u&#39; is 0x75. &nbsp;Presumably it was &quot;Begin Fueling&quot;.</p>
<p>For Raymond: kudos, I&#39;d have never figured that out.</p>
<p>Now, what kind of bug would cause the fourth-most-significant bit to be cleared . . . ? &nbsp;I&#39;m just not creative enough to figure it out.</p>

		<p>@Aryeh Gregor:</p>
<p>No, Raymond is counting bits from the least significant, but he starts counting from bit 0, as any self-respecting geek would do, not bit 1.</p>

		<p>A broken ribbon cable between the lcd panel and the main control board seems plausible. &nbsp;The ribbon cable would bend every time the front panel was opened to add receipt paper, and one of the data lines could eventually sever.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of the time I was handed an old PC to see if I could make it useful again.</p>
<p>When I turned it on, it said &quot;DICK BOOD FAILEBE&quot;. On this occasion I recommended disposing of it since it was clearly hardware-sick as well as software-sick.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
