<p>Adrian McCarthy asks, "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#654530">Can you create an information context for the display?</a> ... I can call CreateDC("DISPLAY"), but perhaps that wouldn't generalize for a multiple-monitor display with different settings on each screen. I'm trying to avoid constantly creating and destroying DCs when all I need to do is measure strings, check color depth, dpi, etc."</p>
<p> I admire the effort of trying to avoid creating a whole DC when all you want is to perform some inquiries. Some inquiries are monitor-independent, like getting the DPI or measuring strings, so you can just use <code>GetDC(NULL)</code> to get a temporary DC. This is cheaper than a full-on <code>CreateDC</code> since <code>GetDC</code> goes through <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/06/01/612970.aspx"> the DC cache</a>, so you're just grabbing a DC out of the cache temporarily, doing a little computation, and then returning it to the cache (with <code>ReleaseDC</code>). </p>
<p> If you are doing something that is monitor-specific, like getting its color depth, you can <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms534598.aspx"> call <code>EnumDisplayMonitors</code> on the desktop DC</a> to look at each monitor. </p>
<p> (And just for completeness, to get the name for a specific monitor if you really do want to create an IC for it, call <code>GetMonitorInfo</code> with a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms534807.aspx"> MONITORINFOEX</a> and look at the <code>szDevice</code> member.) </p>
<p> <b>Update</b>: Original text said "DC" in the last sentence by mistake. </p>

		<p>&#8230; and the answer to the original question is? &nbsp;I get the impression of &#8220;no, but it doesn&#8217;t matter because you can GetDC cheaper&#8221; but a straight answer would be nice.</p>

		<p>MSDN states that ICs are somehow more efficient than DCs:</p>

<p>Presumably the overhead of creating certain structures was significant a long time ago. How relevant is the distinction in more recent Windows versions (&gt;= Win2K)?</p>

<p>Wouldn&#8217;t faster hardware have made more impact than the version of windows?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure you can maintain the same quality of experience for the user by soaking up any advantages from faster hardware by inefficient programming.</p>

		<p>Actual dots per inch has always been monitor dependent.</p>
<p>Windows is still working on getting its software DPI to agree with the real thing.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure Windows will get there in another two or three versions.</p>

		<p>&quot;Software DPI&quot; and the real thing will probably never match. &nbsp;Nor does it make a lot of sense for them to do so for many devices. &nbsp;An obvious case is a projector screen where physical dpi depends on the somewhat random distance between the projector and whatever it&#8217;s projecting onto.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a poorly named UI scaling factor.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m wondering how this extends to .NET. &nbsp;Will Graphics.FromHdc(IntPtr.Zero) perform a similar function? &nbsp;Or would one have to use interop to actually create the DC via GetDC(0) and use that as the handle? &nbsp;Or would neither of those work?</p>
<p>(I tried looking it up, but I don&#8217;t see anything interesting in the Graphics class documentation)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
