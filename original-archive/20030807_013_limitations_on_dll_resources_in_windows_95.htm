<p>         Ancient history lesson.      </p>
<p>         When Win9x loads a 32-bit DLL, it creates a shadow 16-bit DLL so 16-bit code (like         USER) can access resources in it.      </p>
<p>         The shadow DLL is effectively a resource-only 16-bit DLL, created by taking the 32-bit         resources and converting them to 16-bit format. If the resources cannot be converted         to 16-bit format, the DLL will not load.      </p>
</p>
<p>         The 16-bit resource file format specifies resource sizes by combining a DLL-wide shift         value with a 16-bit per-resource scaled size. So, for example, if the shift value         were 2, and the per-resource scaled size were 8, then the actual resource size would         be 8 &lt;&lt; 2 = 32.      </p>
<p>         Windows 95 has a bug in the way it calculates the scaled size.      </p>
<p>         If the Windows 95 kernel decided that it needed to use a nonzero shift value because         the 32-bit DLL contains a resource larger than 64K, it scaled the 32-bit values down         to 16-bit values and rounded <em>down</em> rather than up. So, for example, if a resources         were 65537 bytes in size and the shift factor were 1, then the scaled-down value would         be 65537 &gt;&gt; 1 = 32768. After scaling back up, the result would be 32768 &gt;&gt;         1 = 65536. Notice that the value is too small; the last byte of the resource has been         truncated.      </p>
<p>         Consequently, if you have a 32-bit DLL with resources 64K or larger, you must pad         those resources to prevent this truncation from happening. In the above example, you         would have to pad the resource to 65538 bytes, so that the scaled-down value would         be 32769, which scales back up to 65538.      </p>
<p>         I believe this bug was fixed in Windows 98 but I'm not sure. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=http://support.microsoft.com:80/support/kb/articles/Q182/8/19.ASP&amp;NoWebContent=1">There         is a little program in the SDK called fixres95 that generates the necessary padding</a>.      </p>
<p>         Other limitations of the 16-bit resource file format you may run into:      </p>
<ul>
<li>             <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;137248">Ordinal resource             identifiers may not exceed 32767</a>.          </li>
<li>             The total lengths of named resources may not exceed 65535 (where each name counts             one byte for each character in the name, plus one). Named resources have been a bad             idea since Windows 1.0. They are a convenience that you can easily live without most             of the time, and they are significantly more costly, as you can see.          </li>

		<p>One of the first things I learned in programming (in high school using Turbo Pascal) was that Integers (at the time) could have a value from -32768 to 32767&#8230;thanks for the flashback and interesting history lesson&#8230;most enjoyed!  :)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
