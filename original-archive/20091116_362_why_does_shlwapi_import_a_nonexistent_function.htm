<p>Commenter charless asks <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#681765"> why shlwapi.dll imports a nonexistent function from mpr.dll</a>, which shows up in dependency tools as a broken import.</p>
<p> Because that function did exist at one point, although it doesn't exist any more. </p>
<p> The function in question was available only on Windows&nbsp;95-series versions of Windows. It never existed on Windows&nbsp;NT or any of its successors. But remember that <code>shlwapi.dll</code> was originally developed for Internet Explorer, which ran on Windows&nbsp;95 as well as Windows&nbsp;NT. Internet Explorer checked the operating system and called the Windows&nbsp;95-only function only after verifying that it was running on Windows&nbsp;95. If it was running on Windows&nbsp;NT, then it never called the function and therefore never stepped on the land mine known as <code>ERROR_PROC_NOT_FOUND</code>. </p>
<p> Okay, so why does <code>shlwapi</code> still link to the function long after the Windows&nbsp;95 series of operating systems have become obsolete? </p>
<p> Removing a function, even a function that doesn't do anything, even an <i>undocumented</i> function that doesn't do anything, is a dangerous endeavor. Suppose you have a program that links to the function, but just like Internet Explorer, it is clever and checks whether it is running on Windows&nbsp;NT before calling it. If you remove the useless function from <code>shlwapi</code>, then that program will <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/16/54938.aspx"> fail to load</a>, even though it never calls the offending function, and now you have an application compatibility problem on your hands. </p>
<p> Since it's a small function that doesn't do anything, it's a lot less risky simply to leave the function in. </p>
<p> Even though it doesn't do anything except fail. </p>

		<p>@M&#233;dinoc, Gabe:</p>
<p>Removing the call to the non-existent function would break software that needs to be able to use the function when running on Win95. I am not sure whether this is still a valid concern at this point.</p>

		<p>@Medinoc &#8211; Im my experience filing bugs for several products at Microsoft, the main questions when considering hot fixes are:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the problem you are fixing?</li>
<li>
<p>What is the impact of the problem?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the cost of the fix?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the risk of this code change?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you think through those questions as they relate to this scenario, the average dev team would reject the fix request.</p>

		<p>I think simply because nobody cares. The cost of &quot;developing&quot; and testing the emptiness of the method is much more costly than leaving it in.</p>

		<p>&quot;The import is runtime-generated via GetProcAddress, but there are tools which know how to decode the delay-load information&quot;</p>
<p>Okay, so shlwapi is actually doing the Right Thing for calling a foreign function that may or may not exist. And dependency tools choose to report that as a &quot;broken import&quot; just because they find themselves running in an environment where the function in fact doesn&#8217;t exist (which is one of the two cases that one must assume that code using GetProcAddress will know how to handle)?</p>
<p>I&#8217;d call those dependency tools &quot;broken&quot; instead.</p>

<p>But if you can&#8217;t even remove a function that is undocumented, doesn&#8217;t do a thing and is only used by a few misbehaving applications, what /can/ you actually remove or change when building the next version of Windows ? Do you just add code and leave the old in ? Is anything ever deprecated ? When /are/ you allowed to &#8216;break&#8217; stuff ?</p>

		<p>Henning Makholm: And how can a dependency tool tell the difference between running on a platform where the function doesn&#8217;t exist (by design) and running on a platform where the DLL is broken? &nbsp;Are you advocating that all missing delay load dependencies be ignored? &nbsp;THAT design would be broken.</p>

		<p>Shlwapi should never have been exposed to the ISVs in the first place. At least, it should have been went through through interface design review. If I remember correctly, its interfaces were published as a result of anti-trust lawsuit, which is a shame. All those Path* functions lacking &quot;buffer size&quot; argument make me want to puke.</p>

		<p>As usual, a timely post.</p>
<p>I spent Thursday and Friday in DLL Hell, trying to find a tool that could explain why XP failed to load a particular executable. &nbsp;The only problem indicated by depends.exe was this shlwapi issue. &nbsp;I lost a couple hours chasing that red herring.</p>
<p>The actual problem was a side-by-side version mismatch. &nbsp;Unfortunately depends.exe doesn&#8217;t understand side-by-side.</p>

		<p>Now I&#8217;m going to ask the only slightly less stupid question before anyone does it without hanging a lampshade on it:</p>
<p>Why has this function in shlwapi not been replaced with a stub that *doesn&#8217;t* reference the imported function?</p>
<p>(I feel that the answer is of the style of &quot;if it ain&#8217;t broke, don&#8217;t fix it&quot;).</p>

		<p>According to the documentation, the only argument with a Unicode concern is the volume name:</p>
<p>Pointer to a null-terminated Unicode string that specifies the local name of the drive to connect to, such as &quot;Z:&quot;. If this parameter is NULL, the function reconnects all persistent drives stored in the registry for the current user.</p>
<p>(documentation from the wide version of the function)</p>
<p>So why was this particular design chosen, a wide function on NT and an ansi function on 9x?</p>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t they do what they normally do with functions like this, having both available and working on NT, and the wide version either working on 9x or supported by MSLU, or even only an ansi version?</p>
<p>Given that since the parameter is a drive letter or NULL neither solution would have posed problems and both would have allowed developers to call the function in a platform agnostic manner.</p>
<blockquote><p>

<p>If true, that is another fine example that lawyers can&#8217;t code and shouldn&#8217;t be able to force their broken code upon us.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m afraid if the modern version of shlwapi.dll is installed on Win95, this import from mpr.dll will be the least of the user&#8217;s problems ;) It probably was not tested for Win95 for a long time, and this means things will break.</p>

		<p>ok, so another &quot;I&#8217;m ignorant on the exact workings&quot;-question:</p>
<p>if removing the reference is so costly why not adding the missing function in mpc.dll as a do-nothing stub?</p>
<p>Sure, that *could* shuffle bytes around etc showing some bugs not otherwise seen, but when doing major testing for a new windows version anyhow, this shouldn&#8217;t be a major problem, right?</p>

		<p>&quot;Windows 95-series&quot;</p>
<p>Are you confusing Win95 with Win9x, which also include 98 and Me?</p>

		<p>After reading this another time, no you aren&#8217;t, but I think &quot;Win9x-series&quot; would still be better.</p>

		<p>&quot;Okay, so why does shlwapi still link to the function long after the Windows 95 series of operating systems have become obsolete? &quot;</p>
<p>Seems that the Vista version of shlwapi finally got rid of this import.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;&gt; All those Path* functions lacking &quot;buffer size&quot; argument make me want to puke.</p>
<p>&gt; It&#8217;s almost as if MAX_PATH had never been defined&#8230;.</p>
<p>Yeah, MAX_PATH and the Path* functions are responsible for the hoards of apps out there that can&#8217;t handle file paths longer than 255 characters.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
