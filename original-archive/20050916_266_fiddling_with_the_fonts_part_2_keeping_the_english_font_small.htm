<p>
We concluded last time that we wanted the custom large font to
apply only to the columns containing Chinese characters and
leave the original font in place for the English columns.
We do this by carrying two fonts around, choosing the appropriate
one for each column.
</p>
<pre>
class RootWindow : public Window
{
 ...
private:
 HWND m_hwndLV;
 HWND m_hwndEdit;
 HWND m_hwndLastFocus;
 HFONT m_hfChinese;
 <font COLOR=blue>HFONT m_hfNormal;</font>
 int  m_cyEdit;
 ...
}

RootWindow::RootWindow()
 : m_hfChinese(NULL)
 <font COLOR=blue>, m_hfNormal(NULL)</font>
{
}

RootWindow::~RootWindow()
{
 if (m_hfChinese) DeleteObject(m_hfChinese);
 <font COLOR=blue>if (m_hfNormal) DeleteObject(m_hfNormal);</font>
}

LRESULT RootWindow::OnCreate()
{
 ...
 ListView_SetExtendedListViewStyleEx(m_hwndLV,
                                     LVS_EX_FULLROWSELECT,
                                     LVS_EX_FULLROWSELECT);

 LOGFONT lf;
 if (!GetObject(GetWindowFont(m_hwndLV), sizeof(lf), &amp;lf)) {
  return -1;
 }
 <font COLOR=blue>m_hfNormal = CreateFontIndirect(&amp;lf);
 if (!m_hfNormal) return -1;</font>
 lf.lfHeight += lf.lfHeight / 2; // 50% bigger
 m_hfChinese = CreateFontIndirect(&lf);
 if (!m_hfChinese) return -1;
 SetWindowFont(m_hwndLV, m_hfChinese, FALSE);</font>
 ...
}
</pre>
<p>
Before we change the default font for the list view to the
Chinese font, we create a copy of the original font
(which we rather presumptuously call "normal") for safekeeping.
Next, when the list view asks us to customize a column,
we select the appropriate font and return the "I also changed the
font" code.
</p>
<pre>
LRESULT RootWindow::OnLVCustomDraw(NMLVCUSTOMDRAW* pcd)
{
 ...
 case CDDS_ITEMPREPAINT | CDDS_SUBITEM:
  pcd->clrText = m_clrTextNormal;
  if (pcd->iSubItem == COL_SIMP &&
    pcd->nmcd.dwItemSpec < (DWORD)Length()) {
    const DictionaryEntry& de = Item(pcd->nmcd.dwItemSpec);
    if (de.m_pszSimp) {
      pcd->clrText = RGB(0x80, 0x00, 0x00);
    }
  }
  <font COLOR=blue><strike>// break;</strike>
  if (pcd-&gt;iSubItem == COL_TRAD || pcd->iSubItem == COL_SIMP) {
    SelectFont(pcd-&gt;nmcd.hdc, m_hfChinese);
  } else {
    SelectFont(pcd-&gt;nmcd.hdc, m_hfNormal);
  }
  return CDRF_NEWFONT;</font>
 ...
}
</pre>
<p>
There are several important details here.
</p>
<p>
First, we set the Chinese font as the
"overall" font for the list view.
It would have been easier for us not to do this;
after all, since we explicitly set the font for each column,
why does it matter what the default font is?
It also would have removed the need to create a copy of the original
font.
But if you delete the <code>SetWindowFont(m_hwndLV, m_hfChinese);</code>
line,
the bottoms of the Chinese characters get cut off.
The reason is that the list view uses the default font to decide
what the line spacing should be.
Therefore, the default font for the list view needs to be the
largest font we intend to use for any column.
</p>
<p>
Why does the list view use the default font to decide on the line
spacing?
Because it's not clairevoyant.
That's the only font it has, after all.
It doesn't know what font you're going to select in your
<code>CDDS_ITEMPREPAINT | CDDS_SUBITEM</code> notification handler.
All it has is the font you set with <code>SetWindowFont</code>.
</p>
<p>
Another important detail is that once we have decided to use
different fonts for different columns, we are committed to selecting
a font for <strong>all</strong> columns.
The reason for this was discussed when we discussed
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/07/13/438381.aspx">
how to colorize the columns</a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally, there is the important detail of returning the
<code>CDRF_NEWFONT</code> value when we change the font.
For performance reasons, the list view assumes you aren't
changing the font on a subitem-by-subitem basis
(since very few list views do) and it caches many font
properties to avoid having to recalculate them all the time.
Returning
<code>CDRF_NEWFONT</code> indicates that the list view should
look at the font you selected and base its computations on that font
instead.
</p>
<p>
Since boldface, italics and underline are font attributes,
you can use this "select a custom font" technique to make
selected items display as boldface, italics, or underline,
in addition to using it to change the font size as we did here.
</p>
<p>
That's all for this month.
Next month will be a rather boring one,
adding a status bar to make the Chinese characters even more
readable.
After that, we'll enhance the dictionary lookup algorithm,
which is itself groundwork for dynamic translation, as I may
have alluded to in a previous entry.

		<p>In general is quite bad idea to hard-code font sizes/attributes.<br />
<br />Imagine someone will localize this application into Japanese. The Japanese column with have a smaller font than the Chinese one. BAD!</p>
<p>Same problem with other attributes (bold, italic, underscore).<br />
<br />Imagine italic-underscored Japanese, or Arabic.<br /></p>

<p>(I have no idea why someone in the MSDN documentation group thinks that article should be &quot;archived&quot; because it&#8217;s not &quot;relevant content.&quot;  Read it now before it gets even harder to find.)</p>
<p>My impression is that it&#8217;s not hard to port applications so long as they don&#8217;t make the mistake of thinking fork, signals, pthreads, shells, or X should ever be used.  I&#8217;ve been porting math libraries from Unix to Windows for the last few years.</p>

		<p>With mingw32, cygwin and similar tools you can easily port applications using fork. There is also a pthread&lt;-&gt;native threads wrapper around somewhere (so pthreads are actually very portable). If the app uses GTK or Qt you are lucky on the GUI side (there is an implementation for windows) don&#8217;t know for other toolkits. For the rest you&#8217;ll have to port most function calls by hand :)</p>

		<p>This article and several others call a function SetWindowFont().  I tried looking for where this function or method was defined in the scratch program or new scratch program or dictionary program or dialog box example, but couldn&#8217;t find it.</p>
<p>Now in the MSDN page at<br />

<br />one of the examples (you&#8217;ll have to unhide it to see it) also calls SetWindowFont().</p>
<p>Is SetWindowFont a Win32 API?  Is it documented somewhere?</p>

<p>Thank you.  I have a feeling of deja vu about that answer, and wonder if I might have asked the exact same question before.  Which segues into the answer for my other question:</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; Is it documented somewhere?</p>
<p>Sounds like the answer&#8217;s no.  Well, we know how the owner of this blog will scream and pounce on anyone who uses undocumented functions &#8212; especially when he sees someone post programs in blogs calling undocumented functions.  Now waiting to see how that bloodbath will turn out ^u^</p>

		<p>Since it&#8217;s just a bunch of macros, the file is self-documenting. If you want to see what a macro does, you can read it directly.

<br />&gt; Since it&#8217;s just a bunch of macros, the file<br />
<br />&gt; is self-documenting.</p>
<p>The file self-documents what this version of the file does until the next Visual Studio service pack or (theoretically possible) Windows Update.  It doesn&#8217;t document whether users are supposed to allow themselves to depend on it.</p>
<p>A few months ago I read that a header file in the DDK declared some functions but driver programmers weren&#8217;t supposed to call those functions.  The header file self-documented itself but didn&#8217;t document that it had a mistake in itself.</p>
<p>More recently I&#8217;ve had a couple of disputes with your colleagues because ntddk.h and wdm.h export definitions of TCHAR and a few related identifiers (indirectly from ntdef.h but nonetheless doing it).  Your colleagues say that driver programmers should know not to use these identifiers in kernel mode, but these self-documenting header files do not say so, and the writer of some code that I saw obviously had an inadequate level of clairvoyance.  The MSDN pages say even less (e.g., which primitive C functions are allowed to be called in kernel mode and which aren&#8217;t, near-zero documentation).  A self-documenting header file is no substitute for an MSDN page.</p>
<p>&gt; There&#8217;s also a copy of the original<br />
<br />&gt; documentation here<br />
<br />&gt; <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://community.borland.com/article/0,1410,17542,00.html" rel="nofollow">http://community.borland.com/article/0,1410,17542,00.html</a> </p>
<p>Thank you.  I plan to read it a bit more fully on the weekend.  Meanwhile, are other Borland documents for 3.1 also suitable for determining what identifiers we should and shouldn&#8217;t use on Windows XP?  Why don&#8217;t Visual Studio and DDKs come with pointers to such relevant documents?  And when we do rely on them, will you be happy to do the appcompat work to keep the results running?</p>

<br />&gt; documentation from MSDN was a mistake.</p>
<p>Oh, I didn&#8217;t know it used to be there, and I wonder why you didn&#8217;t say so earlier.  Now knowing that, it&#8217;s nice to reach an agreement &#8230; at least partially.</p>
<p>Hmm, what kind of mistake?  If it was a slip of the fingers of some typist, then surely it will only take a few years for MSDN to correct the error.  But if it was a deliberate exercise of poor judgement, then we should not expect a correction.  If it&#8217;s the latter case, then I&#8217;m still left thinking that authors of new code aren&#8217;t supposed to use it.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
