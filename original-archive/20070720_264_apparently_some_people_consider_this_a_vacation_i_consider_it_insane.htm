<p>One of the little cards that came in the <a href="http://www.cascade.org/EandR/stp/">STP</a> information packet is an advertisement postcard for <a href="http://rei.com/adventures/trips/europe/ecf.jsp"> Epic Cycling Climbs of France</a>. For $3299 (+airfare) you receive the "privilege" of cycling up the Alpe d'Huez and other notorious mountains.</p>
<p> I'm sorry. If I'm going to go up l'Alpe D'Huez you're going to have to pay me, not the other way around. </p>
<p> (Then again, I paid to ride my bicycle from Seattle to Portland, so obviously I'm a little insane already. I've already taken the first steps in <a href="http://riderx.info/blogs/riderx/archive/2007/06/29/progressive-insanity.aspx"> progressive insanity</a>; maybe they were just showing me where I was headed if I didn't watch my step. Sort of like those anti-smoking ads.) </p>

		<p>Several years a friend of mine did this &quot;holiday&quot;. He completed the ride. Several others succumbed to heatstroke, while others suffered mild hypothermia. Since he is a friend, he I could not describe him as insane; but he his eccentricity has passed the mild category.</p>

<p>(Those anti-smoking ads are useless. Every time I see one, I end up having a smoke within minutes, just on principle that I&#8217;m not going to be told what to do. If I want to die a painful and stinky death, I will, damn it!!!)</p>

<p>This tour thing&#8230; &nbsp;What do you get for $3299, exactly? &nbsp;Food and guides? &nbsp;Why is this so expensive for something you can just do yourself?</p>

		<p>Hmm&#8230; I just took a similar trip through the Pyrenees: 7 days, 500mi, 50000&#8242; of climbing. I guess you&#8217;ll be coming after me in the white coat.</p>
<p>But it was a great trip, if strenuous. Good food (yes, that&#8217;s what you pay for) and scenery&#8211; and descents! I think the best part was it gave me an incentive to do some serious riding beforehand to get in shape.</p>
<p>Now I get to watch the Tour as they go over some of the same roads and make it look easy. (We saw both Vinokourov and Sastre out training.)</p>

<li>
<p>There are worse things than the alpe, like some of the offroad stuff.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I&#8217;m planning on going up there with a 5 year old on the tagalong to make it harder. The worst part is his centre of gravity pulls you off on the bends.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>that is a very expensive option. I&#8217;d expect to spend 50-80 euros/day; If you spend more you are eating too much and putting on more weight than you burn.</p>
</li>

		<p>I look at it the other way: when I go vacationing in France, I would definitely take my bike and ride some of the epic mountain stages. &nbsp;One to see how good I am, and two to soak in the ambiance of &nbsp;a TdF stage.</p>

<p>Hotel accommodations; Eddy Merckx CHM carbon frame road bike; 8 breakfasts, 5 lunches and 6 dinners; expert guide/leadership; vehicle support and luggage transportation.</p>
<p>Sounds like normal traveling package plus a new bike, minus the air and train tickets.</p>

		<p>Don&#8217;t be a baby about it:) &nbsp;Hill are your friend, they just want to help you be a better rider!</p>
<p>Are you watching the Tour de France on TV now? &nbsp;The action is great.</p>

		<p>Do they also include the anabolic steroids, testosterone injections, blood doping, etc. for that price? So you can really get into the spirit of Le Tour.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t mean to be funny, but this holiday is for wimps. &nbsp;It&#8217;s only a single climb each day, rides between 40 and 60 miles. &nbsp;Piece of cake to any club cyclist. &nbsp;Indeed any decent club cyclist would want to do a lot more. &nbsp;Also these alpine climbs are really easy since the gradients are so low, 6-10%. &nbsp;Ok they go on for a long time but you can just spin up them with no real effort.</p>
<p>Now, it&#8217;s much more challenging to do 2 or even 3 of these cols in a day&#8230;..</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
