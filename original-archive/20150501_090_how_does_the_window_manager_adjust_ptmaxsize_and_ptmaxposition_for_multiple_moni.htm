<p>There is a note down in the documentation for <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632605(v=vs.85).aspx"> the <code>MIN&shy;MAX&shy;INFO</code> structure</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> For systems with multiple monitors, the <b>ptMaxSize</b> and <b>ptMaxPosition</b> members describe the maximized size and position of the window on the primary monitor, even if the window ultimately maximizes onto a secondary monitor. In that case, the window manager adjusts these values to compensate for differences between the primary monitor and the monitor that displays the window. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> People ask about the nature of this "compensation" and how they should deal with it. </p>
<p> When the window manager sends the <code>WM_<wbr>GET&shy;MIN&shy;MAX&shy;INFO</wbr></code> message to a top-level window, the <code>MIN&shy;MAX&shy;INFO</code> structure comes preinitialized with the following information: </p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="black" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<th>Member</th>
<th>Initialized To</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>ptMaxSize</b></td>
<td>The dimensions of the primary monitor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>ptMaxPosition</b></td>
<td>The upper left corner of the window if it were     maximized on the primary monitor.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>ptMinTrackSize</b></td>
<td>The minimum size the user can resize the window.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>ptMaxTrackSize</b></td>
<td>The maximum size the user can resize the window         (the union of all monitors, basically).</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> Two of these values are monitor-relative and are therefore subject to adjustment. </p>
<p> <b>ptMax&shy;Position</b> is easy. The point is moved to a corresponding relative position on the window's actual monitor. </p>
<p> <b>ptMax&shy;Size</b> is trickier. If the specified size is greater than or equal to the size of the primary monitor, then the <b>ptMax&shy;Size</b> is adjusted to include the difference in size between the primary monitor and the actual monitor. In other words, if <b>ptMax&shy;Size</b> is 20 pixels larger than the primary monitor, then it will be adjusted to being 20 pixels larger than the actual monitor. But if <b>ptMax&shy;Size</b> does not completely cover the monitor, then its value is used as-is. </p>
<p> That is what the documentation is referring to when it says "In that case." The case is "if the window ultimately maximizes onto a secondary monitor." </p>
<p> There is a bit of a gotcha here: If your window is larger than the screen in one direction but not another. For example, you may have a narrow maximum width but a tall maximum height. (Think console windows.) In that case, you will need to use <code>Monitor&shy;From&shy;Window</code> to get the parameters for the actual monitor so you can set your maximum height appropriately. </p>
<p> We'll dig a little deeper into this gotcha next time. </p>

		<p>What I used to hate about WM_GETMINMAXINFO is that it was sent very early on in the window creation process when I didn&#39;t actually know much about my window, let alone how small or big I was prepared to let it be.</p>
<p>And of course the other problem is that the region of allowable dimensions is nonrectangular, for example the maximum height or width might be 256 but only one dimension can exceed 240 at a time, except for the square of size 241.</p>
<p>Fortunately you can handle all that in other ways these days.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
