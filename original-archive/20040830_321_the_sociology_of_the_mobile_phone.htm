<p>It has become obvious by now that the mobile phone has changed the way people interact. These two papers were forwaded to me by a colleague, whose summary I am shamelessly lifting from heavily.</p>
<p> First is a short paper titled <a href="http://www.smartmobs.com/archives/003495.html"> Exploring the implications for social identity of the new sociology of the mobile phone</a>. </p>
<p> The much more fascinating (and much longer) one is <a href="http://www.motorola.com/mot/doc/0/234_MotDoc.pdf"> The Effects of Mobile Telephones on Social and Individual Life</a>&nbsp;[PDF]. Read about Flight, Suspension and Persistence&mdash;the three ways people deal with incoming calls. Learn how to tell an Innie from an Outie. Set up an Approximeeting. Are you a swift, an owl, a dove, a sparrow, a starling, or a peacock? Pick up some UK mobile phone lingo: </p>
<ul>
<li>"Gooseberry call": calling someone during their date to get a progress report. </li>
<li>"Shagbile": the mobile phone your partner doesn't know about, used for affairs. </li>
<li>"Sad": derogatory term for people who show off their phones. Enormous ritualization surrounds this. </li>
</ul>
<p> "Shagbile" is the best. So <a href="http://www.austinpowers.com/">Austin Powers</a>. </p>

		<p>I think it was probably &quot;Shag Pile&quot;, but was misheard by the interviewer.<br />
<br />Shag Pile carpet is thick soft woolly carpet, nice to lay down in :D<br />
<br />So this is of course where the word &#8216;shag&#8217; in the British/Austin Powers sense comes from.</p>

		<p>I just wish people would be more conisderate with the damn things.</p>
<p>Just about every day in one of my college classes a cell phone goes off with one of those annoying-as-all-get-out ring tones that is the derivative of some once famous song.</p>
<p>And don&#8217;t get me started regarding the movie theatre.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a hint: TURN OFF THE RINGER.</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8217;I&#8217;d like to turn off my mobile when I&#8217;m in bed with someone,&#8217; said one businessman, many miles from home, &#8216;but my wife suspects I&#8217;m being unfaithful if she can&#8217;t reach me.&#8217;&quot;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve actually seen people in the movie theatre *answering* the phone and chatting five minutes while the movie was running. Which finally convinced me that humanity is doomed after all.</p>

		<p>My favorite moment this year.  Watching someone try to smoke a cigarette, talk on a cell phone, and ride a bike.  Then they ran into a tree.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
