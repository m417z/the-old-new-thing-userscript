		<p>Well, make the sample small enough and use a database that&#39;s big enough: You can find everything (if we separate notes eight to twelve into single notes, I&#39;m pretty sure we can find a match in almost every symphony)</p>

		<p>You mean whatever the voice sings?</p>
<p>I suspect, if you reverse and flip some bars of Bruckner 6th (that&#39;ll will also turn it from minor to major), that&#39;ll be it.</p>

		<p>&#8230;and basing the theme off Mahler and Bruckner makes total sense. Mahler and Bruckner are part of the same tradition in the history of music. Mahler was well aware of Bruckner&#39;s music. He quoted Bruckner&#39;s 4th in the finale of 6th, and also re-orchestrated Bruckner&#39;s 6th. Opening of Adagio from Bruckner&#39;s 9th might have given Mahler the idea about the beginning of Finale of his 9th.</p>
<p>Mahler is to Bruckner what Kirk is to Spock. One is without all restraints, and another is very logical and almost asexual, but not totally devoid of all feelings.</p>

		<p>Two other correspondences:</p>
<p>1) Compare the opening to the 3rd mvmt of Howard Hanson&#39;s 2nd Symphony [1, at start] with one of the main ET themes [2, at start]</p>
<p>2) One of the main guitar themes from Dire Strait&#39;s Romeo and Juilet [3, very near start] is straight out of Bruce Springsteen&#39;s Jungleland [4, at 0:32]</p>
<p>The other funny related thing I&#39;ve seen is a YouTube comment on (I think a now-taken-down) copy of Bruckner&#39;s 8th saying &quot;how low of Bruckner to steal Hans Zimmer&#39;s two note Batman motif&quot; [5, at 1:22:04 in that recording] :-)</p>

		<p>This is amazing. I mean, what are the odds that a small number of notes in a melodic relationship turn up *almost* the same in other compositions?</p>
<p>OK, OK, the opening notes *are* a bit special, of course. At least it&#39;s not a four chord song, I suppose. (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOlDewpCfZQ" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch</a>, just in case you&#39;ve never seen it.)</p>

		<p>Is finding two and three notes in another piece of music actually that impressive though? (I thought I was imagining the four notes not actually being correct).</p>
<p>I found note 8, it&#39;s used everywhere.</p>

		<p>I was playing my flute in a pub session on Wednesday and I&#39;m sure I used note 8 several times and note 9 at least once. </p>
<p>So sue me, because I&#39;ll probably do it again this coming Sunday.</p>

		<p>@Maurits: that Oh Canada resembles the Zauberflöte is not only something you&#39;ve voticed, the Wikipedia page of &quot;Oh Canada&quot; tells the same :-)</p>
<p>@smf and Steve: you remind me of the guy in the joke who loudly complains after a famous orator held a long speech &quot;I have a book whith his whole speech inside &#8211; word for word&quot; and when challenged produces a dictionary. It&#39;s not the individual notes that make up the source, it&#39;s the combination. Three or four notes (quasi-)identical and in similar instrumentation and length are not as common as you maybe think, especially if you produce something distinctive. The da-da-da-daaah of Beethovens Fifth is quite recognizable, even if it&#39;s only four notes (or even two since the first three are the same). See also jingles, which are frequently only a few notes &quot;long&quot;.</p>
<p>In case of samples high courts in both the US and germany have decided, that two-second samples used in the background of a different music decades later constitute copyright infringement &#8211; even when only careful listeners can hear them.</p>
<p>Btw: the beginning of &quot;Mars&quot; of Holsts Planets is recognizable in both in the chase scene at the beginning of Star Wars (IV) and in the first part of the fifth act of Diablo (I) </p>

		<p>1. &nbsp;There&#39;s a piece of classical music whose main theme is very similar to the bass line from Queen and David Bowie&#39;s Under Pressure (AKA the bass line from Vanilla Ice&#39;s Ice Ice Baby). &nbsp;This post would be way better if I could remember which piece of classical music it is. &nbsp;Does anybody know what I&#39;m talking about?</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;In the Star Trek Into Darkness credits, I noticed that the original theme music was credited to Alexander Courage *and* Gene Roddenberry. &nbsp;The reason is interesting:</p>

		<p>Sure if it were three and four notes by the same composer then I&#39;d go along with it. However the four notes is a cheat as only notes 1 &amp; 2 are correct. If you A/B it then the third note is actually wrong.</p>
<p>If you took all the music ever written then I think you&#39;d be surprised how many 2 note collisions you will find. We like sounds that go together, so the number of combinations is far more limited than you think.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>I agree that notes 3 and 4 are cheats. In the Star Trek theme, the interval between notes 2 and 3 is a minor third, not a second (minor or major). -Raymond</em>]</div>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
