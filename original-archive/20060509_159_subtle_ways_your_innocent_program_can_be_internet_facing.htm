<p>Last time, we left off with a promise to discuss ways your program can be Internet-facing without your even realizing it, and probably the most common place for this is the command line. Thanks to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mind/1196/cifs.asp"> CIFS</a>, files can be shared across the Internet and accessed via UNC notation. This means that anybody can set up a CIFS server and create files like <code>\\server.example.com\some\file.ext</code>, and they will look to the world like a file on a file server somewhere (because that is, in fact, what it is). When you double-click it, you're launching the document.</p>
<p> And that's where the command line attack comes from. Suppose your program is a handler for a file association. Say, your program is <code>litware.exe</code> and it is the registered handler for <code>.LIT</code> files. The attacker just has to create a file called <code>\\server.example.com\some\path\target.lit</code> and induce the user into double-clicking it. Once that's done, your program will be run with the command line you registered, which will probably be </p>
<blockquote><p> <code>"C:\Program Files\Litsoft\litware.exe" \\server.example.com\some\path\target.lit</code> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Notice that the attacker controls the path. This means that if you have a bug in your command line parser, the attacker can exploit it. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Code injection via the command line is an elevation of privilege. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Note that this extends beyond merely extra-long file names. If you registered your verb incorrectly by forgetting to put quotation marks around the file name insertion <code>%1</code>, the attacker can hatch a file with an odd name like <code>\\server.example.com\strange -uninstall path.lit</code>. The resulting command line is therefore </p>
<blockquote><p> <code>"C:\Program Files\Litsoft\litware.exe" \\server.example.com\strange -uninstall path.lit</code> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Your parser then breaks the command line up into words and interprets this command line as having three parts: </p>
<ul>
<li>The file <code>\\server.example.com\strange</code> </li>
<li>The command line switch <code>-uninstall</code> </li>
<li>The file <code>path.lit</code>. </li>
</ul>
<p> The program then tries to load the file <code>\\server.example.com\strange</code> and fails, possibly displaying an error message, then it uninstalls itself,  and then tries (and fails) to load the file <code>path.lit</code>. End result: The user gets two strange error messages and the program is uninstalled. </p>
<p> Of course, the attacker also controls the contents of the file, so any vulnerabilities in your file parser can be exploited as well. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Code injection via file contents is an elevation of privilege. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> If you write a shell extension, your extension will run if the user activates it on the remote file. For example, if you have a context menu extension, it will be instantiated and initialized with the remote file as the data object. Many context menu extensions contain buffer overflow bugs in the way they mishandle the names of the files that the user right-clicked on. (Notice that I said "names"&mdash;plural. The user might multi-select files and right-click on them.) For example, a certain shareware file archival program responds to the <code>GCS_HELPTEXT</code> request by taking the names of all the files and combining them into the message "Add the files A, B, C, D, and E to the archive." Unfortunately, when the names A, B, C, D, and E are very long, an exploitable buffer overrun occurs. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Code injection triggered by file name length is an elevation of privilege. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Just because your program doesn't contact the Internet explicitly doesn't mean it's safe from Internet-based attacks. </p>

		<p>Raymond,<br />
<br /> &nbsp;How did the attacker (on a server over the internet) get the user to execute the verb.</p>
<p> &nbsp;You examples seem like special cases of the &quot;if you can run a program in the context of the user, it&#8217;s not an elevation of privilege&quot;.</p>
<p> &nbsp;I see how this could be turned into an exploit by the right content (a .pif file downloaded from the internet) but there has to be user intervention involved somewhere.</p>

		<p>The &#8216;spaces in the file name&#8217; trick is common in other operating systems, too, and surprisingly is better handled by most Windows developers than it is on other platforms! &nbsp;OS X ran into considerable problems when it came out, because most Unix script authors were unused to dealing with spaces in file names, but most Mac users loved to put spaces there.<br />
<br />One trick I use to increase my chance of catching these errors is to have a couple of directories called &quot;Program&quot; and &quot;Documents&quot; in the root of my C drive, and remove all my rights to them. &nbsp;Then I get an error any time a &quot;C:Program Files&quot; or &quot;C:Documents and Settings&quot; path gets executed incorrectly.<br />
<br />It&#8217;s not a 100% guarantee, but it does catch a few programs.</p>

		<p>If you can use deception, what&#8217;s to say you can&#8217;t deceive a user into typing an arbitrary string into an arbitrary dialog causing a code injection? Like &quot;To win many dollars, copy and paste this string into XYZ App&#8217;s options menu.&quot;</p>
<p>Just like visiting a &quot;malicious webpage&quot; by getting them to click a URL, you&#8217;re tricking a user to perform an action that does something malicious, unexpectedly.</p>

		<p>Since when are programs combined with their uninstallers!?</p>
<p>Ok, I have seen malware do it, but I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve NEVER seen an (legitimate) application that uninstalls on a command-line flag.</p>
<p>And anyway, this is Windows we&#8217;re talking about, it should be &quot;/uninstall&quot; not &quot;-uninstall&quot;.<br />
<br />In fact &quot;-uninstall&quot; wouldn&#8217;t even be normal on a UNIX system, it&#8217;d be &quot;-u&quot; or &quot;&#8211;unistall&quot;.</p>

		<p>That was just a hypothetical &quot;bad thing&quot; you can do from the command line. I leave your imagination to come up with more likely &quot;bad things&quot;. Fancy text editors for example are rich targets.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve never understood why users have execute access to their own directories. &nbsp;It seems to me that only specified directories (like programs) should have execute rights. &nbsp;There is no reason why a user should be able to run a .exe in their own direcory. &nbsp;However, the execute and transvers rights are overlayed so it&#8217;s difficult to remove execute rights without blocking access to the directory (oddly the same is true on unix/linux).</p>

<br />[&#8230;]<br />
<br />&gt; there has to be user intervention involved<br />
<br />&gt; somewhere.</p>
<p>Maybe there has to be user intervention involved in configuring Outlook Express to display its preview pane, but historically the preview pane was on by default.</p>
<p>With Internet Explorer it still seems to be possible. &nbsp;A user might visit a trusted site that they&#8217;ve been visiting for years, and neither the user nor the site&#8217;s owner knows that either:<br />
<br />(1) the site was infected 5 minutes earlier or<br />
<br />(2) one of the Google advertisements on the site delivers infection to the user via the contents that the advertisement brings in from a third site.</p>

<p>You might be right on that, maybe only DLLs are combined with their uninstallers.</p>
<p>&gt; And anyway, this is Windows we&#8217;re talking<br />
<br />&gt; about, it should be &quot;/uninstall&quot; not<br />
<br />&gt; &quot;-uninstall&quot;.</p>
<p>This is Windows we&#8217;re talking about, where a ton of programs recognize hyphens as option flags and some programs are even documented as doing so.</p>

		<p>The worst thing about geeks and nerds is their pedantry &#8211; some people are biologically incapable of recognising a hypothetical example if it slaps them in the face.</p>
<p>Also, oddly enough, it&#8217;s not unheard of for multiple minor security holes to add up to one big hole. Even if &quot;maybe&quot; the hole is only accessable to people who have already broken in, there&#8217;s still a reasonable chance that one other little hole will give them just enough access to attack the second hole and then have full control.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s nothing &quot;special case&quot; here. If I run a file server I can *not* run a program in the context of the user, but I can take advantage of flaws in the program that will allow me to inject code if they read data from my server. Therefoer I have had my priviledges elevated from &quot;provide data&quot; to &quot;change the code that is being executed&quot;.</p>
<p>Besides, &quot;click here to see the dancing bunnies&quot; is a lot easier than persuading people to format their own hard drive. Although, having said that, people have been persuaded to delete an oddly named file with a funny looking icon, not realising that it&#8217;s an important system file. &nbsp; ;) &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#8217;s strange, but people who can&#8217;t follow instructions to &quot;click on the start menu&quot; when talking to tech support are still capable of deleting system files, as long as they shouldn&#8217;t. People are weird.<br /></p>

<p>As Raymond mentions, the -uninstall option is just a &#8216;proof of concept&#8217; example.</p>
<p>Surely, there are many things that can be imagined to be malicious that can be invoked from the command line of a number of programs.</p>
<p>As an example, a number of Unix/Linux/GNU/whatever programs have a &#8216;special option&#8217; (&#8216;&#8211;&#8216;) that tells the program that anything following should not be considered an option. &nbsp;From that point, something that starts with a &#8216;-&#8216; is considered a filename, not an option. This helps prevent exactly the types of attacks that Raymond is discussing.</p>

		<p>&quot;However, the execute and transvers rights are overlayed so it&#8217;s difficult to remove execute rights without blocking access to the directory&quot;</p>
<p>You simply deny traverse/execute rights on *files* only for any directory which in turn will propagate to files in any subdirectory.</p>

		<p>ken lubar, you are confused. Having &quot;execute&quot; rights to a directory does not make it legal to execute files in that directory. Only that file&#8217;s execute rights determine if it can be executed. Of course the owner of a file may freely change those rights, so there&#8217;s no reason I can&#8217;t put any file in any directory and just add execute rights to it.</p>
<p>Also, the &quot;traverse&quot; right on a directory usually doesn&#8217;t matter because by default everyone has the privilege that allows it to be ignored. This allows you to create a directory I don&#8217;t have access to with a child subdirectory that I can access.</p>

		<p>@Stu:<br />
<br />-uninstall is often used for service binaries to (un)install themselves.<br />
<br />It is but just an example; maybe &nbsp;litware.exe only accepts one operand and discards %2 and higher?</p>
<p>@ken lubar:<br />
<br />use Software Restriction Policies in XP and later and only allow execution in %SystemRoot% and below and %ProgramFiles% and below.<br />
<br />Don&#8217;t forget to remove .lnk from the list of binaries, and add .swf and other notorious file extensions which may find their normal way into browser caches etc. and get &quot;executed&quot;.</p>
<p>@Raymond:<br />
<br />when the executable is registed with it&#8217;s full path and detected as 32bit binary then Explorer quotes the %1 itself (you wrote once). SCNR.-)</p>

		<p>Somebody would actually expose Windows File Sharing to the internet? </p>
<p>I can&#8217;t be the only person who snorted mightily when Microsoft renamed their hackable, wobbly, inefficient LAN file server protocol to be &quot;Common *Internet* Filing System&quot;<br /></p>

		<p>So you&#8217;re saying that all programs are exposed to the Internet, because people can download files from the Internet and then open them in programs.</p>
<p>Why on earth would anyone open a random file from the Internet without first thinking about where they were getting it from?</p>
<p>Oh, right, Windows&#8217;s special &quot;Internet sites look just like local files&quot; security-hole-by-design which they advertised so heavily. &nbsp;:-P</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Somebody would actually expose Windows File Sharing to the internet?</p>
<p> &nbsp;A couple of years ago, when I had a cable modem, occasionally my router would light up as someone&#8217;s machine would try infecting my computer with some sort of crud.<br />
  <br /> &nbsp;A couple of times I mounted C$ on the offending machine, to leave nastygrams in their autoexec.bat. At least once, my antivirus software reached out and cleaned execuatbles on their machines. (Which probably violated my license agreement.)

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
