<p>Danail wants to know <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/20/10040074.aspx#10040385"> the story behind the <code>WM_<wbr>SYNC&shy;PAINT</wbr></code> message</a>.</p>
<p> <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd145221(VS.85).aspx"> The documentation</a> pretty much tells the story. When a window has been hidden, shown, moved or sized, the system may determine that it needs to send a <code>WM_<wbr>SYNC&shy;PAINT</wbr></code> message to the windows of other threads. This message must be passed to <code>Def&shy;Window&shy;Proc</code>, which will send the <code>WM_<wbr>NCPAINT</wbr></code> and <code>WM_<wbr>ERASE&shy;BKGND</wbr></code> messages to the window as necessary. </p>
<p> When you call the <code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Pos</code> function, the window manager updates the window size, position, whatever, and then it goes around repainting the windows that were affected by the operation. By default, the <code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Pos</code> function does a quick-repaint of the windows before returning. After the function returns, the normal <code>WM_<wbr>PAINT</wbr></code> message does the real work of painting the window. The quick-repaint is done so that there is immediate feedback that the window did change its size, position, whatever. </p>
<p> This quick-repaint is done by sending a <code>WM_<wbr>NCPAINT</wbr></code> and <code>WM_<wbr>ERASE&shy;BKGND</wbr></code> message to the windows that were affected by the <code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Pos</code> operation. This normally happens without incident, but if one of the windows affected by the <code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Pos</code> operation belongs to another thread, the window manager needs to get into the context of that other thread to finish the job. That's where <code>WM_<wbr>SYNC&shy;PAINT</wbr></code> comes in. The <code>WM_<wbr>SYNC&shy;PAINT</wbr></code> message means, "Hey, I was going around quick-painting a bunch of windows, but I couldn't quick-paint you (or any other windows on your thread) because I was on the wrong thread. Could you finish quick-painting yourself (and all the other windows that need quick-painting)? Thanks." </p>
<p> Another way of looking at this is that it is a way for the window manager to teleport itself into another thread so it can finish its work. "Lah di dah, quick-painting all the windows, oh crap, I can't quick-paint that window because it's on the wrong thread. Let me inject myself into that other process [trivial, since <i>I'm the window manager</i>, <a href="http://dashes.com/anil/2007/04/cats-can-has-gr.html"> I'M IN YR PROCESS REEDING YR MSGS</a>], and now I can send a message to myself [<code>WM_<wbr>SYNCPAINT</wbr></code>], and when that other copy of me receives it, he'll finish where I left off." </p>
<p> If you don't like any of this teleportation or multiple-copies-of-yourself imagery, you can say that the <code>WM_<wbr>SYNC&shy;PAINT</wbr></code> message means, "Quick-paint this window as part of a quick-paint operation begun on another thread." </p>
<p> If you don't want this quick-paint to take place, you can follow the instructions in the documentation and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms633545(VS.85).aspx"> pass the <code>SWP_<wbr>DEFER&shy;ERASE</wbr></code> flag to suppress the <code>WM_<wbr>SYNC&shy;PAINT</wbr></code> message</a>. </p>

		<p>Let&#39;s see if I understand: the moral of the story is &quot;WM_SYNCÂ­PAINT is an internal message, just treat it like any other message you do not know about (that is, let it slide through the default case in your switch, which will do nothing more than calling DefWindowProc) and everything will work fine&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Cesar: I was thinking similarly. &nbsp;In fact, why did they document WM_SYNCPAINT in the first place if it&#39;s only used internally? &nbsp;I&#39;m trying to think of a case where I&#39;d actually need to know about it. &nbsp;The only thing I can think of is debugging (e.g. sniffing messages with Microsoft Spy++ &#8211; you might wonder what those undocumented messages are). &nbsp;If the documentation did not document WM_SYNCPAINT and instead documented that all unknown messages should go to the default window procedure then all would be fine (in theory, anyway!).</p>

		<p>@JamesJohnston: &quot;all unknown messages should go to the default window procedure&quot;</p>
<p>Forgive me if I am wrong (more of a Unix programmer, so I might get some Windows-specific things wrong), but I believe it is deeper than &quot;all unknown messages&quot;; it is &quot;all messages your window procedure does not care about&quot; (which includes unknown/undocumented messages, but also known and documented messages which are not relevant to your window). That is, treat only the messages which matter to you, pass the rest to DefWindowProc and let it return the applicable &quot;this message makes no sense&quot; error codes.</p>

		<p>@Cesar: If you read Raymond&#39;s blog, you&#39;ll see the real reason for passing all unknown is so new messages added in a future version of Windows get their default behavior.</p>

<p>aka unknown unknowns messages.</p>

		<p>Wouldn&#39;t it be known unknowns if you were expecting new windows versions to add messages, but didn&#39;t know what those would be?</p>

		<p>But since they haven&#39;t been added, so you just don&#39;t know what the messages are, wouldn&#39;t that make them unknown known unknowns?</p>

		<p>of course I know that this is a remnant of ancient times when memory was scarce and furry things from alpha centauri were still furry things from alpha centauri, but&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8230;would that method with the &quot;Paint Thyself&quot; message still get implemented today or would it be easier/better to give every windo a 2D-plane it can paint what it wants on and then use some z-Koordinate (plus perhaps Alpha blending) to generate a composite of all those windows for the Desktop user?</p>

		<p>@Engywuck:</p>
<p>IIRC that&#39;s the way OS-X does it&#8230; every window is drawing to a surface that&#39;s a texture for the GPU to composite on-screen.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
