<p>
Consider a program whose output to the console goes like this.
(I've prefixed each line with the output stream.)
</p>
<pre>
stdout: line 1
stderr: err 1
stdout: line 2
stderr: err 2
</pre>
<p>
You want to capture both the normal and error streams,
so you run the program and append
"<code>&gt;output 2&gt;&amp;1</code>" to capture both streams
into a single file.
But when you look at the resulting output file, you get this:
</p>
<pre>
line 1
line 2
err 1
err 2
</pre>
<p>
What happened?
</p>
<p>
Most programs
change their output behavior depending on whether
the output stream is a file or a device.
If the output stream is a device (such as the screen),
then buffering is disabled and every print statement goes
to the screen immediately.
On the other hand, if the output stream is a file,
then buffering is enabled and print statements do not go
directly into the file but rather into an application-managed
memory buffer.
When the buffer fills, it is written to the file, and then the
buffer is emptied so it can accept more output.
</p>
<p>
This explains the behavior we see above.
The program generates its output to both stdout and stderr,
and the results are buffered.
When the program exits, the buffers are flushed, first
stdout and then stderr.
That's why you see all the stdout output grouped together
and all the stderr output grouped together.
</p>
<p>
"But I don't do any of this in my programs; why is it happening anyway?"
</p>
<p>
If you use the C runtime for your output, then your program does
behave this way whether you realize it or not.
The default behavior of the C runtimes is to perform unbuffered I/O
for devices and buffered I/O for files.
You can override this behavior in your own programs by calling
<code>setvbuf</code> to force buffering on or off for a file handle.
</p>
<p>
(A classmate in college became legendary for fixing a bug
in one of the programs used in the VLSI class, all of which were
notoriously buggy.
He patched the binary to disable buffered I/O.)</p>

		<p>And, of course, there is the behaviour of the Unix &quot;ls&quot;, which when redirected (or piped) automagically switches from using several columns to a &quot;one file per line&quot; mode.</p>

		<p>On UNIX, well Linux at least, console output is also buffered, the buffer is flushed when a newline is output.</p>
<p>Makes things interesting when you&#8217;re using good old printf debugging if you don&#8217;t put &quot;n&quot;&#8217;s on all your debugging output.</p>

		<p>Anonymous &#8212; that&#8217;s because /bin/ls does an &quot;if(isatty(1))&quot; while deciding how to format its output.</p>
<p>If its stdout (file-handle 1) is a TTY, then it uses several columns. &nbsp;If not, it uses one. &nbsp;(This is so you don&#8217;t have to remember to &quot;ls -1&quot; every time you need to redirect the output. &nbsp;You can if you want to, but if stdout is a pipe or a normal file, then it won&#8217;t make any difference.)</p>

		<p>[sorry if this is repeated. I&#8217;m pretty sure the last submit failed, but &#8230; who knows.]</p>
<p>bramster: The same way you do it on an old bourne-compatible shell on UNIX:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;command &gt; output_file 2&gt;&amp;1</p>
<p>I tested this on cmd.exe on XP SP2 and it works fine. Here&#8217;s the test program I used, which produced identical output in the target file and on the console (and worked correctly with redirections of just stdout or just stderr).</p>
<p>#include &lt;iostream&gt;</p>
<p>int main() {<br />
<br />    using namespace std;<br />
<br />    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;This is on stdout&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;<br />
<br />    cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;This is on stderr&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;<br />
<br />    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;This is also on stdout&quot;;<br />
<br />    cerr &lt;&lt; &quot;this is also on stderr&quot;;<br />
<br />    cout &lt;&lt; endl;<br />
<br />    cerr &lt;&lt; endl;<br />
<br />    return 0;<br />
<br />}</p>
<p>I guess the NT POSIX system has some nice legacy lying around. I wonder what I can do with passing file descriptors around etc&#8230;</p>

		<p>Craig, I think it worked that way because of your use of &#8216;endl&#8217; which I believe causes the buffer to be flushed. &nbsp;If you had used &quot;n&quot; instead, your output might have been subjected to the buffering rules.</p>

		<p>When you output your debug statements (stderr and stdout, in Java which is System.err and System.out respectively) to a file, do take I/O buffering into consideration. You may not see your output lines in the sequence you expect if your program is perfor</p>

  <br />I don&#8217;t have (at the moment) a program at hand where the order of redirected output would matter to me, but from time to time it would be so very useful to have an easy way. Maybe Monad could tackle this problem, please?<br />

		<p>BSD3-derived Unix variantes provide pseudo ttys that are a cross between a pair of pipes and a tty. It&#8217;s how xterm etc. work for instance. There is also a utility called &quot;script&quot; which does just what rolfhub wants. Note that it is not a good idea to use &quot;script&quot; to work out which control codes &quot;vi&quot; uses.

<p>Well, I&#8217;ve read the manpage, and it looks quite useful, especially:<br />
  <br />&#8212;[from man script]&#8212;<br />
  <br />-c COMMAND<br />
  <br />Run the COMMAND rather than an interactive shell. This makes it easy for a script to capture the output of a program that behaves differently when its stdout is not a tty.<br />

<p>The manpage seems to have improved since then ;-)<br />

  <br />Certain interactive commands, such as vi(1), create garbage in the typescript file.<br />

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
