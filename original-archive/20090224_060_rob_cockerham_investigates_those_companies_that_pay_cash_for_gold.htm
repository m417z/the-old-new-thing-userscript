<p> Rob Cockerham seems to have a lot of spare time, which is great for the rest of us, because he investigates all those things we simply don't have the time for, and then posts the results <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/"> on his Web site</a> ("The sixth-best website in the world"). </p>
<p> Today's highlight is a pair of investigations he performed some time ago which seem to show two sides of one industry. </p>
<ul>
<li>In     <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/citizen/goldkit/gold_kit.shtml">     The Gold Kit Surprise</a>,     he sprays some worthless junk with gold paint and sends it in.     Just writing that sentence made me laugh with anticipation     and I haven't even gotten to the punch line yet.     Read it through. </li>
<li>In     <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/citizen/goldkit/cheat.shtml">     Cash4Gold Will Offer One-Third of the Actual Value for your Gold</a>,     he sends actual gold to Cash4Gold to see how much they offer for it.     Well, the title gives away the punch line,     but it's still worth reading. </li>
</ul>
<p> That Web site is a sinkhole of time-wastage. If you're not careful, you'll find yourself clicking around from story to story, like the <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/inside/howmuchinside.html"> How much is inside?</a> adventures, in which he investigates things like <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/inside/threadcount/threadcount01.shtml"> how many threads per inch are there in 360-thread count pillowcases?</a> Or his <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/incredible/incredible.html"> gallery of costumes</a> (for Hallowe'en or other events), including my favorite: <a href="http://www.cockeyed.com/incredible/paparazzi/paparazzi.html"> Paparazzi</a>. </p>

		<p>The punchline in the Cash4Gold article is in the follow-up article: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.cockeyed.com/citizen/goldkit/reputation.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.cockeyed.com/citizen/goldkit/reputation.shtml</a></p>

		<p>Pure scam&#8230;just pure scam. I just don&#8217;t understand why the FTC doesn&#8217;t regulate and come down harder on these con artists that run businesses like Cash4Gold.</p>

		<p>You laugh now, but what about when the y2k bug hits and oil production drops and the continents are flooded and the Great Tribulation begins? Then these gold-buyers will be the ones saying &quot;Who run Bartertown?&quot;</p>

		<p>I should have paid more attention to your warning, as I found the posts there very entertaining and hardly managed to stop myself reading them. :)</p>
<p>I found the post about &quot;Using a torn credit card application form to apply for a card&quot; [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.cockeyed.com/citizen/creditcard/application4.shtml" rel="nofollow">http://www.cockeyed.com/citizen/creditcard/application4.shtml</a>] very surprising.</p>
<p>I guess I should simply burn the form next time&#8230; :P</p>

		<p>@Duke of New York</p>
<p>A truckload of Campbell&#8217;s&#174; Chicken Noodle Soup will be worth more than a wharehouse full of gold in post-apocalyptic times.</p>
<p>Personally, I like the story he did a few years ago when gas spiked in which he compared the cost of various items on a per gallon basis.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
