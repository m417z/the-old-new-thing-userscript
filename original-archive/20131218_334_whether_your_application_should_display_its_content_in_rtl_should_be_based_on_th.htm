A customer had the following puzzle:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
We have a small bootstrapper application that consists of a dialog box
and a few message boxes.
The problem is that we want our application to work properly
on Arabic and Hebrew systems,
and we can't come up with a good way to determine text direction
of the underlying system.
We found
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2006/03/03/542963.aspx">
this article by Michael Kaplan</a> that tells us how not to do it,
which is great, but what's the recommended way of actually doing it?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You already know whether you should be displaying your application's
UI in LTR or RTL:
If this is the Arabic-localized or Hebrew-localized version of your
application, then display it as RTL.
If this is the English-localized or French-localized version,
then display it as LTR.
</p>
<p>
There's no point in trying to display your English-language strings in
RTL just because the underlying operating system is Arabic.
If your strings are in English, then display them in the way they
should look to an English speaker.
A dialog box like this helps nobody:
</p>
<table BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0
       TITLE='A dialog box with RTL layout of LTR text, which ends up right-justified and with punctuation marks in the wrong place.'
       STYLE="color: black; background-color: #d4d0c8;
              border-width: 2px; border-style: outset;
              font-size: 9pt;
              font-family: Segoe UI, Tahoma, MS Sans Serif, Arial, sans-serif">
<tr BGCOLOR="#0a246a"
           STYLE="padding: 2px; font-size: 8pt;
           font-family: Tahoma, MS Sans Serif, Arial, sans-serif">
<td ALIGN=left STYLE="padding: 4px 2px 4px 4px">
    <b STYLE="float: right; color: white">...Please wait</b>
    <span STYLE="background-color: #d4d0c8; border: solid 1px white; border-bottom-color: #404040; border-right-color: #404040">
      <span STYLE="border: solid 1px transparent; border-right-color: #808080; border-bottom-color: #808080">
        <b>&times;</b>
      </span>
    </span>
  </td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td NOWRAP STYLE="padding: 25px; text-align: right">
,(Preparing setup (50% complete<br>
.your patience is appreciated
  </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
When your localization team translates the application into Arabic,
they can
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/goglobal/bb688119.aspx#EDC">
insert two copies of U+200E (LEFT-TO-RIGHT MARK)
at the start of the
<i>File&shy;Description</i> in the version resource</a>.
That is the signal to Windows that the application
should have RTL as its default layout direction.
</p>
<p>
If you want your application to choose a language dynamically
(say, to use English strings if running on an English system
but Arabic strings if running on an Arabic system),
then you can add a flag in your resources so that the localizers
can indicate whether a particular language pack expects text to
run left-to-right or right-to-left.
</p>
<pre>
IDS_LANGUAGE_DIRECTION "LTR" // change to RTL if localized in Arabic, etc.
</pre>
<p>
Your application could then check the direction
and call
<code>Set&shy;Process&shy;Default&shy;Layout</code> based on the result.</p>

		<p>@Random User 058372: Good point! &nbsp;&quot;RTL&quot; can only mean the &quot;wrong&quot; way. &nbsp;All languages are &quot;LTR&quot; as far as they are concerned. &nbsp;A better convention might be to use &quot;&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#39;m confused by the example. &nbsp;Shouldn&#39;t it be something like:</p>

		<p>Does the close button always display on the right side of LTR windows and the left side of RTL windows, or is it always on the right on an LTR OS and left on an RTL OS?</p>

		<p>Mr Cranky,</p>
<p>To my (extremely limited) knowledge of foreign languages, most RTL languages use syllablries, not alphabets, and &quot;normal&quot; arabic numbering. So I would guess closer to:</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8230;wait Please</p>
<p>.pleatcom %50 upSet</p>
<p>(Your opinion of syllable breaks my vary.)</p>
<p>Initialisms being special cases, because the order of the letters is dependent upon the order of the words being represented.</p>

		<p>Random User 058372: Syllabaries are quite rare. Probably the only common ones are Hiragana and Katakana (both Japanese), and they are LTR. Arabic, Hebrew, and Urdu are the most common RTL scripts.</p>

		<p>Gabe,</p>
<p>&gt; Probably the only common ones are Hiragana and Katakana (both Japanese), and they are LTR.</p>
<p>Only due to computer restrictions.</p>
<p>For over a millennium, Japanese (include hiragana, katakana, and han scripts) is written from top-to-bottom and right-to-left.</p>
<p>This is still true in most published works, such as novels and newspapers.</p>
<p>The fact that PCs do not display text in this layout is a large barrier for older Japanese.</p>

		<p>@Christian: see his Twitter account. He merely mentioned a planned meeting with the potential to restore the blog, and later noted that we shouldn&#39;t expect its return in the near future. If the blog is available from inside Microsoft, obviously it&#39;s not a technical issue; anything more would be speculation.</p>

		<p>@Random832: It is a known fact that humans have mixed preferences. For instance, not every right-handed person necessarily prefers to shoot with right hand, kick with the right foot, sit in a car with the driver&#39;s seat on the right side, drive in the right lane or sit on the starboard side of a ship. The same way, not every RTL language writer might prefer the Start button or Office button on the right side of the screen.</p>
<p>Software developers either fail to account for all these permutation or fail to keep up with the deadline, the budget and these permutations at the same time. They make a compromise somewhere. 90/10 law, you know.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
