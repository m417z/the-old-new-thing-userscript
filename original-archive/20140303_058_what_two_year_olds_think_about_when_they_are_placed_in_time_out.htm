<p> She cheerfully replied, "&#20210;&#26410;&#20054;!" (Still naughty!) </p>
<p> In an unrelated incident, one of my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/04/27/9570320.aspx"> honorary nieces</a> was being similarly punished. She told her aunt who was passing nearby, "In a little while, my daddy is going to ask me if I'm sorry. I'm not really sorry, but I'm going to say that I am." </p>

		<p>@KS</p>
<p>Yes. Punishment needs to be immediate and consistent, starting at an age where causality is understood.</p>
<p>What do you recommend? Saying &quot;Don&#39;t do that?&quot; Let everyone know how that works for you.</p>

		<p>These stories are cute, though I think I can already tell where the comments section is going.</p>
<p>They aren&#39;t your direct children, but I am curious if you have the freedom to ask them why they don&#39;t feel sorry. I lack children, but I think it might be an interesting conversation.</p>

		<p>@Gearov</p>
<p>They don&#39;t feel sorry for whatever they did for the same reason adults don&#39;t; they felt like their actions were justified.</p>
<p>The most relevant example for a 2-year old might be hitting someone who hit you first. Other people might say the action was unwarranted, adults tend to want to be &#39;objective&#39; and &#39;not take sides,&#39; but the child is going to feel perfectly justified in defending themselves, and not understand why they should feel sorry.</p>

		<p>@Anon: By 2 years old, empathy begins to develop and only after that they might feel their actions unjustified. Before that they can only behave with the idea without understanding that &quot;when I doing this thing I get punished, when I do that thing I won&#39;t.&quot;</p>

		<p>When my oldest daughter was ten, while we were driving somewhere, she cheerfully declared &quot;There&#39;s nothing you can do punish me.&quot; She then detailed every punishment and why it didn&#39;t work. When she turned 16, I discovered her Achilles Heal&#8211;driving privileges.</p>
<p>(The good news is that her daughter is even more precocious. Now that&#39;s karma.)</p>

		<p>One year my wife brought my older daughter, then 4, and her best friend to the office for Halloween. &nbsp; The two girls spent the *entire* trip over discussing, in detail, the srategies they use to anipulate their parents. &nbsp; The level of discussion was very similar to that found in the GoF patterns book: when to use, alternatives, possible variations, pitfaalls, and implemenation details.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
