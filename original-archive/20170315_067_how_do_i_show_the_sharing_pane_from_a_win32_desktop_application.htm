<p>
A customer wanted to show the sharing pane from their Win32
desktop application.
In a UWP application,
this would be done by calling
<code>Windows.Application&shy;Model.Data&shy;Transfer.Data&shy;Transfer&shy;Manager.Show&shy;Sharing&shy;UI()</code>.
Let's do it in a Win32 desktop app by following
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160629-00/?p=93775">
the basic rules for projection</a>:
Static methods are represented as methods on a "Statics"
interface on the activation factory.
</p>
<p>
Start with
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20030723-00/?p=43073">
the scratch program</a>
and make these changes.
(Remember, Little Programs do little to no error checking.)
</p>
<pre>
<font COLOR="blue">#include &lt;wrl/client.h&gt;
#include &lt;wrl/wrappers/corewrappers.h&gt;
#include &lt;windows.applicationmodel.datatransfer.h&gt;
#include &lt;tchar.h&gt; // Huh? Why are you still using ANSI?
#include &lt;roapi.h&gt;

namespace WRL = Microsoft::WRL;
namespace dt = ABI::Windows::ApplicationModel::DataTransfer;

using Microsoft::WRL::Wrappers::HStringReference;

void OnChar(HWND hwnd, TCHAR ch, int cRepeat)
{
  switch (ch) {
  case TEXT(' '):
    {
      WRL::ComPtr&lt;dt::IDataTransferManagerStatics&gt; dtmStatics;
      RoGetActivationFactory(HStringReference(
        RuntimeClass_Windows_ApplicationModel_DataTransfer_DataTransferManager)
                             .Get(), IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;dtmStatics));
      dtmStatics-&gt;ShowShareUI();
    }
    break;
  }
}

HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_CHAR, OnChar);
</font></pre>
<p>
Fire up this program, hit the space bar,
and&hellip; nothing happens.
</p>
<p>
Okay, so maybe we need to do a tiny bit of error checking
after all.
The call to
<code>Show&shy;Share&shy;UI</code> fails with
<code>E_NOT_SET</code>.
The reason is that the
<code>Show&shy;Share&shy;UI</code> method
has an implicit dependency on the current thread's
<code>Core&shy;Window</code>,
because it needs to know
which window is being shared.
But since we are a Win32 desktop program,
we don't have a
<code>Core&shy;Window</code>.
</p>
<p>
Oh no, what do we do?
</p>
<p>
Enter the interop pattern.
</p>
<p>
To accommodate Win32 desktop programs,
there is a parallel universe of <code>HWND</code>-based
methods.
In places where WinRT depends on the current thread's
<code>Core&shy;Window</code>,
this alternative universe offers a similarly-named method,
but with the <code>For&shy;Window</code> suffix,
indicating that it operates on classic Win32 <code>HWND</code>s
rather than fancy-pants
<code>Core&shy;Window</code>s.
</p>
<p>
One component of
this parallel universe of
<code>-For&shy;Window</code> methods
consists of interfaces that end in the name <code>Interop</code>.
In our case, it's
<code>IData&shy;Transfer&shy;Manager&shy;Interop</code>.
This interface is available on the activation factory,
the same as the
<code>IData&shy;Transfer&shy;Manager&shy;Statics</code> interface.
The general pattern is as follows:
</p>
<table BORDER="1" STYLE="border-collapse: collapse" CELLPADDING="3">
<tr>
<th>XxxStatics</th>
<th>XxxInterop</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Get&shy;For&shy;Current&shy;View</td>
<td>Get&shy;For&shy;Window</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Do&shy;Something (implied "for current view")</td>
<td>Do&shy;Something&shy;For&shy;Window</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
In our case, we have a
<code>Show&shy;Sharing&shy;UI()</code> method
on the <code>Statics</code>
interface,
so the corresponding interop method is called
<code>Show&shy;Sharing&shy;For&shy;WIndow()</code>.
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;shlobj.h&gt; // IDataTransferManagerInterop

void OnChar(HWND hwnd, TCHAR ch, int cRepeat)
{
  switch (ch) {
  case TEXT(' '):
    {
      <font COLOR="blue">WRL::ComPtr&lt;dt::IDataTransferManagerInterop&gt; dtmInterop;</font>
      RoGetActivationFactory(HStringReference(
        RuntimeClass_Windows_ApplicationModel_DataTransfer_DataTransferManager)
                             .Get(), IID_PPV_ARGS(<font COLOR="blue">&amp;dtmInterop</font>));
      <font COLOR="blue">dtmInterop-&gt;ShowShareUIForWindow(hwnd);</font>
    }
    break;
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
Okay, so now we show the share pane,
but the pane just offers to share a screen shot.
How can we get the pane to offer custom data
provided by the program?
We'll look at that next time.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
One of my colleagues noted that
"data transfer manager" is a poor name for the class,
seeing as transferring data is what computers do most of the time
anyway.</p>

		<p>Probably just a typo, but the text talks about &#8220;Show足Sharing足UI&#8221; and &#8220;ShowSharing足For足WIndow&#8221;, but code has &#8220;ShowShareUI&#8221; and &#8220;ShowShareUIForWindow&#8221;.

		<p>I found out the hard way that ShowShareUIForWindow only works on Windows 10+, on Windows 8 it returns S_OK but does nothing when called from a normal desktop app. I&#8217;m assuming it only works for the Metro browser on Windows 8?</p>

		<p>Hmm, I admit I have no idea what the &#8220;Sharing Pane&#8221; is. Google/Bing search for &#8220;Sharing Pane&#8221; and &#8220;Sharing UI&#8221; shows mostly MacOS stuff and some 3rd party apps&#8230; nothing that looks like a Windows OS feature.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m on Windows 10, how can I access this as a user?</p>

		<p>In Windows 8 it was on the Charms bar, in Windows 10 it is just a icon inside the app. It used to look like &#8220;holding hands in a circle&#8221; but it is now supposed to look more like iOS: <a href="https://medium.com/microsoft-design/the-iconography-of-sharing-183a1ad9c6f1#" rel="nofollow">https://medium.com/microsoft-design/the-iconography-of-sharing-183a1ad9c6f1#</a></p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know if that is what it really is supposed to be but it is similar to the Ubuntu logo where it is called the &#8220;Circle of Friends&#8221;[1]</p>

		<p>This assumes you have a choice of smart pointer. In theory you do (I&#8217;m assuming the WRL deallocator is projected somewhere, I live in managed memory land so I don&#8217;t worry about these things), but why use any one other than the one that comes with the library you&#8217;re interacting with?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
