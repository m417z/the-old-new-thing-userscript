<p>In Windows&nbsp;95, the <i>Find</i> option took its place on the Start menu  between <i>Settings</i> and <i>Help</i>. In Windows&nbsp;2000, the option was still there, but its name changed to <i>Search</i>, a name which persist today if you use the classic Start menu.</p>
<p> When the menu option changed its name, the keyboard accelerator changed accordingly. Whereas <i>Find</i> used F as its accelerator, <i>Search</i> uses C. Here's a secret: The classic Start menu still responds to F as the keyboard accelerator for <i>Search</i>. The work to make this happen was undertaken as a concession to people who imprinted on the old Start menu and whose "muscle memory" still wants to press F to open what used to be the <i>Find</i> menu. </p>
<p> The totally redesigned Start menu for Windows&nbsp;XP changed the keyboard model radically, but if you're still attached to your muscle memory, you can switch to the classic Start menu and keep using all the old keyboard shortcuts from Windows versions past. </p>

		<p>What was the rationale behind the name change? Was it an acknowledgement that you may not find what you are searching for, or perhaps search is a more Internet-friendly term?</p>

		<p>In addition to Raymond&#8217;s answer, Windows can&#8217;t guarantee you&#8217;ll &quot;Find&quot; what you&#8217;re looking for, it can just &quot;Search&quot; for it. Search makes more sense when you think about, at least to me.</p>
<p>Now if only we could get everyone on the same page about using &quot;Previous &lt;-&gt; Next&quot; on slideshows instead of &quot;Last &lt;-&gt; Next&quot;. Last has two meanings, people! Previous has only one! It&#8217;s obvious!!</p>

		<p>One of the things I dislike most about vista is that the &#8216;classic&#8217; start menu has drifted a bit further from the classics (expanding the administrative tools menu from the control panel is gone for instance). &nbsp;Its not that I&#8217;m in love with the classic menu, its just that I develop and test on every windows release from NT4-&gt;Longhorn, I just want to work with a least common denominator. &nbsp;So switching the menu to &#8216;classic&#8217; is just about the first thing I do when I install a new OS.</p>

		<p>James: &nbsp;The obvious benefit of Last/Next over Previous/Next is the symmetry of the words, specifically with respect to length.</p>
<p>Therefore, there&#8217;s a UI benefit to Last/Next that&#8217;s powerful enough the ambiguity of Last is irrelevant considering the benefit of context in deciphering which meaning of &quot;last&quot; is intended.</p>

		<p>@Cody If you dont like &quot;Last&quot; then you have &quot;Back&quot; which confirms to the beauty and has only one meaning in context.</p>
<p>@James Its partially correct, that Windows search/find is not flawless. Thats because it only searches files with extensions it understands. You need to do advanced settings to make the engine behave non-intelligent, in which case, it does find what you are looking for. Some features in Windows are not meant for smart people like you and me&#8212;didn&#8217;t anybody tell you :-)</p>

		<p>Of course, I still use Ctrl-F to search in both Firefox and IE. &nbsp;And in IE, as in many other apps, &nbsp;it&#8217;s still called &#8216;find&#8217; when referring to searching for text in a single file/page/document/etc.</p>

		<p>When I started using Vista, I would try to shut the machine down by using WinKey, U, Enter, which would bring up the shutdown dialog box and confirm it. &nbsp;Vista of course had no idea what &quot;u&quot; was, since the typed character went into the neato search box. &nbsp;The new start menu is still pretty cool.</p>

		<p>I still usually do Winkey-F (together) to pull up the find stuff, but I also do Winkey, F sometimes (either because I miss the key, or whatever). Since I&#8217;m not interested in moving to Vista yet, I still use XP. I&#8217;ve been making myself switch to the &quot;new&quot; XP Start Menu over the Classic since I figure I really should get used to it. Since I go back to Win95 (Win31 even), it&#8217;s taken me a long time to get out of the habits I developed in the Win95/98 era. I still occasionally have a split second of confusion when I pull up the System control panel and can&#8217;t find the Device Manager tab.</p>

		<p>And here I thought it might have just been &quot;under the hood.&quot; &nbsp;On XP, at least, the &#8216;F&#8217; accelerator skips the &#8216;Search&#8217; menu top level and drills straight to &#8216;For &amp;Files and Folders&#8230;&#8217;</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t wondered why that menu nagged at my subconscious until now, since Windows menus don&#8217;t usually jump menu levels like that.</p>
<p>Awesome; thanks again for obscure Windows trivia.</p>

		<p>So why donât you* care of our muscle memory when doing localizations? I imprinted on the US English version (of Windows 3.1) and memorized Alt+F A as the Save As shortcut. Nowadays, the only thing one can buy** in Russia is Russian, where the same command is (key-wise) on Alt+A R.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, in Vista the Favorites folder (when displayed in the classic start menu) also has the accelerator key F.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m using the German version of Vista. I&#8217;m not sure, if this is a problem in the English version as well.</p>
<p>In XP typing Windows-key -&gt; F -&gt; G would open Google Reader. But in Vista I&#8217;m stuck at Search.</p>
<p>Maybe someone knows a way how to give the Favorites folder a unique accelerator key?</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, you can&#8217;t use the classic start menu with the new type to search functionality.</p>
<p>I prefer the classic start menu because it&#8217;s more simpler and predictable&#8211;there are fewer options to scan visually and digest, and what options there are stay in a fixed location (they don&#8217;t move around.) This also endears it to inexperienced users I find, too (7 options are a lot less intimidating than twenty plus of the XP/Vista start menus.)</p>
<p>It seems like Microsoft has been trying to copy Apple&#8217;s successes in UI design in recent years. Unfortunately, they seem to have taken the wrong lesson&#8211;lifting the bells and whistles and none of the simplicity.</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
