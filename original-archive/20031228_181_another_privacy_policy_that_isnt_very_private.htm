<p>Today I read <a href="http://www.nuveen.com/managedAccounts/PrivacyPolicy.asp">the privacy policy for Nuveen Investment Advisors</a>. I like this part:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>We do not disclose any nonpublic personal information about you to anyone, except as permitted by law.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>"Except as permitted by law". How reassuring. Is it really necessary to have an official policy promising that that you won't break the law? And actually stating that they promise to follow the law on this specific issue raises the question, "So are they willing to break the law with regard to other issues?"</p>
<p>This sentence basically means, "We reserve the right to disclose nonpublic personal information about you to the fullest extent permitted by law." </p>
<p>In particular, later in that paragraph, it states that </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>... we may disclose the information we collect, as described above, to companies that perform administrative or marketing services on our behalf...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>In other words, "We may disclose nonpublic information about you to people who will try to sell you stuff." </p>
<p>All the regulations about privacy disclosure statements hasn't actually secured anybody's privacy, since the regulations only require <i>disclosure</i>; they don't require that they actually <i>do</i> anything to protect your privacy.</p>

		<p>Are these statements also part of an opt-out policy? IOW, after reading these &quot;we&#8217;ll only share your info with everyone&quot; clauses, you can jump through various high and flaming hoops in order to request that they do not &quot;protect&quot; your &quot;privacy&quot; as indicated?</p>

		<p>There is no way to opt out. These are just &quot;This is the way it is. If you don&#8217;t like it, feel free to close your account.&quot;  I just found another privacy statement for yet another company but it&#8217;s basically the same as the one above: &quot;We will disclose your information to anybody we want.&quot;</p>

		<p>I wonder if they are aware of the laws in Europe?<br />
<br />For any European citizens, they are not allowed to keep any information in a database without the user&#8217;s permission. The user has to be able to see what information is stored in the database and change it if desired. The user has the right to request that data is removed from the database. They are not allowed by law to share any of this information without the user&#8217;s explicit permission.<br />
<br />A very strange exception is email addresses, which are not considered personal information. Europe does allow spamming with similar regulations as the US: You have to be able to opt-out. But most spamming companies don&#8217;t follow this regulation too seriously either. Many spam emails still have no opt-out possibilities, and i recently noticed a spammer (sending me the same email about 10 times per day on average) is requesting up to 72 hours to opt out, but changes web sites every few days. This means: By the time the opt-out is in effect, they have changed to a new url and you have to opt out again.</p>

		<p>There may be a bit more weasiling going on with &quot;permitted by law&quot;.</p>
<p>I suspect that that they what readers to see &quot;except as required by law&quot; (note the meaningful &quot;required&quot; as opposed to the meaningless &quot;permitted&quot;).<br /></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
