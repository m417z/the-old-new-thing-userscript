<p>
Here's a question that came from a customer.
You can answer it yourself based on what you know about modal UI.
(If you're kind of rusty on the topic,
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/tags/Modality/default.aspx">
you can catch up here</a>.)
I've left in some irrelevant details
just to make things interesting.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
Our program launches a helper program
to display an Aero Wizard
to guide the user through submitting a service request.
</p>
<pre>
theWiz.DoModal(hwndMainFrame);
</pre>
<p>
There are no <code>EnableWindow</code> calls leading up to
or returning from this call.
the <code>DoModal</code> handles things nicely.
</p>
<p>
When the user clicks "Cancel" to cancel the service request,
we use a TaskDialog so we can get the new look for our confirmation
message box.
The task dialog setup goes like this:
</p>
<pre>
TASKDIALOGCONFIG config = { 0 };
config.cbSize = sizeof(config);
config.hwndParent = hwndMainFrame;
</pre>
<p>
When the user clicks "Yes" to cancel,
then another window instead of our frame becomes active.
</p>
<p>
On a hunch, I replaced the task dialog with a Win32 message box
</p>
<pre>
MessageBox(hwndMainFrame, ...);
</pre>
<p>
and bingo, we get the correct behavior.
When our wizard exits, the main frame receives focus.
</p>
<p>
I believe that the "automatic" modal behavior that comes
with <code>DoModal()</code> that takes care of disabling
and reenabling the main frame is somehow getting short-circuited
by using <code>TaskDialog</code> from inside our
<code>PSM_QUERYCANCEL</code> message handler.
</p>
<p>
Right now, we've switched to <code>MessageBox</code>,
but we would much prefer to use the task dialog.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Although it's not common,
it is legal to have a window's parent or owner
belongs to another thread or process.
But it definitely makes things a bit more tricky to manage
because it attaches the input queues of the two threads,
and you now have two threads co&ouml;perating to manage a single
window hierarchy.
</p>
<p>
Is the cross-process window hierarchy a contributing factor
to the problem, or is it just a red herring?</p>

		<p>From what I understand of the description of the problem, I think the TaskDialog should have used the Aero Wizard as its parent. This is assuming the cancel handling is done in the Wizard, prior to closing it. (The description of the workflow strongly implies that the confirmation is done before closing the wizard.)</p>
<p>I don&#39;t understand why MessageBox() works properly. Maybe it automatically detects that the parent is disabled and search for its active child?</p>

		<p>I&#39;m assuming that the call to the wizard&#39;s DoModal() with hwndMainFrame as a parameter is setting hwndMainFrame as the owner of the modal wizard (if that&#39;s not the case, then never mind this whole thing). &nbsp;The TaskDialog is setting hwndMainFrame as its parent. &nbsp;This means that there&#39;s two different dialogs that have the same owner, unless I&#39;m getting myself confused by the differences between parent and owner. &nbsp;When the TaskDialog closes, it may re-enable and switch back to its owner, which is supposed to still be disabled and waiting on the wizard. &nbsp;That seems like it&#39;s guaranteed to lead to strange behavior.</p>

		<p>I, too, would like clarification on whether the task dialog is shown prior to dismissing the wizard. &nbsp;If so, then the task dialog&#39;s parent should be the wizard, not the original program. &nbsp;Then the task dialog should return activation to the wizard which would in turn return it to the main window.</p>
<p>But I&#39;m not sure why the message box works when the task dialog doesn&#39;t.</p>

		<p>The Wikipedia entry also states that its use is uncommon in English, stating that it is optional. &nbsp;I also don&#39;t read The New Yorker or the MIT Technology Review. &nbsp;And since I have a German background and took German language classes way back in high school I naturally think it&#39;s an umlaut. &nbsp;But then in English that would have been written differently.</p>

<p>FTFY ;-)</p>
<p>Regarding the actual question, in my own code, it would most likely be that I forgot to pass <code>config</code> along to code that was expecting it, and MessageBox would work because it didn&#39;t need the config.</p>

		<p>Raymond may be channeling the New Yorker magazine which sticks to the diaresis on cooperate and coordinate, even though most magazines and newspapers have dropped the use. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t think the English language had more than twenty-six letters, with no diacritical marks or accents &#8212; that&#39;s what I learned in elementary school. &nbsp;But there&#39;s amoeba, and diarrhoea, where oe is combined into one letter in older writings.</p>

		<p>Another process has the active Window and wants to give it away to another window?</p>
<p>I think calling AllowSetForegroundWindow should do the trick.</p>

		<p>Mmmm. I&#39;m reading this in a tabbed IE frame. There are three tabs and four IE processes running, making me wonder if this is a case of a window&#39;s parent or owner belonging to another process.</p>

		<p>Totally unrelated, but I just went to a search engine to try to find one of your articles for a co-worker. I didn&#39;t narrow to search to &quot;blogs.msdn.com&quot;, however.

		<p>My guess: The TaskDialog is trying to set an owner window which is still disabled by the wizard. Maybe TaskDialog skips the EnableWindow/SetFocus calls for such a window while MessageBox doesn&#39;t.</p>

		<p>Please can we learn to co-operate with Raymond? Thanks.</p>
<p>I remember a bug in Windows 3.1 where the last active popup didn&#39;t get updated for a background window with a nested dialog. In particular we used an app framework whose default print preview was in a popup and you could trigger the bug by switching away from the app while the print progress dialog (which closed automatically when it had finished printing) was active. In Windows 95 the bug was alleviated by setting the last active popup to NULL, and the bug was completely fixed in at least Windows 2000 (it may have been fixed in prior Windows NT versions but I didn&#39;t test it there.)</p>

		<p>As presented, this problem makes no sense. MessageBox and TaskDialog both implement a a modal popup. With the same parent window being specified, and with both being called from the PSM_QUERYCANCEL message the behavior of the application should be the same. Unless TaskDialog and MessageBox have internal differences in how they implement their modality. Cross process is also a red herring as, again, both examples are doing the same cross process things the same way. Which means there is some undisclosed piece of information that makes one of the scenarios not modal, or it was actually the Butler, in the pantry, with the serving fork.</p>

		<p>Yeah, I think the &quot;irrelevant details&quot; only wound up making the whole exercise more confusing, maybe that&#39;s the point since this is a real world situation? It seems the obvious correct answer is that the incorrect window is specified for hwndParent, as many have pointed out; however, that simple answer is now completely overshadowed by the &quot;irrelevant details&quot; on why there&#39;s a difference between TaskDialog and MessageBox (I&#39;m leaning towards Pierre&#39;s theory), and how the use of incorrect hwndParent ultimately leads to the wrong window becoming active (perhaps a surface symptom of a more serious issue triggered by hwndMainFrame being re-enabled prematurely?)</p>
<p>And it&#39;s amusing that the whole *topic* itself was for a short time sidetracked by the irrelevant topic of diaeresis. Yeah, this blog entry has become more interesting all right, for better or for worse. :p</p>

<p>&quot;If you are displaying a modal dialog from another modal dialog, it is important to pass the correct window as the owner for the second dialog.&quot;</p>

Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
