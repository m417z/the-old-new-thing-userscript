<p>
If you want to find an SDK sample
that uses a particular feature of the
Universal Windows Platform,
you can try
my Windows Universal Samples API concordance on
<a href="http://oldnewthing.github.io/Windows-universal-samples/">
http://oldnewthing.github.io/Windows-universal-samples/</a>.
Expand the tree view to find the thing you're interested in,
and it will provide links to every line of C# code that uses it.</p>
<p>
The following deep links are also supported:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Link to a namespace:
<a href="http://oldnewthing.github.io/Windows-universal-samples/?Windows.Devices.Geolocation">
http://oldnewthing.github.io/Windows-universal-samples/?Windows.Devices.Geolocation</a>
</li>
<li>Link to a class, structure, or enumeration:
<a href="http://oldnewthing.github.io/Windows-universal-samples/?Windows.Globalization.Calendar">
http://oldnewthing.github.io/Windows-universal-samples/?Windows.Globalization.Calendar</a>
</li>
<li>Link to a property or event or enumerated value:
<a href="http://oldnewthing.github.io/Windows-universal-samples/?Windows.Graphics.Display.DisplayInformation.AutoRotationPreferences">
http://oldnewthing.github.io/Windows-universal-samples/?Windows.Graphics.Display.DisplayInformation.AutoRotationPreferences</a>
</li>
<li>Linking to a method is a little trickier, because you need to append
    a backquote, then the number of parameters.
    This is used to disambiguate overloaded methods.
<a href="http://oldnewthing.github.io/Windows-universal-samples/?Windows.Storage.StorageFile.GetThumbnailAsync%602">
http://oldnewthing.github.io/Windows-universal-samples/?Windows.Storage.StorageFile.GetThumbnailAsync`2</a>
</li>
<li>Linking to a constructor is the same as linking to a method,
    except that you use the special method name <code>:ctor</code>.
<a href="http://oldnewthing.github.io/Windows-universal-samples/?Windows.UI.Notifications.BadgeNotification.:ctor%601">
http://oldnewthing.github.io/Windows-universal-samples/?Windows.UI.Notifications.BadgeNotification.:ctor`1</a>
</li>
</ul>
<p>
I will try to keep this site in sync with the latest release of the
<a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/">
Windows Universal Samples</a> repo.
The site is kind of ugly right now, but it works just barely well
enough to do what I needed.
</p>
<p>
Note that the concordance is not complete.
There are holes in the analysis which I hope to fill
in over time.
But at least it's a decent start.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, I'll blog about the program I used to generate this
information.
The short answer is
<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn">
Roslyn</a>.
That's why it searches only in C# samples.

		<p>Still not working in FireFox after the initial fix. If I go to &quot;<a href="http://oldnewthing.github.io/Windows-universal-samples/&quot;" rel="nofollow" target="_new">oldnewthing.github.io/&#8230;/&quot;</a> right now, I see a bullet point with the text &quot;Windows&quot;.

		<p>It&#39;s too bad that Roslyn doesn&#39;t support C++. &nbsp;An open Windows C++ compiler would be nice. &nbsp;(I don&#39;t count GCC or Clang as Windows compilers because they don&#39;t support __try.)</p>

		<p>@Myria:</p>
<p>Clang is trying.</p>
<p>It actually supports __try/__catch/__finally on x64, but not on x86 yet. There are still a few issues, but from the documentation itself, it is being worked on.</p>
<p>Of course this doesn&#39;t change the fact that SEH isn&#39;t fully supported right now, but I just wanted to raise awareness that Clang is trying to be a proper Windows compiler.</p>

		<p>@Darran, @Myria:</p>
<p>SEH is supported in Clang on Windows via the Embarcadero C++ compiler shipped with C++Builder (both 32 and x64.) &nbsp;They contribute back the source too, of course. &nbsp;Hopefully the Clang team will integrate it at some point.</p>

<p>&gt;&gt;It&#39;s also too bad that I feel like Microsoft is deprecating desktop applications.</p>
<p>Then you clearly haven&#39;t been paying attention. &nbsp;I&#39;m a WPF developer and couldn&#39;t build a web application to save my life and I see many good years of development ahead of me.</p>
<p>Sure, there is a lot of focus on script and web because they are still reinventing the way it&#39;s done since they haven&#39;t got it right after all these years of trying.</p>
<p>As far as Microsoft is concerned, they&#39;ve been investing heavily in WPF and XAML/Universal apps recently. &nbsp;I mean, their flagship IDE is written in WPF. &nbsp;Desktop is going nowhere fast.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
