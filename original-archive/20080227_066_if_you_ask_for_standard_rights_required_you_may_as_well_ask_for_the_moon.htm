<p>
One of the predefined security access masks is
<code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code>.
You see it used in defining the <code>_ALL_ACCESS</code> masks for
various objects.
Here are just a few examples:
</p>
<pre>
#define PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS        (STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED | SYNCHRONIZE | \
                                   0xFFF)
#define EVENT_ALL_ACCESS (STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED|SYNCHRONIZE|0x3)
#define FILE_ALL_ACCESS (STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED | SYNCHRONIZE | 0x1FF)
</pre>
<p>
The <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code> mask is meant to be used
when defining access masks for object types.
I'm guessing it's called <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code> because
it's the set of access masks that all securable objects must support.
<a HREF="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa379607.aspx">
Look at the documentation</a>
or just at the definition:
</p>
<pre>
#define DELETE                           (0x00010000L)
#define READ_CONTROL                     (0x00020000L)
#define WRITE_DAC                        (0x00040000L)
#define WRITE_OWNER                      (0x00080000L)

#define STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED         (0x000F0000L)
</pre>
<p>
Notice that <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code> is just
an abbreviation for the union of the four access bits
<code>DELETE | READ_CONTROL | WRITE_DAC | WRITE_OWNER</code>.
</p>
<p>
Now that you see what it's for,
you can also see what it's <strong>not</strong> for:
You're not expected to pass it as the mask of <strong>requested</strong>
access bits when you attempt to open an object.
In other words, the following is wrong:
</p>
<pre>
<i>// wrong!
HANDLE hProcess =
    OpenProcess(dwProcessId, FALSE,
                STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED | PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION);</i>
</pre>
<p>
The person writing this code probably thought,
"Well, I just want to be able to query information, so I need to
pass <code>PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION</code>.
There's this other thing here called <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code>;
since it's required, I'll pass that too."
</p>
<p>
The "required"ness of <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code> doesn't
apply to you, the program opening the object.
It applies to the person who is designing the object.
</p>
<p>
Your attempt to be a "good security citizen" and ask only for the
access you need (namely, <code>PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION</code>)
has backfired due to the addition of <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code>.
If you ask for
<code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code>,
you are asking for <strong>everything</strong>.
</p>
<p>
Why is that?
Notice that <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code> includes
<code>WRITE_DAC</code>.
If you have <code>WRITE_DAC</code> permission, that means that you
have permission to
change the security descriptor on the object,
at which point you totally 0wnz0r it.
You want <code>PROCESS_VM_WRITE</code> access but the security
descriptor doesn't let you?
No problem.
Just set a new security descriptor that grants you
<code>PROCESS_ALL_ACCESS</code> to the process object.
Tada! You now have all the access in the world.
</p>
<p>
Moral of the story:
Don't ask for <code>STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED</code>,
because only somebody with full control will be able to get it.
Ask for what you actually want.</p>

		<p>While I understand that users of the API would think they need to pass that in because of the name, a little bit of critical thinking reveals otherwise. If it was really required to be passed in, omitting it would cause the function to return and set the invalid parameter error code.</p>
<p>Keeping a tiny little solution off to the side for these sorts of &#8216;experiments&#8217; is invaluable.</p>

		<p>One of the culprits is the wording of the documentation. This extract comes from the DuplicateHandle() page:</p>
<p>In addition to STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED, the following access rights can be specified in the dwDesiredAccess parameter for the different object types:</p>

<p>Exactly. I used to always take that to mean, &quot;STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED must be combined with whatever other access rights you specify.&quot;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m waiting for the day when they&#8217;ll replace STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED with MAXIXUM_ALLOWED for some of the XXX_ALL_ACCESS constants, which would &nbsp;instantly fix all LUA problems with the CreateXXX() routines.</p>

		<p>Well, STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED isn&#8217;t really MAXIMUM_ALLOWED. Basically, it is the set of all permissions that an object must understand. Some objects understand other permissions in addition to the ones specified in STANDARD_RIGHTS_REQUIRED. For example, a file could have a permission bit for setting attributes, which doesn&#8217;t make sense for registry keys, and the registry could have a permission bit for enumerating values, which doesn&#8217;t make sense for a file. The mapping between the standard rights and the object-specific rights always gives me a headache.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
