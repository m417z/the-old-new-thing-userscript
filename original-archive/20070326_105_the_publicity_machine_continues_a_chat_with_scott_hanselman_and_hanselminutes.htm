<p> I haven't had the nerve to listen to it myself. I hope I came off okay. </p>
<p> In other self-promotion news (did I mention yet that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/07/1233002.aspx"> I wrote a book</a>?), it looks like I will be in Palo Alto on April 21 for a family event, and I'll likely spend the 20th visiting Microsoft's Silicon Valley Campus. If you'd like me to pay a visit to your user group or whatever, let me know. </p>

		<p>Listening to it now. So far so good. The interviewer is much better than the .Net rocks interviewers were.</p>

		<p>OK I listened to the whole thing and it was definitely better than the .Net Rocks interview for me. Mostly because the interviewer asked questions that were interesting questions in the first place and understood your answers well enough to keep the interview flowing. Where as the .Net Rocks interview you had to carry the interview on your own this was much smoother with both parties keeping a good question and answer series going. The stories you got into were interesting as well like the black icons, the png format of icons in Vista, where MSFT Bob is in Windows XP, etc. All in all very good entertainment. Not too deep, but not too shallow either, it seemed well balanced.</p>

		<p>The &quot;interviewer&quot; thanks you! ;) Raymond, it was a pleasure to chat with you, and I wish we could have played the additional 20 minutes of random banter before and after the actual interview! If you ever get famous for Stand Up Comedy, I&#8217;ll be happy to open for you. :)</p>

		<p>Raymond, you MUST tell us how to get Microsoft Bob off the WinXP CD!</p>
<p>At least tell us how to get the data&#8230; the community here will pitch in (I&#8217;m sure) to brute-force the decryption key.</p>

		<p>Irrelevant linguistic digression&#8230;</p>
<p>Did you know that you have a voiceless w in &#8220;while&#8221;? &nbsp;(At 15:58 in the Hanselminutes recording.) &nbsp;It&#8217;s pretty uncommon to hear speakers of English who still observe that distinction: &nbsp;it&#8217;s in my dialect (Upper Midwestern US) but I think it&#8217;s entirely dead in most of the English-speaking world, where /hw/ has entirely merged with /w/ even in stressed syllables.</p>

		<p>Wow, that was awesome. Nice.</p>
<p>You know, Ramond, you should just ignore the people who require your nit-picks. You&#8217;re so much more fun when you just roll with it.</p>

		<p>As usual with Raymond interviews, you need to wait through a bunch of crud first: but this time it breaks with tradition by not being ten minutes in, the content starts at just 1:20, after the ad by the bored guy who sounds like he&#8217;s thinking &quot;I&#8217;m selling my soul for WHAT?&quot;.</p>
<p>Best one so far, this one :) Agree with the other comments that as an interviewer, he was great. But Raymond was also great here &#8211; took the answers and ran with them at tangents to deliver plenty of storytelling goodness :)</p>

		<p>Did anyone else have an old keyboard nearby when Raymond was talking about how the &quot;print screen&quot; button was on the Asterisk? &nbsp;&quot;Google for pictures,&quot; ha! &nbsp;I&#8217;ve got the real thing right here!</p>
<p>(This is not a nitpick, perhaps a brag?)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
