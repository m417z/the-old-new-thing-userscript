<p>As if there isn't enough to worry about.</p>
<p>  Everyone knows about the dangers of open SMTP relays.  But how many people realize the dangers of an open HTTP relay?  </p>
<p>  Many web sites do arbitrary redirection.  If I were a spammer,  I could create a link to myself that  redirects through some well-known web sites,  thereby granting my spam link false authenticity.  </p>
<p>  <code>  <a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/*-http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/">  http://rds.yahoo.com/*-http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/</a><br>  <a href="http://ads.msn.com/ads/adredir.asp?url=/oldnewthing/">  http://ads.msn.com/ads/adredir.asp?url=/oldnewthing/</a>  </code>  </p>
<p>  With some obfuscatory work, I can make my own URL disappear completely,  leaving just yours.  </p>
<p><code>  <a href="http://rds.yahoo.com/*-http://%77e%62l%6fg%73.%61s%70.%6ee%74/%6fl%64n%65w%74h%69n%67/">  http://rds.yahoo.com/*-http://%77e%62l%6fg%73.%61s%70.%6ee%74/%6fl%64n%65w%74h%69n%67/</a><br>  <a href="http://ads.msn.com/ads/adredir.asp?url=http://%77e%62l%6fg%73.%61s%70.%6ee%74/%6fl%64n%65w%74h%69n%67/">  http://ads.msn.com/ads/adredir.asp?url=http://%77e%62l%6fg%73.%61s%70.%6ee%74/%6fl%64n%65w%74h%69n%67/</a>  </code></p>
<p>  What does this mean for you, the redirector?  </p>
<ul>
<li>It creates additional load on your server.  </li>
<li>It makes Bayesian filters think that your site is spam,  since your site's name appears in spam URLs.  This can cause problems if you intend to send legitimate mail  to your customers.  </li>
<li>It can fool people into thinking that your site is the  source of the spam.  </li>
</ul>
<p>  The two examples I gave above are the big guys who are being  attacked by spammers on all sides.  In fact, their names are  co-opted by spammers so much that some spam redirection URLs  probably don't affect their Bayesian rating significantly.  But if you're a small site that also has unchecked redirection,  you may want to take a closer look.  </p>

		<p>This seems like a good place to report the problems i had with internet connection sharing.<br />
<br />I turned this on on Windows 2000, and because of that i had an open SMTP relay. Of course very soon spammers found and uused it.<br />
<br />I have until today not found any way to disable the open relay without turning the internet connection sharing off  completely. Which is the solution i have chosen.<br /></p>

		<p>Yet another feature that webservers have that shouldn&#8217;t be there in the first place.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure someone, somewhere, can come up with some legitimate sounding reason/excuse of why a webserver would want to support redirection.  But I can&#8217;t think of any reason why it should be turned on by default.</p>
<p>Click tracking for search engines.  Click tracking for Ads.</p>
<p>The advertising model for the web creates such stupid problems.</p>

<p>how about configuring the smtp relay in the smtp servers properties (which can be found in the iis admin console?)</p>
<p>works just fine. :)</p>

		<p>If you really want to obfuscate your URL, use hex, octal, or binary encodings, rather than just URL-encoding the letters.  Binary looks really cool. ;-)</p>
<p>Another great one is the &#8216;@&quot; trick:</p>
<p><a target="_new" href="http://www.wallace.net@weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/12/130454.aspx#FeedBack" rel="nofollow">http://www.wallace.net@weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/12/130454.aspx#FeedBack</a></p>
<p>If you extend the URL part way way out (400 characters), the user may not be able to see it, even if the URL is tooltipped or in the status bar)</p>
<p>This link has lots of fun tricks:</p>
<p><a target="_new" href="http://www.searchlores.org/obscure.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.searchlores.org/obscure.htm</a></p>
<p>(the rest of the site is amazing as well)</p>

		<p>Thomas:<br />
<br />are you sure it works?<br />
<br />I had disabled SMTP completely, but still had an open SMTP relay.<br />
<br />Reminds me of a company where i used to work, where we has proxy server installed.<br />
<br />There was a whole load of hackers (mostly from Pakistan) using our server for spoofing.<br />
<br />They were using the socks proxy.<br />
<br />The permissions on the proxy were set correctly, but they could still get in.<br />
<br />We disabled the socks proxy service, but this service was in the same exacutable of the other proxies, and even with socks proxy disabled, they could still use it.</p>

		<p>In reply to Mark Wallace:</p>
<p>The problem with the @ trick is that it doesn&#8217;t work in IE if you have the latest patches applied (a hotfix from a couple of months completely removed support for usernames and passwords encoded in URLs).</p>
<p>In my recent Mozilla nightly, going to <a target="_new" href="http://www.wallace.net@weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/12/130454.aspx#FeedBack" rel="nofollow">http://www.wallace.net@weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/12/130454.aspx#FeedBack</a>  presents the following dialogue:</p>
<p>You are about to log into the site &quot;weblogs.asp.net&quot; with the user &quot;www%2Ewallace%2Enet,&quot; but the website does not require authentication. This may be an attempt to trick you.</p>
<p>Is &quot;weblogs.asp.net&quot; the site you want to visit?</p>
<p>[Yes] [No]</p>

		<p>Ayup, Opera does the same thing, prompting you about the @ thing.  Of course, your average clueless user might just say &quot;yes&quot;.</p>
<p>What happens if the web site does send back an authentication request (but a bogus one which allows any username/password in, as long as you provide one)?</p>

		<p>I hated it when sites started redirecting through themselves (mostly search engines) in order to determine what links were &quot;best&quot;&#8230; because every redirection was another two seconds on my slow connection&#8230; so I started coding Proxomitron filters to explicitly remove those.</p>
<p>But not to remove all: Yahoo self-links are removed only for content that came from *.yahoo.com.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the Yahoo filter:</p>
<p>Name = &quot;Remove self-links: Yahoo&quot;<br />
<br />Active = TRUE<br />
<br />URL = &quot;*.yahoo.com&quot;<br />
<br />Bounds = &quot;&lt;as*&gt;&quot;<br />
<br />Limit = 512<br />
<br />Match = &quot;1 href=&quot;*yahoo.com/*(*|?)([a-zA-Z]+://*)2&#8217;3&quot;<br />
<br />Replace = &quot;1 href=&quot;2&quot;3&quot;</p>
<p>Perfect?  No.  But it&#8217;s picky enough it shouldn&#8217;t have false positives.  And it means when I look at the URL a link is about to take me to, I can see the real URL &#8212; unless it&#8217;s something like the relay, in which case I&#8217;ll see a really long thing and think twice.</p>
<p>But really, it&#8217;s just like not opening email from random people.  Think before you click.  (*shudder* that sounds way too clicheesque)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d have to say that IE does the right thing by not even giving you a choice. Too many people would just say yes. Very few users can really make an informed decision when any kind of security dialog comes up.</p>

		<p>Raymond (and many others) already written a LOT about people who blindly click yes to dialog boxes.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve actually done usability studies on this:  When a dialog like this comes up, people don&#8217;t actually read the words in the dialog box.  Instead, they either dismiss the dialog box without even reading it, or their mind sees &quot;Do you want get your work done?&quot;.</p>
<p>The answer to that question is always &quot;Yes&quot;.</p>
<p>So they make the wrong choice.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s become distressingly clear that any interaction that involves security is too important to involve user choice.<br /></p>

		<p>Microsoft and Yahoo are not merely victims of spammers using Microsoft&#8217;s and Yahoo&#8217;s redirectors.  Microsoft replies to complaints by saying that the spam doesn&#8217;t reference an MSN account, so Microsoft will not take any action.  Yahoo replies with different garbage.  Microsoft and Yahoo then become active cooperators with the spammers, continuing to provide redirection service instead of excluding those sites even when they have been informed of it.</p>
<p>(Also Microsoft and Yahoo have hosted spammers&#8217; web sites on their own servers and have sent replies stating their refusal to stop.  But someone will probably say the base note is about redirection not spamming&#8230;)</p>

		<p>Henk,</p>
<p>i&#8217;m pretty sure it works over here cause i verified this multiple times.</p>
<p>however, i am <em>not</em> using this with internet connection sharing but with rras/nat (on 2003 server) &#8211; which does the same thing, but (imo) has more flebility in how the beast is set up.</p>
<p>i did have a 2k box /w smtp services running and relaying disabled which also worked reliably.</p>

		<p>Doug,</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not &quot;another feature that webservers have that shouldn&#8217;t be there in the first place&quot;, since it&#8217;s not specifically a &quot;feature&quot; of the webserver.</p>
<p>Sure, you can cause a redirect by returning a 3xx HTTP result code from the server, but there are other ways to do it, for example META REFRESH in your HTML page.</p>
<p>As for legitimate reasons: disallowing transparent redirections (via 3xx codes) would discourage a website from periodically reorganising its pages.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll agree that using a redirection script for click-tracking is hard to justify, but the real problem here is that the redirection script doesn&#8217;t validate the destination.  A potentially more sensible redirection script would take a unique ID and map it to the URL using a database.  This would prevent abuse by third parties.</p>
<p></p>

		<p>You don&#8217;t even need to generate IDs. Just keep a list of valid redirection targets. The redirection script can check whether the target is on the list (or, if you want to save space, use hashes). This is not unreasonable for smaller sites which may have only a few thousand redirection targets.</p>
<p>Norman: I&#8217;m not sure why you&#8217;re complaining to me.</p>

		<p>Thomas:</p>
<p>Are you really sure it works?<br />
<br />Because the situation i had was like this:<br />
<br />Utilities that list open ports said the port was not open.<br />
<br />I could connect ot the port with telnet, but then the connection was closed instantatiously.<br />
<br />But running a port scanner did indicate the port as open, and i got a complaint from my ISP that i had an open relay. On my request they send me a copy of an email that had actually ben relayed through my computer (because first i didn&#8217;t believe them).<br />
<br />Of course if you have Windows 2003, it could very well be fixed by now.</p>

		<p>About a year or so ago, Slashdot made a change whereas a link within a comment would automatically have the domain printed next to it, like so: </p>
<p>&lt;a&gt;link&lt;/a&gt; [microsoft.com].</p>
<p>This was to protect people from the trolls who would trick people into visiting distasteful sites, a la goatse.cx (no longer).</p>
<p>Now days, the trolls are using the redirectors from a trusted domain to fool people all over again.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
