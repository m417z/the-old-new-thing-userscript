While I was
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/05/10/10303506.aspx">
looking for spelling errors in the registry</a>,
I ran across the strange registry key
<code>HKEY_<wbr>CLASSES_<wbr>ROOT\<wbr>CLSID\<wbr>CLSID</code>,
which has as its default value the stringified GUID
<code>{0000031A-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}</code>.
I asked the COM folks what the deal was with that.
</p>
<p>
They explained,
"It's the progid for the class moniker."
</p>
<p>
That was enough to push me in the right direction,
and it made my brain explode from the meta-ness of it all.
Sort of like when you study Category Theory in math class.
</p>
<p>
If you want to connect a COM class ID with a programmatic ID,
you cross-link them like this:
</p>
<pre>
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\<span STYLE="border: solid .75pt black">{clsid}</span>\ProgId]
@="<span STYLE="border: solid .75pt black">progid</span>"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\<span STYLE="border: solid .75pt black">progid</span>\CLSID]
@="<span STYLE="border: solid .75pt black">{clsid}</span>"
</pre>
<p>
The class ID is a child of
<code>HKEY_<wbr>CLASSES_<wbr>ROOT\<wbr>CLSID</code>,
and it in turn has a <code>ProgId</code> subkey whose value
is the programmatic ID.
Meanwhile, the programmatic ID is a child of
<code>HKEY_<wbr>CLASSES_<wbr>ROOT</code>,
and it in turn has a <code>CLSID</code> subkey whose value
is the class ID.
</p>
<p>
Here's where things get weird:
The programmatic ID for the class moniker is <code>CLSID</code>.
</p>
<p>
Plug that into the above formula, and you get
</p>
<pre>
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\CLSID\<span STYLE="border: solid .75pt black">{0000031A-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}</span>\ProgId]
@="<span STYLE="border: solid .75pt black">CLSID</span>"

[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\<span STYLE="border: solid .75pt black">CLSID</span>\CLSID]
@="<span STYLE="border: solid .75pt black">{0000031A-0000-0000-C000-000000000046}</span>"
</pre>
<p>
So it's all legit.
It just looks weird.
</p>
<p>
It's like that trick on the 80386 where you set a page directory entry
to point back to the page directory itself,
thereby allowing you to
<a HREF="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/xzibit-yo-dawg">
access page tables through the page table</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
It frustrates me when I answer a question by merely giving a push
in the right direction,
and the person doesn't realize that it was a helpful push
and just comes back looking for more
hand-holding.
I try not to be that person.</p>

		<p>@Joshua, all the basic COM guids are like that. &nbsp;They&#39;re not regular guids, they&#39;re magic numbers. &nbsp;Sun did the same thing with Java in a couple of places; each patch level of Java creates HKCRCLSID{CAFEEFAC-00jn-00pp&#8212;bb-ABCDEFFEDCBA} where jnppbb maps to a version of the Java plug-in as follows: &nbsp;j.n.pp_bb.</p>

		<p>When I was writing an 80386 operating system in college, we tried the mentioned page directory trick, but it did not actually work. I seem to remember that the format of page directory entries and page table entries are ALMOST identical, except for one bit which is &quot;must always be 0&quot; in PTEs and &quot;reserved for system use&quot; in PDEs (or maybe vice versa). Since it turned out that the system in fact set this bit to 1 pretty often (we never did figure out why), we couldn&#39;t use the same page for both. Which was too bad, because it would have been pretty convenient.</p>

		<p>&quot;So it&#39;s all legit. It just looks weird.&quot;</p>
<p>In legal studies, such a thing is called &quot;gaming the system&quot;, an attempt to adhere to the word of the law, rule or guideline but to defy its spirit. But in computing, it is called a &quot;hack&quot;, until someone pops up and says &quot;Hi, I am a program that is being uninstalled; I want to remove my ProgID from the Registry. My ProgID is &#39;CLSID&#39;.&quot; and Windows says &quot;Sure. There goes the entire CLSID key.&quot; Then, it becomes a security vulnerability.</p>
<p>That was just an example that never happens but I do know of hacks that have turned into security vulnerability.</p>

		<p>@Ian, a Moniker is a fairly simple concept, it is a representation of a COM object or resource, either through a string (which needs to be passed to MkParseDisplayName) or an IMoniker interface but it isn&#39;t actually the object itself. It is just a way of naming that object, hence a moniker, a name to refer to the object. When you bind the moniker (through IMoniker::BindToObject or IMoniker::BindToStorage) what you get back is the object the moniker referred to. For example the Class moniker returns a new COM object loaded through CoCreateInstance, the OBJREF moniker returns an unmarshalled COM object, the URL or FILE monikers returns either an IStream of the resource or it applies the usual filename extension CLSID binding rules and returns you an instance of that object initialized through IPersist*. Actually I take it all back, it isn&#39;t a simple concept at all, don&#39;t get me started on moniker composition.</p>
<p>You can still see the Class Moniker in the &#39;classid&#39; attribute of the IE OBJECT element, in the historical past (i.e. pre-XP SP2 IE) you could specify any moniker you liked in that attribute, but that was rightly considered a security problem :) I doubt very much the moniker system is actually directly used for the classid attribute in modern versions.</p>

		<p>In the mid-90s i was trying to read about COM. But all i remember the endless amounts of the work &quot;moniker&quot;. i never understood what a moniker was, what it was doing, and why it exists.</p>
<p>A decade ago i read Don Box&#39;s *excellent* book on COM, that explains the rationale behind COM. COM is now obvious and intuitiave to me. ClassIDs, ProgIDs, the four exports of every COM dll, CanUnloadNow, regsvr32, all of it.</p>
<p>Except &quot;moniker&quot;, i have no idea what that means. Nor do i know what functionality clsid class might provide, or to whom. A COM object is created by calling CoCreateInstance, i don&#39;t know what else there is.</p>

<p>Anyways, too bad they didn&#39;t use something like {00000050-0052-004F-0047-004900440000} as the CLSID.</p>

		<p>@NoP: I think that is RobLeit&#39;s point. There&#39;s no point sounding the &quot;security vulnerability&quot; alarm for the case of a malicious uninstaller removing the entire CLSID key, because we expect that a malicious uninstaller will be running with administrative credentials and able to do anything it wants.</p>

		<p>&quot;We did this in Windows 95&quot; is somewhat of an understatement.</p>
<p>Windows does this is *EVERY* x86-64 system from 32-bit Windows 95 through to 64-bit Windows 8.1. The tables look different on x64, but the trick of mapping directories to tables is used ubiquitously everywhere.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
