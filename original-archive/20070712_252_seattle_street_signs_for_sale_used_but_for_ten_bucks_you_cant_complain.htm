<p>The city of Seattle has begun a nine-year program of upgrading its street signs, and the city has decided to make the old signs available to the public for purchase. When you see the signs on your street replaced, you can go to the <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/transportation/buy_a_sign.htm"> Buy a Sign</a> page to buy the old one. It looks like signs in average condition are going for $10, whereas signs in below average condition go for $5.</p>
<p> <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003784544_webstreetsigns11m.html"> Unsold signs will be turned to scrap</a>. Signs for famous streets such as Pike and Pine will be auctioned off on eBay. </p>
<p> If street signs aren't your thing, you can <a href="http://www.seattle.gov/warehousing/saleitems.htm"> buy old parking meters for $10&ndash;$15</a> (listed under "Miscellaneous"). </p>

		<p>Wow, they&#8217;re also selling &quot;Used video tapes&quot; for 2.5 cents each! &nbsp; It&#8217;d be worth buying a few hundred just to see what&#8217;s on them.</p>
<p>Would be better than watching reality TV.</p>

		<p>Actually I can see the appeal in buying a parking meter. &nbsp;Not so much a street sign, though. &nbsp;But then I love gizmos :)</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Gabest, what does being made of aluminum have to do with anything? Do you mean people frequently steal aluminum things, moreso than other metals? If so, why?</p>
<p>I mean street signs get stolen in the US, too, but mostly just to be hung up in college dorm rooms. Then again, we make them out of steel, so who knows.</p>
<p>(I know copper&#8217;s valuable, and fiber optic cable is worth tons, but I never really thought of aluminum as theft-worthy.)</p>

<p>Especially over commentators changing his gender.</p>
<p>I wonder if Redmond does the same? I&#8217;d like to pick up a genuine &quot;Microsoft Way&quot; sign.</p>

		<p>James Schend: It is valuable, sells on the price as copper (1-2 dollars / kg currently). There are very poor people on the country who would do anything&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
