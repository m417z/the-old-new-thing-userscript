<p>Answer: Your wallet is empty.</p>
<p> Seriously, there is no way you bought an Itanium by mistake. They are expensive machines: The entry-level workstation available from HP (who co-developed the Itanium with Intel) goes for over $3000 and the entry-level server is over $13,000. And in addition to paying for the computer itself, you probably had to install a custom air conditioning system for your building to keep it cool. </p>
<p> If you still aren't sure whether you have one, go to Help.About in Explorer. At the top of the About box, it will say "Windows XP 64-Bit Edition" if you have it. </p>

		<p>The real question is: How do I tell programmatically if I am running on a 64-bit box?</p>

		<p>$3,000 for an itanium box. Criminy. I own a computer shop and just built an Opteron for for a customer a third of that. He&#8217;s one of those &quot;gotta have the biggest, baddest, fastest&#8230;&quot; guys and understands that it will be a bit before there is a 64-bit OS for him.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s not get into an AMD vs. Intel war. I&#8217;m actually an Intel fan.</p>

		<p>Most of the time you shouldn&#8217;t be trying to detect whether you are running on a true 32-bit machine or on a 64-bit machine via emulation &#8211; just let the emulator do its thing.</p>
<p>If you really need to check, call IsWow64Process. But use this power only for good, not for evil!</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s a shame HP strangled the Alpha AXP CPU that they acquired from DEC by way of Compaq.</p>
<p>Raymond, care to comment on the rumour that Microsoft had an internal version of Windows NT running on Sparc? ;-)</p>

		<p>To John Topley:</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t blame HP for strangling Alpha.  At a time when DEC was selling Alphas (or pretending to do so), and Intel was selling 32-bit microprocessors, DEC published a newspaper advertisement saying that Intel&#8217;s microprocessors were the best in the business.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not the reason why DEC died of course, but it sure didn&#8217;t help any.  DEC was DEC&#8217;s worst enemy in many ways.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
