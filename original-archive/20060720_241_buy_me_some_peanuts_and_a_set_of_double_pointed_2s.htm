<p>It's <a href="http://seattle.mariners.mlb.com/NASApp/mlb/sea/ticketing/stitchnpitch.jsp"> the second annual Stitch 'n Pitch at Safeco Field</a>. Stitch n' Pitch events for other cities can be found on the <a href="http://www.stitchnpitch.com/"> Stitch n' Pitch web site</a>. (Channeling Lynne Truss: Ahem, people, the spelling of the middle word is 'n' with an apostrophe fore and aft.) [10am: Fixed sepleling.]</p>
<p> Seattle Times readers <a href="http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=satlets30&amp;date=20050730"> Dave Butner</a> and <a href="http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=monlets01&amp;date=20050801"> Mike Wilson</a> took issue with the event (though Mr. Wilson's outrage bordered on satirical). To me, baseball is like soccer: It's a game whose primary draw is not the actual scoring but rather the anticipation that a run might be scored. It's in the tension that builds as scoring opportunities develop (most of which prove fruitless), not in the actual scoring itself. And unlike soccer, where something exciting could happen at almost any time, in baseball, there are long stretches where you can reliably predict that nothing exciting will occur. Like, say, when the pitcher is taking a walk around the mound scratching himself. In other words, baseball is a social event, not a sporting event. And if you're going to attend a social event, why not do it with people whom you share interests with? </p>
<p> It's not like I don't appreciate baseball. I know when you should perform a double-switch. I know why the catcher sometimes tags the batter with the baseball after a strikeout. I can even explain the infield fly rule. But when I attend a baseball game with friends, we don't talk about baseball the whole time. We enjoy the sunshine, catch up on each other's lives, gossip about friends who aren't present, admire some of the goofball fans in the bleachers. And enjoy a baseball game. </p>

		<p>Cricket is the same. The game may last 5 days and you know that for the majority of the game very little will happen. Sure, runs are scored, wickets are taken, and every now and then there are some moments of sublime individual skill. The real reason people watch the game though is that it&#8217;s a chance to spend a relaxing day with some friends, drink a few beers in the sun and enjoy the experience of being part of a large and good natured crowd.</p>

		<p>I thought being retentive regarding punctuation was more of a British trait. In the interest of which your apostrophe seems to move around a few times on the &#8216;n&#8217;. </p>
<p>The best bit about Cricket I&#8217;ve been told is that the tickets aren&#8217;t offensively expensive as they often are for other sports.</p>

		<p>So now I&#8217;m curious. Why does the catcher sometimes tag the batter with the ball after a strikeout? Better luck for next time?</p>

		<p>Todd: &nbsp;Watch closely, and you&#8217;ll see that this happens when the third strike is in the dirt, or otherwise not caught cleanly (before touching the ground). &nbsp;If first base is unoccipied (or even if it is occupied, but there are two outs), the batter can attempt to run to first base, and must be tagged or thrown out. &nbsp;See rule 6.05, parts (b), (c), and (j), available at:</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
