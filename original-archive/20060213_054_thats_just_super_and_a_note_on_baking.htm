<p> <b>Bake</b> - (of a code change) to build confidence by observing its behavior over a period of time.

		<p>If I had to guess on the etymology of &quot;bake&quot; I&#8217;d have to go with ceramic baking (i.e. the kiln (sp?)). &nbsp;Just my best guess, but it makes sense. &nbsp;You let things sit in the kiln just a bit longer to see if their done.</p>

		<p>If you&#8217;re talking to designers in UX, or SDETs dealing with security policy, &quot;bake&quot; has a different meaning entirely. &nbsp;UI designers frequently undergo a &quot;baking&quot; process to generate ideas and the SDETs undergo the same process to deal with the terrific stress of their drab and thankless lives, since they are only noticed when things go horribly wrong.</p>
<p>For many of these hapless souls, it all started when they were children and had unfettered access to EasyBake ovens.</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a lot of internal terms that I missed being clued-in on, when I joined. &nbsp;For instance, what are you to do when someone asks you to &quot;S+ me&quot;? &nbsp;Why, send them a meeting invitation, of course!</p>
<p>Acronyms like ZBB, RI, FI, PUM, GPM, and so on, are all thrown about with abandon, as if everyone understands what they mean &#8211; often in conversations external to the company, as if the world at large knew (or cared) about Microsoft&#8217;s names for their internal positions.</p>
<p>But &quot;super&quot; is still the one that gets me &#8211; I think an award ought to be given to any Microsoft employee that can get through a presentation without using it.</p>

		<p>S+ is a holdover from the pre-Outlook days when Schedule+ was the time management system of choice.</p>
<p>I mainly remember how prevelant &quot;fuck&quot; was. One friend distinguished herself by NOT using profanity. She categorized it as &quot;too inprecise to be useful&quot;. Come to think of it, I don&#8217;t remember her using &quot;super&quot; either.<br /></p>

		<p>&quot;super&quot; comes from Bill Gates, who says it all the time &#8212; the weirdness in his usage is using it as a modifier of an adjective.</p>
<p>In the days before Word was the email editor, there was this weird conceit of MS execs to dash off email without spell checking, and to deliberately leave in typos as a way of showing that you were too important and busy to backspace. BillG and SteveB had a tendency to leave in any typos that didn&#8217;t reduce the recipient&#8217;s ability to understand the message. Most employees didn&#8217;t immitate this strange practice, but occasionally you would find a really ambitious program manager deliberately emulating the practice, and looking kind of lame in the process.</p>

		<p>Oh&#8230; and &quot;so,&quot; apparently, comes from German? It&#8217;s starting to seep out of Microsoft into the geek world at large. I&#8217;ve even seen blog entries by oblivious MSFT PM&#8217;s where every paragraph starts with &quot;So,&quot;</p>

		<p>I have a friend who uses &quot;so&quot; as an introductory particle all the time. &quot;So I was at the shops the other day&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>Peronally, I tend to use &quot;anyway&quot; in a similar fashion, though I try to stop myself when I notice it&#8217;s getting a little out of hand.</p>

		<p>It seems like conversational glue used for stringing sentences, &nbsp;ideas, together. &nbsp;Others I&#8217;ve heard &#8216;over-used&#8217; include:<br />
<br />&#8211; sorta<br />
<br />&#8211; like<br />
<br />&#8211; and then<br />
<br />&#8211; (s)he says<br />
<br />&#8211; consequently<br />
<br />&#8211; yeah..</p>
<p>and then, so, I&#8217;d sorta like, yeah to consequently. like, he said, to have a beer&#8230;</p>

		<p>Reading Jensen Harris&#8217;s blog teh other day&#8211;I&#8217;m leaving that typo in to show how silly^H^Himportant I am&#8211;I came across the word &quot;actionable.&quot; &nbsp;Having never seen it before, I looked it up.</p>
<p>actionable: adj. Giving cause for legal action</p>
<p>&#8230;which was clearly incorrect for the context it was being used in.</p>
<p>According to a Microsoftie, &quot;actionable&quot; in Microsoft-ese means &quot;We can do something about it&quot; or &quot;fixable.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a little confused why someone just didn&#8217;t use &quot;doable,&quot; &quot;feasible&quot; or &quot;possible,&quot; which seem to fit the definition perfectly and have the advantage of being perfectly cromulent words.</p>

		<p>The difference between &quot;actionable&quot; and &quot;fixable&quot; is twofold. &nbsp;First, an &quot;actionable&quot; entity is sufficiently well-specified that progress can be made on it can &nbsp;right now, and second, an &quot;actionable&quot; entity need not be something which is broken. &nbsp;That is, &quot;this plan is actionable&quot; is both syntactically and semantically acceptable Micro-jargon, meaning (roughly) &quot;This is sufficiently well specified and staffed that we can safely start work on it without a high risk of wasted effort.&quot;</p>
<p>Your other proposed synonyms don&#8217;t really work very well in that case: something might well be clearly feasible, but unstaffed, or possible but too cloudy to actually start work on.</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
