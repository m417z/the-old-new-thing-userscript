<p>Occasionally somebody asks <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/02/01/7362840.aspx#7377250"> about the timing of an entry I've written</a> and wants to know how far ahead with this blog thing I really am.</p>
<p> To give you an idea of how far in advance I write my blog entries, I wrote this particular entry on February 13, 2008. Generally, the articles are published in the order I wrote them; this particular entry ended up on February 27, 2009 because that was the next available open day. If the big news topic of February 27th, 2009 happens to be related to this entry, it's just a coincidence. </p>
<p> Now, with a buffer of over a year, I do have quite a bit of leeway in choosing when any particular article is published. Although articles in general just get slotted in for the next open day, I will occasionally arrange for one to come out on a thematically-related day. Sometimes the connection is blatant, like writing about time and time zones on the Fridays before Daylight Saving Time transitions, or writing about Hallowe'en on, well, Hallowe'en. More often the connection is low-key, like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/01/21/7181075.aspx"> telling a story about the economics of parking tickets</a> on a day when parking is free in Seattle or <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/02/01/7362840.aspx"> warning about fake guacamole</a> on the Friday before the Super Bowl. And sometimes the connection is impossibly obscure, like taking a story that I know a friend will like and slotting it in on their birthday, anniversary, or some other day meaningful to them. </p>
<p> (To answer Paul's specific question: I found the article on guacamole and said, "That would be a great article to use for the Super Bowl." Since <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/02/02/1582985.aspx"> I already had a Super Bowl article picked out for 2007</a>, the guacamole article was slotted in for 2008.) </p>
<p> There are other patterns you may have picked up on: </p>
<ul>
<li>Mondays are usually spent "answering viewer mail"     (i.e., taking topics from the Suggestion Box). </li>
<li>Less technical articles appear towards the beginning of the week;     more technical articles appear later in the week.     Tuesday in particular tends to get the funny stories. </li>
<li>There is usually one e-mail related posting per month. </li>
<li>There is usually one Microspeak posting per month. </li>
<li>Sometimes an entire week is devoted to a theme,     such as the annual CLR Week. </li>
<li>An unusually short or unusually long technical post is usually     balanced by an amusing non-technical post.     (I have a stash of about a hundred of these "light diversions".) </li>
<li>I tend to avoid technical topics on major holidays. </li>
</ul>
<p> But generally, it's just a FIFO queue. </p>
<p> Oh, and right now, the queue is full up through the beginning of June 2010. </p>

		<p>That is an amazing queue. You could be away for a year and a half (on holiday, working at another company, possibly even [heaven forbid] deceased) and this blog would continue to enthrall us for so long it boggles the mind. Well, mine at least.</p>
<p>Unless you have a phenomenal memory, I can imagine it might be just as much of a surprise for you to see what the topic of the day is as it is for us.</p>

		<p>Is the publishing process automatic, or do you have to push a few buttons? &nbsp;If you were to disappear off the face of the Earth, how long would it be before we knew? &nbsp;Actually, I guess the lack of chastising comment responses would be an obvious indicator that something was wrong.</p>

<p>You&#8217;re sitting in front of your keyboard each day and ponder about what to write next. And if you&#8217;ve got no idea you repeat an article from 5 years ago. Nobody will recognize it anyway.</p>

		<p>So by writing content and scheduling it for time-released publication in a full queue, programmers are likely to be writing buggy code for some time to come. :-)</p>
<p>Raymond prefers a policy of withholding his excellent posts which often contain tips and pointers to useful information that shines the light on Microsoft&#8217;s often poorly documented API&#8217;s.</p>

		<p>I can see one flaw with this:</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re about to go nuclear due to nitpickers and snarky know-it-all commenters. You write a post about how annoying it is and asking them to tone it down. &nbsp;Even if we assume we would listen (aside from a few notoriously uncontrollable types who shall not be named), by the time the post comes up in the queue, you&#8217;ve already gone insane, or the problem has resolved itself.</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;m guessing when you have cause to complain, you bump it up in the queue a bit, or append it as a post-script to another post that is coming up anyway. &nbsp;The idea of you writing cathartic posts that no one knows about for over a year is a sad/funny image though. &nbsp;Kind of like counting to ten before laying into someone; you just count to 31536000 or so (one year in seconds) before unloading.</p>

		<p>So what happens the day you leave MS? Or more morbidly what happens if you die in a freak accident? Will we still be getting your posts? That would be pretty creepy for people that personally know you and read your blog.</p>

		<p>Raymond should confirm, but I believe the way he posts entries is using a tool he wrote himself. I don&#8217;t think the CMS system used by blogs.msdn.com let&#8217;s you save posts for the future. (And Raymond&#8217;s system is more elegant, anyway. Posts are not saved for a specific day in the future, they are just slotted into the queue, ready to be posted whenever&#8230;)</p>
<p>The queue of entries is stored on a machine (at work?), and a task fires each morning to publich the post for that day.</p>
<p>So if, heaven forbid, Raymond leaves Microsoft, his machine will most likely go offline and we&#8217;ll not see posts from him. Perhaps he&#8217;ll be able to move the blog elsewhere and has a personal backup of his posts. I suspect that he does indeed have a backup, since we&#8217;re talking about Raymond! :)</p>

		<p>John,</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t speak for this software, but WordPress allows you to schedule a post for any date. I&#8217;ve used this in the past on my own blog to queue up entries when I&#8217;m going to be gone for a long while. If I were more responsible, I&#8217;d do what Raymond was doing, and just *always* put articles in the queue with at least a month or so of buffer. That way, even if I don&#8217;t feel like writing for a long time, it would look like I&#8217;m still active.</p>

		<p>Just curious, do you know how many entries you have written but then deleted before they appeared on the blog? You mentioned doing this here: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/19/8518565.aspx#8519249" target=_new rel=nofollow rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/19/8518565.aspx#8519249</a></p>

<p>He is very involved on internal mailing lists too. The insight dispenser BOT cannot be stopped !! He also has an &#8216;internal&#8217; MS blog/website which I think is defunct now, but it has an awesome collection of funny geek stuff, archived email conversations and other things. Even if his current entries run out he could just dump that collection..</p>

<p>Until this day, I had been sure I had made the right decision in not moving to Redmond.</p>

		<p>So when you say one Microspeak entry a month, does that mean you write a bunch at once and then slot them into the queue a month apart?</p>
<div class=post>[<i>No, I usually write them one at a time. When I write one, I pick a slot for it approximately a month after the previous one. -Raymond</i>]</div>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
