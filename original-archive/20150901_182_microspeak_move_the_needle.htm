The phrase <i>move the needle</i> is part of general business jargon,
but it is very popular here at Microsoft.
You need to know what it means,
and more importantly, you need to be willing to throw it around yourself
in order to sound more hip and with-it.</p>
<p>
In general business speak,
<i>move the needle</i> means
<a href="http://www.forbes.com/pictures/ekij45gdh/move-the-needle/">
<i>generates a reaction</i></a>,
but at Microsoft, it has the more general
sense of <i>provide a perceptible improvement</i>.
</p>
<p>
The metaphor here is that there is
some sort of meter, like a speedometer or
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VU_meter">VU meter</a>.
Back in the old days, these meters were analog rather than digital,
and they consisted of a calibrated arc with a needle that pointed
at the current value.
</p>
<p>
To <i>move the needle</i> is to have a noticeable effect,
presumably positive.
</p>
<p>
Here are some citations.
</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
It's clear that we will need to make some additional improvements
if we are to move the needle on performance for customers with high traffic.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p>
By investing in this solution we move the needle forward
on reducing
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/03/13/10281708.aspx">
friction</a>
and increasing speed to measurable value.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That second one wins the buzzword award for today.

		<p>Gosh. I assumed it would refer to a record-player, where &quot;moving the needle&quot; is the action of freeing up the needle if it gets stuck in a groove.</p>
<p>That&#39;s actually a more powerful vision to me, and a more rare skill among management. </p>
<p>Anybody can make an effect (at a cost).</p>
<p>Not anybody can _move the needle_ (as in: get things into the right groove, moving with forward momentum again)</p>
<p>I&#39;m strangely sad that it was not that.</p>

		<p>Needless to say, but what must one do to get his needle moved?</p>

		<p>My head hurts reading the second citation, especially as a foreign language speaker.</p>
<p>It certainly brings that cute little IBM advertisement* to mind (about b*** bingo), which I loved watching. Although ironically enough, I bet they are even worse at the whole buzzword thing.</p>
<p>*) I&#39;m not sure if they aired that advertisement globally or only in Germany.</p>

		<p>@AC I&#39;m surprised. I thought IBM spoke exclusively in catalog numbers and registration codes.</p>

		<p>@sehe: Yes, That&#39;s why I said it&#39;s ironic such an ad would come from them.</p>

		<p>How would you say move the needle in an opposite way?</p>

		<p>&quot;By investing in this solution we move the needle forward on reducing friction and increasing speed to measurable value.&quot;</p>
<p>Meaning that at the moment we have a product so slow we can&#39;t measure its speed? Ouch ;)</p>

		<p>I had always assumed it meant getting a positive reaction as in getting applause causing the needle to be moved on the &#39;clapometer&#39; on a game show &#8211; <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clap-o-meter">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Clap-o-meter</a></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
