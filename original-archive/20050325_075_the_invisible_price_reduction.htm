<p> Swedish discount warehouse chain <a href="http://www.coopforum.se/">Coop Forum</a> is running an advertising campaign claiming "New Lower Prices!", but how can you tell? Apparently you're not supposed to (shocking!) compare current prices against what they were before the ad campaign. </p>
<p> Raymond's bad translation follows. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b> <font size="+1"> <a href="http://www.sr.se/ekot/artikel.asp?artikel=580174"> Coops "new" price reduction not new</a></font></b> </p>
<p> <b> A major new price reduction advertising campaign issued by discount warehouse chain Coop Forum this week to all households in the Stockholm area could be misleading. </b></p>
<p> The list of which merchandise which actually had their prices lowered, that is secret, according to Roger Gehrman, vice managing director for Coop Forum. </p>
<p> "The price structure is one of the probably most important trade secrets we have," he says. </p>
<p> <b>But you claim that you are lowering prices. How can one be sure that you really are doing it?</b> </p>
<p> "You can't compare today's prices with how they were earlier," says Roger Gehrman. </p>
<p> <b>Difficult to know for both Ica and Coop</b> </p>
<p> It is almost just as hard to get a grasp on Coop's claimed price reduction as it is with <a href="http://www.ica.se/">Ica</a>'s.  </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.sr.se/ekot/">Ekot</a>'s check shows that both chains refuse to show which individual items were lowered or how large individual price reductions are. </p>
<p> <b>Don't want to report which items were reduced</b> </p>
<p> Coop's manager Roger Gehrman doesn't even want to state which product categories were reduced the most. </p>
<p> "I don't want to go into that. It is nearly all of our product range but I don't have detailed knowledge to talk about a specifically reduced product and I don't have the list in front of me either," he says. </p>
<p> This week's advertising flyer from Coop Forum to households in the Stockholm region are misleading. "Welcome to our largest price reduction ever" and "New lower prices" says the discount warehouse chain now about a price reduction which in the Stockholm area was already put into place last autumn. </p>
<p> "It happened at the end of October 2004," says the Coop Forum manager. </p>
<p> One figure Coop management did release, and that's how much the 7,000 items were reduced on average: five percent. </p>

		<p>There are quite a few companies that do similar things here.</p>
<p>I remember a few years back a shampoo company advertised a new lower price. Well what they didn&#8217;t mention is that they also reduced the size of the bottle to compensate.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve actually seen US furniture companies do something similar. I was shopping for a new kitchen table and found one I liked for one price, but decided to sleep on it. The next day they were having a &quot;sale&quot; in which the sale price was HIGHER than the previous price yet it was &quot;marked down&quot; 20% (They first marked it way up then gave the 20% discount from that price!)</p>
<p>Needless to say I stopped even looking at their stores.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know about Coop, I never buy from them, but ICA&#8230; before the day they were supposed to lower their prices, some of the ICA stores had already lowered on some of the merchandise, which had the effect that some people could show that the marked down price was the same as before the day they were supposed to lower them.<br />
<br />IIRC, there was however other items that got a lower price claim, when they had had that price for far longer already.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the first time swedish stores do this. Right after christmas when everyone have big sales, there were several cases where they had just taken the old price and put it on a &quot;lower price&quot; sticker. People found out because they had not even bothered to remove the original price sticker, so you could remove the new one and see that the price was the same.</p>

		<p>As an aside to the above, ICA and other chains have recently also REMOVED prices for some packed merchandise, like meat, and only put up a sticker that says the price per kg, and a barcode sticker on the package itself.<br />
<br />They did put up barcode terminals so that you can actually find out what it costs without having to calculate it or ask at the counter.<br />
<br />Either way, it&#8217;s just another thing that wants me to leave this rotting country.</p>

		<p>Even better: the local gas station near me has good prices on milk, the best I&#8217;ve found.  But, they don&#8217;t advertise the price anymore outside the store.  Not only that, they don&#8217;t even tell you what it is *in* the store.  You have to buy it to find out.</p>
<p>You might say &quot;well, just ask the person at the counter&quot;.  Result: vacant teenager stare, with a 20% possibliity of drool, and still no price.<br /></p>

		<p>In other news, don&#8217;t buy a flash MP3 player that has no stopwatch. The stopwatch is an important feature. You think that you don&#8217;t need a stinking stopwatch in your MP3 player? THINK AGAIN!</p>
<p>So why, you ask, would you need a stopwatch on your MP3 player? I admit, I have not the faintest idea. I&#8217;ve got the info from this source of reliable information, along with other invaluable hints on how to chose an MP3 player:</p>
<p><a target="_new" href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/devices/flash.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/windows/windowsmedia/devices/flash.aspx</a></p>
<p>So, how does all this relate to super market pricing in Sweden? Here&#8217;s the common morale: DON&#8217;T  TRUST  MARKETING.</p>

<p>As for the marketing scheme, the same thing happens here in Denmark, must be a scandinavian thing. But then again, Coop also has branches here.</p>

		<p>Scott, that&#8217;s interesting.</p>
<p>Not having prices in the store is illegal where I live:<br />

<p>In Australia, we have something called the &quot;Trade Practices Act (1974)&quot;, designed to prevent this kind of behaviour (among others), and impose penalties where it is breached: <a target="_new" href="http://www.consumersonline.gov.au/content/ConsumerRights/TradePracticesAct.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.consumersonline.gov.au/content/ConsumerRights/TradePracticesAct.asp</a></p>

		<p>In England (and possibly but not necessarily throughout the UK) there is a law that requires that the price with which &quot;sale&quot; prices are compared with must have been used for, I think, at least 28 days out of the last 6 months.</p>

		<p>That reminds me of a sale that some clothes store had a couple years back.  The signs were promising :</p>
<p>&quot;Buy any item at twice the regular price, receive any item of equal or lesser value, absolutely free!&quot;</p>
<p>A friend of mine was working there, and she said that you wouldn&#8217;t believe how many people came up and bought a $20 shirt for $40, just so they could get a $15 pair of pants for free.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
