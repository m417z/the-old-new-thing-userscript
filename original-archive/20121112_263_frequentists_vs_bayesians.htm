		<p>His follow-up post is funny too:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The truth is, I genuinely didn’t realize Frequentists and</p>
<p>  Bayesians were actual camps of people—all of whom are now</p>
<p>  emailing me. I thought they were loosely-applied labels—</p>
<p>  perhaps just labels appropriated by the books I had happened</p>
<p>  to read recently—for the standard textbook approach we</p>
<p>  learned in science class versus an approach which more</p>
<p>  carefully incorporates the ideas of prior probabilities.

<blockquote><p>
  I meant this as a jab at the kind of shoddy misapplications</p>

<p>  screening (which is an emotionally wrenching subject full</p>

<p>  I wasn’t intending to characterize the merits of the two</p>
<p>  sides of what turns out to be a much more involved and</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t get how the neutrino machine is supposed to work. &nbsp;How can you apply an action (dice roll) to an event (machine telling the truth or not) and say they&#39;re related even though they have nothing to do with each other?</p>
<p>Or do I just not get the joke?</p>

		<p>Err, replace that 36 with a 12 (or pretend that roll_two_dice() returns the product of the dice rolls instead of the more traditional sum, but that would just be a wacky API).</p>

		<p>@JJJ. You don&#39;t get the joke. The dice-roll is not related to the event. It is related to the truth statement about the event. The joke is that the frequentist notes that the probability of two sixes is less than 5%, and hence concludes that the truth statement yielded &quot;TRUE&quot; with more than 95% certainty, and hence the neutrino device must have predicted &quot;Sun exploded&quot;</p>
<p>The error, mathematically, is that the error introduced by the two dice dwarfs the likelihood of the event that the truth statement is originally about. So the machine yielding the value &quot;YES&quot; is more likely due to the error introduced by the dice than because the event actually took place.</p>
<p>The XKCD comic is making a point that given a random variable X with error Y, just because Y &lt; 5% (or any d%) and the random variable yields x, does not mean that the random variable is x with a high or even meaningful confidence. If the error margin is large compared with the variable itself, no meaningful statement can be made until large numbers of readings have been taken place to drive down the standard error of the computation in order to even begin to make meaningful statements about X.</p>
<p>This is a commentary by the author of XKCD about how bad people are at these kinds of statistics which occasionally crop up in some important situations. If the likelihood that you have breast cancer is small, and the error on the screening is randomly distributed and larger than that value, then just because you&#39;ve fallen into the category of &quot;machine says you have cancer&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you have cancer. It doesn&#39;t even mean you&#39;re LIKELY to have cancer. It just means that more tests need to be carried out.</p>

		<p>@Matt: &#8230;just because you&#39;ve fallen into the category of &quot;machine says you have cancer&quot; doesn&#39;t mean you have cancer. It doesn&#39;t even mean you&#39;re LIKELY to have cancer. It just means that more tests need to be carried out.</p>
<p>And not only that, but those additional tests sometimes have side effects that may, depending on your personal valuation, be worse than the risk of missing something. Hence the somewhat recent controversial recommendations re. routine breast &amp; prostate cancer screenings, in which doctors no longer encourage it from as early an age in general. (E.g. I think routine mammograms are no longer recommended for 40-50 year olds? I forget. Which isn&#39;t to say that it&#39;s recommended to NOT get them.) Yes, by skipping them people will be more likely to miss cancer &#8212; but they&#39;ll also be more likely to skip damaging side effects as well. Where the tradeoff is probably varies significantly from person to person.</p>

		<p>Another interesting tidbit about the comic that someone mentioned in a reply to the post on Andrew Gelman&#39;s site linked above: the Sun can&#39;t nova; novas only occur on white dwarfs.</p>
<p>A regular star can supernova but the Sun does not have enough mass for that to occur.</p>

		<p>Assume the two stick figures are travelling at constant velocity close to the speed of a neutrino. Would it not be possible that the sun will become a white dwarf and go nova by the time they have finished their conversation?</p>

		<p>On the other hand, if you were confident that the Sun had gone nova, you would probably want to spend your last hour as enjoyably as possible, so you might want to take up that bet ;-)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
