<p><a href="http://blog.ryjones.org/"> Ry Jones</a> wants to know <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/20/10040074.aspx#10040403"> what other podcasts I subscribe to</a>.</p>
<p> Remember, I wrote this back in 2011. </p>
<p> Here's what I listen to. Note that I am not averse to fast-forwarding over parts that don't interest me, such as when they discuss a movie that I simply don't care about. </p>
<ul>
<li>Pop culture:     I don't really follow pop culture, but these podcasts are just     plain fun to listen to.     
<ul>
<li>     <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/archives/archive.php?thingId=129472378">     Pop Culture Happy Hour</a>.     Imagine a group of four really close friends,     all intelligent, witty, and who love to tease each other.     That's what this is.     Favorite part:     The Regrettable Television Pop Quiz,     an occasional segment in which participants are challenged     to identify excerpts from television programs you are     embarrassed to admit that you watch.     </li>
<li>     <a href="http://extrahotgreat.com/">Extra Hot Great</a>.     Similarly enjoyable round-table discussion of This Week     in Pop Culture.     Most of the attention goes to     <a href="http://extrahotgreat.com/the-canon/">     The Canon</a>,     a segment in which episodes of television are nominated     for inclusion in the pantheon of great television.     But my favorite part is Game Time.     (Alas, by the time this article reached the head of the queue,     Extra Hot Great is no longer in production.)     </li>
<li>     <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2187916/landing/1/">     Slate's Culture Gabfest</a>.     The most highbrow of the three,     and the most likely to suffer the fast-forward button.     Sorry, guys.     </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sports:     I am more of a meta-sports person rather than a sports person.     I'm interested in things like rule changes and     the business of sports,     not so much the "Who's going to win this year?"     
<ul>
<li>     <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2224225/landing/1/">     Hang Up and Listen</a>.     I find Mike Pesca's voice a bit too brash for NPR news reporting,     but when opining about sports, it's the perfect pitch.     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/10/01/9901586.aspx">     Stefan Fatsis</a>'s      sporteaucrat impression is always welcomed.     It's hosted by Josh Levin, who opens each week's show with     "This is Josh Levin, and this is Slate's Hang Up and Listen."     That opening bothers me because of the shifting antecedent of     the word <i>this</i>.     ("This <i>voice</i> is Josh Levin, and this <i>show</i> is     Slate's Hang Up and Listen.")     I would prefer that he open with "I'm Josh Levin, and this is     Slate's Hang Up and Listen."     </li>
<li>     <a href="http://onlyagame.wbur.org/">     Only a Game</a>.     The week in sports.     I usually fast-forward over the "Who's going to win this year?",     but I never miss Charlie Pierce.     </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Economics: The dismal science.     
<ul>
<li>     <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/">     Planet Money</a>.     Economics in layman's terms.     I'm a particular fan of their latest series,     <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/archives/archive.php?thingId=162557684">     Ask a Banker</a>,     mostly because     <a href="http://dealbreaker.com/author/mlevine/">     Matt Levine</a> writing style is hilarious.     </li>
<li>     <a href="http://www.freakonomics.com/category/freakonomics-radio/podcasts/">     Freakonomics Radio</a>.     This is the most recent addition to my blogroll.     Still in the trial period.     We'll see if it's still on my list next year.     </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Other     
<ul>
<li>     <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2160802/landing/1/">     Slate's Political Gabfest</a>.     The first podcast I ever subscribed to.     I tend to fast-forward this one a lot of late, though.     </li>
<li>     <a href="http://waitwait.npr.org/">     Wait, Wait, Don't Tell Me</a>,     the NPR News Quiz.     I was one of the very first listener-contestants on this show,     back when it was really awful.     (They actually <i>called me</i> to ask me if I wanted to be on.)     Fortunately, the show is no longer awful.     </li>
</ul>

		<p>I&#39;d just like to recommend the BBC&#39;s &quot;In Our Time&quot; &#8211; Melvyn Bragg draws three academics into giving a layman&#39;s explanation of their area of interest. Covers a massive range of stuff &#8212; the last few have been &quot;The Upanishads&quot;, &quot;Fermat&#39;s Last Theorem&quot;, &quot;The Anarchy&quot; (12th century English History) and &quot;Simone Weil&quot; &#8212; usually fascinatingly. There&#39;s also &lt;a href=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio4/features/in-our-time/archive/&quot;&gt;a" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbc.co.uk/&#8230;/&quot;&gt;a</a> massive back-catalogue available&lt;/a&gt;.</p>

<p>Please do not help spread the misconception that economics is a science, dismal or not. Science is supposed to predict something (that is what makes science useful). Economics has not predicted anything since the day it was born. Latest example: the fact that US is debating its way to the fiscal cliff shows how useful &quot;economics science&quot; is. A real science with centuries of history would have settled the question of &quot;fiscal cliff&quot; in a textbook exercise.</p>
<p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>

		<p>What is it about the Gabfest that it is under both Pop Culture and Other? You&#39;d think that &quot;Other&quot; would mean &quot;None of the above&quot;.</p>

		<p>Lefty &#8211; if economics was a real science with real results there would be no debate, political or not, about the fiscal cliff. Instead, there would be a clear, history-tested result to the problem. (To see what real science would mean in this context, imagine politicians debating electricity.)</p>

		<p>If German is an option, CRE (cre.fm) is the way to go. It&#39;s a highly informative interview style podcast with very diverse topics, from feminism to beer brewing (quite good) to IPv6 (exceptionally good).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
