A customer was having trouble with the
<code>SHGet&shy;Known&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code> function.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
We are calling
the <code>SHGet&shy;Known&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code> function.
from a service while impersonating a user,
but it returns <code>E_ACCESS&shy;DENIED</code>.
It's failing both for
<code>FOLDERID_<wbr>Program&shy;Data</code>
and
<code>FOLDERID_<wbr>Roaming&shy;App&shy;Data</code>:
</p>
<pre>
hr = SHGetKnownFolderPath(
        FOLDERID_ProgramData, // folder ID
        0,                    // flags
        nullptr,              // token
        &amp;path);           // result
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Before we could reply, the customer followed up:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
We found that if we
save the token that is being used for impersonation
and pass it to
the <code>SHGet&shy;Known&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code> function.
then it works.
But we are not sure why is it working now
since the call was already being made while impersonating,
and the documentation for
the <code>SHGet&shy;Known&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code> function
says that if you want to get the known folder path for the current
user, then you pass <code>NULL</code> as the token.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Remember that
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110928-00/?p=9533">
the default answer to "Does this work while impersonating?" is No</a>.
When the
<code>SHGet&shy;Known&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code> function
says "the current user",
it roughly means "the user under whose identity the process is running",
but more importantly,
it means
the user whose registry is mapped as <code>HKEY_<wbr>CURRENT_<wbr>USER</code>,
which, as we saw earlier,
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20141121-00/?p=43563">
is a very tricky proposition for a service that impersonates</a>.
</p>
<p>
In this case, what's probably happening is that the service is
running as something like SYSTEM, and <code>HKEY_<wbr>CURRENT_<wbr>USER</code>
points to SYSTEM's registry,
and the impersonated user does not have access to SYSTEM's registry,
hence
<code>E_ACCESS&shy;DENIED</code>.
</p>
<p>
The backstory is that
the <code>SHGet&shy;Known&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code> function
(and its close relatives
like <code>SHGet&shy;Special&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code>)
are overwhelmingly used by normal applications that do no impersonation,
so that's the use case they are optimized for.
if you pass <code>NULL</code> as the token,
then the functions will read from
<code>HKEY_<wbr>CURRENT_<wbr>USER</code> and cache the results.
If the thread is impersonating, but you fail to pass the impersonation
token to the
<code>SHGet&shy;Known&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code> function,
then it might return the (wrong) cached value,
or it might try to read the value from
the (wrong) <code>HKEY_<wbr>CURRENT_<wbr>USER</code> hive.
Whatever happens, it's probably going to be wrong.
To say, "No, don't use any of your fancy optimizations for
normal applications, because I'm not a normal application.
Get the known folder path for this specific user by
reading from that user's registry."
</p>
<p>
You might say,
"Well,
the <code>SHGet&shy;Known&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code> function
should auto-detect whether it is being called when impersonating
and compensate accordingly."
Maybe, but that means introducing an expensive test to a
hot code path to cover a rare case.
that people shouldn't expect to work anyway because
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110928-00/?p=9533">
the default answer to "Does this work while impersonating?" is No</a>.
Instead, the extra work of dealing with impersonation is transferred
to the people who want to get this information while impersonating.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
Even if you pass the correct token to
the <code>SHGet&shy;Known&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code> function,
you may still run afoul of other requirements.
In particularly, note the sentence
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
In addition to passing the user's <i>hToken</i>,
the registry hive of that specific user must be mounted.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If the registry hive is not mounted,
then there is no way to look up the information in the registry
because, well, it's not in the registry.
You can use the
<code>Load&shy;User&shy;Profile</code> function to
load the profile into the registry.
Just remember to call
<code>Unload&shy;User&shy;Profile</code> when you're done.

		<p>Ah, another great special folders article. I don&#8217;t know how often I already redirected people at your older article about the &#8220;!Do not use this registry key&#8221; entry in the registry so that they program retrieving special folder paths correctly. I guess this just adds to the list in case they need impersonisation.</p>

		<p>Reading this, I thought of this recent SO question: <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37546320/query-recycle-bin-whilst-impersonating-user" rel="nofollow">http://stackoverflow.com/questions/37546320/query-recycle-bin-whilst-impersonating-user</a></p>
<p>But I see that you&#8217;ve recently commented there yourself. Just a coincidence in the timing?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
