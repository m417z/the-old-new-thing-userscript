<p> Oh, and by the way, the phrase "blue screen of death" did not really apply to the blue screen messages in Windows 3.1 or Windows 95. As we saw earlier, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/09/09/10556049.aspx"> the Windows 3.1 fatal error message was a black screen of death</a>, and in Windows 95, the blue screen message was more a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/09/10/10556421.aspx"> screen of profound injury</a> rather than death. (Windows 95 was sort of like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zKhEw7nD9C4"> the Black Knight</a>, trying very hard to continue the fight despite having lost all of its limbs.) </p>
<p> The phrase "blue screen of death" was generally attributed to the blue screen fatal error message of Windows NT. In Windows 95, we just called them "blue screen messages", without the "of death". </p>
<p> I didn't expect this to become "blue screen week", though that's sort of what it turned into. </p>

		<p>This whole blue screen &quot;of death&quot; seems to have a bit of Microspeak to it. &nbsp;I know that I sure called the Win95 Blue Screen the Blue Screen of Death, even though technically you could proceed from it. &nbsp;It seems like most of my friends and coworkers did as well. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think I had ever been exposed to Windows NT at that point.</p>

		<p>The 9x BSOD is considered the de facto original BSOD worldwide. Technically, it may not be death, just injury but I don&#39;t recall myself ever being able to continue using even a 32-bit protected mode program once the 9x BSOD was caused by whatever device driver or real-mode program. It may have been technically possible to continue normally but it rarely ever worked. The option that always worked was to Ctrl+Alt+Del again or press the Reset button on the hardware case. :)</p>

		<p>So, if I understand you correctly, what you&#39;re saying is Steve Jobs wrote the Windows 2.0 Purple screen of Unconsciousness text?</p>
<p>The problem seems to be that some people erroneously refer to the windows 3.1 CTRL+ALT+DEL screen as a BSoD. The Wikipedia article has been updated to reference this series of events but still contains reference to the CTRL+ALT+DEL screen as a BSoD. It&#39;s the notification area / system tray issue all over again.</p>

		<p>My memory may be faulty, but I&#39;m pretty sure we called the Windows 3.1 screen the BSOD at the time, and certainly the Win 9x one. I first really experienced Windows NT (4) in 1999, but don&#39;t recall seeing its blue screen until Windows 2000 came along. I don&#39;t think I even made the connection between that screen and the name BSOD at first.</p>

		<p>Accurate or not, the blue screens in Windows 95 were called &quot;Blue Screens of Death&quot;, by the users if not by Microsoft. I&#39;m fairly sure that the &quot;blue screens of notification&quot; (or whatever you want to call them) of Windows 3.1 also bore that nomenclature, although that may have been retroactively tacked onto them after Win95&#39;s crashes became infamous. I remember also changing the colors of the BSOD, first by editing the System.ini directly and later by using the BSOD Properties applet.</p>

		<p>Was the screen REALLY blue? What were the RGB values? </p>
<p>GOTCHA!</p>
<p>MS-DOS screens didn&#39;t have RGB values. It&#39;s only blue if it is COLOR 1</p>
<p>And we all know that Raymond invented the COLOR 1</p>
<p>(dear God, I just tried the COLOR 1 command on my Windows 8.1 box and it worked. Isn&#39;t that taking backwards compatibility a bit far?)</p>

		<p>The idea that &quot;Blue Screen of Death&quot; only applied to NT Kernels is laughable &#8211; or, at best, Redmond/Kernel tinted glasses. &nbsp;At the height of the phrases popularity, almost no-one one outside the IT industry was familiar with Windows NT &#8211; certainly not enough for its kernel panic page to enter the popular conciousness.</p>
<p>When people said &quot;Blue Screen Of Death&quot;, they were talking about the called the Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 blue screens, and pretending otherwise doesn&#39;t make it so. While it was theoretically possible to continue in those cases, in reality the system was usually completely unresponsive to such attempts, and even when successful, all people ever did was save their work and reboot due to incipient instability.</p>

		<p>I had to laugh when the primary source provided is immediately dismissed (Probably because it&#39;s associated with Microsoft in some way; what would they know about BSoD?), and all facts for his claims come exclusively from secondary sources, whose headlines don&#39;t even match the bodies of the articles.</p>
<p>Of course, it does say a lot about people and the media in general these days. The idea of reading deeply into something by checking its sources, or past the headline, seems to be a dying form. Journalism by press release springs to mind as another example.</p>

		<p>@GWO: Except the blue screen Raymond talked about was triggered by using Ctrl-Alt-Del in Win3.1 when an app was hung, allowing the application to be terminated.</p>

		<p>@Yuhung_Bao I know how Win 3.1 handled C-A-D, and how to get a bluescreen. &nbsp;The point is, using that method to terminate Apps simply didn&#39;t work reliably, and anyone who tells you otherwise is full of it.</p>
<p>If the App was hung you hit C-A-D and got the bluescreen to terminate the App. &nbsp;And then, as often as not, the system became completely unresponsive and you had to press the big red switch. &nbsp;The idea that the Win 3.1 blue screen didn&#39;t mean your system was basically hosed is historical revision. &nbsp;Remember, Windows 3.1 didn&#39;t have functional memory protection &#8212; far worse that Win95, and that wasn&#39;t great &#8212; so the damage a buggy app could cause was basically unlimited.</p>

		<p>From the Wikipedia article:</p>
<p>&quot;On 4 September 2014, several online journals [&#8230;] attributed the creation of the Blue Screen of Death to Steve Ballmer (Microsoft&#39;s former CEO) while citing a source that never said such a thing: An article by Raymond Chen&quot;</p>

		<p>I am pretty sure I didn&#39;t start calling the Windows 95 screen a blue screen of death until after I had heard the term in reference to NT. But that testimony is worth next to nothing as it is nearly twenty years ago.</p>
<p>Google ngrams says that the term &quot;blue screen of death&quot; didn&#39;t become popular until about 1998. It more or less tracks &quot;Windows NT&quot; but considerably lags &quot;Windows 95&quot;. So I think it tracks the rise of NT within businesses rather than Windows 95 within homes.</p>

		<p>@GWO The point is it&#39;s not a BSoD because you asked for it. You pressed the keys that caused that screen to be displayed. If the computer was dead it wouldn&#39;t be able to give you that screen when you asked for it. Yeah you&#39;re in a bad state because a program is hung and windows might not be able to help you but it&#39;s not dead yet.</p>

		<p>If I were you, I would contract a presidential election campaign and claim that the opposite side is responsible form BSOD. Done wisely, you could make huge amount of money AND change the course of history!</p>

		<p>I also remember calling them &quot;blue screens&quot; and not &quot;blue screen of death&quot;. I think I first read the term &quot;blue screen of death&quot; in some article that mocked Windows NT (and advocated Linux). I didn&#39;t start calling them BSOD because it was too long to say and because by the time I switched to NT (W2k at the time), they were much less frequent than what I experienced with W9x. (At the time, I was reinstalling Win98 every 3 weeks, certainly because of all the games and shareware of mediocre quality&#8230;)</p>

		<p>Hmmm, this one is interesting. Memory is a funny thing. I remember blue screens in Windows 95 (and 3.11), and in my mind I call it &quot;o death&quot;, probably because in XP (and earlier NT) that&#39;s what Blue meant. I think my mind (and probably most people&#39;s has retroactively updated the term and this it &quot;always was&quot;. It&#39;s come as quite a shock to realize that my memory is unreliable in this way!</p>

		<p>For what it&#39;s worth, I started working with Windows NT 3.1 when it was in beta. I recall hearing the term &quot;Blue Screen of Death&quot; shortly before or just after it had been released from the [network] driver developers I was working with. (I also have a vague memory of Microsoft being initially annoyed at this term, but it may have just been our liaisons.) I generally still preferred, and still prefer, the shorter term &quot;Blue Screen&quot; since it says everything you need to know with fewer syllables. </p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
