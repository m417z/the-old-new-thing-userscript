<p>
When our main window is created, we also create a balloon-style
tooltip and add a tracking tool.
Normally, the tooltip control appears and disappears automatically,
at a position of the tooltip's choosing.
Tracking tooltips are managed manually,
so you can specify exactly when and where they appear,
and you also manually remove them from the screen.
At startup, we add the tool but do not show the balloon tooltip yet.
</p>
<p>
When the user presses the space bar,
we get the current cursor position and tell the tracking tooltip
to appear at exactly that location,
then we activate tracking mode.
The result:
The balloon tip appears, and the tip of the balloon points directly
at the mouse cursor.
</p>
<p>
When the user presses the <kbd>ESC</kbd> key,
we deactivate tracking mode, which removes the tooltip from the
screen.</p>

		<p>Why do tooltips disappear so quickly (especially in IE)? &nbsp;I often can&#39;t read the entire thing before it disappears, and so I have to drift off and back on so it will re-appear. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>It lead to us completely reimplementing tooltips since there is no obvious way to change the timeout from .NET (there probably is a way but it was faster to reimplement tooltips than find it.) Turns out tracking tooltips are really easy to implement by hand.</p>

		<p>Is having the common controls entry in your manifest enough to get the version 6 common controls DLL to load, or do you have to load the DLL somehow as well? I&#39;ve only worked with manifests for msvc*.dll, which is its own different bundle of joy.</p>
<p>Raymond, what is your feeling on TCHAR at this point? Windows 9x is long gone, so is there a reason to use TCHAR instead of WCHAR?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>It depends on how your component is loaded. Search MSDN for &quot;common controls manifst&quot; for your options. I use TCHAR as a concession to people who have to maintain old code that is still ANSI-based. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@ Joshua &#8212; changing the timeout on tooltips from managed code is very easy. &nbsp;The tooltips provide props to do that. &nbsp;You are correct in that it is darn near impossible to control where the tooltips apear outside of some win32 interfacing.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
