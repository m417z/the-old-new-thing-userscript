<p>One of my friends (let's call him "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/06/19/636824.aspx">Bob</a>") retired from Microsoft many years ago. Bob is an amazing programmer whose skills I remain in awe of.</p>
<p> I remember visiting his office one evening with a mutual friend ("Fred") to catch up on things. When we turned up, he showed us a problem that he was working on. He was doing some sort of fancy graphics effect, but since I'm not a graphics person, I sat down in his guest chair and flipped through some magazines while he talked about the problem with Fred. (Fred being a graphics guru.) They discussed the problem and settled on an algorithm. Or at least I assume that's what they did, because I wasn't paying much attention. </p>
<p> And then Bob started digging into the algorithm's implementation. Since this particular effect was in the program's inner loop, it had to be fast, and at the time this story took place, that meant assembly language. Not just your everyday assembly language, but insane assembly language, pulling crazy tricks like using the stack pointer as a general purpose register (since the x86 has so few registers) and performing multiple operations in parallel with one register. I put down my magazine, and Bob and I sweated out the details. Meanwhile, Fred flipped through a book on Bob's shelf. </p>
<p> That's how great Bob was. It took two people (Fred and me) to keep up with one Bob. </p>
<p> Anyway, that's a pretty long introduction to Bob just to get to the real story, which will come tomorrow. </p>

<p>Mr. Chen, I can&#8217;t say this enough, but thank you for maintaining this blog despite all the horrific people who come here and taunt (annoy) you. &nbsp;You&#8217;re right, you should become a professional psychic.</p>

		<p>I take it that it was in DOS, and the SP-munging was done between CLI and STI? Otherwise an interrupt would start writing stuff in random locations.</p>

<p>&gt; Igor, surely Norman will complain about the</p>
<p>&gt; Japanese implementation of DOS? ;-p</p>
<p>Other way around.</p>
<p>Mr. Chen is the one who said that Windows 95 legitimized 32-bit programming. &nbsp;So as for the 32-bit programming that I did before MS-DOS existed and during the era when MS-DOS was used on toy computers, Mr. Chen complained that my work was illegitimate.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t have to pay for or use MS-DOS in those days so I haven&#8217;t experienced much cause for complaint with it.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>&#8220;Mr. Chen is the one who said that Windows 95 legitimized 32-bit programming.&#8221; Did I say that? I can&#8217;t even find the word &#8216;legitimized&#8217; anywhere on the blog except in this very comment. I think you&#8217;re being a bit oversensitive. (Even if I had said it, it was clearly not to say that all 32-bit programming before Windows 95 was illegitimate.

<p>Probably the posting would have been in year 2003 or 2004 but this doesn&#8217;t help much in tracking it down, sorry.</p>

<p>I agree that &#8220;popularized&#8221; is more compatible with your writing style. &nbsp;In a while I&#8217;ll try searching again. &nbsp;32-bit programming was popular before Microsoft existed, so the effect of reading &#8220;popularized&#8221; would have been the same as the effect of reading &#8220;legitimized&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I agree with JamesNT (the first post)!</p>
<p>Please keep writing Raymond, your blog is on my top 3 list of blogs, without it I would have to go back reading newsgroup with a much lower SNR.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t posted a comment here in a long time since this blog is already flooded with comments, but I just wanted to say that I enjoy your blog a lot and I guess that there are a lot of people like me who don&#8217;t post comments (frequently) but still enjoy reading your blog.</p>

		<p>&gt; That&#8217;s what I meant by &#8220;popularized&#8221; &#8211; that</p>
<p>&gt; it became something even non-technical people</p>
<p>&gt; understood at some level.</p>
<p>In that case it wasn&#8217;t an insult and I apologize for feeling<br />
insulted. &nbsp;(And since I haven&#8217;t found the statement that I think<br />
you made, I might owe you an additional apology. &nbsp;But I do plan to<br />
do more searching ^_^)</p>
<p>But I have a feeling that most non-technical people really don&#8217;t<br />
understand the meaning of 32 bits even at some level, whether in the<br />
era of IBM 360s or VAXes or PCs. &nbsp;On this matter I don&#8217;t have any<br />
complaint about your opinion, I just have different experience.<br />
&nbsp;My experience includes several people who couldn&#8217;t understand the<br />
idea of a virus even when I abused the word to include all kinds of<br />
malware, people who don&#8217;t understand what role memory plays in a<br />
computer, people who do understand memory but don&#8217;t understand why an<br />
increase from 32MB to 160MB might bring a speedup (nor why an increase<br />
from 256MB to 1GB wouldn&#8217;t speed up the kinds of things they do), and<br />
people who don&#8217;t understand why it takes longer to write a program than<br />
to use a program.</p>

<p>I rather suspect putting &#8220;now with 20% more relocated sectors&#8221; on HDD packaging would have a similar effect, too&#8230;</p>
<p>It did push 32 bit code to the point 32 bit apps could sell in volume, but I very much doubt there was any real understanding of the implications (remember Bart incinerating his &#8220;obsolete&#8221; console which was only 252 bits, once the 256 bit version was released?)</p>

		<p>So are we ever going to find out how to do that trick with reusing ESP? Unless you play tricks with assuming you can always obtain a particular page for your own use, I can&#8217;t easily imagine how to get the stack pointer back after losing it from the register.</p>
<p>Educate us Raymond! :)</p>

<p>Hey, what happened to your famed psychic powers? &nbsp;You&#8217;re not supposed to use memory for ESP, you&#8217;re just supposed to use tricks.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
