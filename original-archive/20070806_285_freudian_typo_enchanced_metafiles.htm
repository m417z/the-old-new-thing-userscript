<p> Back in 1993, there was an internal presentation discussing the various new features that were being added to that fancy new version of Windows that ultimately came to be known as Windows&nbsp;95. In the GDI section, one of the new features was listed as "<a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/145999">Enchanced metafiles</a>". </p>
<p> When the slide went up, you could hear the scattered titters of laughter as each person read and discovered the typographical error. For a few days thereafter, the GDI folks had to endure people stopping by and asking them, "Hey, so how are those enchanced metafiles coming?" </p>

		<p>Could have been worse &#8211; if such a feature had existed at the time it might have been auto-corrected to &quot;enchanted metafiles&quot; :)</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t get it. &nbsp;What is Freudian about &quot;enchanced?&quot;</p>

		<p>Jonathan, Freudian slip is just something that is caused by the subconscious.</p>
<p>In this example it could be that enchanced was misstyped because the typer thought that these new metafiles would only work under chance, or some such thing.</p>

		<p>Yes, a Freudian slip is when you say one thing but mean a mother.</p>

		<p>Maybe Enchanced Metafiles use some sort of &nbsp;randomness to recreate the original image. Hence, enchanced.</p>
<p>typedef struct tagENCHMETARECORD</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;DWORD &nbsp; iType; &nbsp; &nbsp;// Record type EMR_XXX</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;DWORD &nbsp; nSize; &nbsp; &nbsp;// Record size in bytes</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;DWORD &nbsp; dParm[1]; // DWORD Array of parameters</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;DWORD &nbsp; dwChance; // Chance record is correct</p>
<p>} ENCHMETARECORD;</p>

		<p>I never liked the name metafiles in the first place. &nbsp;They are actual fully self contained real files, nothing meta about them. &nbsp;I would have rather they be called metaimages. &nbsp;Anyways, it can&#8217;t be changed now and few people use this clever file format anyways.</p>
<p>I also think bitmaps should have been called pixelmaps. &nbsp;Every file is a collection of bits.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
