<p>Nektar wants to know <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#2668386"> why you can't use the space bar to select check box and radio button elements from a menu</a>.</p>
<p> The short answer is "Because it's a menu, not a dialog box." </p>
<p> The check mark and radio button are just visual adornments provided by the menu manager as a courtesy; they do not affect the behavior of the menu itself. Notice, for example, that there is no way to specify "radio button groups" in a menu, so the menu manager wouldn't know which items needed to be deselected when you select a radio button menu item. (I guess it could infer them from separators, but then you would have people saying "I want my radio button group to exclude item number&nbsp;4, but I don't want to put a separator in between; that looks ugly.") </p>
<p> And then how would a program reject an auto-selected check box or radio button? E.g., the user pushes the space bar to turn on <i>Show the Widget Bar</i> and an error occurs trying to show the Widget Bar. If the program displays an error dialog, that would dismiss the menu. So maybe the program would just silently re-uncheck the box, which leaves the user puzzled as to why the space bar "doesn't work" for turning on the Widget Bar. Or worse, what if hiding the Widget Bar causes the menu to reconfigure itself? (Maybe there are some menu items that are visible only when the Widget Bar is selected; if the user hides the Widget Bar, those menu items need to be deleted.) Windows doesn't have a precedent for menus reconfiguring themselves <i>while they're being displayed</i>. What if one of the items that gets deleted when you hide the Widget Bar is the menu item that contains the Widget Bar checkbox? ("I turned off the Widget Bar, and my menu disappeared!") </p>
<p> That said, there is no technical reason these design issues couldn't be overcome. You could have a style like <code>MF_GROUP</code> that behaves like <code>WS_GROUP</code> to establish the scope of menu radio buttons; you could have some way to mark a menu item as "this is an unselected check box" or "this is an unselected radio button"; you could come up with a way for a program to reject a user's attempt to change the check box status; you could design a way for menus to be dynamically reconfigured while they are open; you could even design a way for menus to respond in some vaguely reasonable way when the item the user just selected gets dynamically deleted! But all of these features take effort, and they detract from the simple design of a menu as "Here's a list of things you can do. Pick one. Once you pick one, the menu dismisses." Every feature starts out with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2004/01/12/57985.aspx"> minus 100 points</a> and needs to beat out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/31/10017567.aspx"> the other 200 items on the list</a>. </p>

		<p>How many points do you get when the existing behaviour violates the principle of least astonishment?</p>
<p>Windows used to have a very keyboardable user interface. In fact that was one of the things I found most attractive about it: unlike just about every other UI, you could reliably use Windows without having to mess with the mouse.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know when things started to go downhill, but Windows 95 introduced a lot of UI elements with surprising behavior, and the current Windows/Office UI is an ergonomic disaster. It&#39;s a shame they can&#39;t go back to about Windows 3.11/NT 3.5 and start over.</p>

		<p>You can still check those entries with ENTER, just like any other menu items.</p>
<p>If I understand correctly, the hypothetical difference using the space bar is that the menu would stay open.</p>

		<p>IIRC (and I may be wrong) Windows 3.11 didn&#39;t support &quot;checkable&quot; menu items at all; that was a Windows 2000 innovation. &nbsp;The pre-Windows 2000 way to do this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;Foo</p>
<p>x Bar</p>
<p>was:</p>
<p>Show Foo</p>
<p>Hide Bar</p>

		<p>@Michael: And so does Word 2010. It is highly convenient, if you ask me. What if you wished to uncheck all items, and the menu disappeared each time you unchecked one of the items!</p>

		<p>Those wacky Office guys are always pushing the UI envelope. &nbsp;I&#39;m always discovering little surprises. &nbsp;For example, if you press the context menu key in Excel (AKA the &quot;right-click&quot; key) then you get one menu; if you actually right-click with the mouse, you get that menu plus another one.</p>
<p>Surprise, generally speaking, is not a good thing in the UI world.</p>

		<p>Wait a minute. I remember coding a check on/check off menu item in Win16 on Win95. MF_CHECKED worked just fine back then.</p>
<p>I&#39;m quite convinced this worked on Win3.1 since my compiler&#39;s documentation for Win32 seemed to predate Win95.</p>

		<p>@Maurits: Well, but there is no way to navigate to the minitoolbar using the keyboard, so it actually makes sense that only the ordinary popup menu is shown when you press the context key on the keyboard.</p>
<p>Another feature of the Office 2010 menus is that you can use (Shift+)Tab to navigate them.</p>

		<p>The Office 2007 menu IIRC are browsable pressing first the / key and then using the keys that appear in tooltips over the various items. Once you know it it&#39;s fine, but it&#39;s surely against the PLA (I&#39;ve never seen anything that goes in &quot;keyboard shortcut mode&quot; when you press the slash key).</p>

		<p>@Matteo Italia: Lotus 1-2-3 for DOS.</p>
<p>I keep trying to active menuitems with the space bar, presumably because I&#39;m used to activating buttons with the space bar (Enter only works if the dialog manager hasn&#39;t been confused into making some other button the default. Yes, it happens. Sigh.)</p>

		<p>@Matteo Italia: I&#39;m guessing that support for the slash key is to make Lotus users happy, as Neil mentioned, but the documented way to bring up keyboard tooltips with the Ribbon is by pressing the Alt key.</p>

		<p>I miss the old Amiga days where you could select multiple items without having to go back to the menu bar to bring it back up &#8211; hold down RMB to bring forth the menu bar, and while holding RMB click LMB on each item you&#39;d like to toggle. This only worked with menu items that didn&#39;t spawn a dialog or other type of window, but it was still insanely handy at time.</p>

		<p>@AC</p>
<p>When I&#39;ve been faced with a dialog and I want to select the items I end up going for my mouse even though I don&#39;t want to. The reason why is because I don&#39;t want to spend the time to find out how this dialog box is going to work. I&#39;m saying this as someone who would love it if I only ever had to use the mouse in paint. The problem with &quot;try enter&quot; is because I&#39;ve been burned hitting enter, hoping it&#39;ll select the checkbox/radio button/funky control, and the next/finish button ends up being hit. As a result I&#39;ve now gone onto the next window. Maybe it&#39;s something that only happens in webpages, maybe it&#39;s not.</p>
<p>The end result is that, as an end user, Windows is not helping me discover how I can use the keyboard to make using this application easier.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
