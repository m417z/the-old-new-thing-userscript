A customer found that under heavy load,
their application would occasionally hang.
Debugging the hang shows that everybody was waiting for the
<code>Lpdr&shy;Loader&shy;Lock</code> critical section.
The catch was that the critical section was reported as locked,
but the owner thread did not exist.

<p>
How can a critical section be owned by thread that no longer exists?
</p>
<p>
There are two ways this can happen.
One is that there is a bug in the code that manages the critical
section such that there is some code path that takes the critical
section but forgets to release it.
This is unlikely to be the case for the loader lock
(since a lot of really smart people are in charge of the loader lock),
but it's a theoretical possibility.
We'll keep that one in our pocket.
</p>
<p>
Another possibility is that the code to exit the critical section
never got a chance to run.
For example, somebody may have thrown an exception
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/09/10/10347674.aspx">
across the stack frames which manage the critical section</a>,
or somebody may have tried to exit the thread from inside the
critical section,
or (gasp) somebody may have called
<code>Terminate&shy;Thread</code> to nuke the thread from orbit.
</p>
<p>
I suggested that the
<code>Terminate&shy;Thread</code> theory was a good one to start with,
because even if it wasn't the case,
the investigation should go quickly because
<a HREF="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WhereTheLightIsBetter">
the light is better</a>.
You're not so much interested in finding it as you are in ruling it out
quickly.&sup1;
</p>
<p>
The customer replied,
"We had one call to <code>Terminate&shy;Thread</code> in our application,
and we removed it,
but the problem still occurs.
Is it worth also checking the source code of the DLLs our application
links to?"
</p>
<p>
Okay, the fact that they <i>found one at all</i> means that
there's a good chance others are lurking.
</p>
<p>
Before we could say, "Yes, please continue your search,"
the customer followed up.
"We found a call to
<code>Terminate&shy;Thread</code> in a component provided by
another company.
The code created a worker thread, and decided to clean up the
worker thread by terminating it.
We commented out the call just as a test,
and it seems to fix the problem.
So at least now we know where the problem is and we can try to fix
it properly."
</p>
<p>
&sup1; In the medical profession, there's the term
ROMI, which stands for <i>rule out myocardial infarction</i>.
It says that if a patient comes to you with anything that could
possibly remotely be the symptom of a heart attack,
like numbness in the arm or chest pain,
you should perform a test to make sure.
Even though the test is probably going to come back negative,
you have to check just to be safe.
Here, we're ruling out <code>Terminate&shy;Thread</code>,
which I guess could go by the dorky acronym ROTT.</p>

		<p>Ah yes ROMI they decided to not believe me when I told them straight up it wasn&#39;t one. There&#39;s no such thing as a slow (weeks) heart attack.</p>
<p>While there valid uses of TerminateThread, any uses of that pattern where the program is a whole-prohram transform (no COM for you whatsoever and most of GDI is walking on eggshells after that.)</p>

<p>1. TerminateThread, SuspendThread.</p>
<p>2. _exit.</p>
<p>3. CreateThread, _beginthread (instead of proper _beginthreadex).</p>

		<p>@Joshua: haven&#39;t you ever watched House? Everybody lies. Even if they seemingly have no reason to. :-)</p>
<p>Besides, can you imagine the headlines if a patient dies of a heart attack and the doctors have to defend themselves with &quot;he told us it couldn&#39;t be one&quot;? If nothing else, who says the symptoms you were feeling for weeks couldn&#39;t be unrelated and you happened to have a heart attack at that very moment? As unlikely as it is, if the test is sufficiently cheap, there&#39;s no reason not to do it. Hickam&#39;s dictum: patients can have as many diseases as they damn well please.</p>

		<p>ROMI is actually different from &quot;the light is better&quot;. The logic behind ROMI is that the cost of the condition is so high that you need to test for that one first. The logic of the lamp-post is that the cost of the test is so low that it doesn&#39;t hurt to do that one first. (The two could actually conflict, if testing for MI was greater than testing for TT.)</p>

		<p>In order to be able to reproduce this problem reliably, I&#39;m going to guess that they start a worker thread, determine the work item is unnecessary, and cancel it via TerminateThread. Since the system is under heavy load, the thread has not finished initializing before being terminated, leaving the loader lock abandoned.</p>
<p>So I guess if you want to make sure you can safely terminate a thread, do it from the loader lock?</p>

		<p>@Gabe: Nothing makes the loader lock special. The thread could be holding any other lock.</p>
<p>You could try and terminate the thread while holding every lock, but good luck with that.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: Although heart attacks usually comes quick and sudden, blockage of blood vassals can take months to develop.</p>

		<p>@The MAZZTer: &quot;Yes, I could reboot and that would probably temporarily resolve the problem. &nbsp;But, then we would lose this opportunity for you to find the bug in your product and develop a permanent fix.&quot; is something I find myself telling vendors these days. &nbsp;To me, rebooting is no longer a suitable resolution unless you already have enough information to produce a root cause analysis.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
