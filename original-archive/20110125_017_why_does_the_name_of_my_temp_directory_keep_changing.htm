<p>A customer liaison contacted the shell team with the following request:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>Subject</b>: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/01/18/1488858.aspx">Support case: 069314718055994</a></p>
<p> On two of my customer's machines, he's finding that if he opens %TEMP% from the Start menu, it opens C:\<wbr>Users\<wbr>username\<wbr>AppData\<wbr>Local\<wbr>Temp\<wbr>1, C:\<wbr>Users\<wbr>username\<wbr>AppData\<wbr>Local\<wbr>Temp\<wbr>2, and so on. Each time the user logs off and back on, the number increments. The number resets after each reboot. Why are we seeing these folders being created under Temp? This does not appear to be the default behavior. What would cause the operating system to create these folders? </wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></p>
<p> The customer rebuilt one of the affected machines, and the behavior went away. However, the customer claims that both machines were working fine before, and then this problem suddenly started. Therefore, the customer is afraid that the problem will come back in the future. Any pointers in solving this mystery would be very much appreciated. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> It's not clear why this question was directed at the shell team, since Explorer doesn't set your TEMP directory. (In general, a lot of random questions come to the shell team not because they are shell questions but because people don't know where else to turn. Since the shell presents the desktop, and the desktop is on the screen when the problem occurs, maybe it's a shell issue!) </p>
<p> The question was redirected to the Remote Desktop team, since it is Remote Desktop that creates these subdirectories off the TEMP directory. And from there, psychic powers predicted that the problem lay in the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc759190(WS.10).aspx"> <i>Administrative Templates\Windows Components\Terminal Services\Temporary folders</i></a> group policy. If you don't select <i>Do not use temporary folders per session</i>, then these TEMP subdirectories are created. (Yet another of those crazy <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/03/14/1878777.aspx"> negative checkboxes</a>.) There is also <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/243215"> a knowledge base article describing the registry keys behind these group policies</a>. </p>
<p> The customer liaison responded cryptically, </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Thanks. I tested the policies and it is the one that creates the folder. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Not sure what this means for solving the customer's problem, but that was the last we heard from the customer liaison, so I guess this policy was enough to give the customer a nudge in the right direction. </p>

		<p>With IE protected mode, the temp directory when accessed from IE&#39;s open/save dialogs redirects to %tmp%Low folder which is extremely annoying because it&#39;s a low integrity process.</p>

		<p>Why do I suspect the direction they actually took was informing their end-users to disable this functionality so they can continue to hard-code the temp directory against all good practice and sense? (I am, of course, assuming they are a software vendor&#8230;)</p>

		<p>I do have such a system that wants semi-hardcoded temp paths (actual location is a persistent config file). However, the system would be undisturbed with %temp% bouncing around.</p>
<p>As for why one would want to fix %temp% has to do with making sure it gets cleaned properly. Junk files lying around waste disk space and sometimes provide unwanted information leaks.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t know how that was a problem. The actual problem is that the darned programs drop the temporary files there and LEAVE THEM THERE. %TEMP% becomes a dirty dump. I suggest everybody to add a requirement to their software: When a process exits gracefully, it should not leave anything in %TEMP%. Especially those stupid installers.</p>

		<p>George: That&#39;s quite a gem! It&#39;s hard to imagine nobody thought to write it this way:</p>
<p>&quot;To share a single temporary folder for all terminal server sessions, click Enabled. To create a separate temporary folder for each terminal server session, click Disabled.&quot;</p>

		<p>&quot;To allow each user to share a common temporary folder across all interactive sessions (localy or via Remote Desktop), enable this setting. To allow each user&#39;s session (locally or via Remote Desktop) to have its own temporary folder, disable this setting. Either setting could solve some application compatibility problems, depending on whether they believe users always have the same temporary folder path (enable the setting) or whether they believe users always have isolated folder paths (disable this setting). Leave this setting disabled unless you identify a scenario where it needs to be enabled.&quot;</p>
<p>I think that&#39;s a better explanation&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Alex Grigoriev: Too many developers assume that %temp% is automatically cleaned by the system periodically. Heck, *I* assumed that for the longest time. Every time I found junk in there it was always &quot;Well, I haven&#39;t rebooted in a long time&quot; to explain away all the junk.</p>
<p>I wonder why Windows doesn&#39;t automatically clean up its various temp folders on reboot? I can only assume there are a significant number of programs that keep non-temporary data there, so MS is stuck.</p>

		<p>&quot;Then again, it&#39;s hard to imagine what sort of app requires the setting to be one way or the other.&quot;</p>
<p>Badly written ones ;)</p>
<p>For instance, applications which use fixed filenames for sort or temporary files, assuming TEMP will never be shared. Most would fail to start a second instance, as they couldn&#39;t open a second instance of the file with exclusive-write. They&#39;re the ones that need per-session temporary directories.</p>
<p>The second class &#8230; apps which do interprocess communication via files in TEMP (even if only in the form of leaving set of results X for second application Y to pick up). Much to my annoyance, we have some apps (or rather, extensions to a CAD program) written like this at work. They at least use their own, separate, TEMP directories &#8230;.</p>

		<p>Sounds like their problems would have been solved by creating a folder under %ProgramData%.</p>
<p>As for the assumption that %Temp% gets cleaned periodically, it&#39;s my understanding that it does get cleaned up when you run the Disk Cleanup utility. But these days our disks are so big, how often do you have to run it?</p>
<p>Personally, I&#39;ve come into situations where I wish NTFS has a Cleanup Date attribute on files, similar to Creation Date and Last Modified Date. Then when a disk is starting to run out of space the OS could scan for files past their cleanup date, and clean them up.</p>

		<p>Since my %TEMP% is set to a ramdisk location, I have first-hand knowledge about the compatibility issues. &nbsp;The biggest issue I&#39;ve had is with an antivirus program that creates a temp file for each internet download&#8230; and stores a copy of the entire downloaded file, which occasionally exhausts space on the ramdisk. &nbsp;Miscellaneous other issues from permissions not being identical to the original directory created by Windows. &nbsp;None that I know of from the temp directory getting wiped at reboot.</p>

		<p>@Joshua:</p>
<p>Some programs save data in TEMP which could become important when the program crashes. I think, MS Word used to be one of them: It was able to recover an unsaved document, provided that some auto-save option was enabled in Word&#39;s settings beforehand.</p>
<p>Lotus Notes lets you open documents directly from an e-mail, by shell-executing a copy of the attached file, saved in %TEMP% under a new, unique name. When you are working on such an document, without too much thinking, your modified copy is still in %TEMP%. You better have no auto-cleanup in place if your system reboots as long as your modified file is still there. Otherwise, you can easily lose hours of work.</p>
<p>My disk at work is filled by 50 GB out of 1 TB =&gt; There is really no need for nasty scripts.</p>

		<p>Good point LR. Curious how software intended for use by programmers doesn&#39;t exhibit that behavior.</p>

		<p>@Ben Voight:</p>
<p>| None that I know of from the temp directory getting wiped at reboot.</p>
<p>I suspect that your %TEMP% points to a drive letter different from %SYSTEMDRIVE%. Since MoveFileEx() doesn&#39;t work across drive letters installation/replacement of locked files during reboot works for your setup &#8230; by accident.</p>
<p>If you want to see installations which use MoveFileEx() fail just &quot;mount&quot; your RAMDISK to %SYSTEMROOT%TEMP (this is where the SYSTEM environment variable TEMP points to) and remove all your users/administrators TEMP environment variables.</p>
<p>@C:WINDOWSTEMP:</p>
<p>Services (like IIS) run under system accounts which dont have a user-specific %TEMP% and therefore use the system-wide %TEMP%</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
