		<p>At the end of the day it&#8217;s a shame Zidane decided to retaliate at ALL. A much better story would have been if Zidane showed a superior attitude and ignored the insult.<br /></p>

		<p>Zidane&#8217;s response was inappropriate, but understandable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When adrenaline is running high, reactions can become a reflex. &quot;I&#8217;d like to do your sister&quot; (essentially what Materazzi said) would probably elicit an inappropriate response from a brother even without the additional boost of a highly competitive atmosphere.</p>

<p>The only way this whole story is &quot;understandable&quot; is because of Zidane&#8217;s fame which is so much greater than Materazzi&#8217;s one (which to be true is quite infamous) that everyone wants to find a way to justify the myth for his actions.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s de rigueur in international soccer, but in the NBA or NFL an insult about someone&#8217;s sister would be kindergarten-level stuff. &nbsp;I&#8217;d hate to see what Zidane would do if he was subject to trash talking from some real masters of the genre.</p>

		<p>and who do you think zidane is? some redneck from kentucky who didn&#8217;t play with the players from most of the countries in the world? Your NBA and NFL cant compare to the global football.</p>

		<p>My first thought watching that play was that maybe Zidane wanted to be kicked off the field. &nbsp; &nbsp;Maybe that way he was &quot;dragged off the field&quot; &nbsp;instead of &nbsp;leaving voluntarily in his last game? &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />Either way &nbsp;I think people underestimate how stupid people tend to get when we&#8217;re physically exhausted. &nbsp; &nbsp; Soccer will do that to someone much more then &nbsp;NFL or NBA where you can easily sub in and out.</p>

		<p>Even if you&#8217;re apologizing for something, rhetorics can still do marvels.<br />
<br />Zidane said about his head-butt : &quot;I apologize *towards children and people* who watched this.&quot;</p>

		<p>I would also think that it&#8217;s understandable.</p>
<p>Every people have certain &quot;bottomlines&quot; that when other people try to touch it, they&#8217;ll simply gone crazy.</p>
<p>Headbutt is just one of the ways to express immediate anger, and it&#8217;s not likely to cause serious injury like fighting with fist&#8230;(one usually can&#8217;t continually headbutt others&#8230; it&#8217;s dizzy&#8230; :P But with fist you can attack again and again&#8230;) so I guess it&#8217;s better than normal fighting&#8230; er?</p>
<p>P.S.: Admitted some twisted reasoning above&#8230;</p>

		<p>I dunno, I think Zidane should have been arrested on the spot. Nevermind the legend&#8230;he brought shame on himself, his team, and the entire sport.</p>
<p>As for calling his sister bad names&#8230;eh, maybe next year you can move up to 4th grade ZuZu.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s &quot;understandable&quot; that when a person from a different country mummurs some silly insult during one&#8217;s sport&#8217;s highest-level match about one&#8217;s sister that the person probably doesn&#8217;t even know that a proper reaction is to physically assault them and thereby confirming that person&#8217;s belief that after having made such an insult that one would be very disturbed and emotional about it.</p>
<p>Yeah I guess I understand that too, after all, such a emotional violent reaction was to be expected wasn&#8217;t it? I&#8217;m surprised he didn&#8217;t go home and kill his sister in order to defend her honor.</p>

		<p>Understandable does not mean justifiable.</p>
<p>I understand that atmosphere and emotion have an effect on how a person will react to certain things. &nbsp;In the case of a sports event, it is not uncommon for that reaction be violent.</p>
<p>That is not to say I don&#8217;t find both Zidane&#8217;s and Materazzi&#8217;s behaviors to be inappropriate, irresponsible and unquestionably stupid. &nbsp;I&#8217;m thankful they were on a sports field and not in a bar where anything in reach could have become a lethal weapon.<br /></p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
