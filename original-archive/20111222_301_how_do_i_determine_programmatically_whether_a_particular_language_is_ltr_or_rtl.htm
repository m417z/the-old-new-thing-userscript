<p>Given an <code>LCID</code>, how does one determine whether the language lays out left-to-right or right-to-left? One suggestion was simply to hard-code the list of known right-to-left languages, and if the language isn't on the list, then assume that it is left-to-right. This technique is clearly fragile, because Windows adds support for new languages not infrequently, and if one of those is a right-to-left language, then your table is now out of date. And besides, there are languages whose layout is neither left-to-right nor right-to-left. For example, Chinese and Japanese traditionally lay out top-to-bottom.</p>
<p> To obtain the text layout direction programmatically, call <code>Get&shy;Locale&shy;Info&shy;Ex</code> with <code>LOCALE_<wbr>IREADING<wbr>LAYOUT</wbr></wbr></code>. </p>
<p> And just hope that nobody ever hands you a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2009/03/26/five-dollar-words-for-programmers-part-four-boustrophedonic.aspx"> boustrophedonic</a> language. </p>

		<p>I agree, the first technique is clearly fragile. &nbsp;But MSDN says LOCALE_IREADINGLAYOUT is Windows 7 or later. &nbsp;So what&#39;s the best solution on Windows XP/Vista?</p>

		<p>I am lucky enough (so far) to have never worked on any application requiring anything more than english and french. I can imagine that working with right-to-left languages would cause no end of headaches when trying to provide a reasonable layout. It&#39;s nice to know that there is a built-in way to determine what you&#39;re working with.</p>

		<p>Incidentally, Chinese can be laid out either RTL or LTR (the rule says to use natural alignment according to the object that it is laid out on, such as head of bus).</p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen worse problems than this one. E.G. We must uppercase w/o changing word length, and word contains ß.</p>

		<p>Michael Kaplan mentioned a solution long time ago. It was to use LOCALE_FONTSIGNATURE and check for a particular bit in the LOCALESIGNATURE structure. Works at least on Vista, maybe XP too.</p>

		<p>So, it does exist. But square block is not acceptable not font support is still extremely spotty. Too bad.</p>

		<p>Regarding Japanese writing direction, in literature it traditionally was and still is top-right to bottom, but for technical and scientific works top-left to right is generally employed. This is because the Japanese basically got their taste of modern science from the Dutch, who wrote horizontally.</p>
<p>This horizontal mode of writing is now recommended by the Ministry of Education. Apart from scientific works you also find it in building inscriptions, signs above store displays, television and other such situations where space restrictions make vertical writing impractical. It is also often but not by any means exclusively in newspaper headlines, though the text tends to be vertical.</p>
<p>And horizontal writing is also used&#8230; in computing, presumably a combined influence from television and the fact that computers came from America and hence used horizontal writing.</p>

		<p>@AC: I&#39;m not convinced that computers in Japan came from America. My understanding is that computers essentially evolved separately there, as early American computers weren&#39;t capable of displaying Japanese. The NEC PC-98 architecture, while still being 8086-based, was completely different from the IBM PC architecture. It had a 640&#215;400 display in 1982!</p>
<p>Since the machine was essentially designed from scratch in Japan, there&#39;s probably little reason that it couldn&#39;t have had top-down writing being the standard.</p>

		<p>I wonder does windows even support a boustrophedonic language ?</p>
<p>&quot;Chinese and Japanese traditionally lay out top-to-bottom&quot;</p>
<p>Chinese do top-to-bottom and right-to-left.</p>
<p>When i think about i&#39;ve never seen windows do top-to-bottom text either do windows support it ?</p>

<p>Yea, I wondered for a while why EGA dating back to 1984 used a 640&#215;350 instead of 640&#215;400 resolution exactly because of this.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
