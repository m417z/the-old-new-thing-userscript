<p> The <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC43/"> Web page associated with my PDC 2008 talk</a> has been updated to include the source code that I used for all of the demos. </p>
<p> Other remarks: </p>
<ul>
<li>When I wrote, "If you know what's good for you, don't actually use a title image," that was in the context of using group descriptions. If you watch the video, you'll see that if you give a group description a title image, the title image is drawn on top of the text, which is, not to put too fine a point on it, hideous. If you're going to go down the road of using the total information overload of group descriptions, at least use a blank title image. Of course, if you're not using group descriptions, then go ahead and use title images; they look fine on their own. </li>

		<p>I was wondering in which mode the list view is in Windows Vista in the control panel applet that displays the mobile phones that are known to the OS &#8211; since extended tiles don&#8217;t work&#8230;</p>
<p>Control PanelNetwork and InternetSync Center</p>
<p>thank you!</p>

		<p>Speaking of XPS files in that white paper site, how come if I have firefox as the default browser then XPSViewer will try to open XPSs with firefox? If its a format only IE supports that it&#8217;s silly to try to open it with any other browser.</p>

		<p>Although it&#8217;s 100% offtopic I&#8217;m going to have to agree with Shy Shalom here: on my machine XPS files are basically unusable. I managed to find a way to read them, but your average user has zero chance of doing so. What a mess. To add insult to injury, Explorer was happily showing the thumbnail all the way through. Maybe if I made the thumbnail really big I&#8217;d be able to read the first page&#8230;</p>
<p>Moreover, to take an unwarranted jab to that ill-fated format, losslessly converting it to PDF makes it a whooping 33% smaller.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
