<p>Back in 2003, <a href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/advertising/adtrack/2003-07-20-track_x.htm"> M&amp;M offered a chance to win $5000 every summer for life</a>, but if you looked more carefully, the offer actually read, "Win $5000 Every Summer For Life*", and the asterisk at the bottom read, "Maximum 50 years". That fine print was filled with strange stuff. For example,</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> 3. Sponsor responsible only for delivery of prize; not responsible for prize utility, quality or otherwise.<br> ...<br> 10. Sponsor: M&amp;M/Mars, High Street, Hackettstown, NJ 07840. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> One of the prizes was approximately ten pounds of M&amp;Ms. The logical conclusion: "M&amp;M is not responsible for the quality of M&amp;Ms." </p>
<p> I was reminded of this by the recent flap over <a href="http://it.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/06/22/0024225"> how hard it was for one person to cancel his AOL account</a>. There was an AOL contest some years back that offered a chance to "Win free AOL dial-up service for life!", and it too had limited your life to 50 years in the fine print. That one would actually be fun, though. Imagine, in the year 2052, AOL will still have to keep one modem up and running just for this contest winner. </p>

<p>I could imagine it, if other companies were as committed to their existing customers. &nbsp;MSFT is the only company I&#8217;ve seen bend over backwards so far for its legacy users.</p>

		<p>For some reason this reminds me of a story. &nbsp;I was told it as a joke involving AOL, but it&#8217;s possible it was a real con tried by some smaller ISP.</p>
<p>Basically, they justified their higher price by offering 1000 free hours per month as opposed to the 750 hours offer by (the competition/themselves prior to price increase).</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll note, of course, that a month has, at most, 744 hours.</p>

		<p>While it&#8217;s more likely that AOL would just provide them with another service, there are similar cases. Back in the late 80s, the cable company in Longmont, CO scrambled all but a few basic channels. This made it difficult for people to use cable-ready TVs. The reason for this was that part of the contract with this city was that some people were given &quot;basic cable&quot; as long as they lived in their houses. There were only around 6 people left who qualified for free service.</p>

<p>Clearly it was a catch-all phrase to prevent lawsuits.</p>
<p>Utility: A diabetic wins the 10 lbs. of M&amp;Ms. &nbsp;Without the utility disclaimer, he or she could sue for a different prize because they clearly can not utilize the 10 lbs. of M&amp;Ms</p>
<p>Quality: Almost every package of M&amp;Ms will contain some malformed product. &nbsp;In my experience, I&#8217;ve seen a lot of &quot;conjoined twins&quot; M&amp;Ms (two pieces of chocolate which had been coated together to form one double-lobed piece). &nbsp;We can probably all imagine some ungrateful winner who sues because they found some malformed M&amp;Ms in their prize.</p>
<p>Obviously, the lawyers are the real winners of this contest.

<p>I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d term that a &quot;con&quot;. &nbsp;Everything is up front. &nbsp;And, is it possible they allow multiple simultaneous connections, thus using 2 hours per hour?</p>

		<p>Weiguo: Close; as I recall, the &quot;1000 hour&quot; free trial was for 45 days, not one month &#8211; meaning you could indeed use every hour of the trial &nbsp;allowance within the free period (45 days being 1080 hours).</p>
<p>My inner geek is now wondering (a) whether they actually enforced the 1000 hour limit, charging extra if you used the maximum possible 1080 hours, and (b) what they did about daylight savings, which could make it 1081 hours instead at the right time of year.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
