<p>Once upon a time, a senior manager held a team meeting to address low team morale. Attempting to highlight how important the project was, he opened by saying, "I just got back from &lang;faraway country&rang;, meeting with some of our important clients, and..."</p>
<p> This remark had exactly the opposite effect from what the manager intended. Instead of revitalizing the team, the team became even more despondent. "Here we are, working late and coming in on weekends, and this senior manager is telling us about his recent overseas junket." </p>
<p> (After he left, I heard that he still pulled this stunt with his new team. "Over the past two weeks, I've been all over &lang;continent&rang;...") </p>

		<p>That sort of showing off is usually an indication of how little business travel they actually do. I know a few people who travel all over the world with their job, and most would kill for a few weeks continuously in the office. Decent bed every night, see the kids, proper home-cooked meal etc&#8230;</p>

		<p>&quot;I just got back from a 1st class, all-inclusive trip to ⟨faraway country⟩ which I could effort only with my extremely high income of ⟨number which makes you sick⟩ $ each month, together with my 12 masseuses, and yes, while I was not busy sipping down cocktails on ⟨promintent beach name⟩, I talked to a very important customer about how to boost team morale at work.&quot;</p>

		<p>In the early days of my career, I aspired to travel. Following domestic travel, I aspired to continental travel. Following that, I aspired to inter-contenental travel. Once I acheieved that, I realised how much of a pain it was and I aspired to the authority to be selective about my travel and became increasingly proactive to seek alternatives.</p>
<p>The pattern was to see the inside of airports, hotels and offices and not much else. That was partly because there was the habit of doing meeting work through the day and base office work (i.e. catch-up) through the evening. And let&#39;s not start with the airport security charade/palava.</p>
<p>I&#39;d agree that early in my career, when managers discussed travel it was demotivating to hear of their trips. Now, I&#39;m just glad it isn&#39;t me, although the odd trip is fine.</p>

		<p>reminds me of a snr mgr who recently told us &quot;I&#39;m putting in a $90k swimming pool this year&#8230;&quot; While we were looking at $350 above ground option :) That being said I agree with others: travel sounds great to those who aren&#39;t doing it, but once you have done travelling for work it&#39;s typically not all that its cracked up to be&#8230;often just hotel, airport, office, rinse &amp; repeat.</p>

		<p>At the company where I work an exec played coy when asked where he spent his vacation. He said that he spent it next to his phone (part of which is true because I was on two 1-hour long conference calls with him during that time).</p>

		<p>I&#39;d guess that when he was meeting those important clients he was also telling them &#39;I have implemented such-and-such a feature&#39; (as opposed to &#39;My team have implemented such-and-such a feature&#39;). </p>
<p>Well done you; maybe you&#39;d like to take your part in the 24/7/365 support rota for that feature if *you* implemented it &#8230; </p>

		<p>Actually, I remembered for one company that I worked for, a trip to factory at Cambodia or India does not have this kind of effect. (We all know how it is to have a work trip there.)</p>
<p>International travels aren&#39;t always something your staffs want to have, depending on where is the destination.</p>

		<p>As others have said these trips aren&#39;t usually much fun but are often perceived as such by those not going. &nbsp;One benefit of doing them regularly is you can build up loyalty points with airlines and hotels to earn free personal holidays!</p>
<p>While, as Boris says, there are alternatives to physical trips, my experience with working with geographically spread teams is that occasional real world meetings help to humanise the distant voices.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m sure there are negotiations and similar activities where it is beneficial to &quot;feel out the room&quot;, as it were, but usually that isn&#39;t true for technical discussions. You write up documents, receive comments, revise them, begin development, track and review changesets. If you have to fly on a business trip for a technical purpose, as opposed to convening a videoconference to resolve an especially tricky issue, there&#39;s usually something that needs fixing in everyday collaboration tools.</p>

		<p>Ha. Tragically, one of my colleagues was killed in the Lockerbie bombing (in the plane). Our boss gathered everyone together to tell us this (though I personally was pretty sure that was the flight he was on) and also said &#39;I hope you all realise now that business travel isn&#39;t as glamorous as it&#39;s made out to be&#39;. [To be fair, whilst he was an insensitive macho idiot, he was an old-school British insensitive macho idiot &#8211; you knew where you were with them]. </p>

		<p>The problem is elsewhere not in the overseas trips. My father always talks about his business trips in team meetings and the result is, most of the times, great.</p>
<p>Search the actual reason in that manager&#39;s general attitude and how he was perceived (John Styles&#39;s post above hit the mark) as well as what caused the low morale. When the morale is low, it is a sign that something is seriously wrong; one or two of the words isn&#39;t the problem.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve found that the people who take issue with, or are envious of, business trips taken by others, generally don&#39;t travel on business themselves. &nbsp;They&#39;re not familiar with the misery that often comes with these trips. &nbsp;Sure, it can be fun to eat out basically every night on the corporate dime, but that gets old quickly, and there&#39;s plenty of stuff to dislike about trips (airport security? flight delays? lumbar pain due to long-distance driving?) &nbsp;You&#39;re far from your loved ones for days, weeks, or months at a time. &nbsp;Sure, phone calls and video calling can ease the longing, but they&#39;re a poor substitute for the real thing. &nbsp;And they can get expensive over long distance. &nbsp;And video calling is, of course, a relatively recent invention, while business trips are not. &nbsp;You generally don&#39;t have much time for sight-seeing. &nbsp;The only trip on which I had time to be tourist was on a two-week stay at a customer site and I stayed the weekend (rather than deal with the misery of airports, flying, etc.). &nbsp;If any tourist attractions are open during the week, then they&#39;re generally open during normal business hours, so time spent out of the office is generally limited to restaurants, bars, and hotel rooms.</p>

		<p>@Big boss: please, &quot;business class&quot; just means a slightly larger seat in the cattle car. &nbsp;It&#39;s nothing special. &nbsp;Traveling for business still means being away from loved ones for long periods of time; something that the &quot;peons&quot; back at work don&#39;t necessarily suffer.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
