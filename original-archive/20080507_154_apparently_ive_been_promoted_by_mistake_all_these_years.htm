<p>A few years ago, <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20070322063412/http://blogs.msdn.com/devi/archive/2006/08/07/691791.aspx"> this posting on the secret to getting promoted</a> caught my eye.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> After several years at Microsoft, I had an epiphany today. I came to the realization that the best way, rather the only way -- to get promoted is to demonstrate the ability to hire and retain top talent. Other factors do go a long way but without the ability to hire, you are going to reach your glass ceiling sooner than you think. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I have done absolutely nothing to demonstrate this ability, and if I managed to hire or retain anybody, it was purely by accident and for that I apologize. </p>
<p> As far as I'm aware, I've never done anything listed in the article as "the only way" to get promoted. I must have been promoted by mistake. (And I suspect <a href="http://minimsft.blogspot.com/">Mini-Microsoft</a> might have a thing or two to say to the claim that the only way to get a promotion at Microsoft is to hire, hire, hire.) </p>
<p> Yes, I know that the phrase "the only way" was written for rhetorical effect and is not to be taken literally. I'm making a joke, people! </p>
<p> And as it so happens, I also took the text out of context. The target audience for the remarks was senior management, not dorky programmer types like me. So, strike two. </p>
<p> <b>Aftermath</b>: After reading this entry <a href="http://www.stepto.com/Lists/Posts/ViewPost.aspx?ID=329"> in my "upcoming entries" blog queue</a> <a href="http://scobleizer.com/2007/02/16/yuvi-analyzes-raymond-chens-blog/#comment-292939"> accessible only to Microsoft employees</a>, a fellow employee emailed me to say that this Web site was a factor in deciding to come to Microsoft, so my claim that I have done absolutely nothing is incorrect. I wrote back, "Well, maybe so, but it's also the case that I haven't been promoted since you were hired." </p>
<p> The response: "I guess I must not be top talent." </p>

		<p>It seems that empire-building is suddenly a good thing.</p>
<p>&quot;You will also prove to your boss that you can easily be moved into another role&quot; &#8211; Maybe that is desirable if you don&#8217;t like your current job&#8230;</p>
<p>I just can&#8217;t get into the mindset of people who think like this. I want to take what I do to as high a level as I can. I can&#8217;t do that if I keep changing jobs or spend my time coordinating a lot of other people to do my work for me.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s simple. You look at your job as doing a task (Writing code, designng features, whatever). So do the other people. They&#8217;ve just defined the task as &quot;Get promoted.&quot; Everything they do is in support of their primary task. Anything that doesn&#8217;t support it doesn&#8217;t get done.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t ever assume the people around you share your goals.</p>

		<p>Your quote fits nicely into recent comments on minimsft blog regarding Indian empire-building at MS.</p>

		<p>Raymond, the fact that you are not a higher level is a key reason I left Microsoft. No joke.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve personally seen your work, you are not just a blogging wind bag who looks good on paper. Any team would kill to have someone of your knowledge, skills, work ethic and clarity in communication.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit this kind of GAL analysis is faulty, you probably have been rewarded far past any given title from options and otherwise. And I&#8217;m not actually a great fan of some of your humor posted internally.</p>
<p>But in the end if a programming demigod as yourself doesn&#8217;t get a higher technical rank just because you make things work and people smarter rather than building an architectural folly as some others have been richly rewarded for, well I don&#8217;t want to be there because such a company does not reward (anymore) work that I respect. That fact that you stay is apparently a quirk of your personality as you know you could leave at any moment.</p>
<p>Sorry if this is too direct, but you have had a huge influence internally as well as externally, I hope you feel richly rewarded and not just a cog in the machine, because a cog you are not.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
