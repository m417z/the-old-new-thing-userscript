<p>One of the regular events of the Seattle Symphony season is a New Year's Eve late night performance of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony followed by a post-concert party to ring in the new year. Last year I received an advertisement in the mail promoting that year's concert, and one page of the brochure contained the message <i>{Ring in the New Year}</i> printed atop a photo of an impressive array of musical forces crammed onto the Benaroya Hall stage.</p>
<p> But if you look closely at the instruments being played and the composition of the chorus, you quickly realize that they aren't performing Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. Beethoven's Ninth Symphony does not call for eight vocal soloists, a harp, a piano, a mandolin, a celesta, or an organ. Nope, the photo is from a performance of Mahler's Eighth Symphony. </p>
<p> But hey, it looks more impressive in the photo. Nobody will notice. </p>

		<p>Well, at least they used a photo of their own hall. (Not that I could tell the difference.)</p>
<p>Did they correct the photo in this year&#8217;s ad?</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s just marketing. What&#8217;s on the box has only a passing relation to what&#8217;s in it. Besides, the people who can figure it out are going to come anyway because they love music. The knowless[wo]men are going to be there because it&#8217;s the Done Thing no matter what&#8217;s on the picture.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not sure why this is &#8220;wrong,&#8221; or why we care if people will &#8220;figure it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an advertisement for a performance by the symphony, accompanied by a picture of the symphony. &nbsp;Do you really expect them to take a separate picture for every performance, which accurately reflects the orchestral makeup for that performance?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t. &nbsp;If you do, what&#8217;s your expectation for a performance of multiple pieces with several different combinations of instruments? &nbsp;A separate picture beside each, showing the exact combination for that piece?</p>
<p>It just seems silly, but to take it seriously: It&#8217;s not enough to say it&#8217;s wrong, Raymond, tell Micro&#8230; uh, the Seattle Symphony how they should do it correctly.</p>

		<p>Ironically, the Ninth calls for an instrument that is not specified in the Mahler 8th. Although, to be sure, today its part is always played on its tenor cousin.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the repeat performance tomorrow (and the waltzes, which I last heard when I sung it in high school, which come to think must have been before Brahms composed them).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
