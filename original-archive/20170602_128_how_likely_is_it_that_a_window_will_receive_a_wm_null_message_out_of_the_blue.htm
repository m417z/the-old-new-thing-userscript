<p>
A customer discovered a bug in their control that resulted in a crash:
</p>
<pre>
LRESULT CALLBACK MyWindowProc(HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
  switch (uMsg) {
  ...
  default:
    if (uMsg == g_customRegisteredMessage) {
      // For this message, the lParam is a pointer
      return HandleCustomMessage((SOMETHING*)lParam);
    }
    break;
  }
  return DefWindowProc(hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam);
}
</pre>
<p>
The problem is that under certain conditions, the control doesn't
initialize the
<code>g_custom&shy;Registered&shy;Message</code> variable.
If a <code>WM_</code><code>NULL</code> message arrives,
the test
</p>
<pre>
    if (uMsg == g_customRegisteredMessage) {
</pre>
<p>
is <code>true</code>,
and we take the <code>lParam</code> of the
<code>WM_</code><code>NULL</code> message and treat it as a pointer.
Since the <code>lParam</code> of the <code>WM_</code><code>NULL</code>
message is usually zero, this causes the program to crash with
a null pointer.
</p>
<p>
The customer fully acknowledged the bug.
But their question was one of risk management.
How likely is a window going to receive the
<code>WM_</code><code>NULL</code> mesasge?
Knowing the likelihood of the scenario would help
them decide how critical the fix is.
(And they weren't able to reproduce the problem in-house,
so as far as they could determine, the likelihood was
effectively zero. And yet it was happening.)
</p>
<p>
The <code>WM_</code><code>NULL</code> message is not a common
one, but it's not uncommon either.
Posting a <code>WM_</code><code>NULL</code> is usually
done by a window to itself in order to
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20090930-00/?p=16553">
wake up its message loop</a>.
This is typically done when the program has a custom
message loop, and it needs some of the non-message code
to run.
We saw an example of this
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050405-46/?p=35973">
some time ago</a>
where we posted a <code>WM_</code><code>NULL</code>
to let our message loop know that the pseudo-dialog has exited.
</p>
<p>
Posted <code>WM_</code><code>NULL</code> messages are usually 
done from a program to itself,
and they are usually posted as thread messages,
not window messages,
so they don't normally come through the window procedure.
</p>
<p>
Sending a <code>WM_</code><code>NULL</code> is a different story,
though.
It is a relative common technique to send a
<code>WM_</code><code>NULL</code> message
to a window for the purpose of checking whether the
window is responding to messages.
We used it to
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20161118-00/?p=94745">
wait for a window to finish processing a foreground change</a>.
Some system monitoring tools will periodically call
<code>Send&shy;Message&shy;Timeout</code> to send a
<code>WM_</code><code>NULL</code> to all windows, just to see if they
are responding.
Windows UI Automation uses <code>WM_</code><code>NULL</code> messages
help determine the
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa359460(v=vs.85).aspx">
window interaction state</a>.
</p>
<p>
The customer could try running system monitoring tools
or accessibility tools to increase the likelihood of
receiving a <code>WM_</code><code>NULL</code> message under normal
use.
(I mean, sure, they could write a program that explicitly sends
a <code>WM_</code><code>NULL</code> message to their window,
but that wouldn't be anything a normal end-user would have.)
</p>
<p>
I suspect the customer will bump up the priority of this
issue due to the accessibility angle.
People who use accessibility tools tend to really need them.
It's not like you can tell a person with poor visual acuity,
"Oh, just suck it up for a while."
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
The customer wrote back.
After further investigation, they found that the problem
was traced to a third party tool
that their client was using,
specifically
<a HREF="https://github.com/Maximus5/ConEmu/blob/1b6bb22e8be3b0d29b10f23abfdd31aed44a756f/src/common/DefTermBase.h#L404">
this line of code</a>
that sends a <code>WM_</code><code>NULL</code> message to the foreground
window to determine whether it is responding.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m guilty of that. I now of course correctly only use WM_USER and WM_APP ranges. I guess the fact that it says WM_NULL says &#8216;sentinel&#8217; to me before it says WM. Which is of course fantastically bogus&#8230;</p>

		<p>Speaking of accessibility, why is Windows still buggy when it comes to remembering user-selected mouse pointer theme? Whenever I set one of the &#8220;large&#8221; themes, it&#8217;s back to normal after system restart.</p>

		<p>I also use a large mouse pointer theme. I am not experiencing the problem you describe. Perhaps there is some &#8220;mouse enhancement&#8221; software that is resetting it.</p>

		<p>Speaking of themes, I noticed that Windows randomly thinks the theme has been edited (and shows as an unsaved theme <code>Custom.theme</code>) while it&#8217;s not. I am wondering if some software is misbehaving&#8230;</p>

		<p>Since upgrading to 1703, Windows keeps using the standard mouse pointer instead of my chosen one (even though it does show it in the Mouse applet). I never had these problems with older builds (and I also never had problems with my monitors not going to sleep/Windows not locking the screen before 1703).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
