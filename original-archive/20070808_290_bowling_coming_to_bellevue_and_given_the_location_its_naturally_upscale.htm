The lounge be positioned on the second floor, beneath <a href="http://www.parlorbilliards.com/"> Parlor Billiards</a>, a business which by a fantastic coincidence has exactly the same business model as the bowling all^H^H^Hlounge, but with billiards instead of bowling. By Christmastime, the 23,900 square foot venue will be the site of strikes, splits, and, no doubt, lots of failed <a href="http://www.jimloy.com/bowling/spares.htm"> pick-up</a> attempts.</p>

		<p>Our msft team just moved into offices in Lincoln Square, the first of a few waves of Microsofties invading Bellevue in order to relieve the office space shortage in Redmond. It was most interesting, as Microsofties, being the only people in jeans and t-shirts in a pool hall mostly populated with &quot;urban casual&quot; downtown types and sharply dressed, well manicured bouncers. I assume the &quot;upscale&quot; bowling alley will be the same experience. It will be fascinating to watch: will Microsoft change downtown Bellevue apparel norms or will we transplanted Microsofties, now miles from our Redmond home (ok, so about 4 miles), learn to dress up to go drink beer and shoot pool so we fit in better with Bellevue types? Only time will tell.</p>

		<p>Sounds like the Garage on Capitol Hill (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.garagebilliards.com/homeb.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.garagebilliards.com/homeb.htm</a>), but with fewer hipsters.</p>

		<p>These Lucky Strikes are Chains, I think the first one was in Chicago, opened to a ton of fairfare (My boss showed me a huge article on it in one of his AV/Sound magazines.) &nbsp;They had one in ST. Louis at the Mills Mall, but it went belly up. &nbsp;Strange business model at times it seemed. &nbsp;The Bar (with it&#8217;s 9-10 screens) tended to play sports, but the Screens on teh lanes would often showcase Art or the like.</p>

  lots of failed pick-up attempts.

<p>I like the dual meaning there. :-) &nbsp;I do it myself sometimes.</p>

		<p>*yawn* There has always been bowling in Bellevue. If you prefer your bowling de-yuppified, check out the Sun Villa down the hill from Bellevue Community College.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
