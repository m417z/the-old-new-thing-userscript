		<p>Actually, the claw machines can have their difficulty adjusted&#8211;even to the point of making it purposefully unwinnable except for 1/X plays. &nbsp;I looked this up once after making a perfect drop that didn&#39;t even come close to getting the toy.</p>

		<p>Apparently most (all?) of these claw machines have settings to increase or decrease the odds of winning. This can be done by adjusting the strength of the grip or more deviously by fixing the &quot;payout&quot; percentage. Merely spotting a loose toy is not enough to guarantee a win if you don&#39;t know the machine.</p>
<p>Some interesting discussion and video here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.joystiq.com/2007/01/04/patience-key-to-beating-arcade-crane-games/" rel="nofollow">http://www.joystiq.com/&#8230;/patience-key-to-beating-arcade-crane-games</a></p>
<p>Especially this quote is good to keep in mind if you&#39;re going to try and game the system:</p>
<p>&quot;&#8230;I use to work for a company that distributed the toys to the people who own the crane games and I can assure you that regardless of how many times it takes to pull that thing out, you are not getting your money&#39;s worth.&quot;</p>

		<p>Vilx: From one of the links in your search: “I guess that’s like the third time it’s happened at the Robinson Mall from what I was told by security guards,”</p>
<p>Apparently it happens so often that it&#39;s only newsworthy if there&#39;s no key available and they have to call the fire department, or somebody records it on video.</p>

		<p>He means that the machine is rigged so that the claw will only grip properly one in x times (e.g. 1 in 4 or 1 in 12). &nbsp;Wikipedia (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claw_crane" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Claw_crane</a>) has a pretty in depth article at the number of ways the game can be rigged. &nbsp;While I always knew it was rigged, I had never known how badly</p>

		<p>My brother and I have a system, one of us stands on the side and the other at the front, we then direct the controller to move it backward or forwards. It allows us to get the x and y axis pretty well dead on, but even then we sometimes fail to get the prize, most likely due to rigging.</p>

		<p>@David Walker, SimonRev got it&#8211;I meant it to be the same as &quot;X%&quot;, some arbitrary chance of winning where if you&#39;re not lucky, your skill doesn&#39;t matter *at all*.</p>

		<p>My little brother wasted a whole bunch of cash trying to &#39;win&#39; a finding nemo plush from one of these. After he had given up and we were about to leave, we noticed the tech come to refill the prizes in the machine, so my dad just paid him for the plush.</p>

		<p>@Worf, we already knew this because we see &quot;Commenter J. Random asks&#8230;&quot; posts linked back into 2008, such as <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/05/16/10164682.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/10164682.aspx</a> . &nbsp;If Raymond pushes the answer into the queue soon after the question is asked, then the lag between question and answer reveals the approximate queue length.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also been getting longer. &nbsp;IIRC, posts in &#39;07 answer comments from &#39;05. &nbsp;This makes &quot;the OLD new thing&quot; extra appropriate as a blog title.</p>
<p>Of course, all of this assumes &quot;the queue&quot; really exists as such, and Raymond doesn&#39;t randomly troll his archives for old comments to respond to.</p>

		<p>Sliced, the US TV series, showed a Claw Machine being cut in half and showed the air compressor mechanism used to give the 1/X win rate. &nbsp;The arcade owner could set the potential win rate X to be as long or short as they want. &nbsp;If you hear the compressor kick in it&#39;s a &quot;win&quot; possibility so you&#39;d better get your grab right on that attempt!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
