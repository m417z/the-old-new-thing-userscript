Today's Little Program obtains the comment string for a share.
This is what shows up in the <code>net view</code> output like this:
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt;>net view \\scratch
Shared resources at \\scratch

Share name  Type  Used as  Comment

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
temp        Disk           <a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/07/10171801.aspx">MAY BE DELETED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT WARNING</a>
The command completed successfully.
</pre>
<p>
Here goes.
Remember: Little Programs do little to no error checking.
</p>
<pre>
#define UNICODE
#define _UNICODE
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;lm.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int __cdecl wmain(int argc, wchar_t **argv)
{
 PSHARE_INFO_1 info1;
 NetShareGetInfo(argv[1], argv[2], 1, (LPBYTE*)&amp;info1);
 printf("name = %ls\n", info1-&gt;shi1_netname);
 printf("remark = %ls\n", info1-&gt;shi1_remark);

 return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
The expected command line arguments are the server name
and the share name.
We ask for
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb525407(v=vs.85).aspx">
information level 1</a>,
which gives us the name, the type, and the remark.
I just print the name and the remark.

		<p>I must say, that looking at the numberings of the various information structures, I have to wonder how they got numbered.</p>
<p>It&#39;s almost as if different groups were assigned different numeric ranges and then numbers were chosen arbitrarily within those ranges.</p>
<p>For example, SHARE_INFO has numbers, 0, 1, 2, 501, 502, 503, 1004, 1005, 1006, and 1501; while SERVER_INFO has 100, 101, 102, 402, 403, 502, 503, 1005, 1010, 1016, 1017, 1018, 1107, and many in the 1500 range.</p>

		<p>Always interesting to see these &quot;how do you do xyz&quot; posts (i.e. getting a piece of info that is displayed in the output of some part of Windows)</p>
<p>The in-depth look at parts of the User subsystem in Raymond&#39;s book is amazing as well.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
