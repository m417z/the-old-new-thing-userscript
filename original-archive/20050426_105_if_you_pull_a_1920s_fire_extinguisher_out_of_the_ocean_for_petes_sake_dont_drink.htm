<p> Oceanographer Curtis Ebbesmeyer is a fascinating source of information. He appeared again on <a href="http://www.kuow.org/">my local public radio station</a> to discuss issues related to garbage floating in the ocean. For example, at the 5:05 mark, he reminds us that, <a href="http://www.kuow.org/weekday.asp?Archive=04-15"> if you pull a 1920's fire extinguisher out of the ocean, you shouldn't drink it</a>. </p>
<p> Other fascinating facts: </p>
<ul>
<li>Ten-pound bowling balls float. </li>
<li>Sneakers float upside-down, and the tongue acts as a rudder, resulting in left-footed sneakers and right-footed sneakers washing up on different shores. (Beachcombers from different-footed shores occasionally meet up to try to assemble a pair.) </li>
<li>There are 1939 different species of plastic ducks. </li>
</ul>

		<p>Those 29000 rubber ducks/beavers/frogs that washed overboard in 1992 are particuarly fascinating&#8230; that must be the oddest way a science has ever advanced.</p>
<p>Beachcombers.org is down but I found a story with some pics:</p>

		<p>If you drink a fire extinguisher, don&#8217;t throw it into the ocean.</p>
<p>BTW, I suppose drinking it qualifies for &quot;extended exposure&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=478457" rel="nofollow">http://answers.google.com/answers/threadview?id=478457</a></p>

		<p>I really do worry about Pete,  if people aren&#8217;t worrying about his sake all sorts of nasty things potentially befall the guy.  Without supervision he seems to be lacking in a certain amount of uncommon,  common sense.</p>
<p>This web-site:  <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://members.aol.com/MorelandC/HaveOriginsData.htm" rel="nofollow">http://members.aol.com/MorelandC/HaveOriginsData.htm</a></p>
<p>suggests that the phrase<br />
<br />&quot;euphemisms for the phrases &quot;for the love of God/Christ&quot; or &quot;for God&#8217;s/ Christ&#8217;s sake&quot;&#8230; &#8230;Why Pete?  Most likely it is a reference to the catholic Saint Peter.&quot;</p>
<p>There are some ther quirky phrase origins listed at the site</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
