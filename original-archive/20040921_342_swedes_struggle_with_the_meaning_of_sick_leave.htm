<p>As part of the continuing campaign to shed their hard-working stereotype, perhaps <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/07/27/198411.aspx"> taking a cue from their more well-adjusted Norwegian neighbors</a>, <a href="http://story.news.yahoo.com/news?tmpl=story&amp;u=/nm/20040917/od_nm/sweden_sickness_dc"> Swedes have been taking dubious sick leave in record numbers</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  [A] study showed 40 percent believe it is enough to feel tired to stay home and draw benefits.  </p>
<p> A survey of 1,002 Swedes by the board also showed 65 percent believed they could go on sick leave if they felt stressed at work and 41 percent thought a conflict with their boss or workmates was a good enough reason.  </p>
<p> One fifth thought a strike at the child care center also made them eligible for the benefits and 71 percent said family problems entitled them always or sometimes to sick leave. </p>

<p> Reuters claims <i><a href="http://www.dn.se/">Dagens Nyheter</a></i> as the source, but if you punch "Anna Hedborg" into DN:s search engine, asking for articles within the last week, it finds nothing. But if you ask Google, the article is right there: <i><a href="http://www.dn.se/DNet/jsp/polopoly.jsp?a=320915">Tr&ouml;tta sjukskriver sig</a></i> (<i>The tired call in sick</i>). Once again, Google finds a web page that the site itself cannot. </p>
<p> On a somewhat related note, <a href="http://www.sr.se/ekot/artikel.asp?artikel=473711"> a different type of sick-leave abuse has been detected</a>. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  According to the Social Insurance Board, several people  have been drawing sick-leave pay for several years, while simultaneously working another job and receiving unemployment benefits. </p>
<p> Some cases are of ordinary people who defraud the Board in small amounts but over a long period of time. In the other cases, there are links to serious economic crime where, for example, money was paid out to fictitious employees at nonexistent companies. </p>

		<p>When I lived in Sweden in the 70s it was well known that it was not allowed to make computer runs comparing the information in two systems.</p>
<p>So for instance kindergarten charges were based on income before tax that you told them you had and the local authority was not allowed to match this with your tax returns.</p>
<p>Oddly enough the people more easily able to afford kindergarten charges were usually the ones claiming low incomes (while bringing the kid to work by Mercedes).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all part of the Swedish &quot;we can trust people&quot; mentality and it maybe used to work but it doesn&#8217;t nowadays.</p>
<p>It was well-known that Volvo had very high absenteeism on Mondays. But equally well-known that it was impossible for them to get rid of the worst offenders.</p>

		<p>So what? Why is it NOT okay to take a sick day when you&#8217;re feeling tired or to leave if you&#8217;ve had an argument with the boss? Stop thinking like a boot-licker Ray.</p>

		<p>I think we&#8217;re coming up against the American view of what&#8217;s acceptable. We have more holidays, and generally the law is more worker /family friendly.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t condone throwing a sickie because you really need to be sick to do so, but often people come in to work when they are sick and infect their whole office&#8230;<br />
<br />Stress can make you unable to work, and in this country you can be signed off work by a doctor due to stress: you are counted as sick if you are unable to work due to health problems.<br />
<br />Therefore you would also be unable to work if you were exhausted (but not just &#8216;tired&#8217;).<br />
<br />If your nursery was on strike suddenly, you&#8217;d have to look after your kids. This wouldn&#8217;t be counted as sick leave, but would no doubt be treated with compassion by your employer, and maybe counted under your allowance for parental unpaid leave.</p>

		<p>Lots of companies won&#8217;t allow people to take unpaid time while they still have paid time on the books. So the time they need off in effect, becomes sick time. Employees learn this and make it happen more often than not. I have taken days off for personal reasons, but here where I work we don&#8217;t have sick time, just PTO (Personal Time Off).</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t doubt that the system is abused. That said, it may often be better in the long run to not always wait until you are &quot;actually sick&quot; before you stay home. If it makes you come back to work much quicker, what&#8217;s the problem? Personally, I also prefer if my colleagues that think they are about to come down with a fever stay outside my breathing sphere.</p>
<p>Of course I work in the IT industry, like everyone else reading this I guess, and it is commonly feasible for me to do large parts of my work from home at any time of the day, week or year. Thus I rarely call in sick unless I&#8217;m completely floored and instead do what work I *can* without exhausting myself even if it&#8217;s only responding to the occasional &quot;What&#8217;s the deal with this bug?&quot;-mail.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m aware that this wouldn&#8217;t work quite as well if I were part of a team at an assembly line or a if I were a dentist.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
