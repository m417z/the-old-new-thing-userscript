<!-- CONTENT START -->
<p>
A customer had a Web-based full-screen application,
and they wanted to write a companion application
that did the following every second:
</p>
<ul>
<li><code>FindWindow</code> &rarr;
    <code>InvalidateRect</code> &rarr;
    <code>UpdateWindow</code>, or</p>
<li><code>FindWindow</code> &rarr;
    <code>RedrawWindow</code>.
</ul>
<p>
They wanted to know whether there was some other API for redrawing
a window,
because the mechanisms above have the side effect of causing the
window to flicker.
</p>
<p>
This is a strange sort of request, so we asked the customer
what they are trying to accomplish by triggering artificial
redraws.
After all, if the content didn't change, then there's no point
in redrawing.
And if the content did change,
the Web page will redraw itself anyway.
And the issue isn't that they want to F5-refresh the Web page,
because a redraw doesn't trigger a page refresh.
What's the use case for forcing a redundant redraw?
</p>
<p>
The customer explained that they are using a specific
display monitor from a specific manufacturer,
and they found that some of the monitors go to black
if they display an unchanging image
for more than a few minutes.
These monitors are being used in public spaces where it
is expected that the content may remain unchanged for
an extended period of time.
The customer is already working with
the monitor manufacturer to investigate the problem,
but they are looking for a workaround while the
root cause investigation continues.
</p>
<p>
If you look at the problem that way,
you'll see that even if they got the workaround they
wanted, it wouldn't solve their problem!
The problem is that the display monitor has a defect where
it requires screen updates.
They are looking for something that forces a screen update.
They found something that forces a screen update,
but it causes the screen to flicker.
But what they don't realize is that
the flicker is the screen update!
If you perform a flickerless redraw, then no pixels
on the screen will change,
and then the monitors will go to black.
</p>
<p>
The customer doesn't realize it, but they <i>want</i>
flicker,
because it is the flicker that is keeping the monitors
from going dark.
They just want a tiny bit of flicker instead of an entire
screen full of flicker, which is what they're getting now.
</p>
<p>
My recommendation is create a 1&times;1 window,
show it on the screen for one second,
and then remove it.
Choose a corner of the screen, so it won't be too noticeable
to the user.
If the corner of the screen normally shows a white pixel,
you might have your tiny pop-up window show a very light gray pixel,
so that even if the user is watching for the flicker,
it will be barely noticeable.
(You'll have to experiment to see how much flicker is needed
in order to keep the monitors from going black.)
Show the window without taking focus so that the main application
remains unaffected.
</p>
<p>
Don't go around trying to poke other applications' windows.
If you want to update the screen, then update the screen.
</p>
<p>
Imagine you have a security camera that goes to sleep if
nothing moves for five minutes.
You have the security camera pointed at a giant ship that
is docked and not moving.
Redrawing the application window is like asking the ship to
move forward a little bit, then move back.
Much easier is to build a little machine that waves a stick
in front of the camera.
But what you definitely don't want to do is build an
<i>invisible</i> stick.</p>

		<p>Here&#8217;s a use case for wanting to do this exact thing.  I own a window that embeds a child window owned by a helper process over its whole client area.  If I add WS_THICKFRAME, Windows likes to draw over the borders when the window is activated or deactivated, despite my best efforts to return 0 from the WM_NCCALCSIZE handler or to use DwmExtendFrameIntoClientArea.  My process&#8217;s window receives the WM_ACTIVATE message and WM_NCPAINT messages and I want to handle one of both of these by telling the child window to redraw part of itself because we can assume that Windows drew over the edge of the window.</p>
<p>The biggest issue here is synchronization.  Any functions that use SendMessage shouldn&#8217;t be used, which potentially rules out UpdateWindow.  I settled on using InvalidateRect with a bErase parameter of FALSE to avoid flicker.</p>

		<p>Many monitors come with some form of burn-in protection or auto-sleep functionality, especially if they comply with EnergyStar standards.  Usually there&#8217;s an option in the monitor&#8217;s OSD menu that allows this to be disabled, but I&#8217;ve definitely encountered monitors that don&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>What threw me was the fact that some monitors did it and some didn&#8217;t. It sounds like they&#8217;re all identical models. I guess they might have just been configured differently.</p>

		<p>@Falcon: those who use third-party router firmware know well the tendency of manufacturers to completely change a device&#8217;s internals while keeping the same model number. I imagine it&#8217;s either that, or a difference in the monitor&#8217;s firmware version.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m going to use my psychic powers. Being a public space, I would bet the monitor has some kind of plasma display (they are brighter and easier to read from odd angles than LCDs). Plasma displays are basically arrays of tiny CRTs, one subpixel pixel each (R, G or B), and like CRTs, they suffer from burn out. You can see this at airports and bus stations. Thus, the &#8220;defect&#8221; can be an anti-burn feature that switches off the display when an static image has been shown for too long.</p>

		<p>Now I&#8217;m curious if the customer simply wasn&#8217;t aware of the Power Management settings in Windows which turn off your monitor after some time of inactivity. Or if it was a &#8220;feature&#8221; of the driver or monitor because they didn&#8217;t know how to properly implement standard sleep features&#8230;</p>

		<p>I was thinking of a similar answer&#8230; many years ago, I wrote a quick little app that would occasionally (every 30 seconds or so) adjust the mouse position by one px (and then back)&#8230; this would let me disable my screensaver while the app was running (in retrospect, a button to &#8220;enable/disable&#8221; would&#8217;ve been a nice enhancement)&#8230; same concept :)</p>

		<p>Apart from the &#8220;solving the wrong problem&#8221; issue, I have to question their chosen frequency. If the monitor is going dark after not being updated for more than a second then how did it even get shipped as a working product?</p>

		<p>The line &#8220;they wanted to write a companion application that did the following every second&#8221; is what I am calling out. It&#8217;s as if they think that unless they do it *every second* the monitor will go dark, which is ridiculous. Later in the article it is mentioned that they are aware that the monitor goes dark after a few minutes, so again I have to question their desired refresh frequency.</p>

		<p>I read it that the companion application that did &#8220;the following&#8221; every second was just to make sure that something got written so the monitor would not go dark.</p>
<p>I question why the solution had to run every second, instead of every 30 seconds or so, but &#8230; whatever.</p>

		<p>&gt;it is called a clock</p>
<p>I think you missed from the original text: &#8220;Web-based full-screen application&#8221; and &#8220;being used in public spaces &#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a kiosk. And the browser is full-screen, so the clock is covered. And these are typically setup (at least one hopes) that users cannot access the taskbar/start-menu/those-funny-tile-things. </p>
<p>What we know &#8211; they have control over the software loaded on the machine. We don&#8217;t know that they have any control over the web-based content (they could be just setting machines up under a contract for someone else). So rule out using JS to dynamically &amp; periodically change the CSS on some small  elements.</p>

		<p>I was thinking the same thing.  It would make more sense if they made their content just dynamic enough that the screens don&#8217;t display identical content for hours at a time.  At that rate, you might as well use posters instead (cheaper too).</p>

		<p>And I first thought it&#8217;s just the screen saver / power management kicking in when I read that their issue is a monitor going black.</p>

		<p>Just make a gif of the company&#8217;s logo rotating, or morphing somehow, and stick it in the corner the web page you&#8217;re displaying. Problem solved.</p>

		<p>The stick has been used in real life, only it was a beckoning cat (&#8220;maneki-neko&#8221;). It was a fairly clever solution, and cute, too!<br />

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
