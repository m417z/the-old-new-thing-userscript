        Reader Jeff Miller added Word-style scroll tips to our sample scrollbar program. Here's
        how he did it: 
    </p>
<pre>HWND g_hwndTT;              /* tooltip control */
TOOLINFO g_ti;              /* tooltip info struct */
BOOL g_fInScroll;           /* Scroll state */

void CancelScrollTip()
{
    if (g_fInScroll) {
        g_fInScroll = FALSE;
        SendMessage(g_hwndTT, TTM_TRACKACTIVATE,
                    FALSE, (LPARAM)&amp;g_ti);
    }
}

void UpdateScrollTip()
{
    if (!g_hwndTT) return;
    if (!g_fInScroll) {
        g_fInScroll = TRUE;
        DWORD dwPos = GetMessagePos();
        SendMessage(g_hwndTT, TTM_TRACKPOSITION, 0,
                    MAKELPARAM(GET_X_LPARAM(dwPos) +
                               GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXVSCROLL)
                               GET_Y_LPARAM(dwPos)));
        SendMessage(g_hwndTT, TTM_TRACKACTIVATE, TRUE,
                    (LPARAM)&amp;g_ti);
    }
    // Reset the text to LPSTR_TEXTCALLBACK so it will get
    // re-fetched
    SendMessage(g_hwndTT, TTM_SETTOOLINFO, 0,
                (LPARAM)&amp;g_ti);
}

LRESULT
OnNotify(HWND hwnd, int id, LPNMHDR pnm)
{
    switch (pnm-&gt;code) {
    case TTN_GETDISPINFO:
        {
            NMTTDISPINFO *pnmtdi = (NMTTDISPINFO*)pnm;
            wnsprintf(pnmtdi-&gt;lpszText, 80,
                      TEXT("Line: %d"), g_yOrigin);
        }
        break;
    }
    return 0;
}

// change case statement in OnVscroll:
    case SB_THUMBTRACK:     ScrollTo(hwnd, GetTrackPos(hwnd, SB_VERT));
                            UpdateScrollTip(); break;
// add case statement to OnVscroll:
    case SB_ENDSCROLL:      CancelScrollTip(); break;

// add to OnCreate

    /* Create and initialize the tooltip */
    g_hwndTT = CreateWindow(TOOLTIPS_CLASS, NULL,
             WS_POPUP | TTS_NOPREFIX | TTS_ALWAYSTIP,
             CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT,
             CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT,
             hwnd, NULL, NULL, NULL);
    if (g_hwndTT) {
        g_ti.cbSize = sizeof(g_ti);
        g_ti.uFlags = TTF_TRACK;
        g_ti.hwnd = hwnd;
        g_ti.lpszText = LPSTR_TEXTCALLBACK;
        SendMessage(g_hwndTT, TTM_ADDTOOL, 0, (LPARAM)&amp;g_ti);
    }

// add to WndProc
    case WM_NOTIFY: return OnNotify(hwnd, (int)wParam,
                                    (LPNMHDR)lParam);
</pre>
<p>
        A tracking tooltip is used to display the scroll tip because we don't want the tooltip
        to do automatic positioning or automatic show/hide. 
    </p>
<p>
        When a tracking scroll occurs (<code>SB_THUMBTRACK</code>), we update the scroll tip,
        displaying it if necessary. When the tracking scroll ends (<code>SB_ENDSCROLL</code>),
        we remove the tip. 
    </p>
<p>
        The above code mimics the Word XP style, where the tooltip appears near the original
        thumb position but does not follow the thumb as the user scrolls. If you prefer that
        the tooltip follow the thumb, remove the <code>if (!g_fInScroll)</code> test from
        the <code>UpdateScrollTip</code> function.

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
