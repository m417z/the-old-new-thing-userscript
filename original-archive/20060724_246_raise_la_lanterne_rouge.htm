<p>Sure, everybody knows that Floyd Landis won this year's Tour de France. But what about the guy who came in last? While the race leader wears the <i>maillot jaune</i> (yellow jersey), the person at the bottom of the pack is saddled with the <a href="http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/07/23/sports/LANTERN.php"> <i>lanterne rouge</i></a> (red lantern), after the lamp that hangs on the back of a train. This year's "winner" is Wim Vansevenant, who at least appears to be a good sport about it.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Lanterne rouge is not a position you go for. It comes for you. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> (It also amuses me that there's even a <a href="http://tdflr.blogspot.com/"> Tour de France Lanterne Rouge blog</a> which keeps track of who is "pulling up the rear" throughout the race.) </p>
<p> Now, mind you, at least he finished the race, which is more than can be said for <a href="http://www.letour.fr/2006/TDF/LIVE/us/2000/abandons.html"> the thirty-some-odd people who dropped out for one reason or another</a>. All of whose water bottles I am not worthy to carry, of course. </p>

		<p>Wim Vansevenant actually competed with the french rider Jimmy Casper in the last time trial to ride as slowly as possible, and yet finish in time.<br />
<br />Being the red lantern at least gets you some publicity. You are invited to post-tour criteria etc&#8230; &nbsp;</p>

		<p>is this a deliberate reference to the excellent 1991 film of the same name &#8216;Raise the red Lantern&quot; where getting the red lantern has a VERY different meaning &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101640/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0101640/</a><br /></p>

		<p>Railroads in the USA stopped using the veneral caboose in favor of a a bright flashing light called a FRED. Railroads officially expand that acronym as &quot;Flashing Rear End Device,&quot; while their employees often substitute a different word for the &quot;F.&quot; &quot;La lanterne rouge&quot; has a more classy sound, but we could say FRED faster and attach one more quickly. Same negative connotations, of course.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve never heard the &quot;FRED&quot; name before, I always heard them called EOT devices or markers (End Of Train).</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.trains.com/trn/default.aspx?c=a&amp;id=220" rel="nofollow">http://www.trains.com/trn/default.aspx?c=a&#038;id=220</a></p>
<p>Just as cabooses were variously called hacks, crummies, cabins, etc., end-of-train devices go by a variety of names. Besides ETD, there&#8217;s EOT, marker, FRED or Freddy (flashing rear-end device), even Billy and Redman.<br /></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
