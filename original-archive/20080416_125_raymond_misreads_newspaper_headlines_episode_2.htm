<p>I have a strange tendency to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/04/8355309.aspx"> misread newspaper headlines</a>.

		<p>Actual headline from the Detroit Free Press circa 1971:</p>
<p>FEAR SPRAY CAN GAS LIFE TIME BOMB</p>
<p>Very few readers could determine from the headline what the article was about &#8212; Freon eroding the ozone layer. &nbsp;In other words, scientists fear that the gas in spray-cans is a time-bomb for all life. &nbsp;But the DFP deems the word &quot;scientists&quot; much too long to be in large type.</p>
<p>Oh, well, I suppose it seduced some people into reading the paper, which is after all the main purpose of a headline.</p>
<p>-Wang-Lo.</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t say that I&#8217;ve ever referred to instant messaging as such, or even heard it called that outside of TV. &nbsp;It&#8217;s alway &quot;MSN&quot;ing or &quot;ICQ&quot;ing depending on the application in question. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Sometimes these are intentional, as in my local paper years back: &quot;Selectmen sort through trash options&quot;. The editor told me she preferred &quot;rummage&quot; but the headline length thing stopped that.</p>

		<p>Weird, I&#8217;ve never heard of anyone over 10 years old swimming a 100 IM, and I don&#8217;t recall ever seeing the 25 meter pool to do it in. I wonder if anyone can just walk in to the &quot;short course swimming world championships&quot; and jump in the pool for a race.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  FEAR SPRAY CAN GAS LIFE TIME BOMB
</p></blockquote>
<p>The next logical step was, of course:</p>
<p>FEAR SPRAY CAN HAS CHEESEBURGER</p>
<p>And thus LOLcat was born.</p>

		<p>@DC</p>
<p>That&#8217;ll teach me to do my research after posting. In the US, we generally swim in 25 yard pools, but nearly all of our major competitions (all that i&#8217;ve been to) are in 50m pools. I suppose it&#8217;s ironic in this context because I used to complain that the damn european&#8217;s were making us swim in 50m pools. I just assumed they were all 50m and not 25m. Either way, the 100 IM stops being an event after the 8-10 age group. As for speed, I&#8217;m fairly certain I can still push a 100 (yard) IM in under a minute easily, but you&#8217;re right, I would be beaten fairly badly.</p>
<p>The point I was trying to make was that I don&#8217;t believe that &quot;short course&quot; world records are nearly as contested as olympic course world records. Especially for an event that is impossible to swim in a 50m pool. It&#8217;s not surprising to me that those records fall so easily when a slippery new suit comes out.</p>
<p>Pre-emptive return to stupidity: IM has always meant individual medley to me, I&#8217;m not sure how raymond could have mis-understood that headlne.</p>

		<p>@Bryn,</p>
<p>What kind of wondering is that? you clearly don&#8217;t know what you are talking about. As someone who swims every day on a 25 meter pool:</p>
<p>* maybe in the US you have too much space and can afford all pools to be 50 m, but in Spain 25m pools are far more usual than 50m ones.</p>
<p>* I challenge you to just jump in the pool for such a race next to one of the guys who participated in the championship. I am quite sure you will still be swimming the first 25m that he/she will have already finished.</p>

		<p>My favourite sports headline was about Scottish football:</p>
<p>&quot;Super Cally Go Ballistic, Celtic are Atrocious&quot;</p>
<p>Genius.</p>
<p>I found some more when checking the above headline:</p>
<p>About lack of library services in Essex:</p>
<p>&quot;Book Lack in Ongar&quot;</p>
<p>On the polar explorer, Dr Vivian Fuchs, setting off on a new expedition:</p>
<p>&quot;DR FUCHS OFF TO THE ANTARCTIC&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
