		<p>Can you enlighten me why it is possible to mount CD or DVD as a iso/udf file system, but not any other arbitrary set of bytes? Why is Windows so inflexible in this matter? Or are data CD/DVD some sort of magic thing that just cannot possibly exist in a image file?</p>
<p>The need to fiddle around with ISO tools that either bug, do unnecessary copying or install kernel drivers annoys quite much when in *nix you can mount iso files with the quite obvious &quot;mount&quot; command. Atleast an API for that would be nice since people are starting to move their CD&#8217;s more to HDD with the current rate of capacity increase in HDD. Can you even mount floppy images without writing a driver, doubt it..<br /></p>

		<p>In the enlightened year of 2005, we still have programs that assume Windows is installed on C:WINDOWS. </p>
<p>I recently installed a new shell, and my Windows is installed on D:. The shell proceeded to read all my icons and start menu from my old windows installation on C: which I haven&#8217;t deleted yet. Total time this shell was installed for: 2 minutes.</p>
<p>On the bright side, some viruses fail with a &quot;path not found&quot; error :)</p>

		<p>Does ISO allow long file names?  I have always thought that long files names are outside of the ISO spec.</p>

		<p>ISO-9660 has very DOS-like filenames, but virtually every CD and CD burning suite has used Joliet or UDF for years. (With ISO as a fallback option.) Both still have severe restrictions on path+name length, but not like ISO.</p>
<p>In fact UDF support is required for DVDs.</p>

		<p>I put together a media PC (MCE) recently, and when it came to install the drivers for the TV tuners, the driver install program (some godforsaken MFC abortion, obviously, not some sane form of driver install), it crashed after showing a splash screen.</p>
<p>TV tuner functionality being quite essential, I investigated this, and guessed after a while that it was because my Windows system drive was drive G: &#8211; remember kids, never install Windows with the integrated CF/SD readers actually plugged into the USB bus :-(</p>
<p>About a minute later, I remembered our old friend, the &#8216;subst&#8217; command from my DOS days.  After a quick subst command to make C: redirect to G:, the drivers installed fine.</p>
<p>I also emailed the IHV to inform them about these problems.  That was months ago, and I never got a reply, of course.</p>
<p>I, for one, am glad that MS decided to put a space in &quot;Program Files&quot;.  Can you imagine how many apps still wouldn&#8217;t cope with spaces in filenames if they hadn&#8217;t?</p>

		<p>ISO 9660 is two standards in one.  You can have disks with 8.3 file names or disks with 30 character file names.  Both are very widely supported.</p>
<p>Microsoft Joliet is additional data on the disk supporting UNICODE filenames up to 64 characters.</p>
<p>MS chose to produce CDs with ISO-standard 8.3 filenames and long names in the Joliet extension.  But they could just as easily have produced disks with ISO-standard 30 character filenames and the same names in the Joliet extension, or no Joliet extension at all.  (The file causing the problem, pkeyconfig.xml, is much less than 30 chars.)</p>
<p>Even in the enlightened year of 2005, why does MS produce CDs with unnecessary 8.3 filenames?</p>

		<p>What puzzled me for a long time is this:<br />
<br />&#8211; MS Joliet supports UNICODE filenames up to 64 characters<br />
<br />&#8211; MS Windows supports UNICODE filenames up to 256 characters<br />
<br />The MS CD format cannot handle the MS file names :-)<br /></p>

		<p>Here&#8217;s a question; seems to me that the Windows install files have been 8.3 forever, until perhaps now in Vista. All DLL&#8217;s and EXE&#8217;s in Windows (and Office) are 8.3. Now I admit that Windows, when running, seems to use longer files. But perhaps people have (wrongly) assumed that this was a rule.</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe the bios only knows about 8.3 names?&quot;</p>
<p>IIRC, the 8.3 install file thing is because of old CD-ROM drivers.  If you were really unlucky, your Windows CD-ROM driver would not allow anything other than access to the 8.3 filenames/toc.  (Kind of like how if you were really unlucky, Windows couldn&#8217;t use your HD in 32-bit mode, so it emulated it and slaughtered I/O performance.)</p>
<p>This was the case in the days of Windows 95/98, certainly &#8211; at the time I investigated shipping our product (a game) on a CD with LFNs, and was told fairly firmly (either by an MSDN note, or an actual MS dev from the DX/game support group at a Meltdown event) that I really didn&#8217;t want to do that.</p>
<p>To be fair, I believe that even at that time, you had to be really unlucky to get a CD-ROM drive that would only allow 8.3 access.</p>
<p>Of course, we later found out that one of our test PCs was such a beast&#8230;we found out when trying to install another product, I should point out.</p>
<p>Our product worked fine :-p</p>

		<p>The installer for Visual Studio 2005 does not properly handle long file names.  Specifically, it crashes if your temporary directory does not have a short file name.</p>
<p>I would hope that the installer doesn&#8217;t try to kick off a 16-bit executable, but you&#8217;ve got to wonder.<br /></p>

		<p>Tim,</p>
<p>I remembered SUBST a few days ago too.  I had some insanely long directory to go through and said &quot;I wonder if SUBST is still in XP&#8230;&quot; and it was!  It solved my problem and worked wonderfully.  My *nix shell program that I was running a open source program through had no problem handling the new drive.</p>
<p>Does anyone know if any problems would have trouble with SUBST&#8217;d drives?  Some DOS programs didn&#8217;t really like them.  (I remember after finding SUBST in DOS I ran into programs that said &quot;Don&#8217;t run this if you&#8217;ve got a SUBST&#8217;d drive.&quot;)</p>

		<p>We use SUBST on a regular basis for swapping various source tree versions in and out, and most of the developer tools have no problem.  Be aware however, that in newer versions of the OS (XP and later I think) SUBST is logon session specific.  This means that you can&#8217;t create a SUBST, and then point IIS to that subst&#8217;d path as a virtual directory- you&#8217;ll still need to use the physical path so that processes in other logon sessions can refer to the same set of files.</p>
<p>FWIW we also use junction.exe (from SysInternals) to create NTFS reparse points to solve a lot of the same issues, and then some.</p>

		<p>Why it&#8217;s not possible to just give the OS a filesystem definition &amp; type mapping as, say xml or a xml that is transformed into some kind of binary mapper/transformer.</p>
<p>Then you could just give xml version of a filesystem spec to the OS and it would know how to read it without requiring driver done with the piece of crap called IFS. MS asks $$$ for it just because it so shoddy work that they don&#8217;t want everyone to see it.</p>
<p>I want to be able to mount any file system with relative ease, atleast read only, by throwing some spec at the system. There should be a redirector to handle the hook and user mode driver handling the translation.</p>

<p>Bwahahaha. I&#8217;ve had a virus try to install itself in C:WINNT (I had Windows 2000 at the time). This was immediately obvious because&#8230; my Windows was in C:WINNT_3 (had some huge problems with Windows that required reinstalling it twice); it actually created C:WINNT. I found that downright hilarious.</p>

		<p>Wizard to turn any spec into code, only Microsoft could do that.</p>
<p>However some kind of system wide integration point to make it possible for example from command prompt to go do CD c:file.zipblah or file.isoabc and have the IOCTL be handled by user mode driver which in turn could be hooked up with managed code for performing the actual reading or network calls so you could do CD <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="ftp://localhost etc" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="ftp://localhost" rel="nofollow">ftp://localhost</a> etc.</p>
<p>Make the kernel and driver parts as small and safe as possible and let the complexities be handled through io completion callbacks which can then either return data from buffer or spinning a thread to do network reading or whatever. You don&#8217;t need to have ton of kernel drivers.</p>
<p>Microsoft should provide the safe guarded entry points for people in the higher (user mode, .net) to apply innovation by using the information available on higher levels of the OS to the operations on lower level transparently.. Ugh. Time to reduce the number of kernel drivers.</p>
<p>And at that point it might become possible to think about generaziling simpler hierarchical systems for cases where you don&#8217;t need to actually have the whole feature set of a file system to just do the usual open,close,seek,read,write on the data. It sounds hard now since everything happens at kernel level. Time for that to change!</p>

		<p>Too bad you can&#8217;t edit these comments ;-)</p>
<p>The previous comment was quite amusing, so I&#8217;d rather have a some kind of local/remote + seekable/non-seekable place where the user can drop favorite zip/iso etc files, remote web &amp; ftp sites (and setup them optionally permanently).</p>
<p>That&#8217;s possible to do now obviously. However what if you wanted to temporarily let legacy application access these possibly slow, read only or non-seekable system as if they were local? That&#8217;s what I hope would be possible in future. The user knows they are special and can grant, if needed, a more direct access which doesn&#8217;t involve unzipping or full copying necessarily (only long seek accesses to non-seekable systems would involve that in worst case).</p>
<p>There are programs that do this stuff, allow mounting ftp,web,iso,zip at different levels (explorer only mostly). You can write namespace extensions but they do not allow transparent access for legacy software and given they hook that piece of * called explorer they often cause wild array of issues.</p>
<p>Now you have a million programs that imitate explorer style interface and provide zip, ftp etc in these varying interfaces.</p>
<p>Who the he.. wants that? WPF managed and extensible Explorer.. When?!!?</p>

		<p>Doom3 considers Daemon Tools and similar programs to be &quot;hacking tools&quot;, and won&#8217;t let you install it if they are installed. This is another reason why Linux-style loopback mounting of disk images would be useful :-)</p>
<p>Full-service image support like Apple&#8217;s DMG format and associated tools, including &quot;burn image to CD&quot;, would be even nicer.</p>

		<p>Another MS program that doesn&#8217;t understand LFNs: rc.exe (the resource compiler).</p>

		<p>Tell a lie; it&#8217;s VC++ that&#8217;s having trouble.  rc.exe doesn&#8217;t much like LFNs, but it seems you can coax it into using them.  VC++ then seems to spawn some other program which blows up.</p>

		<p>The DDK is more than just a program but the DDK still has problems with LFNs.</p>
<p>PhotoDraw isn&#8217;t even available to MSDN Universal subscribers but PhotoDraw&#8217;s era wasn&#8217;t really too long before 2005.</p>
<p>The Recycle Bin in Windows XP allows filenames longer than 30 characters but I&#8217;m not sure how much longer.  If you use Windows Explorer to delete a file with a name far shorter than 255 characters, it can still be long enough to get a warning that the file can&#8217;t be moved to the recycle bin and a question if you want to delete it outright.</p>
<p>On the other hand, regarding a few people&#8217;s discussions of whether &quot;the&quot; BIOS understands 8.3 filenames, I&#8217;ve owned two that do.  At least two PC makers figured out how to make the BIOS do hibernation into files on a FAT partition before Microsoft released similar functionality in Windows 2000.</p>

		<p>&lt;rant&gt;</p>
<p>&quot;and don&#8217;t get me started. . .&quot;</p>
<p>about product keys and activation.</p>
<p>After having Symantec&#8217;s on-line renewal of my internet security software fail (Novermber, 2004), I purchased a shrunk-wrapped boxed set version.</p>
<p>Never mind that they stiffed me on the mail-in rebates. . .</p>
<p>At random times over the past year, I&#8217;ve been required to &quot;activate my product&quot;.</p>
<p>Which I did, although, it, seemed to me, that there was a problem with the software if it didn&#8217;t know that it&#8217;s a legal version.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Symantec doesn&#8217;t like to talk to people.  It doesn&#8217;t even like to read emails.   Some propeller head at Symantec has decided that they&#8217;re smart enough to answer any problem with software.</p>
<p>The most recent &quot;re-activation&quot; failed, because Symantec keeps a database of activation attempts.  Apparently they think I&#8217;ve activated the software on 24 different machines (my calculation &#8212; reactivation message roughly every two weeks).  So, yesterday, reactivation failed. . . Yada Yada Yada. . .  call this number for technical support. . .   refers you to their &quot;problem solving website. . .   which gives no telephone numbers to call.</p>
<p>There are some really brilliant software concepts there, but, unfortunately, with some really brain-dead implementations.</p>
<p>The bottom line. . .   I was out 3 hours of my life. . .   (I may not have that many left).</p>
<p>Norton Ghost is Great!</p>
<p>Symantec Internet Security is Gone!   (Another three hours, but that&#8217;s the price of freedom).  The fact that I can make this point demonstrates that the problem has been solved.</p>
<p>But my message to software manufacturs re product activation. . .   Make sure it&#8217;s perfect.  If in doubt, make sure you listen to your customers.</p>
<p>&lt;/rant&gt;</p>
<p>I know this is sort of off-topic. . .  but the link led me to it.</p>

		<p>When I put my latest system together and installed everything, by the time I was done, the harddrives had been enumerated, well, a little later than they normally are.</p>
<p>As a result, C, D and E are allocated to a USB memory card reader. F:Windows is where the OS is.</p>

<p>That is exactly where the word &quot;boot&quot; (originally &quot;bootstrap&quot;) came from, in the computer world.  Probably not directly from Heinlein, but both Heinlein and computer workers took it from the ordinary metaphor of a person pulling himself up by his own bootstraps.</p>
<p>By the way one kitten that I had, before she got used to being held facing upwards in my arms, was enormously scared of being held that way.  How scared?  Well, besides paws trying to grab onto everything in sight to turn herself over, she even used two of her paws to grab onto one of her paws and try to use that to turn herself over.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
