<p>One year I decided to dress as a nerd for Hallowe'en. I took an old pair of glasses with large lenses, "repaired" it with some masking tape, and combined it with a plaid dress shirt with a pocket protector and courduroy pants that were too short.</p>
<p> Nobody at work realized I was wearing a costume. </p>
<p> The best Hallowe'en work costume I saw was someone who came dressed as a Christmas tree. Complete with Christmas lights. She had to make sure to stand near an electrical outlet so she could plug herself in. </p>
<p> <b>I wish I had a picture</b>: One of my friends spotted somebody at a work Hallowe'en party dressed as Bill Gates. But not the Bill Gates of today. He was dressed as <a href="http://www.time.com/time/photogallery/0,29307,1630529_1380723,00.html"> Bill Gates from the arrest photo</a>. </p>

		<p>My co-workers and I have often said that our manager&#39;s manager looks a bit like Steve Jobs. Guess who showed up for work today in jeans and a black turtleneck?</p>

		<p>@Raphael: with just jeans and a black turtleneck there&#39;s plausible deniability.</p>
<p>On the other hand, zombie Steve Jobs is definitely too soon.</p>

		<p>I thought Christmas lights weren&#39;t allowed on campus any more. Fire hazard, you know.</p>
<p>Of course, these days you can get battery-powered LED Christmas light strings. Not sure if the safety policy has been updated, but at the very least it would remove the inconvenience of having to stand around next to an outlet.</p>
<p>Though, I think to a certain extent the requirement to stand next to an outlet is arguably an actual, integral aspect of such a costume!</p>

		<p>My younger sister went as a Christmas tree once (circa fourth grade &#8212; came up with the idea herself&#8230;)</p>
<p>As for my least effective costume &#8212; OK, back story first. In the spring of senior year of college, some friends were have frequent &quot;theme&quot; parties. &nbsp;One was &quot;Come as your favorite Oriental or Rastafarian&quot;. My first choice &quot;The president of Sony&quot;, but since I didn&#39;t know his or look, I really couldn&#39;t do him. (I believe I went as Don Ho). &nbsp; Ok, flash forward a few months to October. &nbsp;I&#39;m a now unemployed college graduate who hangs out a lot with his &quot;still-in-school&quot; friends at the college student center. However, over the summer, I&#39;d stumbled upon the name of the (then) president of Sony (Akio Morita). I thought, &quot;Aha.. I can finally do the costume I wanted&quot;. &nbsp;So, on Halloween, I combed my hair like his, and wore a suit with &nbsp;a name tag with a big &quot;SONY&quot; and &quot;Akio Morita&quot; on it. &nbsp;And joined my friends on campus.</p>
<p>Several, upon seeing the suit, remarked &quot;So who are you dressed as, an Employed Person?&quot;</p>

		<p>One of my more effective costumes got some curious questions. Being an aviation nut, I had collected some NASA flightsuits (real nomex ones with the meatball and flag). I decided to wear one of &#39;em, put on my name patch, and go about my day. One of the other tenants on the floor noticed me and asked a coworker what we were doing with NASA and why was the &quot;astronaut&quot; around. (NASA does more than space &#8211; they do literally tons of flight research&#8230;).</p>
<p>I still have it &#8211; they ARE high quality uniform flight suits, after all. Alas, I do not remember the backstory of its previous owner.</p>

		<p>I forgot to add &#8211; my coworker, who was initially confused (NASA? Astronaut? Our company, huh?) then remembered it was me and explained it. They happened to ask a coworker who knew me well. If they caught someone else, hilarity would ensue.</p>

		<p>My most questionably effective costume: in the mid 1990s, I showed up for work dressed as a waiter carrying a platter of manila folders. I walked around the lunchtime party saying, “Files? Can I interest you in some files? Would you like to try some files?”</p>
<p>The questionable part: the accountant figured it out before any of my fellow network admins did.</p>

		<p>A girl of about twelve showed up at our door last night dressed as a nerd&#8211;checked shirt, black-rimmed glasses taped at the bridge of the nose. I said, &quot;Ah, an engineer!&quot;, but she said &quot;No, a nerd.&quot; She didn&#39;t have a pocket protector&#8211;if I still had one, I&#39;d have given it to her along with the candy.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
