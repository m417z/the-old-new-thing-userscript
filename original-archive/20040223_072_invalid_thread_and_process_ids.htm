<p>Perhaps you want a value to use as a sentinel, which you  want to be guaranteed is never a valid thread ID or process ID.  What values can you use?</p>
<p>  Nothing is explicitly written about this topic, but you can  put on your logic cap and figure it out.  </p>
<p>  If you need an invalid thread ID, you can use zero.  How do you know that zero is an invalid thread ID?  It's implied by   <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/hooks/hookreference/hookfunctions/setwindowshookex.asp">SetWindowsHookEx</a>:  Notice that if you pass zero, then the hook is installed into  all threads on the current desktop.  This implies that zero is not itself a valid thread ID.  </p>
<p>  This sentinel value is confirmed by  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dllproc/base/getthreadid.asp">GetThreadID</a>, which uses zero as its error return value.  </p>
<p>  Similarly, if you need an invalid process ID, you can use (DWORD)-1.  This comes from  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/Windows/WindowReference/WindowFunctions/AllowSetForegroundWindow.asp">AllowSetForegroundWindow</a>:  The value ASFW_ANY has special meaning,  which implies that it is never a valid process ID.  </p>
<p>  Or, you can use zero as your invalid process ID,  since that is the error value returned by  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dllproc/base/getprocessid.asp">GetProcessId</a> and  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dllproc/base/getprocessidofthread.asp">GetProcessIdOfThread</a>.</p>

		<p>Raymond,<br />
<br />Please talk (blog) about threading affinity for user code. I asked about that before. Perhaps you forgot. It&#8217;s important to .NET world as well because for example one would not be allowed to DestroyWindows in finalizers.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your blog.</p>

		<p>This isn&#8217;t a democracy. I write about what I want to write about. If it happens to coincide with what you want to read, that&#8217;s just a nice side-effect. Besides a lot of my topics are just memory-joggers. For example two entries are &quot;fibers&quot; and &quot;scrollbar gutter&quot;.</p>

		<p>am I the only one missing the history blogs?</p>
<p>I remember once an irresistable look into MS&#8217;s history.  Lately, the &quot;history&quot; section seems more similar to the &quot;code&quot; section.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to be a whiner, but I really enjoyed the more accessible MS trivia that seems less common lately.</p>

<p>Raymond, I look forward to your discussion of NT fibers. Most books say fibers were only introduced (by Dave Cutler?) for porting Unix code that relied on user-level threads, but I think user-level threads could have performance advantages for any Windows app. How do fibers make porting Unix code easier than using regular NT kernel threads? How does one debug fibers from MSDEV?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been working on the discussion of fibers for over a week. It&#8217;s a very simple idea but if I just said what it was, people would say, &quot;I still don&#8217;t understand&quot;, so I have to go into a lot more detail. It&#8217;ll probably take up over a week of blog entries just to go into the detail people will want.</p>

		<p>Chris Brumme writes a lot about how Microsoft SQL Server uses fibers in his post about hosting the CLR (<a target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cbrumme/archive/2004/02/21/77595.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/cbrumme/archive/2004/02/21/77595.aspx</a>). His post is <em>not</em> directly about fibers, but there is a lot of information about it due to the discussion about MS SQL Server.</p>
<p>But maybe the most important part in the article, with regards to fibers, is his first paragraph in this comment: <a target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cbrumme/archive/2004/02/21/77595.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/cbrumme/archive/2004/02/21/77595.aspx</a>#78365. ;)</p>
<p>But a more direct discussion about fibers would be great to read :)</p>

		<p>keithmo: It&#8217;s certainly documented in &#8216;Inside Windows 2000&#8217;, but it&#8217;s probably not something you should rely on. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s documented anywhere on MSDN.</p>
<p>Basically, anything you find in an &quot;Inside&quot; book should be considered changeable, IMO. It might help you in debugging, but you should pretend there&#8217;s a Chinese Wall.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
