<p>When I discussed some time ago <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/02/10/370445.aspx"> why minimized windows have an apparent size of 160x31</a>, I explained that the minimized icon is a miniature title bar, but I managed not to explain why the values are exactly 160 and 31.</p>
<p> The width of the miniature title bar is determined by the <code>iWidth</code> member of <code>MINIMIZEDMETRICS</code> structure. You can retrieve and change this structure with the help of the <code>SystemParametersInfo</code> function. (Use the <code>SPI_GETMINIMIZEDMETRICS</code> and <code>SPI_SETMINIMIZEDMETRICS</code> flags, respectively.) Some people will mention the <code>MinWidth</code> registry value, but those people are wrong. Notice, for example, that messing with <code>MinWidth</code> requires a logoff cycle, whereas using <code>SPI_SETMINIMIZEDMETRICS</code> takes effect immediately. That's because <code>SPI_SETMINIMIZEDMETRICS</code> updates the internal state variables, whereas whacking the registry just change a value in a database that nobody pays attention to once you've logged on. </p>
<p> What about the height? That's just the height of a caption bar, which you can adjust from the Appearance tab of the Display control panel. (Programmatically, you can use that helpful <code>SystemParametersInfo</code> function, this time using the <code>iCaptionHeight</code> member of the <code>NONCLIENTMETRICS</code> structure.) </p>

		<p>Graphic designers!?<br />
<br />Since when did graphic designers work on Windows??<br />
<br /> I thought the monstrosity called &quot;Luna&quot; was definitive proof that no graphic designer had any input whatsoever&#8230;</p>

		<p>Granted, setting the MinWidth registry value directly may be &quot;wrong&quot;, but it is a documented &quot;wrong&quot;. Also, it&#8217;s the only way to do it non-programmatically &#8212; not everybody knows how to write a program that calls an API function, after all. Plus, the iWidth member of MINIMIZEDMETRICS is expressed in pixels; MinWidth is expressed in [negative] twips, which are not only device-independent but are also an order of magnitude more precise.</p>
<p>I mentioned in the earlier thread that the width of a minimized window is determined not just by the minimized-window width value (i.e., iWidth) but also by the window border width. At 96 DPI, the default minimized-window width value is equivalent to only 154 pixels, not 160. The extra six pixels are accounted for by the left and right window borders.</p>
<p>Similarly, the default minimized-window height of 31 pixels is arrived at by adding iCaptionHeight to the top and bottom window borders.</p>

		<p>I would like to know what the significance of the number &quot;1033&quot; is. For years (decades, even?), folders with this name show up in many MSFT apps, including Office and Visual Studio. I&#8217;ve asked various high-ranking MSFT people, and to a one they shake their head. But it must be formalized somewhere, because it keeps showing up. Inside joke?</p>

		<p>I believe 1033 is the decimal representation of 0x0409, which is the LCID for &quot;English (United States)&quot;. </p>
<p>There are other common LCIDs as well that you can see around, and I think MSDN might actually have a list of them somewhere.</p>

		<p>The [b]actual[/b] window is given magical, negative constants to place it off-screen when minimized.</p>
<p>CreateWindow* does not check the X and Y values on the creation of a window, meaning that a lack of input validation [i]will[/i] place the window off-screen.<br /></p>

		<p>Before you start thinking that there *should* be input validation on window coordinates, Raymond II, consider that virtual window managers rely on being able to have windows off-screen when not visible. Also it would be tricky to figure out when a window would be off-screen on configurations with multiple monitors that are of different sizes.</p>

		<p>Gabe, look up Multiple Display Monitors on how to get the monitor associated with a virtual-screen coordinate, and have the window fall back to the primary display monitor in case it&#8217;s outside of any monitor, ensuring that the window shows up somewhere it can be seen rather than nowhere.<br /></p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
