And the phenomenon isn't just restricted to na&iuml;ve users.
Even programmers ignore error messages.
All they see is "Blah blah blah an error occurred."
</p>
<p>
For example, there's this message that appeared
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/03/04/8014283.aspx">
on a peer-to-peer discussion group</a>:

I tried to submit an update to our database and I got this error.
What does it mean?
Is the error on the client or the server?
</p>
<pre>
Opening transaction 34508.
Locking record 14 for update.
Updating record 14 in table BLUECHEESE.
Operation failed.
write: The file or directory is corrupted and unreadable.
</pre>
<p>
When I try to view the record to see whether my update made it,
I get this error:
</p>
<pre>
The database may be corrupt; it requires administrator attention.
To protect the database, it has been taken offline.
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
I'm no expert here, but it looks like a write operation failed
because the file or directory is corrupted and unreadable.
Since you're updating a record on the server, it's probably a
corruption problem on the server.
(After all, there's no change taking place on the client.
The client is just asking the server to do the work.)
</p>
<p>
And the second error message seems to suggest that the database
may be corrupt and requires administrator attention.
As a precautionary measure, the database took itself offline
so the corruption can't spread.
I'm pretty sure that's a server-side thing, since the database
is on the server.</p>

		<p>Even worse is when non-tech-savvy users don&#8217;t remember error messages and then ask for help. I got a call from my uncle once asking for help because his friend&#8217;s laptop wouldn&#8217;t boot up. Supposedly it was getting an &quot;out of memory on line 67&quot; error. And he was surprised when that wasn&#8217;t enough information for me to tell him how to fix it.</p>

		<p>Well, no wonder the database is corrupt &#8211; cheese doesn&#8217;t last forever, y&#8217;know.</p>
<p>Error messages are read only by people that understand them. &nbsp;It sounds like this particular programmer wasn&#8217;t a database administrator. &nbsp;The error text should probably s/it requires administrator attention/please contact the database administrator for the FROMAGERIE database on the HAUTE-CUISINE server/</p>

		<p>it is also possible they read the error message, but just didn&#8217;t believe. &nbsp;this after long experience of getting bogus errors back from services &#8211; perhaps the most common reason for a &quot;OMG!!

		<p>In the old times of CRT monitors I saw two (then relatively young) programmers who didn&#8217;t even try to read error messages of the compiler in their IDE environment since they preferred setting the screen resolution of Windows higher than being able to read the messages. &quot;Aha, I wrote something wrong, whatever&quot; followed by a set of random modifications to avoid errors from appearing.</p>

		<p>Errors about corruption are kind of annoying, in that there&#8217;s always the slight possibility that the &quot;corruption&quot; is really a broken assumption by a programmer, where they might check for a condition and set an error code on the assumption that the hardware made a mistake. &nbsp;When there is a legitimate software bug behind it, often nobody wants to look into these issues because the error code gives it a red flag. &nbsp;&quot;Check your disk, check your memory, leave me alone, this isn&#8217;t my problem.&quot;</p>

		<p>In my experience, naive users read error messages far more often and far more completely than experienced users.</p>
<p>I think more time with computers makes you trust error messages (especially generic ones) less and less.</p>

		<p>I tend to not trust error messages related to &quot;Out of Memory&quot; or &quot;File corrupted&quot; as many times these are catch-all error messages that could be anything from a null reference to an interface that got a 0 where it wanted a 1.</p>

		<p>Yes, I just failed to read through the error message this Wednesday.</p>
<p>When I wrote a JSP page, I tried to feed &quot;new Date()&quot; into Calendar.setTime(). The error message set it can&#8217;t find a constructer for java.sql.Date without parameter.</p>
<p>I just don&#8217;t read the java.sql.Date part and try searching Java documentation for whether java.util.Date() without parameter is newly introduced or marked as depreciated. (I&#8217;m new to Java, so please don&#8217;t laugh&#8230; :P)</p>

		<p>Even if you perfectly comprehend a message, you can always ask what it means in a larger context. &nbsp;Someone may know &quot;yes, that means the backup software set the permissions wrong on the file, don&#8217;t worry it happens all the time&quot;.</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#8217;t love you anymore.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;What does that mean?&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;It means I am breaking up with you.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;What does that mean?&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;It means I am moving out.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;Does that mean I get the TV?&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

		<p>I have seen a similar phenomenon in online rpg games. Players pick up quests and only read the objective, not the rest of the quest. When they can&#8217;t find the things they need to kill or whatever random gizmo they need to collect, they ask in the in game chat channels. But the main quest text tells you exactly where to find them, they just didn&#8217;t bother to read past Spiders Slain: 0/6</p>
<p>I like to amuse myself by pasting the same info from the quest log into the chat channel, you would be surprised how often that works.</p>

		<p>Chris Lineker:</p>
<p>What you are describing is definately a user interface issue. Clearly if people do not read required mission texts in online games, then reading them should either not be required (hello HUD arrow), or the text should be continualy and trivialy retrievable at least until the mission is completed (and maybe even longer than that.)</p>

		<p>Joseph Koss:</p>
<p>I assure you in the game in question it is trivial to retrieve the text until the quest is complete. There are even HUD addons players can install to provide a nice large arrow and huge text telling them what to do next at all times. Some players just can&#8217;t read/follow simple instructions it seems.</p>
<p>Also agreed that database corrupt errors are rarely actual database corruption.</p>

		<p>Error messages are often wrong or incomprehensible or both, so it&#8217;s no surprise that many people ignore them.</p>
<p>Would it seem implausible that the answer to this story might be: &quot;Yeah, it says that sometimes when the load throttler is running in full-duplex no-parity mode. If you enable reverse page caching, it should go away.&quot;</p>

		<p>Recent problem on server: attempts to read from network drives/UNC paths fail with &quot;Not enough server storage to complete this operation&quot;.</p>
<p>Actual problem appears to be that we now have enough file system filter drivers active that a network IRP doesn&#8217;t have enough stack slots.</p>
<p>&#8216;Storage&#8217;, yes, but the error message makes you think of disk space, and we&#8217;ve got plenty of that.</p>

		<p>I recently had an error from my svn client (version control software) which basically stated that it was unable to create a temporary file in &quot;c:WINDOWSTemp&quot;. Having carefully read the message, I proceeded by checking my local disk space, folder permissions etc.</p>
<p>It turned out to be an error message from the *server*. This fact was not clear at all until other people started complaining about the same problem. </p>
<p>Lesson: prefix server error messages with something like &quot;server error: &quot; if you show them in client software.</p>

		<p>The famous misleading error message was the &#8216;Out of Memory&#8217; message you got with Windows 3 and 9*. It referred to system resources and had nothing to do with memory, but must have caused a fair outlay on useless hardware.</p>
<p>A friend of mine lost a couple of hundred pounds through reading error messages. He got the message &#8216;The program has performed an illegal operation and will now shut down&#8217;, presumed that Microsoft had developed a clever way of finding out the software he was using on his computer were a load of pirate disks from Saudi, and went out and bought &#8216;legal&#8217; versions of the lot.</p>

		<p>@KenW: &nbsp;Raymond said &quot;Even programmers ignore error messages. All they see is &quot;Blah blah blah an error occurred.&quot; &quot;</p>
<p>The antecedent of &quot;they&quot; in &quot;all they see&quot; is &quot;programmers&quot;. &nbsp;I took that to mean &quot;programmers&quot; instead of &quot;some programmers&quot;. &nbsp;Maybe I was wrong there. &nbsp;I am a programmer and it&#8217;s not true that &quot;all I see&quot; is &quot;blah blah blah an error occured&quot;. &nbsp;So, I disagreed.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
