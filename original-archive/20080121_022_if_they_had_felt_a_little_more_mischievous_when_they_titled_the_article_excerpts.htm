		<p>True enough&#8230; fxe6 is invalid for English. Could be French and Raymond typo&#8217;d the case (F &#8211; fou &#8211; bishop), but we have Be2 earlier that line.</p>
<p>I think, anyhow. Never was able to get the hang of chess.</p>
<p>Though, half that notation looks like x86 assembly&#8230;</p>

		<p>The implication that fxe6 on that line is illegal is because the previous move is Nxe6 and most people would normally notate that fxN.</p>
<p>However, it is still valid notation to write fxe6 and would be required if there is ambiguity over which knight is being captured.</p>

		<p>fxN is rare. &nbsp;fxe6 is a little pedantic&#8230; the &quot;more usual&quot; (if the Informant can be taken as a guide of what is &quot;usual&quot;) would be the terse fe.</p>
<p>Worf&#8217;s point is a fair one, which is that the initialisms for the piece names are subject to localization issues&#8230; (e.g., in German, &quot;Knight&quot; is &quot;Springer&quot;).</p>
<p>So the last excerpted move would be more usually written as:</p>
<ol>
<li>â™˜xe6 fe</li>
</ol>
<p>Just in case, the character before the x is U+2658 (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2658/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/2658/index.htm</a>)</p>

		<p>Maurits: but then you obscure (slightly) that there was a capture.</p>

		<p>fe could also be ambiguous, in the case where there were two (or more) pawns on the f file.</p>
<p>Anyway, fxe6 is correct per <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.fide.com/official/handbook.asp?level=EE102" rel="nofollow">http://www.fide.com/official/handbook.asp?level=EE102</a> (section E9).</p>

		<p>Indeed. Raymond&#8217;s notation seems to match the form of algebraic notation that I usually see.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  fe could also be ambiguous
</p></blockquote>
<p>Very true&#8230; as I remember, though, in that particular game the capture was unambiguous.</p>
<p>fxe6 is the more &quot;formal&quot; notation&#8230; fe is comparatively new notation.</p>
<p>The late Bobby Fischer used Descriptive Notation (ugh) when recording his early games (I&#8217;ve seen a scanned image of his scorecard for the Game of the Century vs. Byrne) but I wouldn&#8217;t advocate that system to new chess players. :-)</p>

		<p>fxe6 is standard short algebraic notation. You could also right f5xe6 but it would hardly be necessary.</p>
<p>The rule is that you use the initial for all the pieces (and put the square afterwards if there is the possibility of ambiguity) but for pawns you just use the name of the square.</p>
<p>Descriptive notation was common in the UK until the seventies at least. I used to use German algebraic notation but one of the reasons was to confuse people trying to read it!</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
