<p>Every summer, the city of Redmond stages <a href="http://www.redmond.gov/recreationarts/derbydays/"> Derby Days</a>, an annual celebration of... I'm not sure what. But what it does mean is that roads will be closed in the downtown Redmond area, so if you need to get around, you'll have to plan ahead.</p>
<p> Several years ago, one of my colleagues asked a City of Redmond employee, "What <i>is</i> Derby Days?" He received this very perceptive reply: "Derby Days is a very important cultural event... for the people who organize it." </p>
<p> My friend <a href="http://wendyhome.com/"> ::&nbsp;Wendy&nbsp;::</a> remarks on the apparent <a href="http://wendyhome.com/2006/07/09/cargo-pants-parade/"> dress code</a> which accompanies the parade that honors... I'm not sure what. Not even the people participating in the parade were able to tell her what Derby Days actually was. </p>

<p>History</p>
<p>Redmond Derby Days, which is celebrating its 67th anniversary in 2007, is a summer tradition that came to life at the end of the Depression. &nbsp;It began as a drive to raise money for downtown holiday decorations and school athletic equipment. &nbsp;The Redmond Bicycle Derby was the outgrowth of a small town&#8217;s community spirit and is now the nation&#8217;s longest running bicycle race. &nbsp;As always, this year&#8217;s event will include activities for young and old. &nbsp;Mark your calendar and join the fun.</p>

<p>Redmond Derby Days is an annual community festival held every July. It began as a race around Lake Sammamish called the Redmond Bicycle Derby in 1939, and since then has become a multi-day event including a bicycle criterium, parade, carnival, and entertainment stage.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s an annual party. &nbsp;It doesn&#8217;t commemorate anything. &nbsp;Kennewick, WA has an annual hydroplane race. &nbsp;It doesn&#8217;t commemorate anything either.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s to celebrate you. &nbsp;Every year at the end they are very sad because you never come.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
