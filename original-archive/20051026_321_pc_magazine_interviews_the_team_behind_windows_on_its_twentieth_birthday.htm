<p> <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1868435,00.asp"> PC Magazine interviewed "the team behind Windows" in commemoration of Windows' twentieth birthday</a>. The article's author talked with Bill Gates, Charles Simonyi, Jeff Raikes, Ray Ozzie (huh? He didn't even work at Microsoft until April 2005! How could he have been part of "the team behind Windows"?), Jim Allchin, Brad Silverberg, David Cole, Yusuf Mehdi, Joe Belfiore, and Chris Jones. Ten managers. Apparently "the team behind Windows" doesn't include programmers or testers. </p>
<p> For some reason, the media often identify Hillel Cooperman (a Product Unit Manager) <a href="http://news.zdnet.com/2100-3513_22-5098860.html"> as a programmer</a>, and whenever this happens, we always make a point to assign him a nasty bug to fix. </p>

		<p>What did you expect given your corporate policy of never giving programmers any credit anywhere? One won&#8217;t find your name in any about box anywhere. The end result of this policy is that the only people visible to outside world are managers that talk to journalists, analysts etc.<br />
<br />Isn&#8217;t it funny that a makeup artist in a second rate movie gets more recognition than programmers who wrote, say, Word.</p>

		<p>Nice to see that the 20th anniversary of Windows is getting some attention.  Unlike the 10th anniversary of Windows 95, which (aside from this blog and a few other places) pretty much went unnoticed.</p>

		<p>Didn&#8217;t anybody tell you?  Programmers aren&#8217;t worth the spit thrown upon them!</p>
<p>Just kidding, but I love the idea of sending Hillel code to fix after he&#8217;s been credited as a programmer.  This joke would be even funnier if he had claimed he was a coder.</p>

		<p>&quot;One won&#8217;t find your name in any about box anywhere.&quot;<br />
<br />Take a look at the About &#8211; Credits in Acrobat 7.<br />
<br />More than 700 names listed (and is right there, visible, not hidden in some Easter egg).<br /></p>

<br />Well, this reminds me of one of my favorite books. There somebody commented that if earthlings didn&#8217;t want to see their planet destroyed, they should have looked more carefully at the demolition plans, which were on display at the local planning department in the nearby solar system of Alpha Centauri&#8230;</p>

		<p>Mihai, that&#8217;d be a valid point if Microsoft made Acrobat, but they don&#8217;t.</p>
<p>alex, if the credits are embedded in an easter egg, they hardly count as credits.  As I understand it, the easter eggs which have made it into final products weren&#8217;t exactly corporate-approved.</p>

		<p>Hey, at least Microsoft *has* program/product/project managers.  I used to work as a developer for a software company that has about 2000 employees.  We had no managers, just develeopers&#8230; made things quite difficult.</p>

		<p>In the game industry, full credit is given to programmers.  I&#8217;m credited with working on Jade Empire even though I spent a week looking at database issues with the internal toolset and a weekend cutting the compile time of the toolset in half.</p>

		<p>&quot;What did you expect given your corporate policy of never giving programmers any credit anywhere?&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the official policy at Microsoft ?<br />
<br />I always assumed it was because the *programmers* didn&#8217;t want their names in the credits out of shame. I sure as hell wouldn&#8217;t put &quot;I worked on windows ME&quot; in my resume. </p>

		<p>I sure as hell would be proud of *working* on Windows Me. What I wouldn&#8217;t be proud of is being the executive who decided to produce it in the first place.<br />
<br />BTW does anybody seriously read the crap PC Magazine prints about software? They are somewhat useful for hardware reviews but the software articles are either written by very ignorant people or by people very well paid by certain vendors.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure nobody will be assigning me any bugs any time soon. I have a relatively limited toolset to apply to any problem sent my way (won&#8217;t fix, by design, non-repro, etc.). :)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
