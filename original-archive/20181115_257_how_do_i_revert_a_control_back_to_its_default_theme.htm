<p>
A customer disabled visual styles for their control so that they
could do custom rendering,
but when the system switches to high contrast mode,
they want to abandon their customizations and revert to the system
styles.
</p>
<pre>
// Disable visual styles for this control so we can
// draw it our own way.
SetWindowTheme(hwndControl, L"", L"");
</pre>
<p>
But how do they undo the effect of that call and tell the
system,
"Um, hey, I know I told you that I didn't want the
system to draw any visual styles,
but I changed my mind.
Can you draw visual styles for me after all?"
</p>
<p>
You can return to the default behavior by passing
<code>NULL</code> for the last two parameters.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
When <i>pszSubAppName</i>
and <i>pszSubIdList</i>
are
<b>NULL</b>,
the theme manager removes the previously applied associations. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<pre>
// Return to default visual styles for this control.
SetWindowTheme(hwndControl, NULL, NULL);
</pre>

		<p>I have to give props to the customer for considering accessibility that said I&#8217;m surprised they didn&#8217;t ask for some way to read the theme and then do it themselves.</p>

		<p>Thumbs up to them for thinking about this case at all.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m actually a bit surprised here.  My normal expectation has been to pass null to unset things, but a decent number of APIs (not just MS&#8217;) like to throw up exceptions when you pass a null, even here&#8230;.they insist on some special enumeration or even an entirely separate API just for unsets.  Something about reusing null and/or treating it like magic.  But I just like the intuitiveness of doing it, since it&#8217;s a pretty universal pattern until you start dealing with value types</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
