One customer wanted a way to determine the name of the
computer manufacturer.
For example, they wanted to make some function call and
get back "IBM" or "Compaq" or "Dell".
I don't know why they wanted this information,
and for the moment, I don't care.
</p>
<p>
And of course, when you're looking for information,
you don't search MSDN; that's for crazy people.
No, let's just fire up regedit and hit Ctrl+F.
(I can't imagine how many application compatibility bugs
were created by that "helpful" Ctrl+F dialog in regedit.)
</p>
<p>
The customer found the registry keys that are used
to customize the System control panel,
as well as
<a HREF="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;314472">
the OEMINFO.INI file that also takes part</a>.
But then the question of reliability arose.
After all, since it's just a registry key and an INI file,
the user could just edit it and make it say anything they want.
If the customer wiped their hard drive and reinstalled Windows
from scratch, then this information would be lost, too.
This customer wanted some degree of assurance that if
the computer claimed to be a Dell, then it really was a Dell.
</p>
<p>
Enter WMI.
<a HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/scriptcenter/sgwho.mspx">
The Scripting Guys</a> are all over WMI.
If you search for the phrase "from Win32_ComputerSystem"
you will find hit after hit from the <i>Hey, Scripting Guy!</i>
column.
</p>
<p>
And it so happens that WMI exposes the computer manufacturer info
as well.
If you look at the scripts that the Scripting Guys put out,
probably two thirds of them fall into this pattern:
</p>
<pre>
strComputer = "."
Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:\\" &amp; strComputer &amp; "\root\cimv2")
Set colItems = objWMIService.ExecQuery("Select * from <font COLOR=blue>something</font>")
For Each objItem in colItems
     Wscript.Echo objItem.<font COLOR=blue>something</font>
Next
</pre>
<p>
All we have to do is fill in the "something".
</p>
<pre>
strComputer = "."
Set objWMIService = GetObject("winmgmts:\\" &amp; strComputer &amp; "\root\cimv2")
Set colItems = objWMIService.ExecQuery("Select * from <font COLOR=blue>Win32_ComputerSystem</font>")
For Each objItem in colItems
     Wscript.Echo <font COLOR=blue>"System Name: " &amp; objItem.Name</font>
     Wscript.Echo <font COLOR=blue>"Manufacturer: " &amp; objItem.Manufacturer</font>
     Wscript.Echo <font COLOR=blue>"Model: " &amp; objItem.Model</font>
     Wscript.Echo
Next
</pre>
<p>
Okay, so great, we can use WMI to get this information.
But how reliable is it?
</p>
<p>
Well, the WMI folks tell me that they get the information by
querying the
<a HREF="http://www.dmtf.org/standards/smbios/">SMBIOS</a>
directly, so it's as reliable as your BIOS.
Major manufacturers will put their names into the BIOS&sup1;,
but if you're running on a home-built machine, the values
are whatever came with your motherboard.
The BIOS manufacturers typically put placeholder strings into
their SMBIOS, setting the manufacturer to a generic string like
"Manufacturer", for example.
When the motherboard manufacturer installs the BIOS,
they're supposed to replace the placeholder strings with
something more meaningful, but most of them don't bother.
The result is that a machine you put together from parts
you bought at the local computer shop will most likely
just say "Manufacturer" for the manufacturer.
</p>
<p>
In summary, if you query WMI for the computer manufacturer
and it comes back "Dell", then you can be pretty sure you have a Dell.
(Either that or somebody with way too much time on their hands
burned a custom BIOS that says "Dell".)
On the other hand, if it comes back as "Manufacturer" then you're
still in the dark.
All you know is you've got some sort of generic computer.
</p>
<p>
&sup1;Even though major manufacturers will put their name
into the BIOS,
I'm told that if you send your computer back to the manufacturer
and they replace the motherboard,
they will sometimes forget to burn their name into the BIOS of
the replacement motherboard.
As a result, even on a name-brand computer,
you might see "Manufacturer".</p>

		<p>You didn&#8217;t care why the customer wanted that information ? I would think you would care, based on the large number of posts/regular feature you have about customers asking the wrong question/asking how to do something when that&#8217;s not really what they want to do. You then go about telling them how to correctly do whatever it is they want to do.</p>

<p>From what I can tell you can get the SMBIOS info using GetSystemFirmwareTable:</p>

		<p>I would be surprised to find out a major manufacturer forgot to burn their bios; after all isn&#8217;t SLP dependent on info in the bios? If a major manufacturer did slip wouldn&#8217;t windows bitch about not being activated?</p>

		<p>GetSystemFirmwareTable doesn&#8217;t exist on 32-bit XP or 2000. &nbsp;I already know about WMI, but working with WMI in general (and particularly in C) is a bit of a pain. &nbsp;I was hoping for something closer to GetSystemInfo, but as far as I can tell nothing like that exists going back to 2000.</p>

		<p>I think Eric S. Raymond needs to write a new essay about writing *smart* replies to blogs. &nbsp;People, FORGET about the fact that this originated from a customer question. &nbsp;Stay focused!</p>
<p>How do you get the name of the computer manufacturer? &nbsp;Raymond shows one way but points out the pitfalls. &nbsp;Period. &nbsp;End of story. &nbsp;Move on. &nbsp;Why are you people making this more complicated?</p>

<p>Do you have any idea /why/? Or what they were planning on /doing/ with that information?&quot;</p>
<p>Why boggle? Perhaps the customer was writing some sort of utility application that displays system information. Or maybe it was an asset management app that crawls a network and reports back on the PCs it finds. There are legitimate uses for the information.</p>

		<p>On my computer it says ‘System Manufacturer’. Since I bought it off the shelf, and the particular model was quite popular at the time I bought it, due to a very attractive price/performance ratio, I&#8217;d say the reliability of this field ism&#8217;t that great.</p>
<p>Also, if you look at the chart, it looks like approximately a quarter of times it says ‘Unknown’. By the way, that chart is one of the worst charts I&#8217;ve seen in quite a while. Not just aren&#8217;t they using a pie chart for fractions of a whole, but the bars don&#8217;t start at zero and it&#8217;s hard to extract numbers from it.</p>

		<p>&quot;To Be Filled By O.E.M.&quot; is the default for most SMBIOS strings in an AMI BIOS.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a Motherboard Manufacturer (or in my case embedded Single Board Computer), the SMBIOS data can be a pain. &nbsp;It contains a lot of fields like &quot;Case Mfr&quot; and &quot;Power Supply Mfr&quot;. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t know what values to put in those fields when I make the BIOS. &nbsp;So, I&#8217;m forced to fill in generic terms like &quot;Manufacturer&quot;.</p>
<p>There usually aren&#8217;t many options to tweak the SMBIOS data after it has been loaded onto the Motherboard. &nbsp;There are a few Mobo Mfrs that provide tools to modify the SMBIOS data (Intel does), but most do not. &nbsp;So, most white-box System Mfrs can&#8217;t do anything to fix it.</p>
<p>SMBIOS data becomes significantly less useful when you don&#8217;t make the entire box.</p>

		<p>Interesting. &nbsp;My system has a possibility you didn&#8217;t mention:</p>
<p>System Name: MINERVA</p>
<p>Manufacturer: P4M80P</p>
<p>Model: AWRDACPI</p>
<p>P4M80P is the <em>model</em> name of my computer&#8217;s motherboard, which was manufactured by Gigabyte. &nbsp;The computer manufacturer is &#8216;eSys&#8217;. &nbsp;AWRDACPI appears to be the BIOS producer. &nbsp;Why these two strings are useful but essentially the wrong way around mystifies me somewhat. :)</p>

<p>Not me. 1) they&#8217;re a well-known brand name who produce computers for very reasonable prices; 2) their computers are actually reasonably good quality. &nbsp;Specifically, in the 90s, they were among the first manufacturers to start using screwless cases, which make any upgrades/maintenance you need to perform <em>much</em> quicker. &nbsp;I still remember my old Optiplex desktop fondly: press the two buttons at the back, slide the top forwards. &nbsp;Pull up the lever that holds the PCI bus daughterboard down and lift it out. &nbsp;Adding cards is now trivial, as is putting everything back together. &nbsp;I wish the computers I&#8217;ve had since were so easy to work on&#8230;</p>

		<p>I always wondered why the case manufacturer information would be useful, and why anyone would burn that info into the CMOS/BIOS. &nbsp;If you change the case, the CMOS information is no longer correct! &nbsp;The BIOS burned into CMOS can&#8217;t tell who manufactured the case&#8230;</p>
<p>And yes, looking at a computer can tell you some stuff, but as mentioned above, when you want to compile a list of information about the 10,000 computers in your company, you don&#8217;t want to physically look at all of them one at a time.</p>

<p>Right.</p>
<p>However, I think that, when managing 10000 computers, guys rarely change the computers cases.</p>

<p>Well it depends &#8212; if you can get away with it and earn more money doing that than programming the interface then I&#8217;d go around with a paper and pencil glazing at the cases while trying to look as if I am doing some really important work. ;-)</p>

		<p>I think it&#8217;s another DRM &#8211; like scheme emerging, like &#8211; &quot;your computer doesn&#8217;t belong to you, it belongs to your manufacturer. You&#8217;re only using it.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m kidding, but just wait&#8230;</p>

<p>Hmm, according to the stickers on my case my Dell was jointly manufactured by &#8216;Intel Inside&#8217; and &#8216;Microsoft Windows XP&#8217;</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re talking to someone who actually <em>needs</em> instructions on how to determine their computer&#8217;s manufacturer asking them to &quot;look at the sticker on the front of their PC&quot; is likely to give amusing but unhelpful results. :)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
