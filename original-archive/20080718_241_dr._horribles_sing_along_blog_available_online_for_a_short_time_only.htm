		<p>You got inspired from Larry or you are the one who pointed this to him?</p>
<p>I know it might be totally unrelated, but two bloggers whom I follow on a daily basis writes on the same topic same day, and history says they are friends, makes we wonder.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s like watching a train wreck. &nbsp;You can&#8217;t stop looking.</p>
<p>Ok, a very funny train wreck &#8211; with clowns, I guess.</p>
<p>Clowns and monkeys. &nbsp;And they are getting squished by the caboose.</p>
<p>And instead of blood, lots of paper graffiti.</p>
<p>No midgets, though. &nbsp;Midgets would not be funny.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s awesome, only too bad that they do not want Money from European people (Only on the US and Canada iTunes store) :-( Well, maybe when the DVD comes out the producers change their mind. I mean &#8211; there are actually people willing to pay for something that is free just because it&#8217;s good, and then they don&#8217;t let us.</p>
<p>Anyway, I really enjoyed it and I&#8217;m looking forward to Part III :-)</p>

		<p>No, he&#8217;s not an Evil Overlord. &nbsp;He&#8217;s just a random Evil Genius who&#8217;s TRYING to become an overlord. &nbsp;Obviously, the first (major) step is to get into the Evil League of Evil. &nbsp;And you just can&#8217;t do that without a Doomsday weapon (Even if it doesn&#8217;t even cause any damage, it just has to exist).</p>

		<p>Hmm, definitely Ray &amp; me don&#8217;t share the same taste. It&#8217;s crap all day long and did not even made me smile. Sorry Ray, this time you blew it (like Vista, but that&#8217;s another food of fish who&#8217;s prepared with a different sausage of snake).</p>

		<p>Yeah, how can you not love this short movie? &nbsp;Neil Patrick Harris is handsome&#8211;and a hoot. Who knew he could sing? &nbsp;And the whole thing of making fun of blogs and bloggers&#8211;how great is that?</p>
<p>Has anyone mentioned it seems a perfect metaphor for our dolt President?? &nbsp; &nbsp;Think about it&#8211;likeable, not very bright but ambitious guy has big plans, they come to be and wreck things, in the end. &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#8217;s perfect. &nbsp;It&#8217;s W all over, guys.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fantastic and it has great laughs and singing, too.</p>

		<p>I think I have a new found respect for NPH. &nbsp;Didn&#8217;t much care for him as Doogie, but this was actually quite funny. &nbsp;The guy does in fact have some comic timing to him (or just a damned good director). &nbsp;And Felecia Day is just hot all the way around. &nbsp;So I have a thing for pasty redheads. &nbsp;Someone has to. &nbsp;&lt;eg&gt;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
