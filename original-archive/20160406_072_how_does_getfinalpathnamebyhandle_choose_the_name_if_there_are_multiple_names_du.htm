		<p>The blog people tell me they are having database problems, so posts don&#8217;t always show up. And I&#8217;m in Hawaii right now, so I don&#8217;t wake up until several hours after scheduled posting time. You&#8217;ll just have to deal with it.</p>

		<p>Raymond could give an SLG for the blog, of course &#8211; and it&#8217;d be educational for people who see SLGs/SLAs/SLTs as more &#8220;important&#8221; than competent engineering[1].</p>
<p>How about &#8220;20% refund on all money Raymond has charged you to access his blog&#8221;? No? You&#8217;d prefer 50%? I&#8217;m sure Raymond would go for that, too.</p>
<p>[1] I&#8217;ve worked with one too many inexperienced managers who&#8217;d prefer the service with an SLA that keeps going down over the service backed by a competent team that doesn&#8217;t go down very often, on the basis that an SLA is a good thing.</p>

		<p>If the particular link has been removed (may require use of NT API or the new Windows Services for Ubuntu Linux layer), does it still return the filename that was used to open the file, or will it change and return a different-but-still-valid filename if one exists?</p>

		<p>Excellent question. Normally the answer turns out to be you can&#8217;t (because Win32 always takes a lock on the name); but if it&#8217;s on a Samba share you certainly can.</p>
<p>On a related note, I wonder how it would behave if the last name got removed.</p>

		<p>My psychic powers tell me this is an extreme edge case which nobody specifically bothered to handle, so we can answer the question by putting on our kernel-colored glasses.  By far the easiest way to implement GetFinalPathNameByHandle is to keep track of the file name you used to open this particular handle in the first place.  So I surmise that the kernel will simply return that value regardless of whether it&#8217;s still valid.</p>

		<p>I think the old name would still be returned to be consistant with Unix behavior. (In *nix, if file is deleted when in use by some process, the file will be invisible from outside but still &#8220;exist&#8221; in the view of process that using it. The nodes will only be freed after the last process holding handle to file closed it.)</p>

		<p>Presumably this also applies to the case of renames.</p>

		<p>I wonder what happens if you got the handle using OpenFileById?  (Probably you just get the first hardlink in whatever arbitrary order NTFS has them in.)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
