<p>Last Saturday, my friends and I were heading for a subway station in Brooklyn and found ourselves behind a man and a woman both dressed in Santa Claus outfits. They were kind enough to wave us onto the train with a "hurry, hurry!", and we made it on board just as the subway doors closed.</p>
<p> And then we discovered that we were on a subway train <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/gallery/0750,0750santacon,78558,3.html?pic=4&amp;total=23"> filled with people dressed as Santa Claus</a>, noisy but well-behaved. What parallel universe had we mistakenly stepped into? Was there some subway dress code announcement we had missed? </p>
<p> Nope. The announcement we missed was for the 2007 <a href="http://www.santacon.com/nyc/">New York City SantaCon</a>. (Here they are swarming <a href="http://www.villagevoice.com/gallery/0750,0750santacon,78558,3.html?pic=12&amp;total=23"> Grand Central Terminal</a>.) </p>
<p> <a href="http://santarchy.com/santacon-2007/"> Many cities are having their SantaCon tomorrow</a>, including <a href="http://seattlecacophony.blogspot.com/2007/12/santa-route.html"> Seattle</a>, so if you see roving bands of red-suited revelers, you'll at least know what's going on. </p>

		<p>OK, that was a little weird. I read the &quot;Santarchy&quot; and imagined a system of government run by Santa(s).</p>
<p>How much welfare you are entitled to is determined by how good you&#8217;ve been! Free mince pies for all! Cars are outlawed in favour of reindeer/horse/camel-drawn (as appropriate for your climate) vehicles!</p>

		<p>Uh-oh. That site has some possibly NSFW pictures. Seriously. You need to label the links as such so &nbsp;none of your readers accidentally get caught browsing a page featuring a photograph of some dude wearing nothing but a sock&#8230;</p>

		<p>Lol. In Calgary there is &quot;Santa Pub Crawl&quot; every year. Imagine walking into a large dance club and it being full of extremely drunk Santas!</p>

		<p>Malcolm McLaren, the guy that invented the Sex Pistols claims to have dressed up as Santa and walked around random stores at Christmas time taking toys off the shelves and handing them to kids. Sooner or later security would work out that he was not an official santa and try to arrest him and take the toys back from the kids, who then start to cry.</p>

		<p>Firstly, there shouldn&#8217;t by definition be a collective noun for a group of Santa Claus.</p>
<p>Secondly, what is the plural of Santa Claus? Sant Cli?</p>

		<p>My pick would either just be &quot;Santa Clauses&quot; or perhaps &quot;Santa Claudi&quot;. &nbsp;(Although knowing nothing of Latin, that&#8217;s probably the wrong usage. &nbsp;But it sounds good to me.)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
