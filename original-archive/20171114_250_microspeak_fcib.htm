<!-- CONTENT START -->
<p>
FCIB
(pronounced either by spelling it out <i>F-C-I-B</i>
or as a sort-of acronym <i>eff-sib</i>)
stands for "foreign checked-in binary".
It refers to content checked into a project
as binary output,
rather than as source code.
</p>
<p>
For example,
a photo management project may use
a facial recognition module provided by
a team in Microsoft Research.
There are few different ways this can play out.
</p>
<p>
One way is for the facial recognition team
to provide source code drops to the photo
management project.
The photo management project checks that
code into their project and compiles the
source code and incorporates it into their program.
</p>
<p>
Another way this could be done is for the
facial recognition team to compile their
own source code and send either object files
or complete DLLs to the photo management team.
The photo management project checks those
object files or DLLs into their program
("foreign checked-in binaries")
and links it into their program.
</p>
<p>
The term FCIB didn't originally mean "foreign checked-in binary".
According to legend,
a component was being added to a team's project
as a checked-in binary,
and the development manager in charge of the project
is reported to have exclaimed in frustration,
"Not another f&mdash;ing checked-in binary!"
</p>
<p>
Thus was born the acronym FCIB.
</p>
<p>
Initially, the term FCIB was used
internally within the project,
but eventually they had to explain this acronym
to others,
and that's where the sanitized version came in.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus history</b>:
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa940505(v=winembedded.5).aspx">
The Ancillary Function Driver is called AFD.SYS</a>,
but that name is also a sanitized version of its
original name.
When the networking team realized that they had to add
a kernel-mode driver to Windows,
the development manager is reported to 
have replied,
"What? Another f&mdash;ing driver?"</p>

		<p>Such censored backronyms remind me of the Android logging API, wherein one logs errors with Log.e(), warnings with Log.w(), etc. The highest level (for conditions that should never happen) is called &#8216;What a Terrible Failure&#8217;, but I doubt that&#8217;s the phrase on the programmer&#8217;s mind when they type Log.wtf().</p>

		<p>TheDailyWTF.com (which I&#8217;m sure many of you read) started with the original mean of &#8220;WTF&#8221;. But after a time, it changed to &#8220;Worse Than Failure&#8221;. In fact, many (most?) of the stories of that site are cases of terribly successful projects that barely reach release, and use to create more problems that they solve &#8211; its &#8220;success&#8221; being actually worse than a failure.</p>

		<p>Does this happen a lot at Microsoft? Are there any standardized rules regarding when to use external code and data? I can see executables based on a particular version of code, or code that crosses a Chinese Wall getting this treatment; is this what you were mostly talking about?</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s also code which uses exotic and unusual build processes which tend to result from research. Looking at our projects, I can completely anticipate other teams wanting a binary and an API rather than trying to figure out our build and then whatever they&#8217;d have do to make our build part of their build.</p>
<p>In the example above, the photos guys don&#8217;t really care how facial recognition works, and they&#8217;re sure not going to be modifying the hyperparameters or retraining, so the source doesn&#8217;t do them much good.</p>

		<p>I think there are &#8220;application grade&#8221; programs that comes with Windows and use MFC libraries (say, msinfo32.exe), these certainly qualifies as FCIB, right?</p>
<p>I wonder if other team need shell functions, are they added as FCIB or not.</p>

		<p>In that the Intel Indeo codec is shipped with Windows but, presumably (because you&#8217;ve kinda said so), Microsoft doesn&#8217;t compile the codec but merely includes it as a FCIB and then a Foreign Shipped Binary.</p>
<p>We all do this to a fair extent.  Imaging libraries are very common.  Any controls &amp; toolkits we developers buy from third party vendors tend to be this way too.  We don&#8217;t have the source, and probably don&#8217;t want to, or can&#8217;t, build their code anyway.  We also pay for support and outsource the code precisely because we get a versioned &#8220;thing&#8221; that we can count upon.</p>

		<p>That reminds me that I could not decode an Intel Indeo 4 video on Windows Vista or newer.<br />
Not Intel Indeo 5, which is still shipped with Windows, or even available on the Web, Intel Indeo 4.<br />
ffmpeg/ffdshow &#8220;decodes&#8221; it, but it&#8217;s output is useless.</p>
<p>I had to use a Windows 98SE machine to capture the video. Win9X has a DirectShow codec bult-in for IV41.<br />
Alas, no VfW codec either&#8230;.</p>
<p>I wonder in which dll it resides on Windows 9X, and why it became totally unavailable, even on the Web ?</p>

		<p>I loathe FCIBs in my source control; I&#8217;ve resorted to maintaining an internal NuGet server and turning the various FCIBs in to NuGet packages just so I don&#8217;t have to check them in.  It works pretty well as a solution (probably until the day it doesn&#8217;t and then I&#8217;ll curse it).</p>
<p>I really like having an easy way of saying &#8220;binary that wasn&#8217;t created by this solution&#8217;s build process&#8221; now :)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
