Today I wish to draw your attention to this article:
<a HREF="http://www.delhidailynews.com/news/Confirmed--Microsoft-Surface-Pro-5-to-be-launched-in-June-1462195453/">
<i>Confirmed: Microsoft Surface Pro 5 to be launched in June [2016]</i></a>.
I added the "2016" because the article didn't give a year in its headline,
but it was posted in May 2016, so it was clearly referring to June 2016.
</p>
<p>
Even though the headline says "Confirmed",
if you actually read the article,
you'll find that it's nearly all rumor and speculation.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q">
<p>
It seems that...
</p>
<p>
Reports say Microsoft has released these ads in order to indicate
that the release of Surface Pro 5 is imminent. ...
</p>
<p>
Rumours are swirling that the tablet will be unveiled in
June along with Surface Book 2.
...
</p>
<p>
Some reports claim that...
</p>
<p>
The Surface Pro 5 may...
[I]t is expected that...
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
There are only two statements in the entire article that are actually
put forth as facts rather than speculation.
</p>
<ol>
<li>
"Recently, a patent for the Surface Pen was found on U.S.
Patent &amp; Trademark Office website."
This is easily verified.
</li>
<li>
"The base model of Surface Pro 5 Core i5 will be priced at $899 while,
[sic]
the i7 processor model will cost $999."
This is stated as fact without any source.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Of course, none of the allegedly-confirmed details
actually came true in June 2016.
So much for "confirmed".</p>

		<p>&#8220;The media&#8221;? The media is thousands of different companies and even individuals. Some have high standards and will not do this, and will even publish corrections when they&#8217;re wrong. Others are just anything that fits between the ads and attracts eyeballs (as this one probably is &#8212; I haven&#8217;t followed the link). You (generic you) have to pay attention and figure out which is which.</p>

		<p>Humm&#8230;</p>
<p>[Earlier, it was reported that Surface Pro 5 will be launched in early months of 2017 as the company is currently focused on Surface Phone. ]</p>
<p>And nothing later reversed the idea &#8220;the company is currently focused on Surface Phone&#8221;, so it should be June 2017 instead?</p>

		<p>Lol, and more hard facts:</p>
<p>&#8220;Based on Surface Pro 5&#8217;s leaked photo, the upcoming hybrid laptop might come along with a Type Cover along with the tech company&#8217;s Surface Pen. Aside from the leaked image, the Microsoft Surface Pro 5 might also feature a 4K display. Also, the upcoming 2-in-1 tablet might be powered by Intel&#8217;s newest Kaby Lake processors.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In addition, the Surface Pro 5 is expected to run on Windows 10 full version. As for the price of the Microsoft Surface Pro 5, there is a probability that the forthcoming gadget might cost similar to its predecessor.&#8221;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
