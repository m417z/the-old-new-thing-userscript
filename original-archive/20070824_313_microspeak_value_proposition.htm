		<p>Actually I find this an acceptable term if it&#8217;s used during the planning stages of a project. &nbsp;The product hasn&#8217;t been created yet. &nbsp;The team is proposing to create a product. &nbsp;Management wishes to understand the proposition, specifically in terms of its value to the user. &nbsp;Reasonably clear phrase in my mind.</p>

		<p>The related one that bothers me more is &quot;value-add&quot;, as in, &quot;What&#8217;s the value-add of your product?&quot;</p>

		<p>My biggest problem is that once you created a value proposition it could be more important for some people in marketing to &quot;Demonstrate&quot; it, than to add features than actually deliver. &nbsp;I can&#8217;t tell you how many features we had that &quot;Demostrated Value Propositions&quot;, but didn&#8217;t do anything useful.</p>
<p>In other words, lots of time was spent on the proposition, but little on the value.</p>

		<p>Not just Microspeak, I hear this a lot. I take it as a red-flag indicator that the speaker is unable to quantify an ROI for the imagined benefit.</p>

		<p>You know you&#8217;ve spent too much time with marketing when you read the objections to a term like this, and you start feeling compelled to defend its utility and propriety in modern business.</p>
<p>In other words, to explain the value proposi&#8230; oh, crap.</p>
<p>If you only knew the power of the dark side.</p>

		<p>Oops wrong thread! :)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not much of a &quot;value prop&quot; either.</p>
<p>You get it, you don&#8217;t know what to do with it, and it makes everything pear shaped!</p>
<p>Perhaps it makes sense to give it back in the wrong place, after all!</p>

		<p>&quot;What makes it even more annoying is when it is abbreviated to value prop.&quot;</p>
<p>It reminds me of the &quot;agit prop&quot; in Communist countries&#8230;</p>

		<p>I dunno, at least it shows managers actually pay lip service to adding features that are useful to the user. I&#8217;ve seen features added by programmers that cause users to go ballistic when they find out that it breaks some weird but vital use case they have that no one knows about. What&#8217;s annoying is that people then start talking about policy and security and standards as if they didn&#8217;t have a choice about adding the feature. And pointing out that the use case is the wrong way to use the software.</p>
<p>You can see the effect on this blog &#8211; there are lots of Windows features added so broken third party code can keep running and people complain about the inelegance of them without realising that the elegant solution they want would cause the tech support line to be jammed with angry people.</p>
<p>My conjecture is that capitalism and a strong marketing department actually helps prevent this sort of thing. If the company is insulated from commercial pressure from users it&#8217;s easy for programmers to do insist on a &#8216;pure&#8217; design that massively annoys end users. And I think that&#8217;s the edge Windows has over other less commercial OSs. Sure the code may be a bit hard to read, but that&#8217;s because it supports third party apps doing insane things. And an majority of people care more about the apps than the elegance of the code.</p>

		<p>Personally, I rather proactively synergize all my cooperative team-building efforts to mitigate channel-based concerns while increasing my personal value proposition in order to further drive customer satisfaction and additionaly expand my bandwith for future-oriented growth capability.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
