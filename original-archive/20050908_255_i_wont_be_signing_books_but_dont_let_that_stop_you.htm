<p> There have been some changes to my talk since I wrote about it last time. The lecture style is gone; the material simply didn't support it. It's just going to be a conventional talk against a series of slides. I sort of painted myself into a corner with my title, <a href="http://commnet.microsoftpdc.com/content/SessionView.aspx?SessionID=8acd4162-adb9-4a37-98db-720e7b6e3a48"> Five Things Every Win32 Developer Should Know</a>: If you should know it, then it can't be all that advanced can it? As a result, my talk is really more of a high 200's/low 300's type of talk. But maybe just collecting all these factoids in one place makes it worthy of a 400 rating? </p>

		<p>A factoid isn&#8217;t (surely?) a miniature fact, but something that Everyone Knows Is A Fact although it&#8217;s actually untrue [ie something that behaves culturally as a fact but isn&#8217;t one]. There are plenty of those about Windows but somehow I don&#8217;t think your talk is going to be about those.<br />
<br />They would make a nice alternative talk, though: &quot;Five Things Every Win32 Developer Shouldn&#8217;t Know&quot;&#8230;</p>

		<p>I suppose the fact that someone&#8217;s talking about Win32 at ALL would take it automatically into the 400 level&#8230;</p>

		<p>What does &quot;factoid&quot; mean? (English is not my native tongue)<br />
<br />I&#8217;ve found somewhat contradicting definitions in the dictionaries:<br />
<br />1. something that is widely accepted as a fact, although it is probably not true<br />
<br />2. a small piece of interesting information, especially about sth that is not very important</p>
<p>Thank you.<br /></p>

		<p>I had the impression that &#8216;factoid&#8217; originally meant something like &#8216;like a fact&#8217; or &#8216;commonly believed to be a fact&#8217; or &#8216;misleading fact&#8217; (don&#8217;t know, Isaac&#8217;s post&#8217;s probably right), but then came to mean &#8216;small fact&#8217;. Hence the confusion.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
