		<p>I found waldo he is sitting behind the large white tower in the center-right. He appears to be about ~20ft behind the tower and he is holding a camera, sitting directly on the ground.</p>

		<p>Wow. &nbsp;It looks as if Clarence Thomas fell asleep in the audience&#8230; &nbsp;(A few yards behind Obama, to the left of Scalia.)</p>

		<p>WaldoFinder is my hero effective immediately. &nbsp;Contract specifies at least 4 hours of herodom before replacement. &nbsp;Hero-dom is thereafter at-will.</p>

		<p>Neat photo. :)</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a Photosynth of the event, too:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28661889/" rel="nofollow">http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/28661889/</a></p>
<p>Not one of the best examples I&#8217;ve seen of Photosynth but interesting all the same. (Some of the ones on the website are great.) I like the way the people on the stage change as you move around it due to it using images taken at different times. It&#8217;s quite a surreal effect.</p>

		<p>At first I thought he snapped 220 cameras at the same time to make that gigantic pic. That&#8217;s not unrealistic considering 120 cameras were used to shoot a car commercial, see &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://breezesys.com/MultiCamera/index.htm" rel="nofollow">http://breezesys.com/MultiCamera/index.htm</a></p>
<p>Assuming each of those Canon 30D + lens is $1000 (quantity discount!), that&#8217;s $120k of cameras for one commercial.</p>

		<p>Aretha looks a bit odd&#8230;looks like their photo assembly has a few glitches. &nbsp;(She&#8217;s a few rows behind Cheney.)</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a pair of lower legs with no person attached, about one quarter of the width of the photo from the left, just below the waist high fence.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
