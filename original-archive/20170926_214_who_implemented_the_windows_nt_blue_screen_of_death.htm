Following up on the history of the
Windows 3.1 and Windows 95 blue screen messages,
John Vert admits that
<a HREF="https://www.quora.com/Who-designed-the-original-Windows-Blue-Screen-of-Death">
he wrote the Windows NT blue screen of death</a>.
In particular, he explains why it was white text
on a blue background.
(That it happened to match the Windows 3.1 and Windows 95
color scheme was a coincidence.)
</p>
<p>
As I recall, it was
John Vert who taught me the basics of Alpha AXP assembly language.
(As I noted earlier,

Richard Bond
taught me the basics of Itanium assembly language</a>.)</p>

		<p>Though back in 1991 I would have been using Brief.  My recollection is that Brief&#8217;s default color scheme was a similar white-on-blue.</p>

		<p>With the name &#8216;Vert&#8217; why didn&#8217;t he make it green? Green text on a black background would look like an old dumb terminal.</p>

		<p>No, no, since The Register (or Slashdot, or someone) said that Raymond Chen wrote the Blue Screen of Death, it must be true.</p>

		<p>Blue background was very popular &#8220;back then&#8221;. See Turbo Pascal, Turbo C++, Norton Commander, XTree Gold&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t say that the explanation Vert gives is false&#8230;</p>
<p>Just trying to explain why SlickEdit had a blue theme :-)</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s an interesting anecdote. Of course you don&#8217;t want your error screen to be the same colour as your boot screen or editor.</p>

		<p>Er&#8230; Your source is a Quora post&#8230;</p>
<p>Are you sure it is the genuine John Vert? (Anyone can create an account and claim to be John Vert.) Actually, is there (or has there ever been) a John Vert, the ex-Windows NT kernel guy, working for Microsoft?</p>

		<p>Depends on whether you learned Alpha AXP from a Quora account or not.</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t get defensive; I am not attacking. I am just checking a fact. Do you know how many people have so far come to Wikipedia claiming they are Bill Gates, Anders Hejlsberg or Ellon Musk?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just asking a simple question: Are you sure this Quora account belongs to a genuine article?</p>

		<p>Why would somebody impersonate John Vert? &#8220;Hey, check this out, I&#8217;m going to impersonate an obscure Windows developer and create absolutely no controversy whatsoever. It&#8217;ll be hilarious!&#8221;</p>

		<p>Stick with Wikipedia&#8217;s &#8220;checkuser&#8221; privilege-holders for a while and they tell you why. When everyone looks with skepticism at a user account that says &#8220;I am Bill Gates&#8221;, impersonators start with more complex tactics. Almost a nobody in comparison to Bill Gates, this user account is still a candidate for being one of the three pillars of a reliable source: Credible author. This author is still counted as &#8220;Horse&#8217;s own mouth&#8221; in comparison to total nobodies. (If you truly want to know more, contact User:Codename Lisa of English Wikipedia. Unlike me, she is a social guru.)</p>
<p>But the fact that you have so far eluded answering with a &#8220;Yes&#8221; or &#8220;No&#8221; greatly worries me. To tell the truth, if you had answered in your first or second post, your word would have carried much conviction.</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t prove that it really is John Vert. I&#8217;ll leave you to make your own decision as to whether the story is trustworthy. That&#8217;s why I linked to it. My initial remark was responding your claim that there may not even exist a person named John Vert. I can vouch for the existence of a person named John Vert.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
