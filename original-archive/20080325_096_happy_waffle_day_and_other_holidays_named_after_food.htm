<p>Today is Waffle Day in Sweden, and the reason why today of all days is Waffle Day I find quite amusing.</p>
<p> March 25th is the Feast of The Annunciation according to the Catholic Church calendar, the day on which the archangel Gabriel announced to Mary that she would conceive a child, the Son of God. Why March 25th? The date was arrived at by the following highly scientific calculation: </p>
<ol>
<li>Everybody knows that <a href="http://christmas.howstuffworks.com/christmas4.htm"> Jesus was born on Christmas Day</a>, December 25th. </li>
<li>Everybody also knows that <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/question/index?qid=20071118161150AACmcVy"> pregnancy lasts nine months</a>. </li>
<li>Nine months before Christmas is March 25th. </li>
</ol>
<p> <i lang="la">Ipso facto</i>, <i lang="la">habeas corpus delicti</i>, we have determined the date of the Annunciation to be March 25th via incontrovertible logic. </p>
<p> In England, the holiday is known as <i>Lady Day</i>, a name which is echoed Sweden, where the holiday goes by the name <i>Our Lady's Day</i>: <i lang="sv">V&aring;rfrudagen</i>. Now, if you say <i lang="sv">V&aring;rfrudagen</i> really fast and mumble it, somebody with bad hearing might misinterpret what you said as <i lang="sv">Vaffeldagen</i>, which means <i>Waffle Day</i>. </p>
<p> Now, Waffle Day is not to be confused with <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/food/news_and_events/events_pancakeday.shtml"> <i>Pancake Day</i></a>, a British holiday which coincides with Shrove Tuesday, the day before the beginning of Lent. Unlike Waffle Day, which is based on a pun, Pancake Day had a practical origin: In olden days, consumption of dairy products was prohibited during Lent, and pancakes were a convenient way to use up your leftover <a href="http://www.ochef.com/772.htm"> eggs</a>, butter, and milk all at one go. (That is, on years when it isn't <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/02/04/npancake204.xml"> cancelled</a>.) </p>
<p> And this year, a Polish colleague taught me about <i lang="pl">P&#261;czki Day</i>, a holiday that takes place on the Thursday before Lent and is apparently celebrated by "eating as many <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%C4%85czki" lang="pl"> p&#261;czki</a> as possible." <span lang="pl">P&#261;czki</span> are pastries that resemble a jelly-filled doughnut, and the holiday served the same practical purpose as Pancake Day in England. </p>
<p> What food-based holidays exist in your country? Here are a few more to get you started: </p>
<ul>
<li>Greece:     <i lang="el">&Tau;&sigma;&iota;&kappa;&nu;&omicron;&pi;&#941;&mu;&pi;&tau;&eta;</i>     (<i lang="el">Tsiknopempti</i> = Barbecue Thursday).     Eat lots of barbecued meat on the Thursday before Lent. </li>
<li>East Asia: <span lang="zh-tw">&#20013;&#31179;&#31680;</span>     (<span lang="zh-cn">&#20013;&#31179;&#33410;</span>,     <i lang="zh-cn">zh&#333;ngqi&#363;ji&eacute;</i> =     Mid-Autumn Festival, a.k.a. the Mooncake Festival).     Eat moon cakes in late September.     The traditional filling is lotus seed paste,     but for some reason I imprinted on red bean paste. </li>
</ul>

		<p>Not in my country, but in Russia there is a folk holiday before the Great Lent too, the Butter Week. But it has two roots &#8211; it was a former holiday celebrating the coming of spring with sunny round pancakes.</p>

		<p>For &quot;中秋節&quot;, it literally means &quot;Mid-Autumn festival&quot; and the name has nothing to do with moon cake. It is just that moon cake is a common food for celebration, so people occationally refer to the festival as &quot;Mooncake festival&quot; (very informal and uncommon). <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mid-Autumn_Festival</a></p>

		<p>I believe the idea behind Pancake Day (and Mardi Gras = &quot;Fat Tuesday&quot;) was to eat up all the lard in the house, since meat and its byproducts were prohibited during Lent.</p>

		<p>The best thing about calculations involving nine months of gestation is that gestation is actually closer to ten months. Oops. (It&#8217;s either 38 or 40 weeks, depending on when you start counting.)</p>

		<p>38 weeks from conception, 40 weeks from last period. &nbsp;A month on average has 4.35 weeks. &nbsp;Therefore gestation is just under or over 9 months, depending on where you count from.</p>

<p>I recently heard that it was a &#8216;corruption&#8217; of &quot;Lady&#8217;s&quot; day. Therefore it&#8217;s the same name as in Sweden, just been corrupted somewhat. The corruption is (apparently) that at the time the English language didn&#8217;t have possessives for certain nouns, and it&#8217;d seem that Lady (in the Mary sense or the lady sense I don&#8217;t know) didn&#8217;t have one, so Lady day was correct at the time and is now not so correct. But I can&#8217;t remember where I read that recently&#8230;</p>

		<p>Never thought an American would teach me about Swedish customs, but there you go. Nice story.</p>
<p>Incidentally, my wife and I realized it was waffle day as we were frying up some pancakes. The batter is essentially the same so we could&#8217;ve just dug up our waffle iron but, alas, we had already started frying the pancakes and were too late.</p>

		<p>&quot;In the USA, March 14 (3/14) is pie day! &nbsp;OK, it&#8217;s really pi day, but it sounds the same.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s an important distinction! &nbsp;1/23 is pie day. &nbsp;(According to the American Pie Council, which is good enough for me.) &nbsp;This means you get two days for celebrating pie without being redundant.</p>

<p>Peanut butter is quite obviously the best filling for mooncakes.</p>

		<p>In Iceland we have:</p>
<p>Bolludagur &#8211; Creamy bun with jelly</p>
<p>Sprengidagur &#8211; Salted lamb and lentil soup</p>
<p>Also, during the month of &quot;&#222;orri&quot; we have &quot;&#222;orrabl&#243;t&quot; where we eat sheaps head, rams balls, shark meat, a sort of haggis, dried fish, smoked lamb and wash everything down with Brenniv&#237;n (a snaps). &nbsp;As you can gather from the menu, it is an old viking celebration (that has zero to do with the Christian religion). &nbsp;You would be surprized how tasty some of the above mention stuff actually is : )</p>

		<p>The back story is supposedly about revenge rather than food, but the emblem is striking:</p>

		<p>Most of what I first thought I had to say has already been said by our host, and by other swedes, in the thread.</p>
<p>I introduced V&#229;ffeldagen to my US host upon arriving yesterday. They were amused of the occasion and delighted by the waffles I made. Homemade batter with whipped cream, flour and water.</p>
<p>Now, there are more Swedish food days. Of course, Christmas has a huge set of specific foodstuff that only happen there. Then there is Midsummer, also with specific celebrations if not isolated specific foods. And the Crayfish premiere in August, when the Crayfish eating season starts. And the St. Martin&#8217;s goose (M&#229;rtensg&#229;s) in November (or is it December? I can never remember that one)</p>

		<p>The dates are not held by the Church to be the actual dates of events, but the celebrations thereof.</p>

		<p>For easter day in Romania you would eat painted eggs (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://images.google.com" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.com</a> will give you a good idea) and a special lamb disk (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b89/Adisor1/Pasqua2006/14_drob_2.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://i17.photobucket.com/albums/b89/Adisor1/Pasqua2006/14_drob_2.jpg</a>)</p>
<p>And of course there are traditional dishes for Christmas.</p>

		<p>Regarding mooncake, while the traditional filling is lotus seed paste, I think green bean paste is a more common choice then red bean paste for the new style ones.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
