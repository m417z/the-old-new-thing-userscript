		<p>Indeed. I did use to live very close and quite regularly caught the 139 or 189 bus down Abbey Road. The bus has to stop at that crossing without fail every time. I thought the comment on the article that &quot;nobody brings a step ladder (which is what you need to take an accurate facsimile)&quot; sounded like it was made by a true enthusiast!</p>
<p>Slightly off topic: there&#39;s a guy whose job it is to paint over the grafiti on wall just outside the recording studios too.</p>

		<p>2 minutes, I&#39;m surprised you had to wait that long! It seemed more like every 10 seconds somebody went out there and posed&#8230;</p>

		<p>I used to walk around the corner from that crossing and we would refuse to use it since otherwise you ran the risk of being photographed by tourists!</p>

		<p>It&#39;s worth noting that the crossing was &quot;moved&quot; many years ago so it&#39;s not even the same crossing really.</p>

		<p>Before I moved to New York I used to drive that way when going to visit my brother and sister. The solution is simple, just aggressively honk your horn until they move!</p>

		<p>I live in the vicinity of a neighborhood called Strawberry Fields, with an Abbey Rd, Penny Ln, McCartney Rd, Harrison Rd, Lennon Ln, and Apple Rd. &nbsp;Poor Ringo. &nbsp;Fortunately there are no crosswalks to be found.</p>

		<p>Amusingly, there is a DLR station in East London called Abbey Road, which is a different Abbey Road.</p>
<p>This is, of course, near Stratford which is nothing to do with Shakespeare.</p>
<p>If I were TfL (Transport for London) I would make the decoration of both heavily Beatles and Shakespeare related, and follow up by covering the nearby Pudding Mill Lane station with murals showing their collaboration on the unfortunately lost concept album Love&#39;s Labours Won.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
