<p>The letters SQM originally stood for Service Quality Monitoring, but that doesn't really answer the question, "What is SQM?"</p>
<p> SQM is the internal code name for the technologies behind what is publically known as the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/ceip/"> Microsoft Customer Experience Improvement Program</a>. This is a voluntary program that customers can opt into, which gathers information about Office (say), information such as which menu options you use most often, how often you undo an autocorrection, what types of "impossible" things the program had to recover from, which error messages you've been shown, and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/david_leblanc/archive/2008/01/14/how-we-know-which-file-formats-are-used.aspx"> which file format converters you use</a>. (That's a quick overview of the Customer Experience Improvement Program; <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/ceip/"> click through to read more</a>, including the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/products/ceip/EN-US/privacypolicy.mspx"> privacy policy</a>.) </p>
<p> To me, what raises this beyond just an internal code name to the level of Microspeak is that the term has become linguistically productive. In addition to the term SQM being used to refer to the technology itself, you can also find it used as a verb: "The information gets SQMmed once a month." "Can we SQM this data?" </p>
<p> The letters SQM are pronounced as if it were spelled <i>squim</i>, which happens also to be the pronunciation of the Washington town Sequim. Along with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/04/01/9988477.aspx"> <i>Enumclaw</i></a>, <i>Puyallup</i>, and <i>Tulalip</i>, Sequim is a Washington place name which is used to distinguish the locals from the outsiders. I strongly suspect that whoever came up with the name SQM did so specifically as a tribute to the town best known for its annual <a href="http://www.lavenderfestival.com/"> lavender festival</a>. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus history</b>: At some point, somebody decided that the letters SQM no longer stand for Service Quality Monitoring; they now stand for <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/posts/JonUdell/A-conversation-with-Partha-Sundaram-about-SQM-software-quality-metrics/"> Software Quality Metrics</a>. That this change occurred without anybody noticing proves that nobody really cares what the letters stand for in the first place. I've heard from multiple sources that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2006/04/05/568947.aspx#ctl00___ctl00___ctl02___Comments___Comments_ctl03_NameLink"> the original name came from the MSN team</a>. </p>

		<p>In the division of Microsoft I worked for last year, SQM and CEIP were two different programs, with different rules.</p>
<p>I guess the company is so big that Microspeak has fractured into dialects.</p>

<p>SoftwareMicrosoftMSNMessengerSQM also seems to do it, I guess it&#8217;s in some license I didn&#8217;t read since I sure as hell did not opt in.</p>
<p>So, metrics like these is why features I use (but nobody else seem to) just disappear (Unlimited rebar in IE, floating deskbars etc)</p>

		<p>Raymond, I think you&#8217;re missing a &#8220;stood&#8221; in the first sentence.</p>
<p>asf, from what I&#8217;ve seen, it&#8217;s enabled by default in all beta versions (even required in some versions), and opt-in in production versions. &nbsp;The questions originally didn&#8217;t use the CEIP term, and just asked if you wanted to send program usage data to Microsoft, or something like that.</p>

		<p>I humbly suggest that the past tense of SQM is SQM&#8217;d, not SQMmed.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostrophe</a></p>
<p>It is sometimes used when the normal form of an inflection seems awkward or unnatural; for example, KO&#8217;d rather than KOed (where KO is used as a verb meaning &quot;to knock out&quot;); &quot;a spare pince-nez&#8217;d man&quot; (cited in OED, entry for &quot;pince-nez&quot;; pince-nezed is also in citations).</p>

		<p>For example, consider the apostrophes in the opening monologue of Love&#8217;s Labor&#8217;s Lost:</p>
<p>&quot;pass&#8217;d&quot;, &quot;arm&#8217;d&quot;, and even &quot;regist&#8217;red&quot;</p>

<p>The line after the opening monologue is quite a pearl of apostrophism as well:</p>
<p>&quot;I am resolv&#8217;d; &#8217;tis but a three years&#8217; fast:&quot;</p>
<p>Mmmm&#8230; apostrophes&#8230;</p>

		<p>The alphabet used today is very different from that used by Shakespeare (24 letters vs the 26 of modern English).</p>
<p>I doubt very much that the apostrophe existed in the way that it does today either.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think referring to an ASCII transcription of an Elizabethan text (of which no original copies survive in the authors own hand) is a basis for establishing a grammatical principle.</p>
<p>Besides which, those apostrophes conceivably fit perfectly with the accepted practice of simply denoting missing letters:</p>
<p>Resolv&#8217;d &nbsp;==&gt; Resolv-E-d</p>
<p>in exactly the same way as used in &quot;don&#8217;t&quot; and &quot;hasn&#8217;t&quot; or &quot;o&#8217;er the rainbow&quot; etc etc</p>
<p>This may even be being used to indicate pronunciation to fit the meter of the dialog. &nbsp;i.e. to ensure the &quot;silence&quot; of the E&#8217;s, as opposed to the over pronunciation of them : &quot;re-solv-d&quot;, vs &quot;re-solve-ed&quot; (i.e. with the final syllable pronounced to rhyme with &quot;head&quot;).</p>
<p>Incidentally, both of these explanations fit better with later uses of the apostrophe in that same text:</p>
<p>&quot;Will you prick&#8217;t with your eye&quot;</p>
<p>vs</p>
<p>&quot;Will you prick it with your eye&quot;</p>
<p>But don&#8217;t take my word for it: &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2008/08/try-it-with-a-scramblet-egg-2.html" rel="nofollow">http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2008/08/try-it-with-a-scramblet-egg-2.html</a></p>
<p>(confirming that, yes, in the first instances you reference the apostrophe is connected with a past tense, but only as the usual means of indicating a shortening of the full spelling &#8211; i.e. indicating omitted letters. &nbsp;The tense is changed by the spelling, the apostrophe indicates omission of certain letters in the spelling, NOT a change of tense per se).</p>
<p>That is all.</p>

		<p>Maurits: In Shakespeare, -ed was pronounced as a separated syllable, but the past-tense indicator is now effectively -d. &nbsp;When abbreviations are spelled out (e.g. CD&#8217;s), the apostrophe is separating the initialism from its inflection.</p>
<p>Therefore, SQMmed is (probably) pronounced &quot;squimmed&quot;, while SQM&#8217;d is pronounced &quot;ess-queue-emd&quot;. &nbsp;SQM-ed would be pronounced &quot;ess-queue-emm-ed&quot;, so makes no sense.</p>

		<p>A few years ago, when I was at Microsoft, some of my British friends were laughing about the name SQM (specifically, how it&#8217;s pronounced).</p>
<p>One of them said, &quot;Maybe we should introduce a technology, and make sure its acronym is pronounced &#8216;SCUNT&#8217;.&quot;</p>
<p>True story.</p>

<p>BTW, my understanding of shibboleth was that it was a non-sense Hebrew word used by the ancient Israelites to test authenticity. &nbsp;Spy stuff and all. &nbsp;The reason it was effective was because the &quot;sh&quot; and &quot;th&quot; sounds were somewhat unique to Hebrew in the region at the time.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
