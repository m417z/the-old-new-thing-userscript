<p>A notice was sent out by the real estate department with the provocative subject line <i>Campus notification &mdash; <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/01/8346907.aspx"> Building&nbsp;7</a>: Marking Boring Locations</i>.</p>
<p> What? Were the people in the real estate department saying that the people who work in Building&nbsp;7 need to get some new hobbies? Or maybe they were just going to put up markers like you see in historic districts, but the markers are going to say something like <i>On this spot in 1998, absolutely nothing interesting happened</i>. </p>
<p> But no, that's not what the message was about. It was announcing that, in preparation for an expansion of the parking garage, there will be markers placed in the courtyard indicating where drilling will be taking place. The message was merely informational, so people won't wonder <i>What are these people doing wandering around the courtyard with surveying equipment and making X's on the patio with spraypaint?</i> </p>

		<p>If you looked up Boring in the Yellow Pages in the UK it used to say &quot;See Civil Engineering&quot;.</p>
<p>But the engineers complained for years and Boring doesn&#8217;t appear as a category now.</p>

		<p>Marking boring locations should be a community effort, and not limited to a small survey team. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll contribute by marking where I&#8217;m sitting now.</p>

		<p>Since Building 7 is nonexistent are the markers going to also be nonexistent? &nbsp;I suppose I should word this as past tense since the post is a year old? &nbsp;Is the new parking lot officially building 7 now? &nbsp;LOL</p>

		<p>Reminds me of one of my favorite easy-to-misread sentences, from Steven Pinker&#8217;s How the Mind Works, which featured the opposite problem: &quot;Kelman and Spelke bored babies with two sticks poking out from behind the top and bottom edges of a wide screen&quot; (318).&quot;</p>

		<p>The problem is that &quot;Boring&quot; is a verb that is used as a noun, when it is more commonly used as an adjective.</p>
<p>That should therefore be &quot;Marking locations for boring&quot;, but amusing regardless!</p>
<p>I propose that the real estate department be sent an ambiguous syntax violation.</p>

		<p>Comment 1: I suspect I may have been the first person to bring that fact to the attention of the Internet, way back in 1990 (in fact, the Yellow Pages said &quot;See Civil Engineers&quot;, of which my brother is one).</p>

		<p>Now, if Raymond had written a book like this, he would be .. slightly richer.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Boring-Postcards-Martin-Parr/dp/0714838950" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Boring-Postcards-Martin-Parr/dp/0714838950</a></p>
<p>I have one, its actually more amusing than you realise. Or&#8230; how about <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Roundabouts-Great-Britain-Kevin-Beresford/dp/1843308541" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.co.uk/Roundabouts-Great-Britain-Kevin-Beresford/dp/1843308541</a></p>
<p>Brilliant stuff, not everything that is &#8216;boring&#8217; is quite as boring as it first appears :)</p>

		<p>@Maurits:</p>
<p>&gt; &quot;spray paint&quot; is two words</p>
<p>I actually treat it as one &#8211; as a noun, &quot;spraypaint&quot; is more descriptive than &quot;paint&quot;, (not to mention &quot;spray paint&quot; is an odd phrase, adjectiving* the verb), and as a verb, &quot;spraypainting&quot; is used more often than &quot;spraying paint&quot;.</p>
<p>* &#8211; If I can verb nouns, I suppose I can adjective verbs, but it feels weird to me. Of course, someone&#8217;s going to post an example of a very common verb-as-adjective and I&#8217;m going to feel dumb.</p>

		<p>&gt; Does a &#8220;running commentary&#8221; make sense as a verb-as-adjective?</p>
<p>Technically &#8220;running&#8221; is a noun, so this is a noun-as-active.</p>
<p>OK, OK, it&#8217;s a gerund, but a gerund is a kind of noun (&#8220;in the running&#8221;)</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Technically it is a present participle, which in Germanic languages can function as an adjective. -Raymond</i>]</div>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
