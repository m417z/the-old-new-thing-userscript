<p>I ran across an old document that contained a phrase I hadn't heard before:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  <b>The Plan for the Plan for the XYZ Team</b> </p>
<p> <i>Summary</i> </p>
<p> XYZ is at ZBB and we are now at a recall class only bug bar until RTM. The team has also started working on a plan for a plan to address the requests made from the XYZ Leadership Team several months ago. Details of the planning ... </p>
<p> ... </p>
<p> 3. Bob would like a more concrete plan for a plan. Milestone breakdowns, entry/exit dates, etc... </p>
<p> ... </p>
<p> <i>Plan for a Plan</i>  </p>
<p> We established some deliverables to begin creating the plan for a plan: </p>
<p> Development/Design Code Review<br> Due date: Next week<br> Prerequisites: Dev work items </p>
<p> Alice will drive this to get sanity checks from other developers about overall design. </p>
<p> ... </p>
</blockquote>
<p> There's a lot of Microspeak in that snippet. We've got <i>ZBB</i>, <i>recall class</i>, <i>deliverables</i>, <i>to drive</i>, and the phrase for today: <i>plan for a plan</i>/<wbr><i>the plan</i>. </wbr></p>
<p> The phrase "plan for a plan" makes me think that you're trying to decide how you're going to decide what you're going to to. This is different from "early stages of planning", because when you're in the early stages of planning, you're <i>actually planning something</i>, even though you're still in the exploratory stage. On the other hand, planning for planning sounds like you don't even know how to plan, and you have to go learn how to do it again. </p>
<p> It reminds me of that Dilbert cartoon where Dilbert taunts the pointy-haired boss by suggesting that <a href="http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/1996-07-05/"> it would be rash to have a premeeting without planning it</a>. </p>

		<p>Either these people have seen &quot;Office Space&quot; and found it howlingly funny, or these are precisely the kind of people that &quot;Office Space&quot; finds howlingly funny.</p>
<p>(In one scene in Office Space, &quot;PLANNING TO PLAN&quot; is written in huge letters on a whiteboard in the background.)</p>

		<p>@John: Funny, &quot;ZBB&quot; means something completely different in my company. &nbsp;I wouldn&#8217;t have thought that an acronym that odd would mean something different.</p>
<p>Here, is means &quot;zero-based budgeting&quot;: &quot;if you give me something else to do/support/develop, you&#8217;ve got to take something else away, or extend my schedule.&quot;</p>

		<p>In my last company we used the term &quot;date for date&quot;, which meant the date when you were to provide a target date for your delivery. &nbsp;Which always struck me as nonsensical: if I don&#8217;t know what my target date is, how can I possibly know when I will know a target date?</p>

		<p>&quot;Driving issues&quot; is another good one (I think if &quot;to drive&quot; is Microspeak, than &quot;driving issues&quot; should be, too).</p>

		<p>If managers were more like software engineers, I bet they would have already coined the term &quot;meta-planning&quot; for this.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m amused to note that the Dilbert comic you referenced now has more than twice the number of votes than the other comics on dates around it.</p>

		<p>How do you manage to locate old Dilbert posts? :)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve tried but never managed to find what I&#8217;m looking for. Maybe the answer is as simple as you having bookmarked what you think you might find useful&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
