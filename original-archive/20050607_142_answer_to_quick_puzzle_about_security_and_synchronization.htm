As many people quickly figured out</a>, the reason why the
the <code>WaitForSingleObject</code> returns immediately
is that the call is failing.
The reason is that the second process opened the handle
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dllproc/base/synchronization_object_security_and_access_rights.asp">
with <code>EVENT_MODIFY_STATE</code> access</a>,
which
grants permission to call
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dllproc/base/setevent.asp">
the <code>SetEvent</code> function</a>,
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dllproc/base/resetevent.asp">
the <code>ResetEvent</code> function</a>,
and
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/01/05/346888.aspx">
the fatally flawed <code>PulseEvent</code> function</a>,
but it doesn't include
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/secauthz/security/standard_access_rights.asp">
<code>SYNCHRONIZE</code> access</a>,
which is necessary if you intend to synchronize on the object
(<i>i.e.</i>, wait on it).
</p>
<p>
The fix is for Process&nbsp;B to ask for
<code>SYNCHRONIZE</code> access instead of
<code>EVENT_MODIFY_STATE</code>.
</p>
<p>
The fact that it's happening in a second process is a red herring.
You can put this code in the same process and it will fail/succeed
in the same way:
</p>
<pre>
HANDLE hEventA = CreateEvent(NULL, FALSE, TRUE, TEXT("MyNamedEvent"));
HANDLE hEventB = OpenEvent(EVENT_MODIFY_STATE, FALSE, TEXT("MyNamedEvent"));
WaitForSingleObject(hEventB, INFINITE); // fails
</pre>
<p>
Indeed, the fact that the object is named is a red herring.
It has nothing to do with named/unnamed objects.
</p>
<pre>
HANDLE hEventA = CreateEvent(NULL, FALSE, TRUE, NULL);
HANDLE hEventB;
DuplicateHandle(GetCurrentProcess(), hEventA,
                GetCurrentProcess(), &amp;hEventB,
                EVENT_MODIFY_STATE, FALSE, 0);
WaitForSingleObject(hEventB, INFINITE); // fails
</pre>
<p>
In all three cases, the fix is to change
<code>EVENT_MODIFY_STATE</code> to <code>SYNCHRONIZE</code>.</p>

		<p>And of course, a named handle with a hardcoded name is very easy to squat. Any app can register/signal that event, thus affecting your prog into unfavorable situation (denial of service, maybe worse things)</p>

		<p>Since it doesn&#8217;t seem to be possible to post under the PulseEvent blog entry any more, I&#8217;ll post it here: PulseEvent is not flawed. Rather, what is flawed is a programmer trying to use it as means to signal a specific thread.</p>
<p>The contract of PulseEvent is that it will wake up 0 or 1 thread, depending on circumstances. If you&#8217;re not content with the 0 outcome, don&#8217;t use PulseEvent.</p>

		<p>This is sorta off topic but I am just curious. What is your job at Microsoft? It sounds like you did some core work back in the day (because you did some power toys) but moved into App Compat (apparently). Your posts are very intuitive and interesting, you have posted very.. enlightening scenarios. Somewhat related but not totally, at the Microsoft Community Blogs page, I looked for your blog under App Compate and found nothing, what category are you under?</p>

		<p>Jonathan: If you call CreateEvent, and an event with that name already exists, it will give you a new handle to that event and GetLastError() will return ERROR_ALREADY_EXISTS (183). This way, you can at least tell if the event existed already without causing a race condition.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
