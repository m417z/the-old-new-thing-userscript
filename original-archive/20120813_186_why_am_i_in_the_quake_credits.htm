<p> I've never played a game of Quake in my entire life. I (and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/10/06/10071954.aspx"> most of the rest of the Windows&nbsp;95 team</a>) played DOOM, but after a while, first-person-shooter games started giving me a headache. By the time Quake came out, I had already abandoned playing FPS games. </p>
<p> I don't remember what it was that I did specifically, but it was along the lines of helping them with various technical issues related to running under Windows. At the time, I was a kernel developer, and the advice I gave was almost certainly related to memory management and swapping. </p>
<p> Sorry it wasn't anything exciting. </p>

		<p>Regardless of what it was exactly, having your name next to DJ Delorie (which is written without the periods, btw) seems like quite a feat to me :)</p>

		<p>Wow, I started getting headaches from 3D games in a similar time frame. I played DOOM and was fine, and then later trying DOOM2 instant headaches. Note that headaches from 3D is called &#39;simulator sickness&#39;. I figured there was a trigger event that changed me from someone who didn&#39;t get those headaches, into someone who did. Your are the first other person I have heard of who had something similar happen to them. I have a question: How long after seeing a 3D game screen moving around did you get headaches? (for me it was almost instantly, and would last a couple of days)</p>

		<p>Predating DOOM was Wolfenstein 3D which for 1992-ish was pretty cool. I remember before that Prince of Persia on the 286 and 386 machines was groundbreaking. You can find that and it plays on XP Pro with compatibility set for Win95.</p>

<p>Pfft! Brian, move on and install DOSBox on Windows 7 (or 8 if you swing that way) for complete DOS game nostalgia, though for Doom of course there are great source ports available with lots of new features, better graphics etc. (use Chocolate Doom if you are a stickler for accuracy).</p>

		<p>I played DOOM II on a relatively weak PC. I don&#39;t remember the exact specs apart from that it was an AMD and it hadn&#39;t quite enough RAM for DOOM II so the latter kept continuously swapping; it was giving around 15..25 FPS. No ill effects.</p>
<p>However, several years later and on a much faster machine, I tried the game again for the sake of old times. It was running closer to 70 FPS, I think. The result: I couldn&#39;t pass further than second level due to growing nausea. My younger brother &#8212; same effect.</p>
<p>I wonder what gives.</p>

		<p>@pcooper I agree, I mean who cares who beta tests some software? But giving tips related to &quot;memory management and swapping&quot; wrt the Win95 kernel? Much more interesting ;)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
