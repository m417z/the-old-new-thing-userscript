<p>My friend the seventh grade teacher gave an assignment wherein students were to produce a map of the state of Washington with various required elements, among them, a selection of major cities in the state. Some students failed to understand that the purpose of a map is to represent where the cities are and not to dictate to the cities where they should be, for they moved the cities around in strange ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Some students put     <a href="http://www.ci.port-angeles.wa.us/">     Port Angeles</a> 100 miles inland nowhere near any body of water.     Psst, it's a port.     Ports are not as effective when they are 100 miles inland. </li>
<li>Other students took the idea of a port too far     and put Port Angeles 100 miles out to sea.     This sort of misses out the other half of being a port,     which is being <i>connected to land</i>. </li>
<li>But the winners of the <i>Unclear on the concept</i> award     are the students who moved the cities around.     "All these dots looked all crooked and stuff,     so I moved them around to make a straight line. Was that wrong?" </li>
</ul>
<p> Moving the dots around to make a more visually pleasing arrangement might work if you were designing, say, a <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/assets/downloads/standard-tube-map.gif"> transit map</a>, where the topology of the connections is the important thing rather than their physical arrangement in space. But this wasn't one of those times. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: Another student decided to embellish the map by coloring everything outside the boundaries of the state in blue. Psst, the color blue has special meaning in maps. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teraina"> Washington is not an island</a>. </p>

		<p>According to Wikipedia &quot;The Port of Houston is the port of Houston&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>Just thought that was a little funny. It does seem to be connected to waterways, though.</p>

		<p>You can have a seaport miles inland: the Save Our Wild Salmon Coalition claims that Lewiston, Idaho is a seaport (also on Wikipedia) primarily due to the damming of the Snake River. Lewiston is 500 miles inland. The Coalition is pushing for removal of the dams, which they claim are not bringing significant benefits and are preventing wild salmon reaching suitable spawning grounds upstream. <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.wildsalmon.org/library/map2.cfm" rel="nofollow">http://www.wildsalmon.org/library/map2.cfm</a> &#8211; hover over the Lower Monumental dam, which is the second upstream from the confluence of the Snake and Colombia Rivers.</p>
<p>Still, the point is that the kids don&#8217;t know where the cities are located in Washington and perhaps some of their guesses were less than educated.</p>

		<p>Kudos to Mike Dimmick. BTW Lewiston is about 1/2 mile (~the width of the river) east of Washington. And you have to go through washington to get to it.</p>

		<p>&quot;Psst, the color blue has special meaning in maps.&quot;</p>
<p>Umm, Oregon and Idaho went Democratic this election?</p>
<p>I do trust that you friend marked down those who went with the neater and less accurate shapes. It was one of my beefs in 4th-grade geography that those with neat handwriting and misshapen maps got better grades than those with crummy lettering and better maps.</p>

		<p>Slightly off topic&#8230; Our Product stores Files in a Chucked Folder stucture based on Person Id (0-499, 500-999, etc). Some users thought they would re-organise these into a Name based folder structure (Abram, Adams, etc), so they could open them from explorer, and then wondered why the product could not open the files.</p>
<p>Took them hours to do, took me minutes to restore from Backup :)</p>

		<p>@Leo Petr: but then you&#8217;re talking about the entire country, not surrounding states. I&#8217;m sure that the question of whether the US should be considered an isolated island is a topic that arouses great interest in people&#8230;</p>

		<p>This is rather disingenuous &#8211; they are schoolchildren &#8211; ok so they are a little creative in their maps &#8211; I&#8217;d rather that than they start thinking about &quot;the topology of the connections is the important thing rather than their physical arrangement in space&quot;.</p>

		<p>@JM: Yes seventh graders should be able to do better. &nbsp;They aren&#8217;t 5 years old and this wasn&#8217;t a Fairyland map.</p>
<p>Clearly the teacher has failed to teach the basic purpose of such a map to some of the students and yet Raymond ridicules the students rather than the teacher.</p>

		<p>@fat bob: if the assignment had been to produce a map of Fairyland and make it as interesting as possible as part of an exercise in creative expression, you&#8217;d have a point. If it had been a kindergarten class you&#8217;d definitely have a point.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure there are no seventh-graders reading this blog who&#8217;ll have their feelings hurt by Raymond&#8217;s comments. And seventh-graders who *do* think about topology probably have a bright career ahead of them &#8212; if not a glamorous one.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
