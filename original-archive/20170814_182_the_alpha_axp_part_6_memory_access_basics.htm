<p>
The Alpha AXP has only one memory addressing mode:
Indexed indirect.
</p>
<pre>
    ; load memory to register
    LDL     Ra, disp16(Rb)  ; result is sign-extended to 64 bits
    LDQ     Ra, disp16(Rb)

    ; store register to memory
    STL     Ra, disp16(Rb)
    STQ     Ra, disp16(Rb)
</pre>
<p>
In all cases, the address of the memory is
<code>(int16_t)disp16 + Rb</code>.&sup1;
As we learned when we discussed
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170809-00/?p=96785">
integer constants</a>,
the displacement is a 16-bit signed value,
so it has a reach of &plusmn;32KB.
By convention, a displacement of zero can be omitted.
</p>
<p>
The <code>L</code> suffix loads/stores a 32-bit value (long)
and the <code>Q</code> suffix loads/stores a 64-bit value (quad).
</p>
<p>
If the memory address is not suitably aligned,
then an alignment fault is generated.
By default,
Windows NT handles the alignment fault by emulating
the unaligned load for you, then resuming execution.
However, this is a ridiculously huge performance penalty,
so you don't want to make it a habit.
</p>
<p>
Note the absence of byte and word memory access.&sup2;
You'll have to construct those yourself.
And as noted above,
you'll also construct unaligned memory access
yourself if you know what's good for you.
</p>
<p>
The
special <code>_U</code> versions of the load and store instructions
are useful for constructing byte access, word access,
and unaligned memory access.
</p>
<pre>
    LDQ_U   Ra, disp16(Rb)
    STQ_U   Ra, disp16(Rb)
</pre>
<p>
These special unaligned instructions are available only
for quads.
They ignore the bottom 3 bits of the effective address
when calculating the address to load from.
For example, if the current value of the <var>t2</var> register
were <code>0x1234</code>, then the instruction
</p>
<pre>
    LDQ_U    t1, 3(t2)
</pre>
<p>
would take the value in the <var>t2</var> register,
add <code>3</code> to it, resulting in <code>0x1237</code>,
and then
round the value down to the nearest multiple of 8,
producing <code>0x1230</code>.
It would then load the 8-byte value starting at <code>0x1230</code>
and put into the <var>t1</var> register.
</p>
<p>
There are a set of extra computational
instructions to assist in taking apart and reassembling
integers from their containing quads.
They are the
extraction, insertion, and masking opcodes.
</p>
<p>
Here goes extraction:
</p>
<pre>
    EXTBL   Ra, Rb/#b, Rc  ; Rc =  (uint8_t)(Ra &gt;&gt; (Rb/#b * 8 % 64))
    EXTWL   Ra, Rb/#b, Rc  ; Rc = (uint16_t)(Ra &gt;&gt; (Rb/#b * 8 % 64))
    EXTLL   Ra, Rb/#b, Rc  ; Rc = (uint32_t)(Ra &gt;&gt; (Rb/#b * 8 % 64))
    EXTQL   Ra, Rb/#b, Rc  ; Rc = (uint64_t)(Ra &gt;&gt; (Rb/#b * 8 % 64))

    EXTWH   Ra, Rb/#b, Rc  ; Rc = (uint16_t)(Ra &lt;&lt; ((64 - Rb/#b * 8) % 64))
    EXTLH   Ra, Rb/#b, Rc  ; Rc = (uint32_t)(Ra &lt;&lt; ((64 - Rb/#b * 8) % 64))
    EXTQH   Ra, Rb/#b, Rc  ; Rc = (uint64_t)(Ra &lt;&lt; ((64 - Rb/#b * 8) % 64))
</pre>
<p>
These are weird to write out in formulas, but they are easy to explain.
You want to read these mnemonics as
"extract byte/&#x200B;word/&#x200B;long/&#x200B;quad low/&#x200B;high".
For example,
<code>EXTWL</code> is "extract word low".
</p>
<p>
To perform the extraction, you shift the first source parameter
right (if extracting low) or left (if extracting high)
by the number of bytes controlled by the second parameter.
(More precisely, specified by the least significant
3 bits of the second parameter.)
And then you extract the low-order
byte/&#x200B;word/&#x200B;long/&#x200B;quad from the result.
</p>
<p>
Note that these are fully 64-bit instructions, so there is no
sign extension in the <code>EXTLx</code> instructions.
</p>
<p>
For example,
if <var>t1</var> is <code>0x7531</code>,
then
</p>
<pre>
    EXTWH   t0, t1, t2
</pre>
<p>goes like this:
The shift amount is 7 bytes because
the least significant three bits of <var>t1</var> are <code>001</code>,
and we are extracting the high part.
So take the value in <var>t0</var>,
shift it left 56 bits (7 bytes),
and then extract the least significant 16 bits,
zero-extending the result to 64 bits.
</p>
<p>
The way to think of these instructions is that the extract a byte,
word, long, or quad from a 128-bit value.
The "low" version extracts the value from the least-significant 64 bits
of the 128-bit value,
and the "high" version extracts the value from the most-significant 64 bits
of the 128-bit value.
Both instructions position the extracted value so the two pieces can be
"or"d together.
</p>
<pre>
    high part  low part
    --------- ---------
    ABCD EFGH IJKL MNOP -- 16-byte value
          ^^^ ^         -- 4 bytes extracted at this position
        EXTLH EXTLL
         FGH0 000I
</pre>
<p>
Note that this is <i>not</i> how the instructions actually
operate,
because there are edge conditions when the shift amount is
an exact multiple of 8,
but it's a nice way to help remember how the instructions work.
</p>
<p>
Anyway,
with the extraction instruction, we can load a single byte
of memory, even if not aligned:
</p>
<pre>
    LDQ_U  t1, (t0)
    EXTBL  t1, t0, t1
</pre>
<p>
To see how this works,
let's number
the bytes in a 64-bit value from least significant
to most significant, zero through seven.
</p>
<p>
If <var>t0</var> were <code>0x9731</code>,
then the <code>LDQ_U</code> loads 8 bytes of memory from
<code>0x9730</code>.
The least significant byte (index 0)
contains the value of the byte
<code>0x9730</code>,
and the next-least-significant byte (index 1)
contains the value of the byte <code>0x9731</code>,
which is the one we want.
And by an amazing non-coincidence,
the <code>EXTBL</code> instruction selects the
byte at index <code>0x9731 &amp; 7 == 1</code>,
which is exactly the byte we want.
</p>
<p>
Loading signed data is a bit more work because you have
to sign-extend the result.
The simple way of doing this is to add
</p>
<pre>
    SLL     t1, #56, t1    ; shift byte all the way up to index 7
    SRA     t1, #56, t1    ; shift it all the way back to index 0
                           ; but with sign extension
</pre>
<p>
However, DEC recommends this alternative four-instruction sequence:
</p>
<pre>
    LDQ_U   t1, (t0)       ; load the entire enclosing quad
    LDA     t2, 1(t0)      ; sneaky trick to extract at index 7
    EXTQH   t1, t2, t1     ; shift the desired byte into index 7
    SRA     t1, #56, t1    ; signed shift right to move to index 0
</pre>
<p>
The basic idea here is to extract the desired byte into index 7
and then use a signed shift right to shift it into
index 0 with sign extension.
If we hadn't added 1 to <var>t0</var>,
then the byte we wanted would have shifted off the end of of
the register (into imaginary index 8);&sup3;
adding 1 means that the <code>EXTQH</code> will shift one fewer
index, so that instead of shifting into imaginary index 8,
the value we want ends up in index 7.
</p>
<p>
I'm guessing that DEC recommends the latter sequence because it
has a slightly shorter dependency chain,
but at the cost of an extra register.
</p>
<p>
Of course, if you know ahead of time what the alignment of
<var>t0</var> is,
then you can avoid having to calculate the shift amount in
<var>t2</var> and could just hard-code
<code>(</code><var>t0</var> <code>+ 1) % 8</code> as the second parameter
to the <code>EXTQH</code>.
</p>
<p>
The standard sequence for loading an aligned word is
</p>
<pre>
    LDQ_U   t1, (t0)    ; load the entire enclosing quad
    EXTWL   t1, t0, t1  ; extract the appropriate word, zero-extended
</pre>
<p>
And if you want sign extension, you use the same trick:
</p>
<pre>
    LDQ_U   t1, (t0)    ; load the entire enclosing quad
    LDA     t2, 2(t0)   ; sneaky trick to extract at index 6+7
    EXTQH   t1, t2, r1  ; shift the desired bytes to index 6+7
    SRA     t1, #48, t1 ; signed right shift to move to index 0+1
</pre>
<p>
These sequences are designed for properly word-aligned addresses.
But what if it's not correctly-aligned?
</p>
<p>
Let's find out.
Suppose that <var>t0</var> is <code>0x1357</code>.
Let's say that the word pointed to by <var>t0</var>
is <code>XXYY</code>,
with <code>YY</code> stored at <code>0x1357</code>
and <code>XX</code> stored at <code>0x1358</code>.
But we erroneously treat it as an aligned address and
execute the standard aligned word load sequence:
</p>
<pre>
    LDQ_U   t1, (t0)    ; loads the quad at 0x1350
                        ; t1 = YY??????`????????
    EXTWL   t1, t0, t1  ; shifts the value in t1 right by 7 bytes
                        ;      00000000`000000YY
                        ; and then extracts the least-significant word
                        ; t1 = 00000000`000000YY
</pre>
<p>
Oops, we read only the least significant byte of the value;
the <code>XX</code> was not loaded at all.
</p>
<p>
If you sit down and work it out,
the aligned word load sequence produces the desired results
for most unaligned addresses,
but if the word crosses a quad boundary,
the code executes without any faults
but produces incorrect results.
This is worse than crashing!
</p>
<p>
On the Alpha AXP, it is absolutely essential that you
accurately declare the fact that a pointer may point to
misaligned data.
If you forget, then depending on the size of the data
you are accessing and the precise nature of the misalignment,
you might get away with it,
or you might crash,
or (worst case) you will proceed with incorrect data.
</p>
<p>
So far, we've been looking only at loading aligned
bytes and words.
Next time, we'll look at unaligned accesses,
as well as storing bytes and words,
as well as storing unaligned longs and quads.
</p>
<p>
&sup1;
Note that the base register must be a general-purpose register.
This means no PC-relative addressing,
because the program counter is not a general-purpose register.
This is another strike against
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170810-00/?p=96795#comment-1306055">
storing constants in the code stream</a>.
</p>
<p>
&sup2;
Later versions of the Alpha AXP
added instructions for aligned byte and word access,
but Windows NT didn't require that you had one of those
newer processors.
Consequently,
you were unlikely to encounter them in practice
unless you had code that did processor feature detection
and had separate code paths for processors with and without
support for byte and word access instructions.
</p>
<p>
However, the
<a HREF="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2008.08.windowsconfidential.aspx">
proof-of-concept Alpha AXP 64-bit edition of Windows</a>
did require a processor that supported the byte and word
memory access instructions, so you would see those instructions
if you had to debug the Alpha AXP 64-bit verison of Windows.
(And by "you" I mean "me,"
because that version of Windows never shipped.)
</p>
<p>
&sup3;
Well, except that if <var>t0</var> had been an exact multiple of 8,
then the <code>EXTQH</code> wouldn't have shifted anything at all.
But you can work it out with pencil and paper and convince yourself
that the right thing happens even if <var>t0</var> is an exact
multiple of 8.</p>

		<p>Perhaps this processor is the reason why some compilers had an option &#8220;default char is unsigned&#8221;; this would radically improve the code density here. Somehow I find two instructions to complete a char memory read not unreasonable. This processor is probably a lot faster for  being unable to do unaligned memory access at all.</p>
<p>On another processor I encountered the &#8220;misaligned read&#8221; effect of reading an unaligned pointer. That was a pain to debug until I understood what was going on (no debugger for that environment&#8230;).</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
