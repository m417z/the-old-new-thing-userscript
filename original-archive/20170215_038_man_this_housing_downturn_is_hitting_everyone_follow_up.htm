<p>Back in 2008,
I remarked on a
house for sale on Mercer Island,
described in the original listing as
<a HREF="http://bing.com/search?q=22799+square+feet+in+square+meters">
22,000 square-foot</a>,
having five bedrooms, nine bathrooms,
two swimming pools,
and a
place to park your
<a HREF="http://bing.com/search?q=140+feet+in+meters">
140-foot</a> yacht.
At the time, it was
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20081024-01/?p=20463/">
marked down to $35 million from $40 million</a>.
</p>
<p>
The house was eventually sold in 2010 for
<a HREF="https://www.redfin.com/WA/Mercer-Island/1631-Roanoke-Way-98040/home/254053">
$12 million</a>,
less than a third of the original asking price.
Here's
<a HREF="http://www.zillow.com/homes/for_sale/49034472_zpid/">
another view</a>.
(Note also that the official records don't agree with what was claimed
in the listing.
As a general rule, never believe anything a real estate agent tells you.)</p>

		<p>Maybe they&#8217;re separating toilets and bath/showers and counting all of them (full separation would make it 10, so we can assume one of the bedrooms has a combined bathroom).</p>

		<p>Actually, for a (extreme) luxury house that doesn&#8217;t seem too strange.  If you assume that each bedroom as a private attached bathroom, you will also need a few general-use bathrooms in the house.  One general use bathroom per 5000 square feet is actually kind of stingy if you think about it.</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s probably at least 1 by each pool (2). 1 for each bedroom (+5) which makes 7. So 2 other bathrooms in the rest of the house.</p>
<p>I have three bathrooms in my 3000 ft house (Bedroom, Bedroom and general use). If I scaled my house up to 22,000 ft, I would need 21 bathrooms, right?</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think a linear scaling makes sense.  Otherwise you&#8217;d also have 14 bedrooms.</p>

		<p>One of the linked sites estimates its value at over $18 million, the other at $9.5 million. Bit of a difference there!</p>
<p>Also, it appears to have lost two bedrooms and two bathrooms over the years; both sites say it has three bedrooms and seven bathrooms.</p>

		<p>It is BECAUSE he is so willing to brazenly lie and never retreat from his lies that he got elected&#8230; so he isn&#8217;t a counterexample.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
