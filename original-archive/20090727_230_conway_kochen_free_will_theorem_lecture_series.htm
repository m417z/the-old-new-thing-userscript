<p>Some time ago, there was a bit of excitement when researchers John H.&nbsp;Conway (best known to geeks as the inventor of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life"> <i>The Game of Life</i></a>, a Turing-complete cellular automaton) and Simon Kochen (best known to geeks as, um, okay, he's not known to geeks) <a href="http://www.sciencenews.org/view/generic/id/35391/title/Do_subatomic_particles_have_free_will%3F"> concluded that if human beings have free will, then so too do elementary particles</a>.</p>
<p> In 2009, Conway <a href="http://paw.princeton.edu/issues/2009/07/15/pages/6596/index.xml"> gave a series of six one-hour lectures on this theorem</a>. The lectures have been recorded and <a href="http://www.princeton.edu/WebMedia/flash/lectures/2009_03_04_conway_free_will.shtml"> are available online</a>. (I also found a nice <a href="http://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~jas/one/freewill-theorem.html"> summary of a public lecture by John Conway</a> on the same subject, for those who are impatient and just want the one-page version.) </p>
<p> <b>Bonus Conway Chatter</b>: There are actually two noted mathematicians named John Conway. In addition to John H.&nbsp;Conway, whose work leans more toward group and number theory, there is also John B.&nbsp;Conway, whose work is primarily in functional analysis. (In a rough sense, John H.&nbsp;Conway studies discrete things, whereas John B.&nbsp;Conway studies continuous things.) The group theorist is by far the more famous of the two, and he told me that he had the opportunity to meet with his functional analysis counterpart, who noted that people outside the upper echelons of mathematics often mistook him for the far more famous group theorist. </p>
<p> "When I'm introduced to people, they will recognize the name and say, 'Oh, Dr. Conway, it's such a pleasure to meet you. I'm a big fan of the <i>Game of Life</i>.' I then have to tell them that they are thinking of the other John Conway." </p>
<p> Which is why John H.&nbsp;Conway was amused when he was introduced at some mathematics get-together or other, and the other person enthusiastically responded, "Oh, Dr. Conway, it's such a pleasure to meet you. I'm a big fan of your book on complex variables." </p>

		<p>Oddly, my geek knowledge of John (H.) Conway comes from his book Winning Ways. &nbsp;I knew of the Game of Life but didn&#8217;t connect it with the same author.</p>

		<p>I didn&#8217;t watch/read the lectures &#8211; but this is already obvious to me &#8211; we don&#8217;t have free will. However, the human brain/our environment is so chaotic (as in chaos theory) that it appears as if we have free will.</p>

		<p>Therefore by reductio ad absurdum, I conclude that humans do not have free will.</p>

		<p>So we don&#8217;t have free will. But we have to act as if we do, because we believe we do. As much as I can accept intelectually that I have no free will, I do not really believe it emotionally. I make decisions, and I do not know what I will decide until I have decided.</p>

		<p>&quot;So we don&#8217;t have free will.&quot; &nbsp;</p>
<p>Why do you say that? &nbsp;Our best theory is that particles are unpredictable, their actions aren&#8217;t predestined. &nbsp;It&#8217;s at least an open question whether particles have free will.</p>
<p>We seem to be exquisitely formed amplifiers that are capable of rapidly expanding tiny variations in particle level events into enormous physical change.</p>

		<p>Of course, all of this depends on how you define free will &#8211; it sould simply be the tipping point of a large enough collection of those quantum events.</p>
<p>Of course if you ascribe to the reductio ad absurdum argument that there is no free will, then of course there&#8217;s no such thing as theft.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll be over later &#8211; thanks for all your stuff.</p>

		<p>How can you conclude that you have no free will? Isn&#8217;t that exactly the kind of thing you need free will to do?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
