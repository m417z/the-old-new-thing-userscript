You might think that the <code>Is&shy;Well&shy;Known&shy;Sid</code>
function would tell you whether a SID is well-known, but it doesn't.
Rather,
it tells you whether a SID exactly matches the well-known SID
you specified.
For example, you can ask,
"Is this the <i>Authenticated Users</i> SID?"
or
"Is this the <i>Everyone</i> SID?"
But you can't ask,
"Is this any type of well-known SID?"
</p>
<p>
I guess you could enumerate through all the well-known SIDs,
and check if your SID matches any of them,
but that's getting kind of ugly.
</p>
<p>
If what you're interested in is
whether this is a machine-relative SID
(or a domain-relative SID, which is the special case where the machine
is the domain controller),
as opposed to a universal SID,
you can check whether the SID format is S-1-5-<b>21</b>-#-#-#-#.
All machine-relative SIDs have that form.
</p>
<pre>
#define SECURITY_NT_NON_UNIQUE          (0x00000015L) // decimal 21
#define SECURITY_NT_NON_UNIQUE_SUB_AUTH_COUNT  (3L)
</pre>
<p>
If you want to exclude
<code>machine\Administrator</code> and
other predefined machine-relative SIDs,
you can verify that the last number
(the RID) is greater than or equal to 1000.
</p>
<pre>
#define SECURITY_OTHER_ORGANIZATION_RID (0x000003E8L)

<p>&quot;There is also the fun possibility of there being a new well known SID created later and causing compatibility problems.&quot;</p>
<p>Given that there are around 4 well-known SIDs on a client PC and user SIDs start at 1000, I&#39;m pretty confident that&#39;s not going to be a problem any time soon.</p>

		<p>@Anonymous Coward: It has no difference to the compiler whether you express it in decimal, binary or hexadecimal. Those are just literals.</p>
<p>Btw, when is the last time you see a number that&#39;s not in hexadecimal in a Microsoft&#39;s header file?</p>

		<p>&gt;Can anyone suggest a case where it would be necessary to decide whether a particular SID was well-known or not?</p>
<p>Yes (and have actually implemented it).</p>
<p>When moving objects from one protection domain to another and doing some semi-intelligent ACL conversion. Basically, ACEs with well-known SIDs can be moved verbatim, and the rest need to be subject to conversion heuristics.</p>
<p>Though in practice I think I did it as suggested in Raymond&#39;s original post,by looking for the &#39;non-unique&#39; SID prefix.</p>

		<p>A bit off-topic, but IMHO it would be more logical to have well-known SIDs to be binary-defined and either be exported by some system dll (advapi32.dll is good enough) either even be defined like GUID&#39;s in some SDK .lib &#8211; unlikely that binary representation of SID&#39;s will be changed in future without backward compatibility cuz SIDs are part of SDs that stored on disks and network shares that means they must be backward (and better &#8211; even forward) compatible. In this case instead of calling IsWellKnownSid(sid, WinWorldSid) it would be necessary to call EqualSid(sid, WellKnownWorldSid).</p>

		<p>You might think that you can identify well-known SIDs using LookupAccountSid and seeing if SID_NAME_USE is SidTypeWellKnownGroup. &nbsp;However, this doesn&#39;t include well-known SIDs in the builtin domain, such as Administrators. &nbsp;You could check for the builtin domain separately, I suppose, but Raymond&#39;s approach probably makes more sense (and would certainly be faster).</p>
<p>If you&#39;re being paranoid about forwards compatibility, you might want to conclude that SIDs starting with S-1-5-21 are definitely per-domain, that SIDs which begin S-1-5-32 or return SidTypeWellKnownGroup are definitely well-known, and that anything else is &quot;we don&#39;t know, because SIDs of this sort didn&#39;t exist when the code was written&quot;.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
