<p>A customer wanted to know the internal file format of Visual SourceSafe databases. (That wasn't the actual question, but I've translated it into something equivalent but which requires less explanation.) They explained why they wanted this information:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We are doing some code engineering analysis on our project, so we need to extract data about every single commit to the project since its creation. Things like who did the commit, the number of lines of code changed, the time of day... We can then crank on all this data to determine things like <i>What time of day are most bugs introduced?</i> and possibly even try identify <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/09/20/10213768.aspx"> bug farms</a>. Since our project is quite large, we found that generating all these queries against the database creates high load on the server. To reduce the load on the server, we'd like to just access the database files directly, but in order to do that, we need to know the file format. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Oh great, directly accessing a program's internal databases while they're live. What could possibly go wrong? </p>
<p> I proposed an alternative: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Take a recent backup of your project and mount it on a temporary server as read-only. Run your data collection scripts against the temporary server. This will spike the load on the temporary server, but who cares? You're the only person using the temporary server; the main server is unaffected. After you collect all your data from the temporary server, you can then perform a much smaller number of queries against the live server to get data on the commits that took place since the last backup. </p>

<p>I agree. Especially because it would not says &quot;when are most bugs introduced&quot; but &quot;when are most bugs checked in&quot; which is totally non-correlated with the bug writing time.</p>

		<p>@Bob: &nbsp;Management could mandate that all programmers stop working for the half-hour period around which most bugs are introduced. &nbsp;Or make them go to lunch at that time. &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;Of course, after that change, there would be a new &quot;time of day when most bugs are introduced&quot;.</p>

		<p>Which still means the question for internal file format for Visual Source Safe needs to be answered.</p>
<p>Good idea about restoring to a second instance to take load off primary. It would be doubly true if the primary really were VSS, but that&#39;s beside the point right now.</p>

		<p>Adding to that:</p>
<p>SourceSafe &quot;database&quot; is just a bunch of badly named files in badly named directory tree, and SS &quot;server&quot; is just a fileserver. If it&#39;s a plain Windows Server, the access to the files would be locally cached, and it&#39;s fast enough.</p>
<p>But if the customer had a misfortune of using a different server, the files might not be locally cached, and then the client becomes incredibly slow. I&#39;ve been there; our SS database was stored on non-Windows brand-name SMB filer, and it&#39;s been the world slowest SS server. A wire capture showed that the filer didn&#39;t support opportunistic locking, and that caused all file accesses to be non-cached. Even though the network was 1Gbps.</p>

		<p>Might be OT, but hey, I need to get it of my chest:</p>
<p>You know what Obi-Wan said about Mos-Eisley? That exactly were my feelings when working with Visual SourceSafe. I love the Visual C++ compilers. I worked with 1.52, 6.0 and 2003 all the later. These are nice products. But I hate the guts of VSS. Am I glad that I have left it behind years ago.</p>

		<p>&quot;Like asking for sqlserver&#39;s internal file structure to be able to read data faster.&quot; Which might not be such a bad request under certain circumstances. E.G. A single user reader on its own copy is often faster than the database engine by an awful lot. Raymond here is emphasizing &quot;own copy&quot;.</p>

		<p>If it was a programmer which suggested this approach, I suspect *HE* is the one committing most bugs.</p>
<p>1: The files are probably locked by VSS.</p>
<p>2: If the files are not currently locked by VSS, VSS might need to lock them in order to write to them. Or else commits might FAIL.</p>
<p>3: Yes, you could use shadow copy (as backup softwares do), but who does that when the backup software already served you the files.</p>
<p>This is one of the most stupid requests I ever heard. Like asking for sqlserver&#39;s internal file structure to be able to read data faster.</p>
<p>If you want to pull these kind of tricks, the solution is to migrate to a better scm which saves its content in a more documented format. Lite tfs.</p>

		<p>How about NOT restoring the backup to a second instance?</p>
<p>Grabbing the data from the innards of the backup file would seem to meet all requirements &#8212; it doesn&#39;t interfere with the live server, and it doesn&#39;t require all that performance-killing interprocess communication and locking.</p>
<p>And, the backup format is likely to be much more stable than the live database format, since one expects to be able to use backup/restore when upgrading.</p>

		<p>The secondary benefit of Raymond&#39;s method is certainly not to be underestimated. We&#39;ve had clients where I work that had tons of backups, but not one of them was usable! You obviously don&#39;t have to test every backup, but it&#39;s probably a really good idea to at least test your big full annual ones.</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
