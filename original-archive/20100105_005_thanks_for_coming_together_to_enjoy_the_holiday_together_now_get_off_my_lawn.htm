<p>Due to a confluence of circumstances involving parents on an overseas vacation and other older relatives choosing not to attend (probably related to parents being out of town), I ended up being the oldest person at the extended family holiday dinner table.</p>
<p> This was a first for me, and I resisted the urge to shout "Get off my lawn!" to the assembled masses or to bore younger relatives with rambling pointless stories from my youth. </p>
<p> I guess this is the converse to a friend of mine who presided over a holiday family gathering at his house some years ago, and who realized that if seating at the dinner table were done strictly by age, he would have to sit at the children's table. </p>

		<p>&quot;or to bore younger relatives with rambling pointless stories from my youth.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that the person telling these stories never realizes that they&#8217;re rambling and pointless. So, if you told any stories, perhaps you should remove this bit :-D</p>

		<p>Isn&#8217;t rambling stories about Raymond&#8217;s youth the whole point of his blog ?</p>
<p>Ah, yes. There far from pointless ;)</p>

		<p>The last time I was at a family get together, the kids sat with the older adults, and the &quot;children&#8217;s table&quot; was people in their 20s through 40s.</p>

		<p>Every year my grandfather organizes a family get-together to remember my grandmother, it&#8217;s only for their children and grandchildren.</p>
<p>I have few young nephews and nieces on that side of the family, and they tend to sit with their parents. The &quot;children&#8217;s table&quot; tends to consist of the older grandchildren, which are in the range of 20-35 and their respective wives/husbands.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
