<p>
A customer wanted a program that auto-relaunched itself if it crashes,
or even is explicitly terminated by the user.
They were wondering if there was a way to register such a program
with the system.
Right now, they have a second program that monitors the first,
and if the first program crashes, then the second program relaunches it.
</p>
<p>
Well, if the program is a Windows service,
then they can
configure the recovery policy,
either
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/aa373653(v=vs.85).aspx">
programmatically</a>
or via the
user interface (on the <i>Recovery</i> tab).
</p>
<p>
But for regular interactive applications
(which is what this program was),
there is no such automatic functionality.
And since they wanted to make the program auto-restart even if the
user explicitly terminates it,
I suspect the purpose of the program is not so much to assist their users
but
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160505-00/?p=93415">
to monitor (and possibly harrass) them</a>.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day, all you can do is build taller and taller walls,
and the hostile users will buy taller and taller ladders.
In this case, the user could terminate the second program,
thereby taking out the monitor, and thus allowing them to
terminate the main program with impunity.
Or they could suspend the main program, so that it doesn't terminate
but doesn't do anything useful either.
If you add a heartbeat function, the users could attach a debugger to the program
and patch out the code that implements the undesirable behavior
and leaves just the heartbeat.
</p>
<p>
At this point, it's a matter of how hostile a user you want to
defend yourself against.</p>

		<p>Close, but if the application crashes the user is presented with a dialog and can elect not to restart the process.  Also, it won&#8217;t restart if the user explicitly terminates the process.</p>

		<p>Or you could create two programs, maybe calling them &#8220;Robin Hood&#8221; and &#8220;Friar Tuck&#8221;, which monitor each other and restart/resume their counterpart as necessary.[0]</p>
<p>Note that the originals were PoC hacks written, as a last resort, to force a vendor to patch a privilege-escalation vulnerability they&#8217;d sat on for months. OTOH, if that&#8217;s how you treat your regular users, I hope life is unfair to you right back.</p>

		<p>I wonder how Visual Studio manages to re-open itself after it crashes without asking. It&#8217;s particularly annoying when you tell it to Exit, it crashes while exiting, and then promptly restarts.</p>

		<p>I made an image with Windows XP Embedded for an automotive computer years ago, back in the SP1 days, and as I recall, you could register your own application as the shell instead of explorer.exe.<br />
This would among other things make Windows automatically start a new instance of your program in case the program ever crashed or was stopped in some way.<br />
That would be one way to do it I guess, but I suppose it qualifies as the ultimate example of a global solution for a local problem. :)</p>
<p>It was so long ago, but looking at the list in autoruns.exe, I think it was related to the values in this key in the Registry:<br />
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Winlogon</p>

		<p>Of course, the real way to do this is to run the application in question under an account they don&#8217;t have permission to kill processes in. Easiest way to do this is make it a service and make the user a non-administrator.</p>
<p>If the service needs user UI components, a separate app running user the user&#8217;s account can do this, just make sure the service works properly even if the app is killed .</p>

		<p>Swap the shell.<br />
Pretty much the only case where such behaviour is legitimate is a single-purpose kiosk.</p>
<p>In which case, swap the shell so it only does that single purpose.</p>
<p>And if this isn&#8217;t a single-purpose kiosk, you&#8217;re being user-hostile.</p>

		<p>In Windows 10, if you go into Task Manager and terminate Cortana, it immediately restarts. </p>
<p>So, the functionality that the customer is asking about exists and, in fact , is built into Windows 10.</p>

		<p>And if you kill Explorer, it restarts. Perhaps the developer should swap the shell.</p>

		<p>The Cortana process (SearchUI.exe) is probably protected by the Windows Search service or one of the other services.<br />
So the functionality is basically a Microsoft rolling their own situation like was mentioned in the post.</p>

		<p>But since it&#8217;s protected by a service, the user can disable the service. And if a third-party vendor wants a process to be protected, they can do that with a service.</p>

		<p>Because you can&#8217;t delete an executable while it&#8217;s in use by the system, but you can change its permissions?</p>
<p>Oooh, clever. That&#8217;s one of those interesting cases where you might be aware of those two facts independently, but not think to put them together in the context of this particular problem. Especially while you&#8217;re under the pressure of trying to fight the damn thing. I&#8217;ll file that one away for later use&#8230;</p>

		<p>Is pointing out the difference in cost of living regionalism?</p>
<p>There are plenty of programmers in India for the same BTC. There are plenty of programmers in the US who will do the same for a lot of BTC because the cost of living is higher and the risk is higher.</p>

		<p>Well, the fact is that I avoid using such terms because &#8220;白左&#8221; are way too sensitive to this, and that I do think sometime such saying hurts, but still I just take it (the situation such as this one) as a joke. In the meantime, I enjoy pretending to be over sensitive, i.e., I enjoy pretending to be a &#8220;白左&#8221; &#8212; it&#8217;s kind of sarcasm. I assume you would understand &#8220;白左&#8221; cuz the jargon has been reported by some media in the US haha.</p>

		<p>Just found this <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/4td55w/using_task_scheduler_to_restart_a_program_if_it/" rel="nofollow">https://www.reddit.com/r/windows/comments/4td55w/using_task_scheduler_to_restart_a_program_if_it/</a></p>
<p>Rather clever and I have not tried it. But the idea is that you use Task Scheduler to monitor the application error log and then restart the crashed application.</p>
<p>But per the question in that url my answer would be to fix or remove the plugin that causes the crash instead of restarting the app.</p>
<p>Crash loops are nasty, and you really do not want a situation where an app crashes is restarted and crashes again.<br />
Windows services let you set a limit to how many times a service should be restarted, not sure you can do that with this Task Scheduler trick though.</p>

		<p>Task Scheduler also has a RestartInterval and RestartCount option which you can use to restart a task which fails for any reason. I&#8217;m pretty sure that qualifies as &#8220;a way to register such a program with the system&#8221; ( <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa383518(v=vs.85)" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa383518(v=vs.85)</a>.aspx )</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
