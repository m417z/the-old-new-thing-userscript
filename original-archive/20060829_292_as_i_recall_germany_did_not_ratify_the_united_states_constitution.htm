<p>I remember reading a news report on a court case wherein the defendant claimed protection under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. An interesting angle, especially since the case was being tried in Germany under German law. I may be wrong, but it is my impression that Germany did not ratify the United States Constitution.</p>
<p> There's actually a point to this anecdote. Occasionally, when someone notes that Windows doesn't do one thing or another thing for legal reasons, people will post comments saying something like, "Well, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/03/22/558007.aspx#558480"> a German court</a> ruled <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/01/18/355177.aspx#357497"> that XYZ is legal</a>, so your reason is bogus." Or, "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/03/31/565878.aspx#566315">The case of <i>P&nbsp;vs.&nbsp;Q</i></a> established that XYZ does not apply, so that concern is irrelevant." Or more subtly, "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/03/22/558007.aspx#560235">It has been determined that DEF is allowed</a>." (Whose courts? Whose constitution? Is allowed where?) </p>
<p> You may not realize it, but Microsoft sells software throughout the world, and different parts of the world have different laws. What is legal in one country may not be legal in another, and Windows needs to conform to the intersection of all those laws. (On rare occasions, it will change its behavior based on what country you're in if that country's laws are significantly at odds with those of the rest of the world.) Claiming protection under the United States Constitution or citing a U.S. court decision doesn't carry much weight in front of a German judge. </p>

		<p>Why do business in countries that have laws you don&#8217;t like? &nbsp;You already have the monopoly on Windows and Office, so people will buy and import your products anyway. &nbsp;Punish the countries you don&#8217;t like by not providing any jobs for them, and making their people pay more to import software from outside.</p>

<p>Monoploy or no monopoly. I think that some markets are important enough for Microsoft to make them accomodate local laws.</p>

		<p>On the contrary, my dear oh. If you withdraw from a market and are lucky, people will pirate your software with a wink from the authorities. If you are unlucky, the authorities will enforce your copyright and encourage people to switch to Linux and OpenOffice &#8212; don&#8217;t let people&#8217;s loathing of change mask software utility. If you are very unlucky, the authorities will invalidate your copyright and print copies themselves.</p>
<p>Do not tussle with countries if you are not one yourself.</p>

		<p>In the UK it is probably illegal to rip CDs; there is no fair use law. We don&#8217;t want that bit turned on.</p>
<p>The EU interop laws often come up in discussion, and they are interesting. They say that you are allowed to do reverse engineering for hardware interop. Not software: hardware. They came from the Amdahl/IBM battles, when IBM owned the wire protocols for disk arrays and the like. It&#8217;s a lot harder than you think to use the law to justify the reverse engineering needed to make your middleware server work with COM+.</p>

		<p>As a side note to &quot;Ha Ha Ha&#8217;s&quot; 911 comment, it seems that many people is developing countries get their only lessons in law enforcement and the rights of the accused from watching reruns of old American TV shows, so if they are arrested, they expect/demand the same rights from their (generally dictatorial) government. &nbsp;As one pundit put it, &quot;&#8217;Starsky &amp; Hutch&#8217; may be the greatest motivator of social change in the world&quot;</p>

<p>This has been brought up a million times on Groklaw and gets shot down every time. &nbsp;Nearly all WTO countries are signatories to the Berne Convention and the TRIPS Agreement; if a country chose to ignore these treaties, they&#8217;d promptly be waist-high in trade sanctions &#8212; or they&#8217;d be ejected from the WTO.</p>
<p>(Taiwan is the classic case here &#8212; they&#8217;ve been running into problems with domestic enforcement of copyright, since they only became a WTO country a few years ago.)</p>

		<p>A corollary is that the German government is not elected by Americans, and so one should not expect it to act in their interests. And vice versa.</p>
<p>Also, the U.S. State Dept. Web site devotes a lot of words to pointing out that a U.S. embassy does not have the power to impose American law abroad. It&#8217;s surprising how many people go to a foreign country without any idea of what&#8217;s legal or illegal there.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d just like to chime in with a comment about common law. &nbsp;While it&#8217;s the case that a ruling made in Germany, for example, doesn&#8217;t automatically translate to the precedent set being valid in the United States, it is also the case that such a precedent, if based on analogous previous rulings and/or law in the United States, can be used as part of a defense. &nbsp;As such, many non-lawyers online will often argue that the precedent itself is sufficient basis to assume that a certain situation is legal/illegal as set forth in the precedent.</p>
<p>Now, obviously, lawyers are more inclined to be trepidous about such comments, especially if they believe it will be taken as legal advice. &nbsp;And certainly Germany, for example, and the United States clearly have enough laws that are different that it&#8217;s not as simple as taking some precedent from Germany and really assuming that the precedent is valid in the United States. &nbsp;So, I&#8217;d agree that it&#8217;s invalid to point at the precedent and act like it&#8217;s a given that it would stand in court. &nbsp;At the same time, without arguments to the contrary, precedents do provide at least a valid attempt to guess on what would be the probable outcome of a case. &nbsp;Obviously, it will be courts that finally decide on just what is valid.</p>

		<p>Wow, one of the comments was from me. Go me! No, I do see the point in general, but from an engineering standpoint I stand by my opinion. Figuring out the legal side is a job for the lawyers, I&#8217;ve heard Microsoft does employ a few ;-)</p>
<p>Steve Loughran: &quot;The EU interop laws often come up in discussion, and they are interesting. They say that you are allowed to do reverse engineering for hardware interop. Not software: hardware.&quot;</p>
<p>Not sure what you&#8217;re talking about, but Council Directive 91/250/EEC seems pretty clear to me (or as clear as legal texts can be to me&#8230;):<br />
<br />&quot;Article 6 Decompilation</p>
<p>1. The authorization of the rightholder shall not be required where reproduction of the code and translation of its form within the meaning of Article 4 (a) and (b) are indispensable to obtain the information necessary to achieve the interoperability of an independently created computer program with other programs, provided that the following conditions are met:<br />

<p>This happens all the time. Say that a company such as Apple has some product like iTunes and sells something like DRM&#8217;ed Music to the citizens of a country such as France, and France has some law requiring any company including Apple to do something (say share some DRM secrets with competition) in order to sell a DRM Music product in the country. Any company which violates this law can be fined some amount per infraction.</p>
<p>If you are an Executive at Apple, this would mean that you have a choice:<br />
<br />1) Pay a fine to continue violating the law (pass on the fine on to your consumers) or<br />
<br />2) Share the secret with the competition or<br />
<br />3) Stop selling Music in France or<br />
<br />4) Appeal to a court</p>
<p>All companies selling internationally (not just Apple and Microsoft) have these kinds of problems. Laws are laws. Corporations are not above the laws in any place they do business in. It&#8217;s a complicated world we live in.</p>

		<p>Most days it seems the U.S. didn&#8217;t ratify the U.S. constitution either. &nbsp;Also, living in a country that has a U.S.-written constitution, most days it seems that in every country that has a U.S.-written constitution it&#8217;s illegal to obey a U.S.-written constitution.</p>

		<p>&quot;HAHAHA&quot;, I think it has more to do with the fact that 911 is the standard emergency number of the GSM network</p>

		<p>KJK::Hyperion</p>
<p>GSM specifies 112 as the emergency number, because its the only one recommended by any independent standard (in this case, a standard propagated by the appropriate European standards body in the 1970s) and because it is used in more places than any other. A compliant GSM handset should route &#8216;112&#8217; to a suitable local emergency service (in most countries a central emergency services call center, in a few, the police) subject only to local legal restrictions (e.g. some jurisdictions require a valid SIM before placing any call no matter if its an emergency)</p>
<p>The 911 number seems to be selected only in North America and a few odd places where US telcos installed the infrastructure or had undue influence over its design. &nbsp;Because re-directs are easy to implement and American culture has been exported everywhere it probably works, but is undocumented, in several other countries, but it&#8217;s not part of the GSM standard.</p>

		<p>Nick, you are right. I was 99% sure that my phone (an old Motorola C115) only allowed dialing &quot;911&quot;, but it turns out it&#8217;s actually &quot;112&quot;. Curse my faulty memory</p>

		<p>Well, one of my comments is linked too!</p>
<p>In defense of what I said, I didn&#8217;t want to imply that since a germany court ruled that EULA weren&#8217;t binding, they were automatically not binding in my country (I noted, that well, I was in France, not Germany).<br />
<br />I thought that the german case was still interesting since it may be have been based on laws that have equivalent in other countries, and even on common sense (this item may be less &nbsp;spread).<br />
<br />Of course it was badly worded, but I wanted to imply that maybe they were not binding nearly everywhere but were only &quot;tried&quot; in Germany&#8230;<br /></p>

		<p>&quot;I remember reading a news report on a court case wherein the defendant claimed protection under the First Amendment of the United States Constitution. An interesting angle, especially since the case was being tried in Germany under German law. I may be wrong, but it is my impression that Germany did not ratify the United States Constitution.&quot;</p>
<p>No&#8230; They had ratified on their behalf (insert &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot; reference here about not mentioning The War) {cough} the German Basic Law.</p>
<p>The Basic Law&#8217;s provisions for freedom of speech and expression are more broad than the US Constitution&#8217;s:</p>
<p>&quot;Article 5 [Freedom of expression]</p>
<p>(1) Every person shall have the right freely to express and disseminate his opinions in speech, writing, and pictures and to inform himself without hindrance from generally accessible sources. Freedom of the press and freedom of reporting by means of broadcasts and films shall be guaranteed. There shall be no censorship.&quot;</p>
<p>So&#8230; Ah. &nbsp;Wait. &nbsp;You just said &quot;First Amendment.&quot; &nbsp;You didn&#8217;t say which clause. &nbsp;So it might have been the Establishment Clause, or Peaceful Assembly, or something else.</p>
<p>Still. &nbsp;The Basic Law, in general, is more sweeping than the US in its liberties. &nbsp;The Germans generally don&#8217;t push it as hard as a random bunch of Americans (and notably, American lawyers) would with the same wording, but&#8230;</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a link to the official English translation:</p>

<p>He wrote it in Russia, but then hosted it on US servers (hence subject to US law). If he&#8217;d been hosting child pornography or viruses on a server in the UK, would you object to the UK prosecuting him for it, regardless of Russian law on the matter?</p>

		<p>Through the Omnibus Anti-Crime Act, the US Congress has asserted worldwide jurisdiction of US law over any offense committed against US citizens or interests. &nbsp;The FBI is empowered to enter foreign countries illegally and arrest foreign citizens (possibly on their own soil) for violating US laws; such an action is called a &quot;rendition&quot;. &nbsp;They keep under wraps how many times we&#8217;ve actually done so, but it does happen. &nbsp;There&#8217;s a fair number of countries out there that are actively hostile to the US, not just annoyed like most US &quot;allies&quot;.</p>
<p>Now, most countries are very cooperative with the State Dept when a US citizen gets involved in something bad overseas. &nbsp;Just look at Central America, where countries execute thousands of their own people every year but Americans are untouchable by the govt and criminals are punished extremely harshly if they mess with Americans (if the local govt can find them, with the help of the FBI and/or bribes).</p>
<p>Look also at Aruba&#8217;s response to that American girl being kidnapped; there&#8217;s no way they respond like that to their own people disappearing, if they react at all. &nbsp;Why? &nbsp;Because if they didn&#8217;t cooperate, we&#8217;d hunt down the people responsible and bring them back without their help, and Aruba would have taken a huge PR hit.</p>

		<p>This has further ramifications when you look at web-based services such as Amazon&#8217;s S3 distributed storage system, which replicates data among data centres to ensure failsafe redundancy.</p>
<p>If they decide to install a data centre in the UK (more redundancy, less latency for Europeans), and they happen to replicate your data to that data centre, you are suddenly subject to UK law: for example, you may find yourself threatened with jail if you don&#8217;t release your encryption keys.</p>
<p>This kind of thing is a major problem for many Internet services and may throw us back onto having to use single, local servers for all sorts of purposes. I&#8217;ve written this up in more detail at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://cardbox.wordpress.com/2006/08/25/s3-in-business-11/" rel="nofollow">http://cardbox.wordpress.com/2006/08/25/s3-in-business-11/</a><br /></p>

		<p>Since one of the comments was a follow up to my &#8216;solution to the Samba problem&#8217; post &#8211;</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/03/31/565878.aspx#566266" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/03/31/565878.aspx#566266</a></p>
<p>I&#8217;d advise Microsoft to make any server signature check user configurable. Set the default to &quot;Automatically determine CIFS level&quot;. The user could select &quot;Use CIFS for all servers&quot; or &quot;Use CIFS+(tm) for all servers&quot;. Some countries might need a different default from others. If you get it wrong and a court forces you, change the default with Windows Update on machines that are in that locale, or globally if that is impossible.</p>
<p>Actually, you could also use Windows Update to revoke keys, which leads to some interesting possibilities for bug handling. A buggy server with code in Rom could be handled by having it&#8217;s CIFS+ key revoked on updated clients for example, so it would be only accessed in CIFS mode from that point on. Conversely, new server OSs or updated binaries with bug fixes could have their keys sent out to clients so they would be used in CIFS+ mode again.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
