		<p>Same as with the Dell Laptop disclaimer when you start it for the first time. &#8211; at least, it was with the Latitude D410 some years ago. I don&#8217;t know if newer ones have the same:</p>
<p>There was a legal disclaimer you had to acknowledge. I did not acknowledge the first time, as I did not have the time to read everything. Thus, I switch off the Dell instead.</p>
<p>On next boot, I did not see the disclaimer anymore.</p>
<p>Thus, I never accepted it, right?</p>

		<p>As described in &quot;The Agreeable Cat&quot;, you simply need to construct a device to enable your pets to agree to accept all EULA type agreements.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m sure you could find a way to get the cat to pull that sticker off the Heelys. Catnip, perhaps?</p>

		<p>Older versions of Windows (and many computer games) also had a similar problem. A EULA sticker (you break it, you agree) was placed on the CD case in a manner that would force you to break it in order to get at the contents. Unfortunately, no one ever thought that a user might simply take the CD cover off of its hinges and open it from the other side.</p>
<p>oops.</p>

		<p>PaulCam:</p>
<p>At least, for Germany, this is not really a problem: A license agreement you see only after you have already purchased the item would not stand in court. You must know everything before you buy it, or the license is void.</p>
<p>Note that you must not return the item if you do not want to accept the license: Just use the item as if this agreement was not there in the first place.</p>
<p>Simple, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

		<p>That is why companies also put their EULAs and terms of use online.</p>
<p>Dutch courtrulings consider this to be an acceptable alternative.</p>

		<p>@alt-92:</p>
<p>In Germany, most lawyers do not consider this an acceptable alternative. Everything that gets part of a contract must be known to both parties in advance. If the customer has to lookup a web site (how can he if he wants to buy his first PC?), this is not enough. The seller must tell him before the contract is made.</p>
<p>Note, however, that there is one difference: If you get the EULA before downloading something, this is acceptable. Thus, for example, MS giving its security updates and presenting an EULA, this EULA is considered valid.</p>
<p>It is not very easy. However, the fine print: Shrink-wrapped EULA are not enforcible in Germany.</p>

		<p>Yes well, just because they wrote it on a sticker doesn&#8217;t make it so. Turns out, that just declaring something loudly doesn&#8217;t make it hold up in court.</p>
<p>Heck even things that get signed don&#8217;t always hold. I can remember back in the 90s a few people I knew getting non-competes thrown out because they basically prevented the person from working in the industry at all.</p>
<p>Lesson: &quot;An agreement has to be legal to be valid.&quot;</p>

		<p>In most cases, as far as I know, at least in Europe, any agreement absolving a manufacturer of responsibility when their lethal product injures people is very dubious.</p>

		<p>So in Europe people aren&#8217;t allowed to freely choose to take risks? Because if the alternative is that the product cannot be sold at all (because no-one is willing to sell it), that&#8217;s essentially what it becomes.</p>

		<p>The whole thing is silly anyway. &nbsp;If it ever comes up, all you have to say is &quot;Yellow sticker? &nbsp;Mine didn&#8217;t have one. &nbsp;Someone must have fallen asleep at the factory. &nbsp;Or maybe they were returned without it.&quot; &nbsp;Good luck to them trying to prove you wrong.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
