		<p>Maybe everyone knows this allready and I&#8217;m answering a non-question?</p>
<p>Ground coffee is actually one of the best smell neutralizers that you can get. I’m not exactly sure why this is so though. </p>
<p>If you want to de-odorize your fridge, you can leave some ground coffee in there overnight and it will do a very good job of taking away the bad smell. This even works for those really hard-to-get-rid-of smells like, bad meat etc</p>
<p>I don’t know if you Americans get to see the two old ladies of How Clean Is Your House on BBC Prime, but I picked this up from them…<br /></p>

		<p>Aromatic tobacco will do the same thing. And, of course, baking soda.</p>

		<p>Of course the assumption with both coffee and aromatic tobacco is that you like the smell of either more than the smells of which you are trying to rid yourself.  Not particularly liking either, I prefer the baking soda as it is much closer to odorless.</p>

		<p>And yes, how could we forgotten the sliced lemon. It does a good job on removing the smells in the fridge, too. :)</p>

		<p>Josh,</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve tried using coffee this way, you&#8217;ll know that after we&#8217;ve boiled the coffee bag again and again, the oder of coffee will be dilute enough so you could hardly smell it unless you come really close to it.</p>
<p>Actually I wonder if boiled teabags won&#8217;t get mold so quickly, it&#8217;ll be good candidate for this job too.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s use is to absorb oder but not to use stronger oder to cover it. :)</p>

		<p>You just have to make sure not to use the baking soda and the sliced lemon at the same time otherwise you&#8217;ll get a gooey, bubbly mess in your fridge :)</p>

		<p>I asked a flight attendant about this years ago, and she said that it was for absorbing odors.  She also assured me that the coffee packet (the one I saw had not been used to make coffee yet) would not be used later to make coffee.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
