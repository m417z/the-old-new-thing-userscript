<p>Oh wait, there's also <code>ChildWindowFromPointEx</code>.</p>
<p> There are many ways of identifying the window that appears beneath a point. The documentation for each one describes how they work, but I figured I'd do a little compare/contrast to help you decide which one you want for your particular programming problem. </p>
<p> The oldest functions are <code>WindowFromPoint</code> and <code>ChildWindowFromPoint</code>. The primary difference between them is that <code>WindowFromPoint</code> returns the deepest window beneath the point, whereas <code>ChildWindowFromPoint</code> returns the shallowest. </p>
<p> What do I mean by deep and shallow? </p>
<p> Suppose you have a top-level window&nbsp;P and a child window&nbsp;C. And suppose you ask one of the above functions, "What window is beneath this point?" when the point is squarely over window&nbsp;C. The <code>WindowFromPoint</code> function looks for the most heavily nested window that contains the point, which is window&nbsp;C. On the other hand <code>ChildWindowFromPoint</code> function looks for the least nested window that contains the point, which is window&nbsp;P, assuming you passed <code>GetDesktopWindow</code> as the starting point. </p>
<p> That's the most important difference between the two functions, but there are others, primarily with how the functions treat hidden, disabled, and transparent windows. Some functions will pay attention to hidden, disabled, and/or transparent windows; others will skip them. Note that when a window is skipped, the entire window hierarchy starting from that window is skipped. For example, if you call a function that skips disabled windows, then all children of disabled windows will also be skipped (even if the children are enabled). </p>
<p> Here we go in tabular form. </p>
<table border="1" style="border-collapse: collapse" bordercolor="black" cellpadding="3">

<p> The return values for the various <code>...FromPoint...</code> functions are the same: </p>
<ul>
<li>Return the handle of the found window, if a window was found. </li>
<li>Return the handle of the parent window     if the point is inside the parent window but not inside     any of the children.     (This rule obviously does not apply to <code>WindowFromPoint</code>     since there is no parent window passed into the function.) </li>
<li>Otherwise, return <code>NULL</code>. </li>
</ul>
<p> The entries for <code>ChildWindowFromPointEx</code> are marked <i>Optional</i> because you, the caller, get to specify whether you want them to be skipped or included based on the <code>CWP_*</code> flags that you pass in. </p>
<p> &sup1;There is a lot hiding behind the word <i>Transparent</i> because there are multiple ways a window can be determined transparent. The <code>...ChildWindowFromPoint...</code> functions define transparent as <i>has the <code>WS_EX_TRANSPARENT</code> extended window style</i>. </p>
<p> &sup2;On the other hand, <code>WindowFromPoint</code> defines transparent as <i>returns <code>HTTRANSPARENT</code> in response to <code>WM_NCHITTEST</code></i>. Actually, that's still not true. If the window belongs to a <strike>process</strike> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/12/30/10110077.aspx#10110646">thread</a> different from the one calling <code>WindowFromPoint</code>, then <code>WindowFromPoint</code> will not send the message and will simply treat the window as opaque (<i>i.e.</i>, not transparent). </p>
<p> &sup3;The <code>RealChildWindowFromPoint</code> includes transparent windows in the search, but <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/12/10036953.aspx#10037230"> has a special case for group boxes</a>: The <code>RealChildWindowFromPoint</code> function skips over group boxes, <i>unless</i> the return value would have been the parent window, in which case it returns the group box after all. </p>
<p> Why is <code>RealChildWindowFromPoint</code> so indecisive? </p>
<p> The <code>RealChildWindowFromPoint</code> function was added as part of the changes to Windows to support accessibility. The intended audience for <code>RealChildWindowFromPoint</code> is accessibility tools which want to return a "reasonable" window beneath a specific point. Since group boxes usually enclose other controls, <code>RealChildWindowFromPoint</code> prefers to return one of the enclosed controls, but if the point belongs to the group box frame, then it'll return the group box. </p>
<p> One place I see confusion over the various <code>...WindowFromPoint...</code> functions is code which uses one of the functions, and then massages the result, unaware that there is already a function that returns the pre-massaged result for you. For example, I've seen code which calls <code>WindowFromPoint</code> followed by <code>GetAncestor(GA_ROOT)</code>. This does a pointless down-and-up traversal of the window tree, searching for the deepest window that lies beneath the specified point, then walking back up the tree to convert it to a shallow window. This is the Rube Goldberg way of calling <code>ChildWindowFromPointEx(GetDesktopWindow(), ...)</code>. </p>
<p> Next time, a look at the mysterious <code>RealGetWindowClass</code> function. What makes this function more real? </p>

		<p>I wanted to make a screenshot tool that would overlay the screen with a screenshot of the screen, then draw outlines as you moved over each desktop window then crop the screenshot to that window when you clicked.</p>
<p>It worked great, except that WindowFromPoint (or Child*, or whatever I was using) ended up always, correctly, returning the overlay window covering the desktop. &nbsp;D&#39;oh!</p>
<p>Ended up having to EnumDesktopWindows, creating an array of window bounds, and walking through this array on every mouse move to figure out which rectangle to draw based on mouse location. &nbsp;It works, but I&#39;m wondering now if there was an easier solution.</p>

		<p>Now that I think about it, I might have used WindowFromPoint, and then used GetAncestor or a related API call when I realized it didn&#39;t just work on top level windows. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t know about ChildWindowFromPoint&#8230; anyways very useful compare and contrast of all the functions, thanks!</p>

		<p>The &quot;It&#39;s Complicated&quot; link is funny because the Facebook status is the first thing I thought about when I saw the heading in the table. The linked-to article is from May of 2009, yet is already out of date because it doesn&#39;t mention Widowed, Separated, or Divorced as options. I guess those would fall under either Single or It&#39;s Complicated back then.</p>
<p>Honestly, I didn&#39;t even realize those new options existed until I saw an old classmate&#39;s status set to Widowed one day. When I noticed that his profile picture had just changed to a newborn baby, it was probably the saddest thing I&#39;ve ever seen on Facebook.</p>

		<p>&quot;The WindowFromPoint function looks for the most heavily nested window that contains the point, which is window C. On the other hand ChildWindowFromPoint function looks for the least nested window that contains the point, which is window P&quot;</p>
<p>Huh? &nbsp;So, the function with the name &quot;Child&quot; in it retrieves the parent window P, and the function without the name &quot;Child&quot; in it retrieves the child window C?</p>

		<p>The child function (if I recall correctly) has a parameter for specifying the parent window, while the basic version does not. Looking at the full signatures makes it more obvious.</p>

		<p>&quot;The information is already in MSDN. All I did was organize it into a table,..&quot;</p>
<p>Well, here&#39;s what the MSDN library has to say about WindowFromPoint:</p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>The return value is a handle to the window that contains the point. If no window exists at the given point, the return value is NULL. If the point is over a static text control, the return value is a handle to the window under the static text control.</p>
<p>The WindowFromPoint function does not retrieve a handle to a hidden or disabled window, even if the point is within the window. An application should use the ChildWindowFromPoint function for a nonrestrictive search. </p>
<p>~~~</p>
<p>While it coincides with what you said about disabled and hidden windows, it has nothing about HTTRANSPARENT or different processes.</p>

		<p>@Roastbeef</p>
<p>The problem is, the MSDN is just a documentation source for each individual function. So usually the MSDN would just describe each function and not make a comparison to another one unless there was a good reason.</p>
<p>I suppose they could add a new page to the about windowing or using windowing section which lists the differences, but the individual functions explain precisely how each function works so the information is already there to start with. So this added section would not provide anything which isn&#39;t already in the documentation.</p>
<p>One of the tough parts about the MSDN is getting the information you want/need out of the mountain of information it gives you. That can be tough at times.</p>

		<p>&quot;Rename the windows. Desktop = P, top-level window = C1, child window = C2. Does it make more sense now?&quot;</p>
<p>I suppose. If I now understand correctly, the &quot;Child&hellip;&quot; function returns the _immediate_ qualifying child. The non-&quot;Child&hellip;&quot; function also return a child window, but searches for the qualifying child farthest from the root of the window-ownership tree.</p>
<p>In other words, both functions actually could have been named &quot;&lt;Something&gt;ChildWindowFromPoint&quot;. Like, &quot;ImmediateChildWindowFromPoint&quot; and &quot;FurthestRemovedChildWindowFromPoint&quot;. &nbsp;Granted, those names are a bit wordy. &nbsp;:) &nbsp;But they would have had better mnemonic value.</p>

		<p>Hrm.</p>
<p>If we make a simplifying assumption that child windows are smaller (or equal in size to) the parent window, WindowFromPoint returns the smallest window that contains the point. ChildWindowFromPoint takes in a parent window, and returns the largest child window OF THAT PARENT that encloses the point. In WFP, if the point ends up on the desktop window, it returns NULL. In CWFP, if the point is outside of the passed parent window OR the parent window, it returns NULL.</p>
<p>Basically, WFP gives you the window handle of what&#39;s there under the mouse. CWFP returns the immediate child of the passed in window that contains the point in question &#8211; here, &quot;child&quot; refers to the fact that it returns an immediate child of the parent window ONLY, and not grand children or great-grand-children or deeper.</p>
<p>So if we created windows like:</p>
<p>Desktop (always there)</p>
<p>WindowMyApp (main app window)</p>
<p>DialogMyApp (a dialog your app created)</p>
<p>ButtonMyApp (a button in the dialog of your app)</p>
<p>and click within ButtonMyApp, WFP will return ButtonMyApp. CWFP will return any, depending on the window handle passed in. If you passed in GetDesktopWindow(), you will get WindowMyApp. If you passed in WindowMyApp, you get DialogMyApp. If you passed in DialogMyApp, you get back ButtonMyApp.</p>
<p>Whew. I think that will clarify what &quot;child&quot; means.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Well, mostly correct. Child windows can be larger than parents (they will be clipped); your simplification fails to handle the case where the point is outside any children but is inside the parent; and in your sample window hierarchy, the dialog box is not a child window; it&#39;s an owned window. -Raymond</i>]</div>

<p>[quote]On the other hand, WindowFromPoint defines transparent as returns HTTRANSPARENT in response to WM_NCHITTEST. Actually, that&#39;s still not true. If the window belongs to a process different from the one calling WindowFromPoint, then WindowFromPoint will not send the message and will simply treat the window as opaque (i.e., not transparent).[/quote]</p>
<p>Raymond, it is not necessarily &#8211; &quot;PROCESS different from the one calling WindowFromPoint&quot;. </p>
<p>Just &#8211; different THREAD.</p>
<p>Here is my old little demo just on the topic &quot;&#8230;WindowFromPoint&#8230;&quot;: </p>

		<p>So, it turns out I ended up rolling my own loop that recursed through the visible children finding the most deeply nested child that contained the point, but, unless nothing else was available, excluding child windows without the clip siblings style, presumably to ignore group boxes, since they preceded their groups in the window order.</p>
<p>And yes, the code is as unreadable as the above sentence.</p>

		<p>Oh, and the reason I didn&#39;t have to worry about my overlay window because this was Windows 3.0 and you could do silly stuff such as setting the capture to an invisible window and drawing on the desktop&#39;s window DC (as opposed to the desktop window&#39;s DC, of course).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
