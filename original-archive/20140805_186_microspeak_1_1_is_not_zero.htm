<p>In his reddit AMA, <a href="http://seattletimes.com/html/pacificnw/2008177548_pacificpendgame14.html"> Joe Belfiore</a> <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/windowsphone/comments/24jtcy/hi_im_joe_belfiore_from_the_windows_phone_team_ama/ch7vtqx%22"> wrote</a></p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> i have regular 1-1 meetings with my counterparts in Office, Skype, Xbox. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The little bit of jargon there is <i>1-1 meeting</i>. This is an abbreviation for <i>one-on-one meeting</i>, a common business practice wherein two people, typically <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/work-in-progress/2013/11/11/the-secret-to-effective-one-on-one-meetings-with-direct-reports/"> a manager and a direct report</a>, have a face-to-face meeting with no one else present. In the case Joe used, the meeting is not between a manager and a direct report but between two peers. </p>
<p> The term is also abbreviated <i>1:1</i>, which like <i>1 &minus; 1</i> also looks like a bit of mathematical nonsense. But it's not zero or one. It's just an abbreviation for business jargon. </p>
<p> Of course, Microspeak isn't happy with the abbreviation as-is. Microspeak takes it further and nounifies the abbreviation. "I'll bring that up in my 1&ndash;1 with Bob tomorrow" means "I'll bring that up in my one-on-one meeting with Bob tomorrow." </p>
<p> Note that the abbreviation <i>OOO</i> is not used to mean <i>one-on-one</i>. That abbreviation is used to mean <i>Out of the office</i>, although it is more commonly abbreviated <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/kclemson/archive/2003/09/25/53795.aspx"> OOF</a> at Microsoft. </p>

		<p>&quot;typically a manager and a direct report&quot;</p>
<p>The fledgling meeting notation can be extended to clarify this:</p>
<p>1 &gt; 1: A manager initiates a meeting with a direct report.</p>
<p>1 &gt;&gt; 1: A manager initiates a meeting with a report two levels down (more &gt;s would be added for further levels).</p>
<p>1 &lt; 1, 1 &lt;&lt; 1: As above, but the report initiates the meeting.</p>
<p>Different numbers can be used on either side for varying counts of people.</p>

		<p>Yes, although I&#39;d make a normative intervention here and specify that 1 : 1 shall designate a meeting among exact peers, whereas 1 − 1 shall leave the relationship undefined (could be 1 : 1, 1 &gt; 1, 1 &gt;&gt; 1 &#8230;)</p>

		<p>@ Boris</p>
<p>121 was deprecated in SP2 of XP. &nbsp;Although if you search for the right quid in the registry, one can set a value to 1 in order to re-enable it. &nbsp;It&#39;s a backwards compatibility hack.</p>

		<p>But I have conversations with my manager that are not &#39;one on one&#39;.</p>
<p>My local-culture use of &#39;one on one&#39; is that it&#39;s not just me and him talking, but it is specifically the regular weekly meeting we have with just the two of us present when the subject matter is &#39;me, what I have been doing, what he wants me to be thinking about next, and stuff I should know about&#39;.</p>

<p>&quot;I have my weekly AMs tomorrow starting at 1:00 and I am planning a 3:00 level set about the cadence afterward. Could you just get me the net-net of the brownbag? We can touch base at 4:00.&quot;</p>

		<p>@luceo: &quot;English has a word for this already without the useless corporate jargon. It&#39;s called a conversation.&quot;</p>
<p>Um, no.</p>
<p>I would define a &quot;one-on-one meeting&quot; as a discussion between two employees (I&#39;d say manager &amp; underling, but that may be biased by my workplace) concerning something about the employees&#39; work, workplace, performance, etc.</p>
<p>A &quot;conversation&quot; is multiple people having a coherent discussion about something.</p>
<p>A conversation is neither necessarily two people, meaning it misses out on the &quot;one-on-one&quot; part of &quot;one-on-one meeting&quot;, nor does it have any connotation whatsoever of being work related (even if you know the people involved are coworkers), so it misses out on the &quot;meeting&quot; part of &quot;one-on-one meeting&quot;.</p>
<p>Yes, there are sometimes words that are hard to discern differences between. (I&#39;d say actually &quot;conversation&quot; and &quot;discussion&quot; are largely in this basket, though &quot;discussion&quot; to be does sound slightly more directed and/or serious.) &quot;Meeting&quot; and &quot;conversation&quot; though are not such a pair.</p>

		<p>now I need to know what an AMA is. Besides the latin imperative I of &quot;amo&quot;&#8230;</p>
<p>For meetings between two people and two people only, mostly with a &quot;secret&quot; background, in german there&#39;s the term &quot;Vier-Augen-Gespräch&quot; (talk between four eyes). Vier-Augen-Gespäche can be e.g between politicians or between bosses telling the subordinates that some part of their behaviour is unacceptable, but without doing so with everybody listening in and mostly without (detailed) &quot;paper trail&quot;. Is there something similar (especially the &quot;nobody outside needs to know what was talked about exactly&quot; connotation) in english, or is the 1-1 it?</p>

		<p>And then how is this verbalised? </p>
<p>In the example Raymond gives of &quot;I&#39;ll bring that up in my 1–1 with Bob tomorrow&quot; is the verbal sound &#39;one to one&#39;, &#39;one dash one&#39;, &#39;one one&#39; &#8230; ? </p>

		<p>Why use such ambiguous notation? Out of Office can be easily expressed as e[r(1) ~ 1], which means that the absent coworker _proposes_ (hence the wobbly line) an electronic discussion upon their return.</p>

		<p>So when they conduct a 1:1 with Skype, do they use Skype to do it?</p>
<p>What about Lync, do they do 1:1 using Lync?</p>
<p>I&#39;m just kidding &#8212; of course. &nbsp;However, they use that jargon here (well outside of Microsoft&#39;s empire) as well, but are flexible about the 1:1 part. &nbsp;If someone tells us they need a 1:1, usually that means at least 8 people will actually attend the meeting. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But it would be really funny for the Word guys to hold their meetings using the Word 2013 collaboration feature on OneDrive, and just type to each other in the Word document. &nbsp;I mean wouldn&#39;t that make design walkthroughs fun?</p>
<p>Bob&gt; &quot;Hey, here&#39;s my &#8212; hey don&#39;t touch that paragraph&quot;</p>

		<p>Well, 1:1 isn&#39;t exactly mathematical nonsense, since &#39;:&#39; is used to denote a relation, exactly what&#39;s ment here, isn&#39;t it. At least in Europe it&#39;s used that way (if at all).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
