The documentation for the
<code>Smbios&shy;Information</code> class</a>
says
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
The
SerialNumber
property securely retrieves the serial number from the SMBIOS for the system.
This property is partial trust, so in a UWP app,
you must specify the app in the system's metadata before retrieving any properties.
</p>
<p>
OEMs use the SerialNumber property to aid in identification of devices
for servicing and troubleshooting operations.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What does it mean when it says that "you must specify
the app in the system's metadata"?
How do you do that?
</p>
<p>
The "you" in that sentence is not talking to you,
the software developer.
It's talking to "you" the system manufacturer.
</p>
<p>
When system manufacturers set up a system,
they can specify which
apps are permitted to read the serial number.
The expectation is that the manufacturers will grant
permission to their customer support apps.
(That's what the second paragraph is trying to say.)
</p>
<p>
For example, if they have an app that provides online help,
they can grant that app permission to read your serial number
so the app can use it to filter the help results to those
that apply to the system you have.
System manufacturers are notorious for
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20090402-00/?p=18643">
constantly changing suppliers</a>,
so just knowing the model number isn't always enough to narrow down
exactly what hardware is in the system.
</p>
<p>
What this means for you, the average software developer,
is that unless you've cut a deal with the system manufacturer,
your UWP app won't be able to read the serial number.
</p>
<p>
Sorry.
</p>
<p>
If you want something that can be used from a UWP app to identify the system,
you can use the
<code>System&shy;Identification</code> class.
The <code>Get&shy;System&shy;Id&shy;For&shy;Publisher</code>
gives you an opaque ID that will be the same for all apps
on the system from the same publisher.
See
<a HREF="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.system.profile.systemidentification">
the documentation</a>
for additional details on how well this value survives
reinstalls.</p>

		<p>That makes sense from a security point of view (random apps shouldn&#8217;t be able to reach so far into my PC to find an identifier that specifies &#8220;Brians PC&#8221;).  However, the docs do not describe the situation well at all.  I&#8217;m assuming (/hoping) you have filed a doc bug on this.</p>

		<p>Any doc that refers to &#8216;you&#8217; should be changed to specify exactly who this applies to. Otherwise it means &#8216;the person reading the doc&#8217; which could be anyone.</p>

		<p>I hate reading the &#8220;contact your administrator&#8221; message in documentation &#8211; it&#8217;s understandable in error messages generated by the software though. </p>
<p>Often I am the administrator, so a page for MS Exchange, where no user would be reading unless they were the admin, just raises frustration levels when I get that unhelpful advice</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not that hard to write good documentation, but it seems like developers are writing documentation &#8212; when it should be usability-trained people instead.  Or else, Raymond should write ALL documentation for all products.</p>
<p>So much of the doc is so insider-specific as to be almost useless for others.</p>

		<p>Sometimes those &#8220;usability-trained people&#8221; don&#8217;t have clue on the topic of documentation, so you get documentation that looks like the stub generated by JavaDoc &#8211; no particular value to the developers who needs it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Usability-train developers&#8221; would be way better, but that would be costly. Probably just need to hire some technical editor to point out where needs clarification when the draft of documentation is written.</p>

		<p>Does this mean that the whole recent series is moot, if &#8220;the average software developer, [&#8230;] unless you&#8217;ve cut a deal with the system manufacturer, your UWP app won&#8217;t be able to read the serial number&#8221;?</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t believe so.  This is about how a normal UWP app doesn&#8217;t run with enough trust to access the SmbiosÂ­Information.  The sample code in the series has been about desktop apps accessing UWP-exposed information.  Desktop apps generally run with full trust.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
