<p>When I was considering with some friends what I could be for Hallowe'en this year, one of the ideas that emerged in a fit of brainstorming was "<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger's_cat">Schr&ouml;dinger's cat</a>".</p>
<p> To dress up as Schr&ouml;dinger's cat, or more accurately, the Schr&ouml;dinger cat thought experiment, you just need a cardboard box and a heavy marker. Use the marker to write "Contents: Schr&ouml;dinger's cat. Warning: Do not observe." If you really want to get fancy, you can stick a cat doll inside the box to satisfy the people who ignore the warning. (Then you can scold them for collapsing the wave function.) Leave it ambiguous as to whether the cat is alive or dead. </p>
<p> As part of the brainstorming, I also blurted out the costume "Schr&ouml;dinger's catbox". I have no idea what that would be, though. It just sounded surreal. </p>
<p> Ultimately, I decided that a cardboard box was simply too cheesy, so I dusted off my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/26/55449.aspx"> Nobel Peace Prize</a> costume, which I wore this past weekend to a pumpkin-carving party. </p>

		<p>That reminds me of a friend&#8217;s (coincidentally also named Tom) halloween costume. &nbsp;He dresed up in a burlap sack with back side painted white and the front side unpainted. &nbsp;He carried a box of Frosted Mini Wheats with him, which he would eat from at various intervals during the night. &nbsp;Nobody got his costume. &nbsp;Some became even more perplexed when he claimed he was a cannibal.</p>

		<p>Presumably the &quot;Schr&#246;dinger&#8217;s catbox&quot; is some sort of litter tray. If you could come up with one which you were never sure had been used you&#8217;d be onto a winner (somehow just putting it around a corner doesn&#8217;t seem to work, one can still smell that it has been used).</p>

		<p>In college, a bunch of us made up T-shirts with an entry from the periodic table on the front (so you were an &quot;atom&quot;) and then went around as molecules by moving together in the right configurations&#8230; :)</p>

		<p>I always envisioned a T-shirt that showed a large truck speeding away from a crushed box with a tire tread through the center and the caption: &quot;Schr&#246;dinger&#8217;s Cat is DEAD!&quot; &nbsp;True geek humor. &nbsp;I stopped telling people about it because I kept having to stop and explain exactly what Schr&#246;dinger&#8217;s Cat was and why it was such an important concept.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
