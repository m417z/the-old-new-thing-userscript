<p> A thank-you to commenter <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/03/9392203.aspx#9399628">Greg</a> for pointing it out that the Seattle Symphony made changes to their UBS Masterworks 13 series after the brochures were printed. I compared my printed brochure against <a href="http://www.seattlesymphony.org/_dwn/0910_Main%20Season.pdf"> the online one</a> and updated <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/03/9392203.aspx"> the 2009/2010 Seattle Symphony subscription season at a glance</a> accordingly. They deleted five concerts and added six, so the Masterworks 13 series actually has 14 concerts. They probably kept the name for backward compatibility.</p>

		<p>I hate to break this to you Raymond but not everybody is as committed to backwards compatibility as you are&#8230;</p>

		<p>Actually, &quot;backwards compatibility&quot; is a good reason.</p>
<p>Say you have the brochure, and didn;t realize they changed the packages around. You go tp]o the booth and ask for &quot;Masterworks 13 package&quot;, like the brochure says. If the clerk says no, it&#8217;s Masterworks 14, then some people get snippy or snarky, thinking someone&#8217;s pulling the old bait-and-switch.</p>
<p>Rather than waste time with arguments on how the brochure is outdated, and the price is the same, blah blah blah, the organizers feel it&#8217;s just easier to call it what people expect.</p>

		<p>&quot;it&#8217;s just easier to call it what people expect.&quot;</p>
<p>and then switch :)</p>
<p>Whatever the package name, if the content has changed then the clerks should really take the time to detail what did change.</p>
<p>The package naming is accessory, and can be explained by already printed cards etc. People won&#8217;t care about *that*.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
