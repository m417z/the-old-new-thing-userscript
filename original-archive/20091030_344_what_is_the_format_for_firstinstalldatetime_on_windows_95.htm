<p>Public Service Announcement: Daylight Saving Time ends in most parts of the United States this weekend.</p>
<p> Windows&nbsp;98/98/Me recorded the date and time at which Setup was run in the registry under <nobr><code>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\<wbr>Software\<wbr>Microsoft\<wbr>Windows\<wbr>CurrentVersion</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></code></nobr> as a binary value named <code>FirstInstallDateTime</code>. What is the format of this data? </p>
<p> Take the binary value and treat it as a 32-bit little-endian value. The format of the value is basically <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/05/54806.aspx"> DOS date/time format</a>, except that the seconds are always 0 or 1 (usually 1), due to a programming error. </p>
<p> Exercise: What error would result in the seconds always being 0 or 1 (usually 1)? </p>

		<p>Ok, let&#8217;s start with correct code to compute the DOS date/time value:</p>
<p>dwDosTime = ((dwYear &amp; 0x7F) &lt;&lt; 25) | ((dwMonth &amp; 0x0F) &lt;&lt; 21) | ((dwDay &amp; 0x1F) &lt;&lt; 16) | ((dwHours &amp; 0x1F) &lt;&lt; 11) | ((dwMinutes &amp; 0x3F) &lt;&lt; 5) | ((dwSeconds &gt;&gt; 1) &amp; 0x1F);</p>
<p>dwSeconds is right-shifted by one bit to divide it by two. If you mess up by typing &#8220;&gt;&#8221; instead of &#8220;&gt;&gt;&#8221;, you&#8217;ll be testing whether dwSeconds is greater than 1 instead, which will be true (evaluate to 1) for most values of dwSeconds.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>We have a winner! Congratulations. -Raymond</i>]</div>
<p>Another possible error is the one I mentioned earlier: typing &#8220;&amp;&amp;&#8221; instead of &#8220;&amp;&#8221;. However, this seems less likely, assuming the programmer knows what they&#8217;re doing (which they do if they got the rest of the expression right) &#8211; it&#8217;s an excessive keystroke, as opposed to a missed one.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>The doubled-ampersand is less likely because the ampersand isn&#8217;t needed at all, since you know that for example the month is always at most 12: <code>dwDosTime = (dwYear &lt;&lt; 25) | (dwMonth &lt;&lt; 21) | (dwDay &lt;&lt; 16) | (dwHours &lt;&lt; 11) | (dwMinutes &lt;&lt; 5) | (dwSeconds &gt;&gt; 1);</code> -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>&gt; the month is always at most 12</p>
<p>unless it isn&#8217;t. I would be quite cautious in what is bit-masked to the timestamp. If something goes wrong and you receive a garbage instead of minutes, it messes up the whole value.</p>

		<p>I haven&#8217;t installed Windows in a while but I seem to recall at least some OS installers asking what time it is. &nbsp;If that is the case, then it&#8217;s likely that the time input doesn&#8217;t have a seconds spot &#8211; I don&#8217;t know anyone who cares down to the second when setting the time.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not a programming error, really, is it.</p>
<p>&#8230;with 0 or 1, uh, heck. &nbsp;Well if you&#8217;ve got your timestamps going with, say, milliseconds since epoch or something (fp unix or win32 time), I&#8217;d say they did round(time % 60, 1) / 60 or something silly like that. &nbsp;For high second counts it&#8217;ll give you 1.</p>

		<p>@640k: Why, when reading a description of a bug last manifested in software released almost ten years ago, that was so inconsequential that none of the millions of Windows users ever noticed it OR were affected by it in any way, do you immediately jump to conclusion that it&#8217;s a Microsoft management conspiracy?</p>
<p>Is that *really* the most likely explanation for the bug Raymond described, given that Raymond (a Microsoft developer) is the one describing this bug to you in the first place?</p>

		<p>&quot;The real error is using a language with absurd C syntax&quot;</p>
<p>That is why Real Men program in C.</p>
<p>@Lawrence, a smart developer would ask whether the bug is in a shared function (I guess Raymond would have said so if that were the case), and whether the buggy source code has been cut-n-pasted elsewhere (which I don&#8217;t expect Raymond to know.)</p>
<p>So, yes, a 10-year old bugs do matter, even though I agree in this case the consequences seem minor.</p>

		<p>@Burak: To answer your question: No, Pascal will prevent entire classes of &#8216;typo&#8217; bugs like this, which is a good thing.</p>
<p>But to counter your bogus assertion: I don&#8217;t believe Delphi was an option when developing the Win95 installer. Remember the title of this blog.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
