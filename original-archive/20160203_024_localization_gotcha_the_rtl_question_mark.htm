<p>
Displaying a question mark in RTL is not as easy as it sounds,
because different languages use different question marks.
</p>
<p>
Languages which use Arabic or Arabic-style script flip the question
mark, resulting in
&#x61f;.
On the other hand, Hebrew does not flip the question mark;
they use the LTR-style ?.
</p>
<p>
This is normally handled as part of string localization,
but you have to be careful if you have
a question mark embedded into a bitmap,
such as a Help icon or button.
You have to make the bitmap available to localization so that
the Arabic localizers can flip the question mark,
whereas the Hebrew localizers leave it alone.</p>

		<p>So the tricky thing is not that two versions of the graphic art are needed &#8212; that would be true even if all RTL languages consistently flipped the question mark &#8212; but that you can&#8217;t select which graphic based on the global RTL information?</p>

		<p>Right. The shape of the question mark can be locale-dependent (not just RTL-dependent). There is also a <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/037e/index.htm" rel="nofollow">Greek question mark</a>, so the problem exists in LTR languages, too.</p>

		<p>I assume there are millions of unbanned websites that thumbs up. Why localize it and how? Flip it? Also is there something different about Iran and Afghanistan than the rest of RTL writers like Saudi Arabia, UAE, Oman, Iraq, Syria, ISIS, etc.?</p>

		<p>In those countries, the thumbs up gesture has approximately the same meaning as the middle finger in USA. Not the intended “Like” at all.</p>

		<p>I see. According to Wikipedia, it is like that in Iran, Western Africa and Greece, although it has declined in Iran.</p>

Normally yes, but older versions of Scratch used the Arabic question mark in the Hebrew localization. I wonder how that happened. Maybe whoever translated the strings omitted the question mark, and then someone else added it.</p>

		<p>Raymond, this certain gotcha is very trivial. Let me share a more concerning one: In Arabic, mathematics are written from right to left but not in Persian. Arabs still write individual numbers from left to right. Windows has zero supports for this although Linux supports it well.</p>
<p>Also, Word 2016 has ceased support for numbered lists with Indo-Arabic numerals (digits used in Arabic, Persian, Urdu) and only supports Western Arabic numerals (i.e. the same digits used in America and Western Europe). So, I guess U.N. won&#8217;t be using Word 2016 to write any document related to Saudi Arabia, Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, UAE, Oman, Levant, ISIS, etc.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
