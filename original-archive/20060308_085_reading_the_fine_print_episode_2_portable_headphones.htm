		<p>Maybe they mean motorcycling? &nbsp;It is against the law to operate a motor vehicle with headphones on. &nbsp;Iâ€™m not sure if bicyclists are allowed to wear headphones when riding on the roadway.</p>

		<p>I remember something similar with the Nokia 5210 mobile phone which was advertised as something which should operate in rain too. But the fine print of course said that it should not be used in wet areas/rain/etc. :)</p>
<p>Also it is shock protected to survive small &quot;jumps&quot;, but that scenario was neither supported by the fine print. Yuck.</p>

		<p>In CA, it&#8217;s illegal to operate a motor vehicle or bicycle with both ears covered. This is only on the roads. If you ride off road, it&#8217;s ok to be deaf to what&#8217;s going on around you.</p>
<p>The law is probably different in WA.</p>

		<p>Now I&#8217;m interested in the full text on the front of the box!</p>
<p>The interesting part for me is whether the marketing text says &quot;you <em>can</em> use it&#8230;for biking&#8230;&quot;. Are they your words or the marketeers?</p>
<p>If they used the word &quot;could&quot;, would that have conveyed a [slightly] different meaning? &#8211; compare the meaning of the statements, &quot;you can&quot;, &quot;you may&quot; and &quot;you could&quot;. </p>
<p>Also, If you one day sued them and said you were &#8216;biking&#8217; and NEVER used the word &#8216;cycling&#8217;, is there a chance you would win? </p>

		<p>I must related my favorite small-print story.</p>
<p>Look at the fine-print on the back of a theater/concert/sport event ticket. &nbsp;Generally, it goes like this (direct quotes from one ticket I saw)</p>
<p>first line: &quot;NON-TRANSFERABLE&quot;<br />
<br />translation: The ticket must be used by the person who bought it. If I plan on taking a date, I must bring her with me to the box office so she can buy her own ticket.</p>
<p>second line: &quot;RESALE PROHIBITED&quot;<br />
<br />translation: Not only can no one but me use this ticket, but no one can give me money for using this ticket, which they aren&#8217;t allowed to do.</p>
<p>third line: &quot;MAXIMUM RESALE PREMIUM: $5.00&quot;<br />
<br />translation: Not only can no one but me use the ticket, but the allowed of money they&#8217;re not allowed to give me for use of it cannot be more than $5 more than I paid for it.</p>

		<p>James Curran:</p>
<p>I agree, that makes no sense! But I suspect the reasoning is to give the ticket a notional monetary value &#8211; presumably making forgery of a ticket equal to forgery of currency.</p>
<p>At least that&#8217;s why I always figured coupons had &quot;Exchange value: 0.001p&quot; or similar on them.</p>

<br />BTW, small print is basically not so different from misleading ads and the like. Just as with the ads you can do your homework and find out the real facts about the product, you can grab a dictionary and a book of law and decipher the small print, but very few people actually do it.<br />
<br />Small print is good for printing extra information like permit numbers, company urls and other items which are not essential to the buyer.</p>

		<p>I Am Not a Lawyer, But&#8230;</p>
<p>In respect of the guy with the event ticket &#8211; could this be something to do with the US? &nbsp;I mean, is it possible that in some states &quot;not transferable&quot; clauses aren&#8217;t permissible, but &quot;maximum resale premium&quot; ones are, so they slap on every permutation possible in the hope that at least one is enforceable?</p>
<p>In the second case, I believe the &#8216;nominal value&#8217; on coupons (0.001p) in the UK is something to do with a law that says if you buy something using coupons etc. you have guarantee rights (e.g. if the freebie is broken demand a replacement) or can demand the cash equivalent instead, provided your coupons are worth 25p or more. &nbsp;The promoters give the vouchers an explicit nearly-worthless value to get around this. &nbsp;(If you could be bothered to collect 25p&#8217;s worth of coupons though, you could try demanding the cash :-).)<br /></p>

<p>Liquidation of lawyers, lawmakers, etc., isn&#8217;t bloodthirst. &nbsp;It&#8217;s just that if you liquidate them then you&#8217;ll have no one to make small print illegal ^_^</p>
<p>Besides, if you liquidate lawyers, lawmakers, etc., I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll find a container strong enough to hold the toxic waste that coarsed through their vains.</p>

		<p>Just because &quot;you can&quot; doesn&#8217;t mean &quot;you should.&quot;</p>
<p>Non-transferable means you can&#8217;t buy a ticket for one movie and then use it for different movie. &nbsp;It&#8217;s perfectly fine to give your ticket to a friend.</p>
<p>For resale prohibited vs. maximum resale $5&#8230; I got nothing. &nbsp;Unless they&#8217;re trying to emphasize the point, or go for harsher penalties if you (illegally) sell for (even more illegally) more than $5 of a premium.</p>
<p>Kind of like freeways that have a 65mph speed limit&#8230; and then you come to a slight curve, and they put a &quot;curve&quot; sign with a 65mph speed limit on it. &nbsp;They&#8217;re both legal limits, but the first one has less severe consequences (you&#8217;ll get a speeding ticket) than the second (you&#8217;ll flip over the barrier and die, and then you&#8217;ll get a speeding ticket)</p>

Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's

provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
