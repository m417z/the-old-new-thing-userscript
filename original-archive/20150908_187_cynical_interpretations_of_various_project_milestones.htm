		<p>Half on / half off topic &#8211; we once had an Engineering Director who decided we needed to understand progress on a daily basis to make sure we met milestones.</p>
<p>The term for this? Inch-stones</p>

		<p>Add to the list Relase milestone / Ask customer to look for bugs . And no, I&#39;m not going after Microsoft with this one. Anyone that works in the industry knows it&#39;s impossible to find all bugs before release, because the user will always use the software in ways the developers wouldn&#39;t be able to imagine&#8230;</p>

<p>Having watched my 1 yr old play with my phone, I&#39;m thinking that he could perform testing&#8230; along the lines of Android&#39;s isUserAMonkey()&#8230; But the lock screen, he&#39;s managed to find screens and do things that I didn&#39;t think were possible.</p>

		<p>Cynical interpretation of &quot;Cynical interpretations of various project milestones&quot;:</p>
<p>&#8211; cynical: realistic</p>
<p>&#8211; interpretation: meaning clarification</p>
<p>&#8211; bug: feature</p>
<p>Therefore, whenever you remove features, you&#39;re fixing bugs.</p>
<p>Milestones affect the amount of bugs more than the amount of features. &nbsp;The bigger the milestone, or the sooner its deadline, the greater the Bug To Feature Ratio (BTFR)â„¢. &nbsp;I leave finding the proportion (linear, polynomial, exponential, elliptical) and its constants as an exercise for the reader.</p>

		<p>Integration milestone should clearly be &quot;merging bugs from both teams&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Mason</p>
<p>Yes, the software development process is &quot;Bugging&quot; and &quot;Debugging.&quot;</p>
<p>@Brian</p>
<p>So, your milestones were 173 years out? Perhaps cablestone would be more accurate. (Had to use Wikipedia to get that one.) Then again, a stone is 14 pounds and a sprint is typically two weeks, so why not call them a pound?</p>

		<p>@Scott: yeah, but Android got it almost 30 years late. The original Macintosh had a global variable whose value indicated whether a monkey was at command: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?project=Macintosh&amp;story=Monkey_Lives.txt">http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py</a> .</p>
<p>It is surprisingly useful to stress user interfaces that way &#8211; be it an actual monkey, a one year old child, or a grown up with random click disorder :-P . It&#39;s just a pity that, AFAIK, the Windows SDK doesn&#39;t contain a monkey, as both Android and the original Macintosh ones do/did.</p>

		<p>For some teams, &quot;Integration milestone&quot; also means &quot;exporting bugs between teams&quot;.</p>
<p>And for &quot;Stabilization milestone&quot;, it&#39;s time to convert bugs into features. :P</p>

		<p>There is also parallel process of Discovering bugs, which is the only process that may delay Shipping milestone.</p>
<p>Which reminds of a friend who (being SDE/T) was too good at discovering critical bugs. So the team was not able to ship because they were not that fast in fixing these bugs. The solution? They &#39;promoted&#39; him from SDE/T to SDE, so he could work on creating bugs rather than discovering them.</p>

		<p>@Michael Entin: Inspired by your comment, we now have a new demoralization banner &#8211; &quot;Promotion &#8211; The processs of sending competent staffs away from positions they had proofed to be competent at.&quot;</p>

		<p>cheong00: I&#39;m pretty sure that the term &quot;promotion&quot; is reserved for meaning &quot;giving higher-paid positions to to staff who have proved incompetent at their current job&quot;.</p>
<p>For example, &quot;After three years, Steve could still only program by pasting in code he found via Google, so he got a promotion to manager.&quot;</p>

		<p>@Gabe: I don&#39;t know, but I&#39;ve seen a few times that some software companies prompt their best developers from SA to&#8230; PM. Not to mention that in traditional companies, it quite natural for long time staffs got promoted to titles like &quot;Assitant Manager (Projects)&quot; or even &quot;IT Manager&quot;</p>
<p>//faceplam</p>
<p>There are plenty of developers that can code very well but don&#39;t know how to manage people. For these guys promotion means they have to moved from &quot;time proved competent position&quot; to somewhere weird for them.</p>

		<p>@Brian: &nbsp;Some of us called those daily &quot;milestones&quot; &nbsp;foot-pebbles. &nbsp;Similar meaning (foot &lt; mile ; pebble &lt; stone) but if you envision a pebble in your shoe, it carries connotation of both being painful &amp; impeding forward progress.</p>

		<p>@cheoong00 and Gabe: &nbsp;Closely related is &quot;The Peter Principle&quot;, or &quot;Managers rising to their level of incompetence&quot;, since they only stop being promoted once they reach a point where they are no longer effective.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_principle">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Peter_principle</a></p>
<p>Using promotion as a tool to move someone out of a job where they are already actively incompetent and causing problems is often called &quot;The Public Sector Promotion&quot; model, since in highly unionised and public sector environments it is often easier to promote someone up and out of the way (to where they can hopefully do no harm or at least become somebody elses problem) than it is to demote or sack them for the problems they are causing.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
