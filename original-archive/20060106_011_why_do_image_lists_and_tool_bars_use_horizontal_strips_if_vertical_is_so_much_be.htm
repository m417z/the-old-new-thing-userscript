<p> Two people pointed out that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/05/448073.aspx#448492"> the <code>ImageList_Add</code> function</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/05/448073.aspx#448127"> toolbars</a> use horizontal strips even though we learned that vertical strips are much more efficient. While it's true that the images are passed to the <code>ImageList_Add</code> and <code>CreateToolbarEx</code> functions in horizontal strips, the image list and toolbar code copy them to a vertical strip. </p>
<p> In other words, the horizontal strip is merely an interchange format. Internally, the image list and toolbar use the more efficient vertical arrangement. </p>

		<p>Which prompts the question: why was it decided to use a horizontal strip in the first place? Logical for toolbars, though they run both ways, but irrelevant for image lists.</p>
<p>Is it continuity &#8211; the toolbar arrangement was decided first, so the image list follows &#8211; or convention? (I can only remember ever seeing animations done horizontally in sprite sheets, for example, never vertically.)</p>

		<p>English language (and many others, like my russian) uses left-to-right order for writing. I think this is only one reason why all elements in GUI are aligned horizontally.<br />
<br />BTW usual cinema film uses vertical frames moving.</p>

		<p>Interestingly, CreateToolbarEx has been marked as obsolete in recent versions of the SDK documentation&#8230; wonder if there&#8217;s any specific reason for that?</p>

		<p>@Starfish, re: &quot;I can only remember ever seeing animations done horizontally in sprite sheets, for example, never vertically&quot;.</p>
<p>The Internet Explorer &quot;throbber&quot; &#8211; the animation up at the top right when a page is loading &#8211; is a vertical sequence of frames. See<br />

		<blockquote><p>
  Which prompts the question: why was it decided to use a horizontal strip in the first place?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing that it&#8217;s because most displays are wider than they are tall, making horizontal strips easier to edit than vertical ones.

		<p>I took a look at MFC 2.53, which does toolbars on Win16 where there is no native toolbar control. That seems to store images side-by-side (bartool.cpp lines 208-210) so it may be what the Win32 toolbar is being compatible with.<br />
<br />On the other hand, MFC 2.53 is from April 1995, by which time Chicago betas existed; can someone confirm if CToolBar is the same in earlier MFCs?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
