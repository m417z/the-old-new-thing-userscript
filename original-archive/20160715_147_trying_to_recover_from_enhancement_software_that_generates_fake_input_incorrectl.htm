A customer had a program that supported the mouse wheel,
and they found that some laptops have
trackpad enhancement software
which supports a gesture for turning the mouse wheel.
When the enhancement software recognizes the gesture,
it <i>sends</i> a <code>WM_<wbr>MOUSE&shy;WHEEL</code> message
to the foreground window..
This causes problems for the program because there are
various things that are not allowed when processing an
inbound sent message.
Fortunately,
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ms644941(v=vs.85).aspx">
they can detect whether they are in this situation</a>,
but it's not clear how they can recover from it.
"We have been brainstorming and thinking that if we see this problem,
we will use <code>Post&shy;Message</code> to put
the message 'back' into our queue."
</p>
<p>
The trackpad software is supposed to be using
<code>Send&shy;Input</code>
so that the wheel message orders correctly with the other messages in your input queue.
The <code>Send&shy;Message</code> delivers the message immediately (or as immediately
as possible),
and
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130531-00/?p=4203">
messages posted with the <code>Post&shy;Message</code> function
are processed ahead of input</a>,
both of which are wrong when you are trying to simulate input.
Even your attempt to delay processing by calling
<code>Post&shy;Message</code> won't help because posted messages are processed ahead of input.
</p>
<p>
Here's a diagram which is inaccurate but may help to get the point across:
</p>
<table BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=3 STYLE="border-collapse: collapse"
 TITLE="A stack of messages.
At the top are inbound sent messages.
There is an arrow labeled &quot;SendMessage inserts messages here&quot; at the bottom of that section.
Next are inbound posted messages.
There is an arrow labeled &quot;PostMessage inserts messages here&quot; at the bottom of that section.
Last are inbound input messages.
There is an arrow labeled &quot;SendInput inserts messages here&quot; at the bottom of that section.">

Basically, the enhancement software already screwed you with respect
to message ordering.
You won't be able to make a perfect recovery;
all you can do is try to make the best of a bad situation.
</p>
<p>
One idea is to use the <code>Reply&shy;Message</code> function
in your message handler.
The
<code>Reply&shy;Message</code> function says,
"Hey, like, act like I returned from this message
for the purpose of inter-thread <code>Send&shy;Message</code>
bookkeeping, such as unblocking the sender,
but let me keep running anyway."
This may be enough to get the parts of the system that normally
say "No, you can't do that from inside a sent message" to realize
"Oh, wait, the synchronous part is over. Carry on."
</p>
<p>
If that doesn't work, then you can use the
<code>Send&shy;Input</code> message to generate a wheel message back
into the input queue.
The wheel input will be a bit late (by the amount of time it took your
window procedure to receive the message),
but it'll probably be close enough to correct that most people
won't notice.
There's most likely already a lag in the gesture recognition
in the enhancement software,
so a little more lag probably isn't the end of the world.</p>

		<p>And, I hope Microsoft offered to &#8220;coach&#8221; the developers of the trackpad software in the best way to do things.  Most trackpads seem to be made by the same company, so if they do it right, that will have good effects across the whole laptop industry.</p>

		<p>I suspect that the basic trackpad software is OK.  It&#8217;s some whizzy enhancement built on top of the trackpad software by a specific laptop manufacturer that is causing the grief.  ICBW</p>

		<p>Based on my own experimentation with customizing my laptop&#8217;s trackpad behaviour, the enhancement software is likely still provided by the trackpad vendor, and then customized by the laptop manufacturer. So the basic functionality (like scroll emulation) is probably shared.</p>
<p>However, there&#8217;s still a problem in that laptop manufacturers are not the most diligent in releasing updates for their customized enhancement programs, so fixing the problem would likely not fix it for existing laptops.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not entirely sure how much of it is actually ever customized by the laptop manufacturer. I thought my realtek audio drivers were modified by my laptop manufacturer, until I downloaded the generic ones from realtek and it detected the manufacturer and provided the appropriate skin. I think the manufacturers often say that the laptop manufacturers modify it, just so they don&#8217;t have to offer end user support.</p>

		<p>Man. I hate trackpad software. It is all terrible. Mine feels the need to draw an icon underneath the mouse cursor to tell me that I&#8217;m scrolling (because a window actively scrolling isn&#8217;t enough of an indicator)</p>
<p>This causes problems with focus-follows-mouse enabled, as the icon underneath the mouse cursor gets focus. Sometimes, this crashes the helper program. </p>
<p>Grrr&#8230;</p>

		<p>Microsoft could not even make their Microsoft Intellipoint software play nice with Microsoft Internet Explorer. Search for &#8220;intellipoint scroll too fast problem&#8221;. I still won&#8217;t install Intellipoint from Windows update because of that.</p>

		<p>Hooray for vendor enhancements! It seems the hardware enhancement programs are just as &#8220;useful&#8221; as all the other lovely additional software that comes with a typical OEM installation. Clean installs for me, thank you very much.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
