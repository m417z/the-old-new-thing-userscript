<p>
The PowerPC 600 series has a few types of control transfer instructions.
Let's look at direct branches first.
</p>
<pre>
    b       target          ; branch to target
    bl      target          ; branch to target and link
</pre>
<p>
The direct branch instructions perform an unconditional relative
branch to the target.
It has a reach of
&plusmn;32<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20090611-00/?p=17933">MB</a>.
All the "... and link" instructions 
set the <var>lr</var>
register to the return address (the instruction after the branch).
This happens even for conditional branches when the branch is not taken.
</p>
<p>
There are also absolute versions of these instructions:
</p>
<pre>
    ba      target          ; branch to target (absolute form)
    bla     target          ; branch to target and link (absolute form)
</pre>
<p>
The absolute versions treat the displacement as an absolute address
rather than as a displacement from the current instruction pointer.
These are not useful in Windows NT, but could be useful in embedded
systems.
</p>
<p>
Things get exciting when you look at the conditional branches.
Formally, they are written as
</p>
<pre>
    bc      BO, BI, target  ; branch conditional
    bcl     BO, BI, target  ; branch conditional and link
</pre>
<p>
Conditional branch instructions have a reach of only
&plusmn;32<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20090611-00/?p=17933">KB</a>.
There are also absolute variants <code>bca</code> and <code>bcla</code>
which treat the displacement as an absolute address,
allowing conditional branches to the top and bottom 32KB of address space.
Again, absolute addressing is not that useful in Windows NT.
</p>
<p>
The magical <var>BO</var> and <var>BI</var> parameters describe
the condition to be tested.
You can optionally decrement the <var>ctr</var> register and
check if the result is zero or nonzero.&sup1;
You can also optionally check if a specific bit in the <var>cr</var>
register is set (true) or clear (false),
and sometimes you can provide a static prediction hint.
The following combinations are valid:
</p>

<p>
Any <var>BO</var> values not in the above table
are reserved for future use and should be avoided
if you know what's good for you.
</p>
<p>
A static prediction hint overrides
any internal branch prediction algorithm,
so you'd better have very high confidence that your
hint is correct.
</p>
<p>
These mnemonics save you from having to memorize the
<var>BO</var> numbers.
</p>
<pre>
    b<u>xx</u>     BI, target  ; branch conditional
    b<u>xx</u>l    BI, target  ; branch conditional and link
</pre>
<p>
Except that if the mnemonic ends in a <code>+</code> or <code>-</code>,
then the prediction hint goes at the very end.
For example, "branch if false and link, predict not taken"
is <code>bfl-</code>.
</p>
<p>
The bit index <var>BI</var> can be written as a number,
but as we saw when we learned about condition registers,
you can combine the condition register bit mnemonics with
with the <var>cr#</var> mnemonics
to produce a reference to a condition bit.
For example,
<code>4*cr2+gt</code> means
"The <var>gt</var> bit in the <var>cr2</var> condition register."
And since the numeric value of <var>cr0</var> is zero,
you can omit <code>4*cr0+</code>,
which results in some surprisingly readable results like
</p>
<pre>
    bt       eq, target  ; branch if eq is set in cr0
</pre>
<p>
The assembler goes one step further and provides a few combination
mnemonics:&sup2;
</p>
<table BORDER=1 CELLPADDING=3 CLASS="cp3"
    STYLE="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<th>Branch and condition</th>
<th>Mnemonic</th>
<th>Meaning</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>bt lt</code></td>
<td><code>blt</code></td>
<td>Branch if less than</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>bt gt</code></td>
<td><code>bgt</code></td>
<td>Branch if greater than</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>bt eq</code></td>
<td><code>beq</code></td>
<td>Branch if equal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>bt so</code></td>
<td><code>bso</code></td>
<td>Branch if summary overflow</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>bf lt</code></td>
<td><code>bnl</code></td>
<td>Branch if not less than</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>bf gt</code></td>
<td><code>bng</code></td>
<td>Branch if not greater than</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>bf eq</code></td>
<td><code>bne</code></td>
<td>Branch if not equal</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>bf so</code></td>
<td><code>bns</code></td>
<td>Branch if not summary overflow</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
The mnemonics can separate the condition bit from the
condition register,
so you can get
</p>
<pre>
    beq      cr4, target  ; branch if eq is set in cr4
</pre>
<p>
Okay, the next type of branch instruction is the computed jump.
</p>
<pre> 
    bcctr    BO, BI, BH   ; branch conditional to address in ctr
    bcctrl   BO, BI, BH   ; branch conditional to address in ctr and link

    bclr     BO, BI, BH   ; branch conditional to address in lr
    bclrl    BO, BI, BH   ; branch conditional to address in lr and link
</pre>
<p>
You are not allowed to use any of the "decrement <var>ctr</var>"
branch operations
with the <code>bcctr</code> or <code>bcctrl</code> instructions
because shame on you for even thinking about trying it.
</p>
<p>
The <var>BO</var> and <var>BI</var> codes follow the same rules as above,
and the assembler provides mnemonics for various combinations.
If you go to PowerPC reference materials, you'll see
<a HREF="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/DeveloperTools/Reference/Assembler/050-PowerPC_Addressing_Modes_and_Assembler_Instructions/ppc_instructions.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP30000824-TPXREF105">
horrid tables</a>
that look like some sort of dystopian
declension table from a long-forgotten Slavic language.
In this hypothetical language,
<code>bdnztlrl</code> means something like
"branch on odd-numbered Thursdays," I guess.
(Okay, it actually means
"<u>b</u>ranch, after <u>d</u>ecrementing <code>ctr</code>, if the result is <u>n</u>on<u>z</u>ero,
and if the condition bit is <u>t</u>rue, to the address in the <code><u>lr</u></code> register,
and <u>l</u>ink.")
</p>
<p>
The <var>BH</var> field provides a hint for branch prediction,
primarily whether the branch target is likely to be the same
as the previous time the branch was encountered.
Branches through an import table are likely to be the same each time.
Branches through a vtable could also use this hint if the
method is being dispatched from the same object in a loop.
(The vtable is unlikely to change during the loop.)
</p>
<p>
The processor optimizes on the assumption that
<code>bctr</code> is a computed jump
and
<code>blr</code> is a subroutine return,&sup3;
although the <var>BH</var> hints can tweak those assumptions.
Furthermore, Windows NT <i>requires</i> that non-leaf subroutine returns
be encoded exclusively as <code>blr</code>.
You are not allowed to pull fancy tricks like <code>beqlr</code>
to perform a conditional subroutine return.
This is not a significant problem in practice because there's usually other
stuff that needs to be done as part of the function epilogue.
Adding this rule makes the exception unwinding code easier.
</p>
<p>
For the same reason,
the conditional versions of the "and link" branches
are mostly useless in practice
because even if you can conditionalize the link,
you still prepared the function call unconditionally.
You might have been better off just branching over the
function call entirely.
</p>
<p>
Okay, so great, you have these instructions that operate on the
<var>lr</var> and <var>ctr</var> registers,
but how do you actually get values in and out of them?
</p>
<pre>
    mflr    rt           ; rt = lr
    mfctr   rt           ; rt = ctr

    mtlr    rs           ; lr = rs
    mtctr   rs           ; ctr = rs
</pre>
<p>
The "move from/to <var>lr</var>/<var>ctr</var>" instructions
let you move values into and out of the <var>lr</var> and <var>ctr</var>
registers.
(Like <code>mfxer</code> and <code>mtxer</code>,
these are actually shorthand for <code>mfspr</code> and <code>mtspr</code>
with the appropriate magic number for <var>lr</var> or <var>ctr</var>.)
</p>
<p>
In practice, the first instruction of a non-leaf function is
<code>mflr r0</code> to save the return address,
and
when it's ready to return, it will do a
<code>mtlr r0</code> to load up the return address in preparation
for the <code>blr</code>.
This is pretty much the only thing the Microsoft compiler uses the
<var>r0</var> register for:
Transferring the return address in and out of <var>lr</var>.
</p>
<p>
But wait, I'm getting ahead of myself.
I promised to talk about the table of contents,
so let's do that
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180816-00/?p=99505">
next time</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
PowerPC mnemonics are so absurd that there was even
<a HREF="https://twitter.com/ppcinstructions">
a short-lived parody twitter account for them</a>.
Now that you've learned most of the instructions,
you may understand some of the more insidey jokes, like
</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">mscdfr - Means Something Completely Different For r0</p>
<p>&mdash; PowerPC Instructions (@ppcinstructions) <a href="https://twitter.com/ppcinstructions/status/557938532401295360?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 21, 2015</a></p>
</blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
<p>
&sup1;
Note that even if you loaded a 64-bit value into the <var>ctr</var>
register (because you detected that you had a 64-bit-capable processor),
the test for
zero or non-zero is performed only against the least-significant 32 bits
of the <var>ctr</var> register
when the processor is in 32-bit mode
(which is what Windows NT uses).
</p>
<p>
&sup2;
The assembler also provides
<code>bge</code> (branch if greater than or equal to)
as an alias for <code>bnl</code> (branch if not less than).
I think that's misleading, because <code>bge</code> suggests
that the test checks two bits (<var>gt</var> and <var>eq</var>)
and branches if either is set.
But in fact it checks whether <var>lt</var> is clear.
Now, if the condition register was set by a comparison,
then the two cases are equivalent, but if you have been playing
games with condition register flags,
you can get into states where the trichotomy of numbers breaks down.
</p>
<p>
&sup3;
The return address predictor gives the processor the ability to
start speculating instructions at the return address
even before you move the return address
into the <var>lr</var> register!</p>

		<p>The branch prediction hints aren&#8217;t necessarily honored by the processor.  POWER9 ignores them except in connection with a conditional store, although the manual suggests that you may be able to change the firmware to honor them again.</p>
<p>Apparently they&#8217;ve had too many customers who set the hints less accurately than the dynamic predictors could do and fielded a few too many performance questions about them.</p>
<p>Thats a shame, since static hints could make the GCC and LLVM santizers more efficient.</p>

		<p>But is <code>mscdfr</code> an actual instruction, or does it just resemble one? I ask because I know an origin for <code>shrdlu</code> and it seems like the account just wanted to make it sound like an instruction.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
