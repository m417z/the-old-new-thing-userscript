		<p>I am extremely disappointed at the prejudice shown by the organisers towards the One True Editor, and their lack of fair and balanced opposition to our adversary, Emacs, and its users. Even the venerable edlin gets a dig, but not Emacs.[0]</p>
<p>I therefore allege that the NotepadConf organisers are secret Emacs users, and should consequently be the next target of the Internet Hate Machine (aka 4chan). Further, I propose the creation of a breakaway meetup &#8211; the NotepadSymposium &#8211; which should consider adopting @Don&#39;s idea of inviting sexy Clippy cosplayers as a completely reasonable and totally non-creepy way to gain mindshare and traction.</p>
<p>[0] Naturally, everyone instinctively understands that the ancient and noble standard editor &quot;ed&quot; is rightfully beyond reproach.</p>

		<p>I have a filter that will convert images to text from Photoshop and some other apps &#8212; so that then means Notepad can also be used as a paint program.</p>

<p>Not sure how one could advance Notepad and doesn&#39;t make it looking like WordPad. :P</p>

		<p>Too bad they don&#39;t make use of ASCII Art converter to produce an ASCII Art drawing of the map to Location.txt on the page. They can hide a link to the actual map on the character representing the location.</p>

		<p>&gt; Funniest part: Workshop: Integrating Spell Checking Into Notepad. Attendees should bring a copy of Notepad, and a dictionary.</p>
<p>You find this funny? To me this is just an example of the sort of feature creep and bloatware that has been sneaking into Windows over time. Sure you may claim the dictionary is an optional physical extra, but sooner or later M$ or someone will sell dictionary back-strap mounts for the SurfacePro &#8211; correction: *SatanPro*. Still laughing now? What next? With Windows turned into a tablet device the straps might as well be marketed as a papoose as well. WINDOWS IS NOT A PAPOOSE! <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Edward_S._Curtis_Collection_People_007.jpg" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/File:Edward_S._Curtis_Collection_People_007.jpg</a></p>

		<p>@Tim: Spell checking in Notepad seems easy enough. You just need a file, words.txt, which contains every known word, and then do a Find in it for each word whose spelling you want to check. (Use some sort of delimiter to ensure you find whole words; space comes to mind.) The bit that worries me is the copy of Notepad, which might be a violation of your software licence with Microsoft. Maybe they&#39;re supposed to bring a licensed installation of Notepad instead?</p>

<p>In this session, you&#39;ll learn how to write code in Notepad that runs code from Notepad, so you can run code for Notepad while you edit code in Notepad!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
