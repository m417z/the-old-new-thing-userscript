<p> Some suggestions for those companies which produce children's play furniture: </p>
<ol>
<li>If a part is 99.9% symmetric, please call out the other 0.1%. Otherwise, the person doing the assembling will waste five minutes trying to get it to fit before realizing, "Oh, I have to turn it the other way." </li>
<li>Do not refer to the same part by multiple names. Try to stick to the name as it appears in the parts list. Otherwise, the person doing the assembling will not know which one is the M5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;30mm screw. </li>
<li>Corollary: If you refer to a part, please make sure it appears in the parts list. </li>
<li>Do not omit steps on the assumption that the person doing the assembling has read ahead. "Step 5: Insert X into Y. Step 6: Close snaps around the sides of Y." Invisible step 4.5: "Open the snaps around the sides of Y so that X will fit." </li>
<li>Take into account that the person doing the assembling is most likely being pestered by at least one excited kid during the assembly process. And is probably tired. </li>

		<p>This demonstrates one of the reasons I like IKEA.</p>
<p>1. They always point out the difference in a fairly-obvious manner.</p>
<p>2. The almost never use text so there&#39;s no danger of using confusing names.</p>
<p>4. The drawings make it very clear what the state of parts should be before and after each step.</p>
<p>However, having great instructions is not all that matters. Since this isn&#39;t an IKEA review I&#39;ll stop here and not bore you with irrelevance.</p>
<p>About step 5, how do you take that into account when writing instruction manuals?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>For item #5, it means keep each step simple with clear start end points, and don&#39;t require three hands or careful balancing. Bad: &quot;Step 5: While holding the W open, frob the X with one hand while gnorfing the Y with the other, frist the Z and Q, and attach the result to the X.&quot; Better: &quot;5: Open the W (design so that W stays open by itself). 6: Pre-gnorf the Y. 7: Frob the X to the Y. 8: Gnorf the Y. 9: Close the W. 10: Frist the Z and Q. 11: Attach the Z/Q piece to the X.&quot; -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>The best assembly instructions I&#39;ve ever seen are for Lego kits. &nbsp;My son was able to put together some of those complicated Star Wars models by himself when he was 6.</p>

		<p>Lego kits usually do have great instructions, though I remember one complex kit which was obviously missing a step. Unfortunately, it was a very complex step and my son and I spent some time scratching our heads trying to figure it out.</p>

		<p>With regards to #5: &nbsp;they should also include extra parts. &nbsp;I helped my brother-in-law assemble a swing set and I spent most of the time preventing my three year-old nephew from running off with parts or tools, attempting to attach parts out of sequence, and attempting to remove previously attached parts. &nbsp;He was very upset that we didn&#39;t want his &quot;help&quot;.</p>

		<p>Extra parts can be confusing as well. &nbsp;How many extras should you have when you get done?</p>
<p>I am a big fan of the method of packaging hardware in a cardboard backed &quot;bubble&quot; container. &nbsp;It makes identifying the parts easy, and keeps them from running off. &nbsp;(With or without helpful kids.) :-)</p>

		<p>Crappy documentation is a result of treating the docs &#8212; including the testing and editing of docs &#8212; as something that you can cheap out on, and that &quot;users will figure it out.&quot; It&#39;s very common:</p>

		<p>Well, back to IKEA once more &#8230; while they *usually* point out distinguishing features of parts it&#39;s not always so. Sometimes the furniture has identical parts except for the varnished outer surface – which is nowhere mentioned. You essentially have to figure out which might be a part that&#39;s not the bottom or back and would need the varnished side.</p>
<p>That and the only nearly identical two dozen wood pieces once drove me nuts. They give their screws and other small parts numbers, why not the wood pieces too and just print them somewhere on the inside of them?</p>

		<p>Last year, I had a Melissa and Doug kitchen to assemble. &nbsp;It was without a doubt the best assembly experience I&#39;ve ever had &#8211; better than Ikea. Color coded, screws of different sizes that physically could not fit in the wrong holes. I have asked Mrs. Claus to strongly consider Melissa and Doug items solely for the ease of assembly.</p>

		<p>Oh toys&#8230;</p>
<p>I was assembling the a modeling kit from Disney last week for my cousin. On the box it seems the joints are movable, but in fact there&#39;s some locking mechanism inside the joint, so before you assemble, you must figure out what pose you want the model to be.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve had a hard time explaining to her why the joints can&#39;t move.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
