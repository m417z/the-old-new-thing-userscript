<p>Last night I attended the <a href="http://www.nwmahlerfestival.org/"> Northwest Mahler Festival</a>'s performance of Mahler's Second Symphony (<i>The Resurrection</i>). The concert opened with Copland's <i>El Sal&oacute;n M&eacute;xico</i> and Barber's <i>Prayers of Kierkegaard</i>. [Typo fixed 12:30pm]</p>
<p> The Copland was kind of shaky, in a way that I couldn't quite put a finger on. The wind balance seemed a bit off, and it somehow didn't seem to "come together". By contrast, my knowledge of the Barber was zero, so they could've pulled out kazoos and I wouldn't've know that something was amiss. </p>
<p> The Mahler demands quite a bit from both the woodwind and brass sections, but I was relieved to find that the tricky problem of getting them to play friendly appeared to be nonexistent. The Mahler "came together". (Well, duh, this is the Northwest <strong>Mahler</strong> Festival, after all.) I was so at ease with it that I started to ignore the occasional technical error... </p>
<p> Performances of Mahler symphonies have a significant visual component. It's always a blast to see the clarinets playing "Schalltrichter auf", and for the Second, I was oddly fascinated by the rute. (I think my favorite Mahler percussion instrument is the "large hammer striking a wooden block" from the Sixth Symphony. When you see the percussionist raise that huge mallet, you know it's coming... and when the blow finally comes, it sends shock waves through your body.) </p>
<p> Anyway, there's no real point to this entry. Just babbling about a symphony concert that I found very satisfying. </p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know if the name of the play is actually &quot;El S&#225;lon M&#233;xico&quot;, but I believe you should&#8217;ve written &quot;El Sal&#243;n M&#233;xico&quot;.</p>

		<p>I saw the Moscow Symphony Orchestra play Tchaikovsky&#8217;s 5th here in Dallas and it was simply amazing. Who better to play a Russian composer&#8217;s song than the Russians?</p>

		<p>The kazoos reminded me of being in the audience when my choir was doing Bernstein&#8217;s <em>Mass</em>, a huge work written in the early 1970s when Bernstein had just discovered how trendy the Catholic church was (this was just after Vatican II, when (in the words of Tom Lehrer) the Pope had changed a lot of things &quot;in an effort to make the church more commercial&quot;).  <em>Mass</em> does, in fact, use kazoos, to great effect.  It&#8217;s a shame the only extant recording is by an undersized and underpowered choir who didn&#8217;t do it justice; my choir &#8212; actually, a combination of university choirs from all around Australia attending that year&#8217;s Intervarsity Choral Festival &#8212; did a spectacular job, and the guy singing the lead sounded like Nick Cave at his best.  Easily the best concert I&#8217;ve ever heard.</p>
<p>So, in summary: kazoos can be good.</p>

		<p>It demands quite a bit from the basses in the choir at the end&#8230; do you know how hard it is to fake singing low low low Bb?</p>

		<p>After two weeks of partying all night and rehearsing all day at an Intervarsity Choral Festival, believe me &#8212; the trick is getting any notes ABOVE a low low low Bb.  And that&#8217;s if you&#8217;re a soprano.  Basses by that stage need clearance from the local seismological institute before they warm up.</p>

		<p>I wish I had known you were coming, I would have looked for you. :-) I was singing Bass. The Barber was really fun to do: I never had to learn to sing a 12-tone melody before. I&#8217;m starting to hit the saturation point on the Mahler, though &#8212; while I was very emotionally affected at some of the rehearsals, by the time we got to the concert, I was having a bad case of been-there-done-that.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
