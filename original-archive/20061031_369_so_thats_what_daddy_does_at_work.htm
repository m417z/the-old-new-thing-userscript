<p> Though it does lead to some misconceptions on the part of the younger children, the result of extrapolation from too few data points. I remember a colleague of mine who brought his young daughter to work for Hallowe'en. A conversation with "Cathy" some days later went like this: </p>
<p> "Hi, Cathy." </p>
<p> "Hi." </p>
<p> "Do you know where your daddy works?" </p>
<p> "He works at Microsoft." </p>
<p> "Do you know what your daddy does at work?" </p>

		<p>My uncle is a retired AF pilot &#8211; after retraining some other pilots, he got a cushy assignment in .de. His daughter had a career day thing around that time, and when she introduced him it went like this: &quot;This is my daddy, he drives a jeep&quot;.</p>

		<p>There is an apostrophe in Halloween for the same reason there is an apostrophe in &quot;didn&#8217;t&quot; and &quot;wasn&#8217;t&quot; &#8211; it marks where a letter or letters have been dropped.</p>
<p>didn&#8217;t = did n&#8217;o&#8217;t</p>
<p>wasn&#8217;t = was n&#8217;o&#8217;t</p>
<p>Hallowe&#8217;en = All Hallows Eve = (All) Hallow(s) E&#8217;v&#8217;en(ing)</p>
<p>I think &#8211; English is my first language but that doesn&#8217;t mean I understand it&#8217;s technicalities or history perfectly (and the language is perhaps over-endowed with both!)</p>

		<p>You left off the most important fact about halloween at Microsoft&#8230;traffic is sooo bad that it can make a 30 minute comute turn into a 2 hour commute (unless you are riding a bike). &nbsp;Its the best day of the year to take off early&#8230;</p>

<p>Yes. Expose them to the harsh realities of the world sooner so they can feel their responsibilites pressing on them early on, getting heavier and heavier as we burden them with even more information earlier than even we learned it. Then they can snap even sooner! Stupid.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>What a load of crap. Of course it is better to teach your kids to be responsible and that won&#8217;t make them snap sooner. You are wrong and I sincerely hope you are not and will never become a parent. If you do, you will obviously be only capable of bringing up spoiled brats, not normal responsible persons.</p>

		<p>man, I wondered why my space got a zillion hits from yours today&#8230; okay, not a zillion but more than one, which is a big day for me. &nbsp;and yes, the kids had fun again this year trick or treating at Microsoft, especially since daddy wore his gorilla costume all day at work&#8230;</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Cody, I agree with you.</p>
<p>However, parents which don&#8217;t realize that their kids nowadays have to learn more and faster than we did are not helping them at all.</p>
<p>Kids should be encouraged to learn. Their future depends on it.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
