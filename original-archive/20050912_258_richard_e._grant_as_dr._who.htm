<p>While waiting for <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/"> the Ninth and Tenth Doctors</a> to reach the States, I was tipped off to <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/webcasts/index.shtml"> some animated Dr.&nbsp;Who episodes on the BBC web site</a>. These are really well done and managed to slake my Doctor cravings for a little while longer.</p>
<p> In particular, Richard E.&nbsp;Grant's second turn as the somewhat Earth-obsessed Time Lord in <i> <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/doctorwho/classic/webcasts/shalka/"> Scream of the Shalka</a></i> is a must-see. The tired frustration of his Doctor is a refreshing change from the more amiable personas he's had in recent incarnations. After saving the Earth (nay, the universe) from certain destruction for over forty years, you kind of can't blame him for being fed up with the whole thing. </p>
<p> (Second turn as The Doctor? Yup. Richard E.&nbsp;Grant played The Tenth Doctor in <i> <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0212887/"> Doctor Who and the Curse of the Fatal Death</a></i>, a spoof produced for the charity organization <a href="http://www.comicrelief.com/"> Comic Relief</a>. I think Rowan Atkinson makes an excellent Doctor, if I may say so myself.) </p>

		<p>Oh I agree, Rowan was spot on as the Doctor.</p>
<p>If I remeber right, you live in the Seattle area. If you have Comcast the CBC is on 99, and they are showing the new Doctor Who. Right now the are rerunning the first season on Sundays.</p>

		<p>The new Doctor Who series (I think using &quot;Dr.&quot; is frowned upon?) was really excellent.</p>
<p>I highly suggest those fans not in reach of the BBC to seek it out by other means (BitTorrent). Just promise to buy DVD when it comes out &#8211; that&#8217;s fair, right?</p>
<p>The Empty Child/Doctor Dances two-parter was one of the best sci-fi tv episodes in recent (and not too recent) memory.<br /></p>

		<p>Anonymous Coward &#8211; it&#8217;s a lot like the &#8216;System Tray&#8217;. Yes, Dr. Who is frowned upon. Yes, the BBC use it themselves. No, you may never use it around hardened Who fans ;-)</p>
<p>The new series was absolutely fantastic, glad to see overseas viewers enjoyed it too!</p>

		<p>Mommeeee!<br />
<br />Are you my mommy?</p>
<p>I agree with AC. For some reason that is one of the scariest things I have seen in a while. Doctor Who had me hiding behind the sofa as a child, and now as an adult as well.</p>
<p>As for the best Doctor, they don&#8217;t come any better than Pertwee.</p>

		<p>I forgot to say &#8211; apparently there are also a <em>lot</em> of audio Who episodes, produced while the TV program was in its long long break.</p>
<p>Now if you will excuse me, I&#8217;m off to exterminate some bugs. Ex-ter-mi-nate!</p>

<p>Blasphemy! Who is not American!</p>
<p>Mummeeee!<br />

<p>Ah, that&#8217;s better.</p>
<p>BTW Who deprived, torrent averse folk can buy the DVD&#8217;s from amazon.co.uk right now &#8211; they&#8217;ll be region 2 PAL though. Box set full of extras towards the end of the year and a christmas special on the BBC. Woo Who!</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not American either, but I prefer the &quot;o&quot; spelling. For one thing, people then know I&#8217;m not talking about Sutekh&#8217;s robots :)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve never seen Doctor Who before, though I&#8217;ve heard of the name I don&#8217;t think it ever ran in Germany. But after having seen this and subsequently the first episode of the new series I must say, me likeeee. Thanks for introducing me!</p>

		<p>Merle &#8211; Paul McGann, in the ill-fated 1996 TV movie. (Which had flaws, but McGann was fantastic in it)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
