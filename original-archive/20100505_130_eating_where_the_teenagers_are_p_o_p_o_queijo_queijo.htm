<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/03/10006066.aspx"> In Bel&eacute;m</a>, directly to the east of the <a href="http://www.mosteirojeronimos.pt/english/index_mosteiro.html"> <i lang="pt-pt">Mosteiro dos Jer&oacute;nimos</i></a> is a block of small shops, the most famous one of which being the <a href="http://www.pasteisdebelem.pt/"> <i lang="pt-pt">Past&eacute;is de Bel&eacute;m</i></a> which sells the, um, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pastel_de_nata"> <span lang="pt-pt">Pastel de Bel&eacute;m</span></a>, the Bel&eacute;m version of the unofficial dessert of Portugal. (<a href="http://www.eamon.the-byte-factory.com/2008/04/15/day-12-lisbon-portugal/">This photo of a group of people eating</a> was taken in front of the <span lang="pt-pt">Past&eacute;is de Bel&eacute;m</span> shop. You can see the blue awnings in the background.) The place is always packed shoulder-to-shoulder with tourists. So turn around, leave the store, and walk back toward the <i lang="pt-pt">Mosteiro dos Jer&oacute;nimos</i>. At about where the pink building&nbsp;is in the photo referenced above is a tiny shop called <a href="http://www.lifecooler.com/portugal/restaurantes/PaoPaoQueijoQueijo"> <i lang="pt-pt"> P&atilde;o P&atilde;o, Queijo Quejo</i></a>, which means <a href="http://seeportugal.org/2008/03/23/belem-lisbon-more-then-just-a-tower/"> Bread Bread Cheese Cheese</a>. If the photo doesn't help, here's how you find it: It's the one packed to the gills with teenagers.</p>
<p> Now, following the teenagers to decide where to eat is a hit-or-miss affair. You might find an awesome little shop, or you might end up at McDonalds. I lucked out and scored a major win. </p>
<p> Here's how you enjoy lunch at P&atilde;o P&atilde;o, Queijo Queijo: </p>
<ul>
<li>Read the menu board posted outside to decide what you want.     Have your dictionary handy since it's only in Portuguese. </li>
<li>Join the     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/27/8553639.aspx">     mob-like approximation of a line</a>     that snakes out the door. </li>
<li>When you reach the register near the door,     place your order and pay for it.     You will receive an order slip. </li>
<li>Join the mob inside the store and try to work your way to     the counter where all the food is. </li>
<li>Get the attention of somebody behind the counter.     You are competing with two dozen other people at this point,     so it may take some effort. </li>
<li>Hand the person your order slip and do your best to answer     questions like "Do you want sauce?" and "For here or to go?"     The correct answers are "Only a little" and "To go", by the way. </li>
<li>Receive your sandwiches, grab some extra napkins,     and walk across the street to the park. </li>
<li>Enjoy your sandwich in the park while taking in the view of the     <a href="http://michaelbarrientos.blogspot.com/2007/05/ponte-25-de-abril.html">     <i lang="pt-pt">Ponte 25 de Abril</i></a>     (the April 25 Bridge),     then take a nap in the warm sunshine. </li>
</ul>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/19/8518566.aspx"> Second only to salt in the Portuguese diet</a> appears to be ranch dressing/mayonnaise/whatever that white sauce is. (Hence the need for extra napkins and the correct answer of "Only a little.") If you're not careful, you'll find your sandwich drowning in approximately ten cubic meters of the stuff. But once you get past that, you have a tasty sandwich with warm meat and crunchy slaw on a crisp baguette. It's sort of a Portuguese version of a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/21/8525412.aspx"> Vietnamese sandwich</a>. </p>

		<p>I suspect the name of the shop, &#8220;PÃ£o PÃ£o, Queijo Queijo&#8221;, comes from a phrase that goes something like &#8220;Ao pÃ£o, pÃ£o, e ao queijo, queijo&#8221;, which roughly translates to &#8220;to call a spade a spade&#8221;.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll find variants of that phrase in Spanish too (&#8220;Al pan, pan y al vino, vino&#8221;).</p>
<p>I might have the wrong wording (I live in Brazil), but you get the general idea :)</p>

		<p>We have Pastel de Bel&#233;m be sold in KFC here, and that&#8217;s yummy.</p>
<p>Also, nice tips for following teenagers in lunch hours. That&#8217;ll usually lead you to tasty food (not always healthy one, though)</p>

		<p>Yeah, my brain warped just from trying to imagine 10 cubic metres of sauce. I&#8217;m still wondering what would happen if you answered &#8220;More sauce&#8221; and &#8220;For here&#8221;.</p>

		<p>@Rafael: Raymond is visiting Portugal, not Brazil. He&#8217;s mentioning Bel&#233;m in Lisbon, not Bel&#233;m do Par&#225;.</p>
<p>@Raymond: By the way, if you visit Brazil (Minas Gerais), you can enjoy a famous delicacy named &quot;p&#227;o de queijo&quot; that&#8217;s a kind of cheese bread (only that&#8217;s made of cassava flour or &quot;polvilho&quot;, not wheat). &nbsp;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
