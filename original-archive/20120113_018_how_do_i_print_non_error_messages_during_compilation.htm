<p>Commenter Worf remarked,  "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/09/8370479.aspx#8374137">My one wish is that <code>#warning</code> would be supported</a>."</p>
<p>  I always find it interesting when people say  "I wish that Microsoft  would stop following standards,"  since the <code>#warning</code> directive is nonstandard.  </p>
<p>  The Microsoft C/C++ compiler implements the feature in  a method compatible with the standard,  namely via a <code>#pragma</code> directive.  </p>
<p><code>  #pragma message("You really shouldn't be doing that.")  </code></p>
<p>  If you want to warn people away from deprecated functionality,  you can use  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/c8xdzzhh.aspx">  the <code>#pragma deprecated()</code> directive</a>  or the even more convenient (but more standards-troublesome)  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/044swk7y.aspx">  <code>__declspec<wbr>(deprecated)</wbr></code> declaration specifier</a>.  The declaration specifier is much more convenient than the preprocessor  directive because you can use it in a macro,  and you can attach it to specific overloads of a function.  (It's also more standards-troublesome because, while it is still  permitted by the standard because it begins with a double-underscore,  it is also not required to be ignored by compilers which do not  understand it.)  </p>
<p>  In my experience, however, printing messages during compilation is  of little consequence.  Print all the messages during compilation as you want;  <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/larryosterman/archive/2011/05/03/nobody-ever-reads-the-event-logs.aspx">  nobody will read them</a>.  The only thing that gets attention is an actual warning or error.  (And in many cases, only the error will get any attention at all.)  </p>

		<p>This is why you should enable the warnings-as-errors option (-Werror on gcc, I do not know what the corresponding parameter is for MSVC). This way, you cannot easily ignore a warning.</p>

		<p>Raymond&#39;s got half a point. Diagnostic messages during compile only get checked when debugging the build chain.</p>
<p>The thing about __ markers is they are supposed to be defined in such a way that they can be dropped by an appropriate define (usually passed as -D, e.g. -D__declspec(x) ).</p>

		<p>&quot;I always find it interesting when people say &quot;I wish that Microsoft would stop following standards,&quot; since the #warning directive is nonstandard.&quot;</p>
<p>Implementing a feature not specified by the standard is not the same as not following the standard &#8211; implementing #warning has no impact on any program written in standard C or C++ [because they obviously won&#39;t use it]. And to say otherwise is to implicitly claim that competing compilers that do implement it aren&#39;t following the standard.</p>
<p>&quot;The only thing that gets attention is an actual warning or error.&quot; And yet it&#39;s so mystifying that people want to be able to generate an &quot;actual warning&quot; rather than just a message?</p>
<p>&quot;it is also not required to be ignored by compilers which do not understand it&quot; &#8211; perhaps, but compilers are not required to understand non-standard pragmas _in the same way_. &quot;#pragma message&quot; could mean _anything_ on some other compiler, so it still has to be guarded by making sure you know what implementation you&#39;re on. And being ignored is the wrong thing: at least #warning is a syntax error and therefore a required diagnostic.</p>

		<p>One approach to generate a warning is the following</p>
<p>#define WARNNAME2(x,y) x##y</p>
<p>#define WARNNAME1(x,y) WARNNAME2(x,y)</p>
<p>#define WARNNAME(x) WARNNAME1(x,__COUNTER__)</p>
<p>#define WARNING(text) </p>
<p>struct WARNNAME(warn) {</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;__declspec(deprecated(text)) void f() {} </p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;void g() { f(); } </p>
<p>};</p>
<p>// Generate a warning</p>
<p>WARNING(&quot;This is a scary looking warning&quot;)</p>
<p>This generates the warning via the deprecated approach, which is hardly optimal for most warnings I need to generate, but is the only workable approach I have found.</p>
<p>I do think that there are valid reasons to allow a user to generate a custom warning, possibly via something like #pragma userwarning(&quot;Danger&quot;), or even the non-standards compliant #warning which at least has the advantage of being compatible with GCC, and possibly becoming a de facto standard.</p>
<p>@Random &#8212; about your question: &quot;And yet it&#39;s so mystifying that people want to be able to generate an &quot;actual warning&quot; rather than just a message?&quot;, the blog post as originally posted this morning had a technical inaccuracy in it which has since been corrected. &nbsp;During the period the technical inaccuracy was present, Raymond&#39;s statement made sense. &nbsp;Now it does seem puzzling and a bit out of place.</p>

		<p>One useful trick to generate a message *and* a warning in VS2005 (and likely later): put a semicolon after the #pragma message. &nbsp;So:</p>
<p>#pragma message(&quot;manah manah&quot;);</p>

		<p>SimonRev,</p>
<p>This is probably &quot;simpler&quot;</p>
<p>#define STRINGIZE2__(x) #x</p>
<p>#define STRINGIZE1__(x) STRINGIZE2__(x)</p>
<p>#define LOC__ <strong>FILE</strong> &quot;(&quot;STRINGIZE1__(<strong>LINE</strong>)&quot;) : warning Msg: &quot;</p>
<p>#define WARNING(MSG) <strong>pragma(message(LOC</strong> MSG))</p>
<p>WARNING(&quot;hi&quot;);</p>
<p>results in:</p>
<p>file.cpp(649): warning Msg: hi</p>
<p>Avoids the deprecated issue, is still clickable and shows up in the error list in the IDE, and is colorized by vcbuild/msbuild.</p>

		<p>I use GCC with almost all warnings as errors. Since without getting rid of the errors the project won&#39;t build, I necessarily have to read the things. Of course, the warnings that are still warnings I ignore because they&#39;re silly.</p>

		<p>Maybe Worf&#39;s wish was that #warning would be supported *by both the C++ standard and the compiler*?</p>
<p>It&#39;s not like the C++ standard is set in stone and cannot be influenced. If we all pray for this feature each night then it might be part of C++0MG in time for our great-great-grandchildren&#39;s seventieth birthdays.</p>

		<p>Firefox developers keep trying to turn on warnings-as-errors but the problem is that newer compilers have more warnings&#8230; perhaps there should be a cut-off point, so that you only error for a known set of warnings.</p>

		<p>@ymett actually, for the standards that define #error, they do in fact require that the implementation &quot;fail to translate&quot; upon encountering it. But in no other circumstance do they require this.</p>

		<p>Actually, I work hard to clear all warnings from the source code, and mark &quot;surpress&quot; for places where I think the warning can be safely ignored (like those generic related ones.) when I worked on Java projects in my previous job. In my current job when is on C# again, I&#39;ll not leave any warnings behind.</p>
<p>Sometimes warning can tell you a potential bug before they come to bite you, so I&#39;ll make sure they&#39;re all assessed and either fixed or surpressed as okay.</p>

<p>Actually even in the days of WinXP where we only have 3 logs that can contain events, I use filtering to read all warnings and errors in order to make sure systems function properly.</p>
<p>In Vista or later, they encourage splitting logs to different container, and that&#39;s even more convenient.</p>

		<p>Ah, but #pragma message does <em>not</em> generate a warning. It&#39;s not listed in the IDE as a warning when looking for warnings and errors. So it&#39;s indeed worthless because people do not go sift through the basic compiler output. But I&#39;ve seen many sift through the processed output (the warnings/errors list). That&#39;s why you need a #warning (a #pragma warning would be fine too). But message is not enough.</p>

		<p>@barbie: Actually, it does generate a warning in the IDE&#39;s Error List as long as the message contains the phrase &quot;warning:&quot;. Likewise, if you write #pragma message( &quot;error: Don&#39;t do that.&quot; ) it will produce an error and compilation will fail.</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
