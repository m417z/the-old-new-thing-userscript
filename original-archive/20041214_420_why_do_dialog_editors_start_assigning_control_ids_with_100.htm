<p>
When you use a dialog editor and insert new
controls, they typically are assigned control IDs
starting at around 100.  Why?
</p>
<p>
Because the small numbers are already taken.
</p>
<pre>
/*
 * Dialog Box Command IDs
 */
#define IDOK                1
#define IDCANCEL            2
#define IDABORT             3
#define IDRETRY             4
#define IDIGNORE            5
#define IDYES               6
#define IDNO                7
#define IDCLOSE             8
#define IDHELP              9
#define IDTRYAGAIN         10
#define IDCONTINUE         11
</pre>
<p>
The dialog manager knows about these special values
and assumes that if your dialog box has a control whose
ID matches one of these special values, then it also
behaves in a certain way.
</p>
<p>
The dialog manager assumes that
a control whose ID is IDOK is an OK button.
If the user hits Enter, the default button will be pushed;
if no default button can be found, then the OK button is pushed.
Similarly, a control whose ID is IDCANCEL is assumed to be
a Cancel button.
If the user hits ESC or clicks the X button in the corner,
then the Cancel button is pushed.
</p>
<p>
If your dialog box has OK and Cancel buttons, make sure to
give them the IDOK and IDCANCEL control IDs so that they
act like proper OK and Cancel buttons.  Conversely, any
control with those IDs had better be proper OK and Cancel buttons.</p>

		<p>Cooney: Often enough that I&#8217;m tired of telling each person individually. Now I can tell everybody at once.</p>
<p>GregM: Because time travel has yet to be perfected. MFC (released in 1993) couldn&#8217;t reuse something that didn&#8217;t exist (IDHELP didn&#8217;t show up until 1995).</p>

<p>Do any of the other ID&#8217;s you list have different behavior?</p>
<p>Back in the day, It took me a while to figure out the significance of IDOK and IDCANCEL.</p>

		<p>On an application I used to work on, we&#8217;d get complaints from users that their settings weren&#8217;t sticking when they edited them with the preference dialogs.  We could never reproduce the problem.</p>
<p>Through a miraculous set of coincidences, we discovered that the customers with this problem were all former Macintosh users who believed that the little close box in the corner was the equivalent of OK rather than Cancel.  (We had a significant number of converts because the Mac version of our popular product had been discontinued.)</p>
<p>Tech support costs were a huge priority, so we made WM_CLOSE map to OK instead of Cancel.  We were careful to ensure the Escape key still did a cancel, and Tech Support never logged another complaint on this issue.</p>

<p>Well, sure.  This is a multiline edit control.  It&#8217;s designed to take enter presses itself, and overrides events that would normally occur.</p>
<p>Your problem with OE is a different sack of potatoes; the subject line is a single line edit control, so&#8230; yeah.  in Entourage (think Outlook for MacOS X) pressing Enter in the Subject area will send you to the Message Text area.</p>

<p>One bit of information that was omitted:  This rule does not apply when an edit control with an ES_WANTRETURN style has the input focus (this is often used with the ES_MULTILINE style).  Pressing Enter in this situation causes a carriage return to be issued to the edit control instead of causing a button to be pushed.</p>

<p>Norman:<br />
<br />Keep in mind that Raymond is only talking about dialog boxes here (or for message loops that use the IsDialogMessage() API) &#8212; in other words, only for UIs that use the dialog manager.</p>
<p>An application that isn&#8217;t using the dialog manager will not behave this way unless it was explicitly coded by someone to do so.</p>

		<p>In the project I&#8217;m currently working on, one of the specs is that the Enter key has a meaning.  Therefore we have to make sure that the Enter key *doesn&#8217;t* map onto an OK button, and we have to play a lot of other obscene tricks in programming in order to make sure that the program gets the Enter key instead of some control getting it.</p>
<p>While typing this response, I hit the Enter key twice between &quot;it.&quot; and &quot;While&quot;.  Fortunately that didn&#8217;t do an OK operation in Internet Explorer.</p>
<p>In Outlook Express the Enter key usually doesn&#8217;t do an OK operation, but sometimes it does when I didn&#8217;t want it to.  For example when typing a Subject line in Japanese, after hitting the Enter key to confirm a Kanji selection, another press of the Enter key causes the message to get sent.  Sometimes the extra press of the Enter key is unintended, sometimes it&#8217;s intended because it looks like the first press hadn&#8217;t made it through to the IME, etc.  After all there are enough cases where Outlook Express loses input keystrokes or loses input mouse clicks, it seems natural to hit Enter again after 10 seconds or so.  Of course Outlook Express&#8217;s option to refrain from sending until clicking the main send/receive button is valuable, but it&#8217;s still a nuisance to change folders and open up the message again and find where the latest intended edit was.  OK, sorry this is too long, but nonetheless there are places where we sure wish the Enter key didn&#8217;t do an OK.</p>

		<p>Norman: The Outlook Express composer window is not a dialog so if Enter maps to Send that&#8217;s a UI error in OE and not in the dialog manager. In OE 6 pressing Enter while editing the Subject field does nothing. (The keyboard shortcut for Send is Ctrl-Enter.) But perhaps the IME can trigger some unusual case in which just Enter is enough.</p>

		<p>I like feedback from buttons (maybe because I was raised on Mac). Even Petzold has few lines about it. That&#8217;s why I have some extra code<br />
<br />to make OK and Cancel buttons blink when Return or Esc are<br />
<br />pressed. Something like this:</p>
<p>SendMessage (btnHwnd, BM_SETSTATE, TRUE, 0);<br />
<br />SleepEx (100, TRUE);<br />
<br />SendMessage (btnHwnd, BM_SETSTATE, FALSE, 0);</p>
<p>SendMessage (parentHwnd, WM_COMMAND, MAKELONG(btnID, BN_CLICKED), (LPARAM)btnHwnd);</p>
<p>It work&#8217;s (button blinks) on Win98, but it doesn&#8217;t work on XP (styles turned ON).</p>

		<p>I agree with the other comments that Outlook Express does not seem to have the UI misdesign that I attributed to it.  I&#8217;m not sure but might have misremembered events in Internet Explorer, in which the UI misdesign was surely in the web page rather than Windows buttons.  Now I can only wonder if it was Outlook Web Access, since I don&#8217;t have an environment now in which to test this possible recollection.  Anyway I apologize for blaming Outlook Express.</p>
<p>Outlook Express did lose an inordinate amount of input from keystroke and mouse buttons though, requiring reinput of the lost items.  The most recent patch to Outlook Express might have fixed that, and I hope to get some feeling for this possibility after a few more weeks.  Windows Explorer and Internet Explorer sometimes lose keystrokes too, just not as often.  (For example in Windows Explorer, Ctrl-A Ctrl-C and notice that everything was indeed selected, move to another folder and do Ctrl-V but the copied items are either nothing or something repeated from an earlier Ctrl-C.)  I am sure that I&#8217;ve unintendedly sent e-mail as a result of reinputting an Enter key and then finding that the first press had not been lost after all.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
