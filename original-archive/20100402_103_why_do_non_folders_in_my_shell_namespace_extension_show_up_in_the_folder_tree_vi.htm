<blockquote class="q"><p> When we click the [+] button next to our shell namespace extension  in the folder tree view, the tree view shows both files and folders, even though it's supposed to show only folders. Our <code>IShell&shy;Folder::<wbr>Get&shy;Attributes&shy;Of</wbr></code> does return the correct values for <code>SFGAO_<wbr>FOLDER</wbr></code> (including it for the folders and omitting it for the non-folders). What are we doing wrong? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The tree view enumerates the children of a folder by calling <code>IShell&shy;Folder::<wbr>Enum&shy;Objects</wbr></code> and passing the <code>SHCONTF_<wbr>FOLDERS</wbr></code> flag while omitting the <code>SHCONTF_<wbr>NONFOLDERS</wbr></code> flag. This means that it is only interested in enumerating child folders. Child non-folders should be excluded from the enumeration. </p>
<p> It so happens that the customer's shell namespace extension was not respecting the <code>SHCONTF_<wbr>FOLDERS</wbr></code> and <code>SHCONTF_<wbr>NONFOLDERS</wbr></code> flags; it always enumerated all objects regardless of what the caller requested. </p>
<p> Fixing the enumerator fixed the problem. </p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not familiar with shell interaction, but from reading this it looks like they were just checking for SFGAO_FOLDER instead of SHCONTF_FOLDERS &#8212; is that right?</p>
<p>Googling for SFGAO_FOLDER doesn&#8217;t yield much information about what it is for, so I&#8217;m not sure if the customer&#8217;s confusion was reasonable or not.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>A basic understanding of the shell namespace was a prerequisite for today&#8217;s article. But just for you (don&#8217;t expect me to do this every time): <code>Get&shy;Attributes&shy;Of</code> is like <code>Get&shy;File&shy;Attributes</code> and <code>Enum&shy;Objects</code> is like <code>Find&shy;First&shy;File&shy;Ex</code> (except that the flags are mandatory instead of advisory). The customer basically said, &#8220;How come files are showing up in the folder tree? My <code>Get&shy;File&shy;Attributes</code> returns <code>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY</code> only for directories.&#8221; The reason was that their <code>Find&shy;First&shy;File&shy;Ex</code> was ignoring the <code>Find&shy;Ex&shy;Search&shy;Limit&shy;To&shy;Directories</code> flag and was returning all items even though the caller said &#8220;Give me only directories.&#8221; -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I was able to follow Raymond&#8217;s explanation even without knowing the details. The customer had obviously implemented IShell&#173;Folder::Enum&#173;Objects, but hadn&#8217;t done so correctly.</p>
<p>This situation is a bit like asking why your VCR doesn&#8217;t record the program you want, even though you selected the correct channel on your TV tuner &#8211; overlooking the fact that the VCR uses its own tuner to obtain the AV signals.</p>

		<p>I wonder why SHCONTF was renamed to SHCONT in the Vista SDK? And what does SHCONT stand for anyway? I&#8217;d wish MSDN would spell out these acronyms at least once, it helps me memorize them.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>I&#8217;m not aware of them being renamed to SHCONT at any point. And it&#8217;s not an acronym.

		<p>@asf: A lot of TVs (probably most of them today) also have AV output ports which could be connected to a VCR&#8217;s input, but I was talking about a setup that was once common &#8211; Antenna -&gt; RF IN, RF OUT -&gt; TV.</p>
<p>Even so, you might still have to make sure that the AV input is selected as the source.</p>
<p>To relate back to the topic &#8211; the customer might have assumed that the tree view would check the attributes of each item to see if it was a folder, but chose not to for performance reasons and because it was not necessary. I&#8217;ve thought of a hypothetical SQL example:</p>
<p>SELECT Name FROM Items WHERE Type = &#8216;folder&#8217;;</p>
<p>(No, I wouldn&#8217;t use strings in real life, this is just for simplicity!)</p>
<p>In this case, you&#8217;d trust that the database engine would only give you folders, like it was supposed to, rather than retrieving the &#8216;Type&#8217; column and checking every item to see if it was a folder.</p>
<p>Anyway, I believe Raymond&#8217;s point was what we&#8217;ve seen many times on this blog: if you don&#8217;t follow the documentation, expect things to break. (Pre-emptive snarky comment: Unless you&#8217;re writing software for Windows, in which case Microsoft will fix your crappy code for you, thus bloating the OS further!)</p>

		<p>@Falcon: In Europe, SCART is the most common connection between VCR and TV, not only can it transfer audio and video (composite,s-video and RGB) but it also supports control commands to change channels/AV input etc</p>

		<p>The MSDN Library for Visual Studio SP1 has an entry for the SHCONT enumerated type with this note:</p>
<p>&quot;Note &nbsp;The name of this enumeration was changed to SHCONT in Windows Vista. Earlier, it was named SHCONTF. The name SHCONTF is still defined through a typedef statement, however, so it can continue to be used by legacy code.&quot;</p>
<p>But you&#8217;re right, there&#8217;s no trace of SHCONT anywhere in shobjidl&#8230;</p>
<p>And <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/bb762539" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/bb762539</a> says: &quot;The name of this enumeration was changed to SHCONTF in Windows Vista. Earlier, it was named SHCONTF.&quot; Oops, but somebody has already reported this mistake.</p>

		<p>On the subject of SCART: SCART allows the composite video stream to go both ways, and also has a signal switching pin. Back in the analog days, you used to get receivers for encrypted TV which used this: The TV would send the currently received signal to the STB, it would detect that it was encrypted and decrypt it, send the decrypted signal back and turn on the signal switching pin to tell the TV to display its signal instead.</p>
<p>An interesting side-effect was that, depending upon your TV, this would make recording the show with your VCR</p>
<p>* Not work (Recording encrypted signal)</p>
<p>* Work only if in the right connector (Recording the decrypted signal which, for example, goes down to higher numbered connectors)</p>
<p>Of course, it is all a bit moot these days.</p>

		<p>Not sure exactly when this possibility first existed or was first removed (I think it began with 95/IE4 and was removed from W2K), but you could actually force Windows Explorer to do this, by typing a file:/// address (pointing to a local HTML file) into the Address bar in a Windows Explorer session. You&#8217;d render HTML in the files panel, but keep the Folders panel, which would list both folders and files in the tree. Still not sure if it was a bug or an unintended feature (if there&#8217;s a difference).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a bit fuzzy on exactly how to reproduce it after all this time, actually, and I don&#8217;t have any easy way to test it. But for folders with small numbers of files, it was sometimes handy when doing web development, or or a makeshift image view before XP added one.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
