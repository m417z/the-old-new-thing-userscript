<p>Some time ago, Microsoft began installing <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/05/14/2611278.aspx"> Starbucks coffee makers</a> in the kitchens, and caffeine addicts waited anxiously  for the machines to reach their building. Or at least that's what happened on the main Redmond campus. But what about the satellite offices?</p>
<p> I'm told that each satellite office qualified for an iCup machine when the number of employees at the office reached some magic value. One of my colleagues who works at the office in New York City told me that they eagerly awaited the arrival of the machine when they learned that they reached that threshold. The long-anticipated day arrived: The coffee machine was installed in the kitchen. </p>
<p> And it exploded. </p>
<p> Okay, it didn't really explode. But the receptacle for holding the spent grounds overflowed and burst, spilling its guts out onto the kitchen floor. If you didn't know what happened, you'd have thought it had exploded. </p>
<p> The reason it exploded was that, although the New York office is rather small, it does have a very high number of visitors. As you can imagine, clients pay visits to the New York offices for meetings, presentations, all that stuff that clients visit offices for; but the underlying algorithm for determining how many coffee machines each office receives doesn't take into account how many visitors each location receives. </p>
<p> Oh, and happy Guy Fawkes Day. Try not to blow up any coffee machines. </p>

		<p>That sounds like a pretty dodgy design &#8211; and I thought my current network scanner/copier/printer was bad, with a full waste toner bin being a &quot;fatal error&quot; which requires an engineer visit to clear, preventing even scanning until their engineer empties it! (On the bright side, it&#8217;s covered under the service contract and has always been same-day service, but still a crazy implementation.)</p>
<p>We recently salvaged an old coffee vending machine for our staff common room &#8211; one which uses single-serving pouches of coffee mix (or tea, chocolate etc) then dumps them into an internal bin. It&#8217;s bright enough to detect if the bin isn&#8217;t in place properly or is full, then refuses to vend until it&#8217;s fixed.</p>
<p>To be fair, I suppose the iCup things will be similar to the machines Starbucks uses in their own stores, which have maintenance routines which include checking the bin and cleaning regularly so this can&#8217;t happen; if the waste bin has slightly greater capacity than the input hopper and you empty the bin each time you fill the hopper, this won&#8217;t be an issue.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not being nit-picky.. I really do have a serious question.</p>
<p>Is it proper English to say &quot;Try not to &#8230;blah blah&quot;? &nbsp;Or is it proper to say &quot;Try to not &#8230;blah blah&quot;?</p>
<p>The first one always bothers me. &nbsp;How does one &quot;try not&quot;?</p>

		<p>@Boo: It&#8217;s &quot;Try not to do x.&quot; If you break it down as &quot;Try (not to do x)&quot; rather than &quot;(Try not) (to do x)&quot; you don&#8217;t have to wonder what &quot;try not&quot; means.</p>

		<p>Yes, the coffee is surprisingly good for machine made coffee. The beans are freshly ground for each cup.</p>
<p>There is a maintenence schedule, so the machines are emptied frequent;y. I suspect the large volume of visitors in the NYC office + the novelty of trying out the new machine resulted it the machine getting full well before anyone expected it to, hence your machine asplode.</p>

		<p>I always get a laugh out of exploding appliances. At our place just last week, the shower head exploded in the hands of the cleaning lady.</p>
<p>Of course she took it way too seriously. It&#8217;s hard to be all understanding when something similar has happened to oneself &#8211; sure, the first minute I was pretty pissed, but then I just laughed it off.</p>

		<p>My &quot;Mr Coffee&quot; actually did explode back in the early 80&#8217;s &nbsp; Luckily no one was in the kitchen when it happened. &nbsp;The heating coil area of the machine was the most damaged. &nbsp;Might of been the heavy calcium build up. &nbsp;I&#8217;d forgotten about it until I read the title. &nbsp;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
