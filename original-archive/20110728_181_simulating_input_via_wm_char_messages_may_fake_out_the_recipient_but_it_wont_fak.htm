<p>We saw some time ago that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/05/30/423202.aspx"> you can't simulate keyboard input with <code>Post&shy;Message</code></a>. You may get away with it, depending on how the application you're trying to fake out processes input, but since you're just faking data, the application may discover that it's all a ruse when they try to access information that you didn't fake out, say by calling <code>Get&shy;Key&shy;State</code> and discovering that the key it was told was being pressed is in fact not being pressed after all.</p>
<p> When you try to do this fake-out, you might or might not be able to fake out the application, but you're definitely not going to fake out the input system itself. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I wrote a test program that simulates input via <code>WM_CHAR</code> messages to write characters into Notepad. I set the local screen saver timeout to one minute, but the screen saver launches after one minute even if my program has been running. On the other hand, when I type on the physical keyboard, the screen saver does not kick in, as expected. How does the screen saver know that the system is really idle and the input is just being generated by a program? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Actually, the question is backwards. How does the screen saver find out about your fake input? Pumping <code>WM_CHAR</code> messages directly into Notepad bypasses the input system. It's not that it "knew" that you pulled an end run around it; it is merely acting on what it knows, and your fake input is not part of what it knows. </p>
<p> It's like prank-calling somebody and saying, "Hi, this is your credit card company. You don't need to pay your bill this month. Don't worry about it." Sure, that person may be fooled into not paying their bill, but a month later, they're going to get a late payment notice from the credit card company. "How does the credit card company know that the bill wasn't forgiven and the phone call was fake?" </p>
<p> If you want to generate input programmatically, use <code>Send&shy;Input</code>. </p>
<p> Note that the window manager still knows whether the input came from hardware or from <code>Send&shy;Input</code>, and the <code>SPI_<wbr>SET&shy;BLOCK&shy;SEND&shy;INPUT&shy;RESETS</wbr></code> system parameter controls whether programmatically-generated input should reset the screen saver. </p>

		<p>Or you could, you know, have your program disable the screen saver while it runs.</p>
<p>Though I love SendInput. &nbsp;Used it to make a library for .NET so I can simulate keyboard/mouse input with a Wii Remote. &nbsp;Good times.</p>

		<p>@Mark: Or a full-screen game. &nbsp;I&#39;ve had the screensaver toggle in the middle of long cutscenes/movies before, and it is not a pleasant experience.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I&#39;ve also had it toggle while watching DVDs and YouTube videos. It can be more trouble than it&#39;s worth sometimes, and there are more legitimate reasons to disable it than you might think at first.</p>

		<p>@Mason Wheeler:</p>
<p>That really depends on how the application is doing it. &nbsp;In my experience, programs that use a &quot;real&quot; full screen mode don&#39;t get interrupted by screensavers, while ones that fake it, by creating a borderless window the size of your viewing area, do get interrupted by the screen saver. &nbsp;Unless they&#39;ve used some other trick to block it, presumably like what Bob suggested.</p>

		<p>@R Bemrose: It&#39;s not a trick, it&#39;s the whole point of SetThreadExecutionState. It tells Windows &quot;even though the user may not appear to be interacting with the PC, it would be really inconvenient for that user if the system were to sleep or the display were to turn off.&quot; Programs that use it include, but are not limited to:</p>
<ul>
<li>DVD/Video Players</li>
<li>
<p>CD/DVD Burners</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Games</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Presentation programs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Voice chat clients</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Backup programs</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>More!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these do not go into fullscreen mode. Some don&#39;t even have UI all the time. However, they still need to block the computer from becoming idle.</p>
<p>(Also, I suspect that fullscreen programs do not necessarily get this protection automatically. They still have to call this function too!)</p>

		<p>Alex: SetThreadExecutionState is actually just a power management function. Its job is to prevent the monitor and/or computer from shutting down automatically. The screensaver is somebody else&#39;s job.</p>

		<p>These days its better to just have the screen go into power save mode.</p>
<p>Power save mode does just as much (if not more) to save your screen (CRT or otherwise) from burn-in and uses even less electricity than a screensaver does.</p>

		<p>If I remember correctly, even if you do things right as a media player/etc, if you have the screensaver lock the computer, it will still effect the screensaver after the timeout period. &nbsp;I can&#39;t find the reference but I know that was the observed behavior with Media Center and Windows Media Player.</p>

		<p>Yeah, that&#39;s the new behavior under the Vista/7 regime. Handling SC_SCREENSAVE (as Raymond mentioned earlier) doesn&#39;t prevent the machine from locking by design. It does work under XP and earlier, though.</p>

		<p>It might be worth mentioned that sending WM_CHAR cannot be used to change the &#39;shift&#39; state of the keyboard. So while you might be able to fake sending characters to notepad, you will not be able to change the case of the characters.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
