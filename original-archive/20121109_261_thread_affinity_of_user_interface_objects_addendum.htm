<p>Some time ago, I discussed <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/10/11/479587.aspx"> the thread affinity of device contexts</a>, noting that the <code>Get&shy;DC</code> and <code>Release&shy;DC</code> functions must be called from the same thread.</p>
<p> The same restriction also applies to printer DCs. Printer DCs must be created and destroyed on the same thread. The printing team imposed this additional rule in order to make it easier for printer driver vendors to author their drivers. (Printer driver developers have a habit of calling <code>CoInitialize</code> in their implementation of <code>CreateDC</code> and <code>CoUninitialize</code> in their implementation of <code>DeleteDC</code>.) </p>
<p> Given that printer drivers are <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/07/03/8682463.aspx"> a third-party extension point</a>, it's probably in your best interest to treat printer DCs as having hard thread affinity, since who knows what the printer driver is going to do if you try to access it from multiple threads. In other words, the thread that creates the printer DC should be the only thread which prints to it, and should also be the thread which destroys the printer DC when printing is complete. </p>
<p> That's not saying that all your printing has to be done from one thread. If you want, you can create multiple printer DCs, each on different threads. Just make sure to use each printer DC only on the thread that created it. Your printer driver will thank you. </p>

<p>Which had amusing consequences in an MFC 6.0 program I maintained that didn&#39;t use COM: the MFC CPrintDialog works by hooking window creation, calling ::PrintDlg(), and subclassing the next window to be created. In this case, that turned out to be a hidden window created by CoInitialize, rather than the Windows common dialog it was expecting.</p>

		<p>&quot;Printer driver developers have a habit of calling CoInitialize in their implementation of CreateDC&quot; &#8212; hmm, does that imply that it is not safe to print from a thread that already belongs to the multithreaded apartment? That wasn&#39;t apparent from the documentation of CreateDC. (Nor does it seem to be stated in the general introduction to printing parts of MSDN, as far as a cursory skim goes).</p>

		<p>Microsoft will never get rid of the bad reputation from programmers until they build a stack of replacement to current COM interfaces that don&#39;t load foreign forth-party DLLs into third-party processes by default. This path is madness.</p>

		<p>Henning,</p>
<p>Bingo! I&#39;d already tried to post a comment regarding HP&#39;s cruddy drivers but my comment disappeared. (Mmm&#8230;does this blog not like Firefox?) Anyways, post-printing, some HP drivers stupidly call COUninitialize() *regardless* of whether their COInitialize call succeeded (it will fail with RPC_E_CHANGED_MODE if COM has already been set up as multithreaded and the COM load/unload counter will not be incremented). </p>
<p>Post-printing, since the driver&#39;s COInitialize() failed the COUninitialize() is unbalanced (the COM load counter is decremented without it being incremented by COInitialize) and the result is that the COM system is uninitialized by the *@#% driver. Poof, any COM objects held by your app are gone.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve always wondered who to blame when an application only crashes when printing to one particular driver. (In my case I think I worked around it by launching the application from WinDbg -G -g with a saved workspace with a breakpoint on the faulting instruction that jumped over it&#8230;)</p>

		<p>@Erik: I&#39;ll admit that I had to read &quot;To close the COM library gracefully, each successful call to CoInitialize or CoInitializeEx, including those that return S_FALSE, must be balanced by a corresponding call to CoUninitialize&quot; in the documentation carefully several times before I noticed that it is only SUCCESSFUL calls that must be balanced with CoUninitialize. It is very easy to misinterpret &quot;including those that return S_FALSE&quot; as &quot;even those that fail&quot;. Bad naming for a successful return code, I think.</p>

<p>In Windows 7 I can&#39;t pin the &quot;Microsoft Help Viewer&quot; that comes with Visual Studio 2012 to the taskbar, and its jump list only contains a &quot;Close&quot; option (none of the other usual ones). I have never seen this behaviour from any other window.</p>
<p>In Windows 8 I can pin it.</p>
<p>So, what was wrong and what changed?</p>

		<p>Ugh, HP printer drivers. I&#39;ve seen a bunch of problems because of them, weird error/crash messages, random garbage printed at set time and uninstallers that don&#39;t do anything (it&#39;s gotten bad enough that many of the recent drivers ship with programs that manually uninstall older driver versions, because the only other way is to use MS FixIt and have that remove 20-30 separate packages they install).</p>
<p>@Erik: the blog will eat your comment if it&#39;s been too long between the page loaded and you pressing Post &#8211; best to copy the comment to clipboard, refresh the page and then post it.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
