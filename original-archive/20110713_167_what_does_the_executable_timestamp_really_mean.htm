<p>A customer was looking for some information on the executable timestamp:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I would like my program to display the date it was linked. The <code>IMAGE_<wbr>FILE<wbr>_HEADER.<wbr>Time&shy;Date&shy;Stamp</wbr></wbr></wbr></code> looks like what I need. Is there an easy way to retrieve this information so I don't have to parse the EXE header myself? Also, what functions exist for formatting this timestamp into something human-readable? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The customer didn't explain why they needed this information, but presumably it was for diagnostic purposes. For example, the program might display the information in the <i>About</i> box to help the product support team identify which version of the program the end-user is running. </p>
<p> We'll answer the questions in reverse order, and then answer a question that wasn't even asked. </p>
<p> The timestamp is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/05/54806.aspx"> a Unix-style <code>time_t</code> timestamp</a>; therefore, you can use the <code>ctime</code> function to convert it to text. If there is a particular format you like, you can use the appropriate time formatting function (though you may have to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/brada/archive/2003/07/30/50205.aspx"> convert it first</a>). </p>
<p> If you want to retrieve this value, you can use <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jmstall/archive/2007/01/18/timestamps.aspx"> helper functions in the <code>imagehlp</code> library</a>; the one most applicable here appears to be <code>Image&shy;Nt&shy;Header</code> or even <code>Get&shy;Time&shy;stamp&shy;For&shy;Loaded&shy;Library</code>. </p>
<p> The unasked question is "Does this in fact give me the date and time that the image was linked?" Fortunately, I don't have to write out the answer to this question, because <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/03/18/9980802.aspx"> I answered it last year</a>. The name <i>timestamp</i> is misleading. Its real purpose is to act as a signature so that the operating system can determine whether a DLL against which one set of values was precalculated matches the DLL physically on the system. A better name for it would have been <code>UniqueId</code>. </p>

		<p>Why import a whole DLL and add more dependencies to your executable when you can do it in a simple one-liner:</p>
<p>((IMAGE_NT_HEADERS*)(((LPBYTE)(&amp;__ImageBase))+pDosHeader-&gt;e_lfanew))-&gt;FileHeader.TimeDateStamp</p>
<p>Replace (&amp;__ImageBase) with an HMODULE to find the timestamp of something else than the current module.</p>

		<p>This is the kind of one-liner I would rather see expanded into three or four lines :)</p>
<p>Admittedly, I don&#39;t do a lot of C coding these days, but those casts are a bit hard to follow&#8230;</p>

		<p>Many years ago (definitely before connect.microsoft.com, possibly before <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com</a>) I made the suggestion (most likely via Microsoft&#39;s CompuServe forum) of a simple change to LINK.EXE : If it encountered an otherwise undefined external named (for example) &quot;$$DATE&quot;, it should define it with the current date/time. &nbsp;I simple solution to all the problems like this.</p>

		<p>@James Curran: &nbsp;You&#39;re asking the linker to interpret the name of an undefined variable, and figure out what it should hold? &nbsp;Does it need to allow for names such as $$DATE in all supported languages? &nbsp;It would need a table of variables and some sort of way to determine what the variable should be replaced with.</p>
<p>There aren&#39;t that many different variables that can be replaced with obvious values. &nbsp;The constant Pi, and maybe $$DATE, and $$TIME, and c (for the speed of light in a vacuum), and &#8230; what else?</p>

		<p>I wrote a program once that parsed and displayed all of the nitty gritty details (image flags and whatnot) from a PE executable. &nbsp;One of the things I learned is that, because the timestamp is only used to optimize the loader, there&#39;s not actually a standard. &nbsp;For example, MS linkers use a time_t format, but Borland&#39;s linker used (maybe still uses?) an internal time format used by DOS for something or other.</p>

		<p>@Csaboka: By the time you&#39;ve added proper validation that the bytes in front of you *are* a PE image, and possibly coded up x86 and x64 flavours of the same, I expect that even Koro would want to break this up into three or four lines, or maybe even use IMAGEHLP.</p>

		<p>@David Walker: It&#39;s not an undefined variable. The linker works with symbols &#8211; it knows little about the language below. We&#39;re just asking that the linker perhaps define __LinkDateTime (32-bit value) as one of its symbols.</p>
<p>The linker certainly can do that, and we can ignore it or use it (it&#39;s a discardable symbol).</p>
<p>Heck, programs can GetProcAddress that too to see if they&#39;re loading 9ld stuff or new stuff.</p>

		<p>This doesn&#39;t work on WinCE 5.0+ because programs cannot read it&#39;s own images any longer, they do not have read access to their own image files. Why? Nobody at ms support knows why this change was made.</p>
<p>And secondly, this blog software suck, please fix it.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
