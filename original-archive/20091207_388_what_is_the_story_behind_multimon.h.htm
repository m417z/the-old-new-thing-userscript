<p>Commenter asdf wonders <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#705379"> what the deal is with that <code>multimon.h</code> header file</a>.</p>
<p> Let's set some context. That header file was written back in the time when Windows&nbsp;98 was still under development. Windows&nbsp;98 was the first version of Windows to support multiple monitors. At the time, most application authors  had Windows&nbsp;95 as their target platform. And even after Windows&nbsp;98 shipped, the expectation was that programmers would target both Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;98 for at least a little while longer. </p>
<p> The problem then is convincing programmers to write their code in a manner that works well in the face of multiple monitors. If you say, "Well, you need to call these functions, but only if running on a version of Windows which supports multiple monitors. If running on an older version of Windows, then you'll need to keep doing things the old way because the functions you want to call don't exist there." </p>
<p> Remember, if you want people to do something that doesn't directly benefit them, you need to make it easy or they won't bother. Therefore, the <code>multimon.h</code> header file was created which did the dirty work of checking whether it was running on a version of Windows which supported multiple monitors. If so, then it called those functions, and if not, then it emulated them. Applications could then use the <code>multimon.h</code> header file and write code on the assumption that the operating system supported multiple monitors: If it didn't, then the stub functions in <code>multimon.h</code> would kick in and implement "fake multimonitor support". For example, if you called <code>GetSystemMetrics(SM_CMONITORS)</code>, the stub function would simply return&nbsp;1. If you asked for <code>GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXVIRTUALSCREEN)</code>, the stub function just gave you the width of the (one) monitor. </p>
<p> Of course, those old versions of Windows which don't support multiple monitors are long obsolete, and there is no longer any need for the <code>multimon.h</code> header file. It long ago accomplished its intended goal. Give it a nice pat on the back. </p>
<p> But the header file still lingers in the Platform&nbsp;SDK. If you have a program written back in the days when you couldn't count on multiple monitor support, then removing that header file would result in a build break in your program. That wouldn't be fun. </p>

<p>I&#8217;m there there are hundreds or thousands of programs out there originally targeted for Windows 95, which get occasional updates (business rules change, for example), and therefore still need the header to compile.</p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>I believe we know your stance on backwards compatibility, but I would like to know what you think about Apple&#8217;s strategy regarding this. In Apple-land, builds regularly break if you switch over to a new SDK. You can keep on using the old SDK, but only until it is removed (you can of course keep an old machine around running an older OS with an older version of the tools).</p>
<p>As annoying as I sometimes think some of the outwardly arbitrary breaking changes are, when reading stories like this I can&#8217;t help but feel that this forced rejuvenation of my and others&#8217; code is actually a good thing.</p>
<p>I realize that this policy would never work in Windows-land due to a multitude of business and economic reasons (I can only imagine the volume of complaints about &quot;forced upgrades&quot; if Microsoft ever switched to something like this), but what do you think?</p>

		<p>No one uses Macs for custom business code, or any sort of code that has to last past one year. &nbsp;Therefore, it really doesn&#8217;t matter if Apple breaks things on every SDK release.</p>

		<p>Another header file that does something similar is NewAPIs.h included with older SDKs. It is now removed in the latest SDKs because it is no longer needed</p>

		<p>@Random099: Seems thread-safe to me. There&#8217;s the possibility of doing initialization more than once, but I don&#8217;t see why that would be an issue. Besides, I can&#8217;t imagine why you&#8217;d use this on a non-UI thread anyway.</p>
<p>Also, what would be the point of removing the file? All you&#8217;d do is save a whole 16KB of the platform SDK&#8230;</p>

		<p>@A different asdf : Apple strategy is just stupid, they just lose their customers:</p>
<p>I coded a program which should works from Win95 up to 7 and also should works on OSX.</p>
<p>It was working great on OSX 10.3 and 10.4, then for some reasons it didn&#8217;t work correctly on 10.5 and up.</p>
<p>I just had to tell my customers to buy PCs to continue to use my software. I had lost enough time and money to try to get my soft working on OSX, now they had to spend time and money buying and learning Windows. They didn&#8217;t have choice because my software is linked to the services my customers wants from me.</p>
<p>BTW: I don&#8217;t have anymore customers using Win9x, they all have at least Win2000 :)</p>

		<p>@Dean Harding</p>
<p>&gt; @Random099: Seems thread-safe to me.</p>
<p>At least strongly implementation-dependent. Consider the following scenario:</p>
<p>[1] In a call to xGetSystemMetrics, Thread A calls InitMultipleMonitorStubs and successfully initializes the function pointers.</p>
<p>[2] Before it processes the line</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;g_fMultiMonInitDone = TRUE; return TRUE;</p>
<p>thread B has its turn. Since g_fMultiMonInitDone is not yet set, Thread B will again attempt to initialize the function pointers.</p>
<p>[3] Thread B&#8217;s call to GetModuleHandle fails due to a memory allocation error. (Note that either GetModuleHandleA or GetModuleHandleW probably requires a string mapping.)</p>
<p>[4] At some time after thread B sets g_pfnGetSystemMetrics=NULL, thread A resumes control. It sets g_fMultiMonInitDone to TRUE, returns TRUE from InitMultipleMonitorStubs, and consequently calls g_pfnGetSystemMetrics. At that point the program will crash.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Good theoretical analysis, but in this case, the header file takes advantage of implementation details that avoid the problem. (The kernel pre-allocates memory for simple string thunks which can be used under certain conditions, and this happens to be one of them.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>It is a great strength of MS&#8217; that they keep these old &quot;no longer needed&quot; stubs around. I know there are people who dislike this &#8211; heck, in my own code I remove stuff like this &#8211; but knowing that I can recompile old working code to accommodate a change is a big part of the reason I only target Windows for my customers&#8217; bespoke apps.</p>
<p>If MS didn&#8217;t have this attitude, I&#8217;d probably just not update my SDK/Dev environment. Which is MS&#8217; loss as much as my own (I won&#8217;t be using any of their new features).</p>

		<p>@Teo: &quot;Hint: compile a program using the Vista VSS SDK, and try running it on XP &#8211; yes, it crashes.&quot; This is a bug in XP with the way manifests are treated, not a by-design backwards compat break, and it&#8217;s been fixed in SP3.

		<p>Comparing Microsoft and Apple on backwards compatibility and market share, which is the chicken, which is the egg?</p>
<p>Say what you will about Steve Ballmer, but he was spot on with his &quot;Developers Developers Developers Developers!&quot; speech.</p>

		<p>Yes, the strong backwards compatibility is a very, very good feature, but the price is that writing software that wants to use new features but still work on older platforms is one big giant ridiculously messed &#8220;thing&#8221; (and that &#8220;thing&#8221; has hundreds of tentacles and three rows of steel teeth, oh and eats babies for snack). For example, the structures for menus and toolbars are so different on Vista and XP that you need special ifs on various places in your code. Mind you, menus and toolbars are just the START, the real hidden dragons await later.</p>
<p>Also, as I discovered, MS *tells* everybody, how Windows SDK is oh so backwards compatible, but in practice it is NOT. It breaks arbitrary. Hint: compile a program using the Vista VSS SDK, and try running it on XP &#8211; yes, it crashes. No, you are not using Vista-specific calls.</p>

		<p>@alt-92, I know. This very well proves that it is *very maddeningly hard* to write a Windows program that runs on particular version of Windows *and* uses features of newer versions of Windows when available. To understand my point of view, try to build a program that runs on XP correctly and when run on Vista, uses functionality from IVssBackupComponentsEx2.</p>
<p>Raymond, you are correct that it is better something to be possible and so on and so forth, but you miss a problem: Windows is a *graphical* ui os. If showing the *menu* of your window is so hard that you cannot do it right from the first time, then there is a very deep problem. I&#8217;ve seen such mistakes in gui frameworks, which are supposed to abstract away these issues. Imagine the novice GUI developers&#8217; life.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to the topic of this article. </p>
<p>And it is that regretfully, I have to point that multimon.h is probably one of the last times when MS actually allowed programmers to transparently use newer functionality with older OSes. After it, there&#8217;s the gdi+ redist and the FileExtd.h which covers just XP/2003. Why did MS stopped helping us programmers cover more of their platforms?</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
