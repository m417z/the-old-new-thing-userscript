<p>Some time in the early part of this century, somebody sent a message to the <i>Windows NT Development Announcements</i> mailing list at Microsoft. It went something like, "My car was parked in &laquo;location&nbsp;X&raquo; and somebody ran into it and didn't leave a note. Does anybody have any information about this?"</p>
<p> Now, one thing you need to know is that the <i>Windows NT Development Announcements</i> mailing list has the entire Windows division as members. We're talking thousands of people. And the sort of announcements sent to the alias are not the "somebody dinged my car" type of announcements. They are announcements like "We will be <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/07/10171801.aspx"> reformatting the scratch server</a> on Tuesday." Important stuff that everybody on the team needs to know. And it's most certainly not for discussions. </p>
<p> Anyway, somebody replied to the message saying something like "Yeah, my car was parked in the same area and it got damaged, too." And then somebody else decided to be silly and wrote, "I parked my car in Germany once and it got damaged. I wonder if that's related." </p>
<p> Before things could <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-mail_storm"> spiral out of control</a>, Jim Allchin, vice president of Windows, stepped in and sent a message to everybody. "Stop replying to this thread." </p>
<p> That shut the thread down really quickly. Nothing like your vice president telling you to shut up to get you to shut up. </p>
<p> There was one reply that came through, though. It was a reply to Jim's message saying to stop replying. The person wrote, "Yes sir, captain sir. Saluting as I type, sir." </p>
<p> I have no confirmation that anybody ever saw that person alive again. </p>

<p>I find this sentence disturbingly close to the journalist ones from yesterday. All in jest, I know, but still&#8230;</p>

		<p>We Germans tend to use â€žthese quotation marks,â€œ at least when doing it correctly. Â«ThisÂ» is more of a Swiss thing, although you may occasionally see Â»thisÂ« being used in Germany; this is more commonly used in novels.</p>

		<p>Those &quot;Swiss/German&quot; quotation marks are called guillemets. Knowing this has never once helped me. &nbsp;The wikipedia page has all sorts of information about them, including which countries use them pointing in, and which use them pointing out.</p>

		<p>We have a similar thing happen on one of our internal mailing lists once a month or so. There&#39;s usually a couple of &quot;sensible&quot; replies followed by a few jokey ones before some big wig (or someone who thinks they are, anyway) steps in and shuts the conversation down.</p>
<p>Personally the latter always leaves a sour taste in my mouth. Some people take email way too seriously.</p>

		<p>The problem is simply, that all the guys who want to/should get work done have to do your emails first, because they come though the no-nonse this is serious stuff list, which all the thousand or more coworkers simply have to read. Additionally, there&#39;s a really dangerous slippery slope to making the list unusable for its assigned role. You <em>like</em> wading though tons of spam every day?</p>
<p>So, whats your alternative to one of the big wigs taking the big hammer and shutting that drain down, before it spirals out of control?</p>
<p>(You may keep the hyperbole, if there was any).</p>

		<p>Deduplicator &#8211; valid points, all, except in my organisation it&#39;s usually two or three emails max. Hardly &quot;tons of spam&quot; to wade through, but some people seem to react as if it is. I&#39;m not saying these things should get out of hand but what&#39;s five or so emails a month between friends (or colleagues)?</p>
<p>Personally, I use inbox rules to filter mailing list emails into folders so I can peruse them at my leisure, when I get the time.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
