<p>I took part in a casual bike ride last month in celebration of a friend's daughter's birthday. Our first stop was <a href="http://trophycupcakes.com/"> Trophy Cupcakes</a> in Wallingford. It was there that I discovered that my wallet was missing. I checked my pockets several times, but the wallet was gone. I was pretty sure I had brought it with me, but there was an outside chance that I had simply forgotten it from the get-go.</p>
<p> The rest of the bike ride was pleasant enough. Well, I took a tumble on the Elliott Bay Bike Trail after coming down the overpass ramp: I was a bit too effective at keeping right and ended up catching the railroad tracks that parallel the trail. Fortunately, I had overprepared for the cold weather and wore four layers of pants, so I got off completely unscathed. </p>
<p> Okay, so aside from wiping out that one time, the ride was quite pleasant, but the thought that I had lost my wallet nagged at me for the rest of the day. On the way home after the ride, I retraced my path, stopping to examine more closely the areas where I had stopped to remove a jacket or adjust some clothing. But sadly, no wallet. </p>
<p> When I got home, I checked my e-mail hoping against hope that somebody had found the wallet and deduced how to contact me from whatever hadn't already been stolen from it. And lo and behold, there was a message waiting for me from a person who works in the area we cycled through and who found my wallet barely a half hour after I had lost it. (And probably even before I realized that I had lost my wallet at all.) </p>
<p> I jokingly thought to myself, "Well, when I go to pick up my wallet, how can I prove that it's mine? I don't have any identification with me; it's all in the wallet!" But of course, my picture is on my identification, so it's pretty obvious that I'm the right person. </p>
<p> I offered the finder a reward, but he declined it, saying, "You'd do the same for me if the roles were reversed." He was right, of course. And as far as I can tell, nothing was missing from my wallet. Even the fortune cookie fortune was still there, one that I'd been carrying around in my wallet for months for good luck. </p>
<p> What was the fortune? </p>
<div style="padding: 2ex"> <span style="border: .75pt solid black; padding: 1ex; background: #ffffd0"> Soon you will hear very good news. </span> </div>
<p> Behold the power of the fortune cookie fortune. </p>

		<p>This has been one of your least people-cynical posts in a while. &nbsp;It combined an interesting personal story with several details (but others an active imagination could fill in, if desired) with a dose of goodwill &#8212; and no preemptive snarky comment to shatter the goodwill factor. &nbsp;I like it. &nbsp;Thanks for the read.</p>

		<p>If you just go by what you see on the news, the world is filled with evil people just waiting to take advantage of you.</p>
<p>But in reality, most people are decent and try to do the right thing (I think). It sure is a great feeling when you get to experience that first hand&#8230;</p>

		<p>For <em>years</em> now I&#8217;ve been waiting to find someone&#8217;s wallet, so that I can return it after having <em>put more money into it</em>. &nbsp;Maybe a $20. &nbsp;To, y&#8217;know, <em>really</em> mess with their head.</p>

		<p>One of my biggest fears is that my wallet will get lost. I dropped a cell phone once and a (I must admit beautiful on many levels) lady immediately grabbed it up and chased me down. The only chance I&#8217;ve had to reciprocate is that on occasion I correct a shop keepers math, in their favor. ;o)</p>

		<p>As someone says above, you can trust 95% of people. But the problem is that you don&#8217;t know if a stranger is in the remaining 5% :-( . Because of that, when somebody acts like he/she is from the 95% (if you follow me), you usually are (grately) surprised, as Raymond did.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s good to read stories from the human side of the engineer. At least, if I my knowledges or psychic powers aren&#8217;t even remotely similar to Raymond&#8217;s, it makes him nearer :-) .</p>

		<p>Hi Reymond !</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t found any way to contact you. &nbsp;Sorry for post this question here.</p>
<p>I want know if Windows has internals functions to parser a command-line like:</p>
<p>Command part inside quotes:</p>
<p>&quot;c:program filesmy test.exe&quot; /xyz</p>
<p>All command inside quotes:</p>
<p>&quot;c:program filesmy teste.exe /xyz&quot;</p>
<p>Command without quotes:</p>
<p>c:program filesmy teste.exe /xyz</p>
<p>The question is: &nbsp; How Windows know if my program is &quot;c:program&quot; or &quot;c:program filesmy&quot; or &quot;c:program filesmy test.exe&quot; ?</p>
<p>Thank you</p>

		<p>My wallet fortune reads:</p>

		<p>Marcos,</p>
<p>You mean beside the &quot;Contact Me&quot; link on the right hand side?</p>
<p>Yes yes, I know it doesn&#8217;t give you an email address, but if Raymond doesn&#8217;t provide a email address because he explicitly says he doesn&#8217;t do tech support, do you think he&#8217;s going to answer you in a comment?</p>
<p>p.s. spelling his name wrong is sure not to earn browny points either.</p>

		<p>&quot;How Windows know if my program is &quot;c:program&quot; or &quot;c:program filesmy&quot; or &quot;c:program filesmy test.exe&quot; ?&quot;</p>
<p>I can answer that for you. &nbsp;Because when I was curious I actually tried it instead of asking questions :)</p>
<p>It depends on where you do it. &nbsp;If you&#8217;re passing it to most API functions then Windows makes no attempts to separate it out or dequote it &#8212; it&#8217;s expecting you to provide a proper filename yourself.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re typing it at the command line, then the program name is everything left of the first unquoted space.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re using CreateProcess, then read the fine MSDN help, since it explains exactly how it works.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re typing it in the Run box, then it works much the same as CreateProcess.</p>

		<p>I once had an instance of someone&#8217;s trying too hard to do the right thing that it backfired &#8211; I was walking into class one day with my iPod in my pocket and my headphones around my neck. &nbsp;During the shuffle as the previous class was leaving and my class was entering, someone managed to accidentally knock my iPod out of my pocket.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t notice until halfway through class, and I&#8217;m sure I would have found it on the floor after class was over, except that someone from the previous class must have decided that it belonged to someone leaving that class and ran off to the lost-and-found with it. &nbsp;I eventually got it back, but it took a lot more effort than it would have had that person not been so proactive.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
