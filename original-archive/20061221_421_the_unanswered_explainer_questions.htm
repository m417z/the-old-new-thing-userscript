<p><a href="http://www.slate.com/?id=3944&amp;cp=1787"> Slate's Explainer column</a> answers questions about current events. Sometimes they do it multiple times, as they did when I asked them how to pronounce the name Pinochet and they said <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/1001989/"> Pee-no-CHAY</a>, then later corrected themselves with <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2131164/"> pin-oh-CHET</a>, and then again re-corrected themselves with <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2155292/"> Yes</a>.</p>
<p> Yesterday, the Explainer provided <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2155836/"> a selection of the questions they received and didn't answer</a> and invited the readers to vote on which one they would like to see answered. My favorite question was the one that begins "I have a sister that stresses the hell out of me," and goes on and on about the car accident, how her sister complains and complains, how she had to tell the sister to stop bugging her with her problems, I mean, I was in a car accident, and concludes, "I really need to know if a person can really stress you out with the same old thing over and over and over again. PLEASE ANSWER BACK ASAP." Comedy gold. If you made this stuff up people would say it was too unrealistic. </p>
<p> As for which one I would actually like answered, I don't know. They're all so goofy, and the answer wouldn't be all that enlightening. </p>

		<p>&quot;I really need to know if a person can really stress you out with the same old thing over and over and over again&quot;</p>
<p>Presumably the answer would be &quot;See the comments on The Old New Thing and what it does to poor Raymond&quot; :-)</p>

		<p>I really would like to know if all that cookie dough from ice cream could be collected and turned into real cookies. I propose melting the ice cream and filtering out the little dough pellets. Then roll them up into little balls and back them.</p>

		<p>The question I would like to have answered:</p>
<p>Mr. Chen. &nbsp;What made you decide to become a developer and not something else (i.e. musician, writer, geologist, et. al.)?</p>
<p>Also, Mr. Chen, this is my first post to your blog using Windows Vista RTM (TechNet Plus subscriber). &nbsp;I&#8217;d like to thank you for a job well done. &nbsp;Vista is a pleasure to use!</p>
<p>James</p>

		<p>I read this explainer yesterday and had a good laugh. &nbsp;I&#8217;d love to see a treatment of the probability of ingesting a molecule of Abraham Lincoln&#8217;s.</p>

		<p>There are so many good ones I don&#8217;t think I could choose just one. &nbsp;Hopefully someone else will give some else like Cecil Adams will give the unanswered ones some treatment.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Raymond, do you stairs in your house?
</p></blockquote>
<p>I do believe the phrase &quot;comedy gold&quot; has become a common part of internet parlance by now.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve always wondered why raw cookie dough was only considered safe to eat in ice cream. The fact that they have left out the eggs when adding it to ice cream would explain that (the raw eggs in cookie dough are a potential source of food poisoning until baked).</p>

<p>Holding them at gunpoint would probably work. :S</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
