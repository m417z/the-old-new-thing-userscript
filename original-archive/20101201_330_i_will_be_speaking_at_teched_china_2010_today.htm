<p>As I've mentioned a few times by now, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/22/10041191.aspx"> the way to get me to show up at your event is to invite me</a>. The easiest (i.e. cheapest) way is to hold your event in the Seattle area so that my travel expenses are effectively zero; I just use my bus pass. The folks at TechEd China 2010, on the other hand, had to fly me all the way out to Beijing, which is where I've been this week.</p>
<p> Preparing these talks is a lot of work, because each one is different. It's not like I have a "stock presentation" that I give over and over. So even if you invite me, I may decline because I simply don't have the time to write up a new presentation for your event, and if your event is outside the Seattle area, I may decline because the travel would take me away for too long. (The TechEd China folks actually invited me last year, but I already had accepted <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/10/07/9904046.aspx"> an out-of-town invitation</a> and couldn't really afford two out-of-town presentations in one year.) </p>
<p> Anyway, if you can read Chinese, then you can <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/zh-cn/gg486881.aspx"> check out the TechEd China 2010 Web site</a>&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;nobody told me that crossed arms was the official speaker pose of TechEd China 2010&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;my <a href="http://www.registermsg.com/teched2010/content/speaker.aspx"> speaker biography</a> and <a href="http://www.teched.com.cn/2010/customer/y/SessionView_pop.asp?SessionID=DEV-LANG-300-7"> the talk description</a>. I can't read Chinese, so I'm trusting the translators to have done a good job. </p>
<p> I've found that a good way to salvage content that I've deleted from the queue (because the topic draws out flame comments) is to use them in talks and presentations instead. It turns out that the people who actually show up for a talk are much more polite than those who just post snarky comments from their mother's basement. I think the fact that you have to be snarky in person removes the veil of anonymity and makes you more accountable for what you say. </p>
<p> And since I know you're going to ask: </p>
<ul>
<li>I'm giving the talk in English. </li>
<li>I don't know whether the talk is going to be recorded. </li>
<li>The talk is being given on December&nbsp;2, even though this entry     is dated December&nbsp;1.     That's because it will already be December&nbsp;2 in China. </li>
</ul>

		<p>I quite enjoyed Raymond&#39;s speaker profile from that site, translated courtesy of Chrome: &quot;Raymond Chen is a Microsoft programmer, involved in the development of multiple versions of Windows program fifteen years. His blog &quot;The Old New Thing&quot; focused on the development of Windows and the Win32 programming, programming community is respected. The website also published the book named &#39;The Old New Thing&#39; (Chinese title: Windows Programming Revelation) (Addison Wesley 2007). While Raymond is also a columnist for the Microsoft TechNet article. Raymond Chen Ruimeng Chinese name, although not speak Mandarin, but can understand the basic Taiwanese, and now are trying to learn Cantonese.&quot;</p>

		<p>If you speak Mandarin but don&#39;t read Chinese, copy-paste into Word and then add ruby (&quot;Phonetic Guide&quot; &#8212; appears next to &quot;Clear Formatting&quot; in Word 2010). &nbsp;It&#39;s actually &nbsp;pretty smart since it can distinguish between different pronunciations of the same character.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this won&#39;t help Raymond since he doesn&#39;t speak Mandarin.</p>
<p>The speaker bio uses somewhat more formal language than the Google translation conveys. &nbsp;I imagine this is a cultural practice?</p>

		<p>For what it&#39;s worth from some anonymous guy on the internet, some of us actually appreciate what you write, and in the event that we come across as &quot;snarky&quot; it&#39;s usually our own failure to communicate clearly, rather than a desire to offend. On the other hand, welcome to the internet &#8211; trolls moved here after being kicked out from under their bridges and we still haven&#39;t managed to do anything about that.</p>
<p>We would rather you delete the snarky comments instead of deleting the interesting posts.</p>
<p>Sure, people will grizzle that you&#39;re violating their constitutional rights, but you work for Microsoft &#8211; if you cured every form of cancer, they would still complain that you didn&#39;t cure every other disease as well.</p>

<p>Or&#8230; or you could use them in a future book! Ok that&#39;s more work, not less :)</p>
<p>Maybe then post them as new bonus chapters for your book! Not in the &quot;Old new thing&quot;, no comments, no problems!</p>
<p>I still haven&#39;t managed to finish your book by the way. English not being my native language, I&#39;ve found that I must not be tired when I read it if I want to enjoy it. And I am always tired when I am home now&#8230; I have to wait for the storm to pass.</p>

		<p>Perhaps you could just leave the snarky comments alone? &nbsp;That way we&#39;d at least get to read your posts (which are quite interesting) even if the comments would be of no value.</p>

<p>While I respect your choice as the author, this makes me wonder: Why do you feel that your articles take a back seat to the comments? &nbsp;Surely people come here primarily to read what <em>you</em> write and not to see the deranged ramblings of a bunch of anonymous half-wits (including yours truly, of course).</p>

		<p>&quot;I&#39;ve deleted from the queue (because the topic draws out flame comments)&quot;</p>
<p>That made me very sad. Now that i think about it, i&#39;ve not seen a flame war in this blog in a long while (perhaps the flamee have all grown up?)</p>
<p>Then again i don&#39;t often read the comments.</p>
<p>Raymond, i&#39;m interested in this queue, is there a way to see what is queued up ?</p>
<p>PS / BTW: Did you miss my question about your C++ scratch program a few posts ago ? Others have also asked questions about it. Will these questions ever get answered ?</p>

		<p>@Sam:</p>
<p>So, first you express disappointment about Raymond deleting posts due to flame/off-topic comments, then you REPEAT an off-topic question? (I realise the two are not quite in the same category, but still&#8230;)</p>
<p>Anyone else dazzled by the irony here?</p>

<p>Not only that, but the U.S. government would start an antitrust investigation into Microsoft&#39;s monopolistic attempt to put doctors out of work.</p>
<p>Europe would sue them for bundling their lung cancer cure and colon cancer cure into the same product.</p>

		<p>Oh, I read it, I assure you. Flame comments can certainly be off-topic. Recent example &#8211; post mentioned Windows Error Reporting and commenters complained about digital certificates, even after being explicitly warned about it. In fact, the warning may have fuelled the fire!</p>
<p>And note this response from Raymond:</p>
<p>&quot;[It&#39;s not the complaining that I object to. it&#39;s the off-topic complaining. -Raymond]&quot; (&quot;off-topic&quot; was underlined)</p>
<p>In any case, it seems to me that including an off-topic question doesn&#39;t really strengthen your argument about not removing posts from the queue. Just an observation&#8230;</p>

		<p>Wow, so you&#39;re learning Cantonese? Impressive. :D</p>
<p>Regading the talk description, I think &quot;经常应用程序也没有，有的只是stack traces和heap dumps&quot; should be &quot;需要调试的应用程序经常什么也没有，有的只是stack traces和heap dumps&quot; instead. I think they may break phrase/sentence in different place so the omission of key words is kind of awkward there. However, the sentence can be understood after some thought.</p>

<p>Different people are mad at MS for different reasons, and to lump them all up together as irrational is dishonest. I know MS gets some undeserved flack but there are TONS of things where it does deserve it. I&#39;m sure that more than a few MS employees secretly despise the product teams that routinely ship buggy bloated crap. The real annoying people are those who in face of criticism directed at MS turn around and say &#8211; but MS ships some nice stuff too..these people are just whiners and would whine about anything MS does.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
