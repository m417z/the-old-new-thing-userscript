<p>I noted to some friends that the weather forecast for Seattle two weekends ago called for rain on Friday, rain on Saturday, and rain on Sunday. But at least on Monday, the forecast was not for rain.</p>
<p> It was for heavy rain. </p>
<p> One of the consequences of Seattle's annual Rain Festival (runs from January 1 to December 31) is that we get plenty of potential for rainbows. A friend of mine was lucky enough to capture a photo of <a href="http://crimeandtheforcesofevil.com/blog/2012/11/unexpected-side-effects/"> a puzzling triple rainbow</a> this past weekend. The primary and secondary rainbows <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OQSNhk5ICTI"> we all know about</a>, but what's that vertical rainbow shooting straight up into the sky? (And observe that the landing point of the rainbow is clearly <i>in front of</i> a house and trees, so <i>go get your pot of gold</i>.) </p>
<p> It turns out that the mysterious third rainbow is a <a href="http://www.atoptics.co.uk/rainbows/reflect.htm"> reflection rainbow</a>. Reflection rainbows occur when light bounces off a body of water before being refracted by rain droplets. The body of water acts like a mirror and creates a virtual light source, which results in a rainbow that is off-center from the primary. </p>
<p> Science! </p>
<p> (I find it interesting that there are some rainbow phenomena that science is still trying to understand. Only a few months ago did researchers figure out <a href="http://www.ouramazingplanet.com/3317-how-twinned-rainbows-form.html"> how twinned rainbows are formed</a>.) </p>

		<p>The coolest rainbow I ever saw was in the water coming out of a snow gun at a ski resort. &nbsp;I was sitting up on a chairlift and saw the entire circle of the rainbow. &nbsp;Unfortunately, I wasn&#39;t able to get out my phone in time to snap a picture, and the next time I rode the lift up, it was gone.</p>

		<p>Are your weather celebrities the same as the ones we have here in Florida? Here, the news goes something like this:</p>
<p>News Anchor&gt; And now, over to chief meteorologist Frank Hurricane for the weather.</p>
<p>Frank&gt; Tomorrow&#39;s forecast is partly cloudy, high in the mid 90s, 50% chance of brief showers in the afternoon, cooling to the low 70&#39;s over night. Back to you.</p>
<p>News Anchor&gt; Way to go out on a limb there Frank.</p>

		<p>Adam Rosenfield,</p>
<p>I guess that chairlift was quite high up in the air, and you were looking down on that snow gun, right?</p>
<p>When you see full circle rainbow (raincircle?), the lightsource (i.e. the sun), your eyes and the circle center lies on a straight line. Unless you are high up in the air (such as in an airplane) and the sun is very low, the major part of the circle will be below the horizon. That is for a &quot;natural&quot; rainbow, where the reflection happens in droplets in the atmosphere.</p>
<p>In your case, where the light was reflected in ice crystals / snow from the snow gun, I guess that the reason why you were able to see it at all is that the background was white snow. I cannot imagine that it would be visible against a dark forest! Conditions must have been extremely favorable &#8211; a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p>

		<p>The &quot;vertical rainbow&quot; doesn&#39;t look vertical to me. It&#39;s clearly curved if you look at the top and the bottom; it&#39;s just part of a much larger circle than the other two, so the curvature is less noticeable.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
