<p>My friend <a href="http://wendyhome.com/"> ::&nbsp;Wendy&nbsp;::</a> got into a state where she kept misplacing her passport. (I guess she keeps <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/03/07/8080064.aspx"> moving it around</a>.) The first time she misplaced her passport and gave up looking for it, she reported it missing and <a href="http://wendyhome.com/2006/07/05/loser/"> received a replacement</a>. Then she misplaced the replacement, and while searching for it, <a href="http://wendyhome.com/2007/08/10/am-i-stranger-than-you/"> she found the original</a>. She reported the first passport as found; this keeps the issuing government happy since they can take it off their <i>If Somebody Tries To Use a Passport with This Number, Arrest Her</i> list. But they can't reactivate the original passport, because it takes time for the updated list to propagate all around the world, and it would be bad to be travelling through some remote country and find yourself thrown in prison because they didn't get the word that your passport number has been un-revoked.</p>
<p> Anyway, she gave up looking for the second passport, and applied for another replacement. By this point, the government found itself in a bit of a quandary: Here's a citizen who is legally entitled to a passport but who has also demonstrated a bit of scatterbrainedness. Their solution: Issue a one-year passport. This allows them to fulfill their obligation to their citizens while limiting the damage if the passport is lost <i>yet again</i>. </p>
<p> (Believe it or not, that's the short version of the story. <a href="http://wendyhome.com/2007/11/29/complicateder-and-complicateder/"> Here's the long version</a>.) </p>

		<p>Yeah, they did this to me 10 years ago. I had mine stolen twice (not directly but once while in a rucksack from my car and the second time while in a courier bag).</p>
<p>I think it even went further than that. There was a clause that only allowed me to get a 10 year passport at the end if I managed to keep the one year for the full year.</p>

		<p>British passports are remote-readable, and if you believe all the scare stories, they can be read at some distance. &nbsp;Surely there&#8217;s a technological fix? &nbsp;Something like a metal detector tuned to Her Brittanic Majesty&#8217;s passports.</p>
<p>(I&#8217;m assuming that the &#8216;lost passport&#8217; location can be narrowed down to something like &#8216;in the house somewhere).</p>

		<p>Nuts. &nbsp;I was hoping she would use the old passport &#8211; then we&#8217;d see whether there really was a &quot;arrest anyone using this passport&quot; list.</p>

		<p>The Australian government seems to go in for financial deterence; the price for replacement goes up each time you lose it. &nbsp;First replacement is the just the normal application fee, second replacement is twice the cost, and the third time is just ridiculous. &nbsp;My last passport is stuck in the bowels of an X-ray machine in Sydney International :(</p>

		<p>I can top that. My dad once had to go looking for his US passport for the first time in several years. He found no less then 3 old, expired, lost, &nbsp;passports but could not find the current one anywhere.</p>

		<p>In Britain we also have a rule that if you lose your National Insurance number card (equivalent to Social Security card) twice, then they never send you a replacement, and you just have to memorize it, or copy it off an old tax return.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s where this rule is stated (what if my card is lost or stolen section):</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
