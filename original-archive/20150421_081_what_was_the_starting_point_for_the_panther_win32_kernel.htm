<p> The original idea for the Jaguar and Cougar projects was to offer a 16-bit MS-DOS environment that could be "kicked up a notch" to a 32-bit protected-mode MS-DOS environment, with virtual memory and multiple virtual machines. They used the MS-DOS 5 and Win386 kernels as starting points. (Why wasn't Jaguar based on MS-DOS 6.0? For the same reason <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/01/19/10117410.aspx"> NASA didn't use the Space Shuttle to rescue the Apollo 13 astronauts</a>.) This project as originally envisioned was cancelled, but the work was not lost. The projects took on new life as the Windows 95 boot loader / compatibility layer and as the Windows 95 virtual machine manager, respectively. </p>
<p> The idea for the Panther project was to start with the existing Windows NT kernel and strip it down to run in 4<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/11/9725386.aspx">MB</a> of RAM. This project did not pan out, and it was cancelled outright. It was replaced with a Win32 kernel written from scratch with the 4MB limit in mind. </p>
<p> The Stimpy project survived intact and became the Windows 95 user interface. </p>
<p> I doubt the code name was the reason, but it's interesting that the ferocious cats did not carry out their original missions, but the dim-witted cat did. </p>

		<p>Is this Panther codename related in any way to the Panther folders created during Windows Setup, starting with Windows Vista? Windows 7, Windows Server 2008 R2, and Windows Vista setup log file locations: <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/927521" rel="nofollow" target="_new">support.microsoft.com/&#8230;/927521</a></p>
<p>I would think it is a coincidence or a codename reuse.</p>

		<p>Very interesting! &nbsp;So Panther was a from-scratch implementation of Win32. &nbsp;Thanks for the clarification :)</p>
<p>I can imagine a lot of cute tricks getting used to make an implementation of Win32 fit in 4 MB.</p>

		<p>@Raymond:</p>
<p>I think dave&#39;s deduction came from your sentence about Panther: &quot;It was replaced with a Win32 kernel written from scratch with the 4MB limit in mind&quot; and the fact that in the first linked article you said that Panther was the Win32 kernel &quot;subproject&quot; for Windows 95. So a possible conclusion is that the WinNT kernel port was cancelled but the Panther name was kept for the rewrite.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Well, the original article didn&#39;t discuss the fates of the projects. The new project didn&#39;t have a code name. It was just the Win32 kernel for Windows 95. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>&gt;start with the existing Windows NT kernel and strip it down to run in 4MB of RAM</p>
<p>But Windows NT ran in 4MB of RAM anyway. &nbsp;I remember seeing it stated in the minimum system requirements on the install floppies, and remember even more getting halfway through the really long, slow install and being informed &quot;Uh yeah, well, we kinda lied about that, you&#39;ll need to go out and buy another 4MB of RAM to actually install&quot;.</p>
<p>(Since hardware changes needed to be signed off by the client, who didn&#39;t believe us (&quot;But it says right here that it&#39;ll run in 4MB!&quot;), this lead to what could have been one of the slowest WinNT installs ever).</p>

		<p>I&#39;d be hard-pressed to accept that even Win95 ran in 4MB, given that a bare install swapped every minute just to update the clock; you needed 8MB if you wanted anything useful such as networking.</p>

		<p>@Dave: Which version of NT ran with a minimum of 4MB? Even NT 3.1 had a minimum of 12MB, and you really, really didn&#39;t want to try doing anything much with that much; I recall popular opinion that (assuming your hardware was supported) 32-64MB was the minimum acceptable amount.</p>

		<p>@Erik_F: Too long ago, sorry, but I assume it was 3.1, and you&#39;re right, it may have been more than 4MB. All I can remember is being sent a machine that met the minimum requirements (the client was cheap), getting some way through the install off floppies (each set invariably had a disk with a bad sector on floppy 799 out of 800), and being told that the advertised minimum requirements weren&#39;t the actual minimum requirements, and we&#39;d have to get client approval to buy more RAM (which they suspected was us gold-plating the deal and took forever to approve).</p>

		<p>Hi. You linked an article (with closed comments, unfortunately) saying that Windows 3.1 did not have a console subsystem. To me, the obvious question that arises is: Why is that? Wasn&#39;t it still pretty common to have command line applications at that time? And maybe utilize parts of the Windows API, but not the GUI parts? (I think of commandline music players, compilers, etc.)</p>

		<p>dasuxullebt: because the command line applications could just run in DOS. It took a deliberate effort (and a lot of resources) to move people to a &quot;real&quot; OS with Windows 95.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
