<p>         <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/1996/06/02/PK70006.DTL">In         an interview with Joel Selvin at the San Francisco Chronicle, Brian Eno explains</a>.      </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>         Q: How did you come to compose "The Microsoft Sound"?      </p>
<p>         A: The idea came up at the time when I was completely bereft of ideas. I'd been working         on my own music for a while and was quite lost, actually. And I really appreciated         someone coming along and saying, "Here's a specific problem -- solve it."      </p>
<p>         The thing from the agency said, "We want a piece of music that is inspiring, universal,         blah-blah, da-da-da, optimistic, futuristic, sentimental, emotional," this whole list         of adjectives, and then at the bottom it said "and it must be 3 1/4 seconds long."      </p>
<p>         I thought this was so funny and an amazing thought to actually try to make a little         piece of music. It's like making a tiny little jewel.      </p>
<p>         In fact, I made 84 pieces. I got completely into this world of tiny, tiny little pieces         of music. I was so sensitive to microseconds at the end of this that it really broke         a logjam in my own work. Then when I'd finished that and I went back to working with         pieces that were like three minutes long, it seemed like oceans of time.       </p>
</blockquote>
<p>         The Windows 95 CD contained extra multimedia toss-ins. The ones I remember are a cartoon         or two by <a href="http://www.awn.com/plympton/">Bill Plympton</a>, a <a href="http://www.weezer.com/">Weezer</a> music         video, and music video of <a href="http://www.newbohemians.com/">Edie Brickell</a> singing <i>Good         Times</i>.      </p>
<p>         For some reason, everybody wanted to know the artist from the <i>Good Times</i> video.         Nobody was interested in the artists who did any of the other stuff. (Okay, probably         nobody asked about Weezer because, well, that's the group right there in the filename.)      </p>
<p>         Hint: Right-click and select Properties. That will tell you the artist.      </p>
<p>         Oh, and the question nobody asked but I'm going to answer it anyway: <a href="http://www.brianorr.com/">The         composer of the Windows 95 Easter Egg theme is Brian Orr</a>. <a href="http://www.brianorr.com/music/compositions/clients.asp">Here's         his story of how it came to be</a>.      </p>

		<p>I&#8217;m convinced that it was that Good Times video that start the legendary &quot;Good TImes&quot; virus hoax.</p>
<p>My speculation:  During the Win95 beta, some beta tester get a build on a CD, sees the video, and emails it to some friend with an AOL account, not bothering to notice that it&#8217;s 30MB long.  (CDROMs were still new then, and most people still hadn&#8217;t grasped the concept that a file COULD be 30MB long).</p>
<p>Anyway, friend with AOL account fires of the ole&#8217; 28.8kbps modem and checks his email &#8212; and it says &quot;downloading email &quot;Good times&quot; for hours.  AOLer figures it&#8217;s a virus, cancels the download, and warns his friends.</p>

		<p>Some of the beta&#8217;s had different media bits on them.  I recall the trailer for Interview with a Vampire as well.</p>

		<p>I hated The Microsoft Sound.wav.  But it sort of fit with Microsoft media efforts at the time; even the Word clipart was ugly.</p>
<p>It was a lot better in Windows 98. Although my favourite soundclip was always the little piece that started up with the &quot;Welcome to Windows 98&quot; dialog.  (If anyone knows where it comes from, let me know!)</p>
<p>Everyone wanted to know who sang &quot;Good Times&quot; because it was just such a nice, pleasant song! I loved it. I was a bit dissappointed that W98 only had media clips pushing forgettable products like Trespasser and EasyBall.</p>

		<p>Raymond, I remember a Building 5 hallway BS session in mid-1995 where a few folks were talking about the &quot;Microsoft Sound&quot;.</p>
<p>I remember you saying; &quot;It sounds like glass breaking in reverse.&quot; or something similar.</p>

		<p>[obligatory late response apology]</p>
<p>Kinda odd that the easter egg is no longer available in later versions of Windows (according to the link to Brian Orr&#8217;s website, it only existed in Windows &#8217;95, not &#8217;98 or above).  Seems to me like something that&#8217;s not very obtrusive and gives the whole team a chance to give a bow, essentially.</p>
<p>Any reason why this isn&#8217;t something that&#8217;s in Windows 2000/XP or can&#8217;t be added for Longhorn?</p>

		<p>Does anyone know where I can download the .wav file for the &quot;Doo, dudududingggggg&#8230;. ding&#8230;. ding&#8230; ding&#8230;&quot; startup sound?  It&#8217;s definitely best startup sound, and I&#8217;d like to have it replace the one that is on XP, which I use now.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
