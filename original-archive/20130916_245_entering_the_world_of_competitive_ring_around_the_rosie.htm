<p>I dreamed that a friend and I were in line at some sort of summer camp to get into the cafeteria. We noticed a glass cabinet with food out in the dining area and asked about it. Turns out that it was available for people to eat, as an alternative to standing in line. We decided to go for it. (Another example of how <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/04/9394114.aspx"> being lucky is observing what you weren't expecting</a>.)</p>
<p> The plates on top of the cabinet were nearly empty, but it never occurred to anybody to open the cabinet door to get the food inside. We opened the door and moved food to the top of the cabinet, as a crowd slowly formed as people noticed, "Hey, look, food magically appeared!" </p>
<p> While we were eating, I got a call from another friend, who was standing outside. She challenged the two of us to a game of Ring-Around-the-Rosie. The stakes: eighty cents per round. I checked my pockets to see how many rounds I could afford to lose. Then I woke up, perhaps out of anxiety. </p>
<p> In other news, I learned that Ring-Around-the-Rosie can be played competitively. At least in dreams. </p>

		<p>I&#39;m assuming this is some US-ian variant of &quot;Ring a Ring o&#39; Roses&quot;?</p>

		<p>@Matt Smith: I&#39;d think that in real life the last to fall down wins&#8230; &nbsp;(Though apparently that interpretation is false.)</p>
<p>@pc: RPS is a competitive game where you&#39;re trying to defeat the other player through rules. &nbsp;Ring-around-the-rosie is a nursery rhyme/singing game. &nbsp;Not a competition between players.</p>
<p>@frymaster: Yes, &quot;ring a ring o&#39; roses&quot; is more common in the UK where &quot;ring around the rosie&quot; is more common in the US. &nbsp;Also, what&#39;s a US-ian&#8230;</p>

		<p>US-ian is a term used to prevent arguments flaring up over:</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;Whether American refers to anybody from the continents North America and South America, or specifically to people from the US. &nbsp;This apparently is the dominant view from most Spanish-speaking countries, and while it&#39;s true we aren&#39;t speaking Spanish here, to be fair there&#39;s a lot more Spanish people in the Americas claiming that term than there are people from the US trying to keep it for themselves. &nbsp;A literal translation of the Spanish term for a US person would be &quot;United-Statesian&quot; or US-ian for short.</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Whether those continents are two separate continents, or three including central America, or one that is just America.</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Whether people who live on an island are &quot;part&quot; of those continents.</p>
<p>Myself, I grew up not in the US, and calling US people American, and being uncomfortable referring to anything else on those continents as American other than the continent names themselves. &nbsp;It&#39;s not particularly rational or consistent, but it&#39;s just language.</p>

		<p>@Gabe: My Spanish isn&#39;t that great, but Estados Unidos Mexicanos would still be translated as United Mexican States and not United States of Mexico, which should also give you a hint how Spanish speakers refer to Mexicans.</p>
<p>As an European who spends a lot of time in the US (among other things in New Mexico so hey I do actually know quite a lot of Mexicans), I still refer to &quot;US-ians&quot; as Americans except when I catch myself, it&#39;s hard to get rid of habits..</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
