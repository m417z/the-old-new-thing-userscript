<p>
Explorer is a single-instance application,
which means that if you try to elevate it,
or if you try to run the 32-bit version on a 64-bit system,
you don't actually get an elevated Explorer
or a 32-bit Explorer,
because the second instance hands the request
to the existing instance.
This is a problem if, say, you have an old shell
extension that works only when elevated,
or is available only in the 32-bit version.
Or if you want an elevated Explorer to do some
administrative file management.
</p>
<p>
As we saw some time ago,
you can solve this problem by
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110325-00/?p=11133">
creating an explorer browser control</a>
with the desired attributes.
But that involves programming.
Is there a way to do this without programming?
</p>
<p>
Yes, and it's a bit of a trick:
You look for some application that already creates
an explorer browser control,
and run that application in the way you want.
If you want an elevated Explorer, then run
that victim application elevated.
If you want a 32-bit Explorer,
then run the 32-bit version of that victim
application.
</p>
<p>
My choice for the victim application is Notepad.
</p>
<p>
In other words:
To get the effect of an elevated Explorer window,
run Notepad elevated,
then select File, then Open.
</p>
<p>
To get the effect of a 32-bit Explorer window,
run the 32-bit version of Notepad
(from the <code>C:\Windows\SysWow64</code> directory),
then select File, then Open.
</p>
<p>
You can do your file management inside
this dialog box:
Rename files, cut and paste them,
right-click them to invoke context menu verbs.
Note that you cannot launch files by double-clicking
them, because the common file dialog interprets
double-clicking as "Open this file".
If you want to launch a file,
right-click it and then select the appropriate
verb (usually <i>Open</i>).</p>

		<p>It does, but AFAIK, they are all managed by a single parent process: you launch an instance, for example, from an elevated command line, that instance communicates your request to the parent process and exits, and the parent process then creates a new (unprivileged) instance to show the folder you requested. I guess that&#8217;s what Raymond means when he says, in the linked article, that Explorer is a &#8220;limited instance&#8221; program.</p>

		<p>For users you can use &#8220;Desktops&#8221; utility of SysInternals Suite for that.</p>
<p>We did use that to spawn explorer.exe as different user on different desktops as a quick way to switch between UAT and development environment. (Kill the explorer process on the new desktop, then &#8220;Run as&#8230;&#8221; explorer.exe with another AD user account.)</p>

		<p>Funny you mentioned it. You can do &#8220;start %windir%\explorer.exe /separate&#8221;</p>
<p>The help text stated it&#8217;s for starting 16-bit process, but it has no problem to start explorer in 64-bit mode.</p>

		<p>I had to do something similar recently. On a kiosk machine in which we kill explorer every few seconds, i needed to move some files on disk. Instead of dealing with the murderous script, I just used notepad&#8217;s open dialogue to move things around. Despite my insistence that this is a valid and hilarious workaround, my coworker persists in killing the script and launching explorer</p>

		<p>same trick applies for executing explorer tasks as a different user&#8230; run notepad as user2 (presumably elevated privileges, such as local admin), open dialog, manipulate file (or right click run app, etc)&#8230; close notepad and continue as normal.</p>

		<p>I have to use elevated Explorer to access a Blu-ray drive connected to a server, and until now I&#8217;ve done this killing Explorer and running it elevated. Good to know about this elevated application trick.</p>

		<p>If I&#8217;m an admin running under UAC, and I try to use Explorer to perform a file operation that requires admin privileges, I get a UAC-ish prompt, asking if I want to elevate and if I confirm, it does the operation.<br />
What magic does Explorer use to allow this level of smooth operation?  I&#8217;m pretty sure that it&#8217;s not like Task Manager, which, when you want to &#8220;Show processes from all users&#8221;, kills itself and starts up a new instance elevated.</p>

		<p>Most likely a new hidden Explorer process is launched. Though this doesn&#8217;t work (or used not to work) for unzipping files. Also, the elevated process may not have your mapped drives and network shares accessible.</p>

		<p>It creates an elevated COM server which exposes interfaces such as IFileOperation which can then be used to manipulate the files as an admin. This is also the route many UAC bypasses take as these objects no longer prompt by default.</p>

		<p>I had to do this for a while when my registry got corrupted and launching explorer directly would error on open. Notepad.exe usually worked pretty well in a pinch and was my go-to choice, however, it only supports single-file selection. When I needed to select and copy around multiple files, something like vscode was a better choice. All of the above were less painful than getting my development environment reimaged and reinstalling/configuring everything.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
