		<p>Salesmen are crooks. &nbsp;So are politicians&#8230; and most lawyers&#8230;and all crooks.</p>

		<p>I know someone who regularly gets suckered by salespeople and it drives me nuts. &nbsp;He&#8217;ll tell me how proud he was that the salesperson had to go ask the manager to get such a &quot;good&quot; price. &nbsp;Or how he didn&#8217;t have to pay $50 on a support visit simply by paying $100 for a support contract. &nbsp;Or how the salesperson extended an &quot;expired&quot; offer just for him. &nbsp;The worst was biting my tongue during the &quot;I bought a timeshare!&quot; discussion.</p>

		<p>Someone once told me a salesman is nothing but a liar with a nice tie. Sometimes they don&#8217;t even wear ties.</p>

		<p>I wonder why Senate, Banking and Trade Federation members in Star Wars are portrayed as ugly greedy bastards?</p>
<p>Perhaps George Lucas was actually trying to tell us something?</p>

		<p>How did you happen to come across this random piece from over a year and a half ago? &nbsp;Is the suggestion box that backed up? :)</p>

		<p>All this talk about sneaky and underhanded behaviour kind of reminds me about the parking ticket I was handed yesterday.</p>
<p>I parked at the office, go inside, plug in my computer, go outside with the parking permit and there&#8217;s a guy taking pictures of my car.</p>
<p>I wave my permit with a big smile, and then I notice that the bastard has already issued me with a ticket.</p>
<p>My colleague says I was gone for, at most, two minutes. Windows&#8217; event viewer says my machine booted at 9:27. (I pressed the power button as I left my computer and my computer&#8217;s clock runs about three minutes too fast)</p>
<p>Parking ticket says I was parked at that spot from 9:06 to 9:23. At 9:06 I had barely left my own apartment&#8230;! The guy had parked his car in front of my car. He obviously hadn&#8217;t bothered checking the other cars, but only those parked with the windshield visible from the road. (that way he didn&#8217;t have to get out of his car and walk around)</p>
<p>I have already written a lengthy complaint and I&#8217;ll post it today. I won&#8217;t rest until that guy&#8217;s life is in total ruins and all his children are sold off as slave laborers.</p>

		<p>@Rune,</p>
<p>I was once ticketed at university for &quot;parking on the grass&quot;. &nbsp;I had actually parked at the back of a parking lot on a section of gravel. &nbsp;I&#8217;m guessing that if they want grass there, they should try removing the gravel first (they, of course, never did). &nbsp;University poles at their finest.</p>
<p>And the car dealer stuff is spot on&#8230; they didn&#8217;t even hit the worst stuff.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
