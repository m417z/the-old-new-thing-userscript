		<p>Im rather amazed the sites are still up and running after all that time. One would figure the  domain would have expired or such after 8 years.</p>

		<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s a reflection that web sites are continually in a state of flux.  I don&#8217;t know about the first one (as Archive.org shat itself when I tried looking) but the second one has actually had content on it at one time or another.  Not for the past year or so, though&#8230;.<br /></p>

		<p>Both emr.fr and leary.com apparently exist for the use in email addresses.  Google shows email address results for both.  It would be nice if such sites would post a &quot;I&#8217;m just using this for my email&quot; notice, rather that the standard &quot;coming soon&quot; or &quot;under construction&quot; notice, but oh well.</p>

		<p>I thought the &quot;Under Construction&quot; stemmed from the real early days of the web, when people would be doing live updates to the web folders.</p>
<p>&quot;Under Construction&quot; was a kind of hint that on any particular refresh links might not work, content could change (or be badly formed). Just try again soon&#8230;</p>

		<p>Raymond:  You never really made the argument as to why &quot;Under Construction&quot; should be made illegal.  All you did was mention two sites that have been so for a long time.  So what?</p>

		<p>I think it&#8217;s a self-conscious thing. People want to put up a site, but realize it will never be good enough for their future &quot;fans&quot;, so they put up an &quot;under counstruction&quot; notice as a deflector for not providing content.  If someone complains that a link is broken, well, it&#8217;s still under construction, buddy.</p>
<p>And you get to use the cool animated icon of the construction sign with the little man digging!</p>

		<p>In all fairness Timothy Leary (<a target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Leary" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Leary</a>) can&#8217;t really update his website&#8230;.and hasn&#8217;t been able to since 1996.  He did &quot;drop out&quot; before we were ready to turn on and tune in&#8230;</p>

		<p>I have always been annoyed when a company takes down a working site to put up under construction info.  Take a look at <a target="_new" href="http://www.hk-usa.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hk-usa.com/</a> &#8212; had a perfectly good website, and now nothing.  Not even a contact number!  How much business might they be losing because people can&#8217;t even get a phone number from their website?</p>

		<p>I think I can explain why <a href="http://www.leary.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.leary.com</a> still is under construction. It&#8217;s hard for a webmaster to make a good website if you&#8217;re already lost choosing trippy colors for it while being on LSD ;-)</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  It would be nice if such sites would post a<br />
  <br />&gt; &quot;I&#8217;m just using this for my email&quot; notice</p>
<p>Or simply provide no HTTP services at all.. but then the WIPO would force you to relinquish your domain because if you don&#8217;t have a home page on your Interweb address then you must be cybersquatting!  :)

		<p>Ha!  I&#8217;ve had pages under construction since 1994. ;-)</p>
<p>And you&#8217;re right, it&#8217;s pretty criminal.  Especially those cases where sites take everything down just to put up a &quot;coming soon&quot; notice.  The Oakland Zoo did that a few years ago.  I stopped going.</p>
<p>But sometimes it&#8217;s fun.  Try various &quot;standard&quot; entrypoints under the domain and see if it&#8217;s just the main index page.</p>

		<p>While &quot;Under Construction&quot; pages suck, I also hate websites that say &quot;Coming Soon&quot; without a date as to when they put &quot;Coming Soon&quot; on it.  In some cases it&#8217;s entire websites, but usually it&#8217;s links to something that is of use or interest to me.  Nothing more annoying than going back after three years to see that something is &quot;Coming Soon.&quot;  At least if they put a date as to when they made the notation &quot;Coming Soon,&quot; you could tell if this was an ancient &quot;Coming Soon,&quot; and hence something to not bother checking, or if it&#8217;s a recent one.</p>
<p>I also love it when people don&#8217;t update links on websites.  I was just on a website recently where the links to a paper on CRC calculations were broken.  I took a few minutes to track down the papers on Google, and sent an email to the site owner explaininng the dead links and giving him the new ones.  His reply? </p>
<p>&quot;Thanks for the new links; I haven&#8217;t updated my web pages in about five years &#8212; and I probably won&#8217;t update them now &#8212; but it&#8217;s good to know in case anyone asks me in the future.&quot;</p>
<p>WTF?  I take the time to actually hunt down the working links and make it easy on him, and his attitude is, &quot;It&#8217;ll save me time when people email me about the broken links.&quot;  Well, if he&#8217;d take five minutes and fix the site, no one would have to bug him for the links!</p>

		<p>My <a href="http://www.leary.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.leary.com</a> site does not mention it is &quot;under construction&quot;.

Regretfully I am physically unable to update my site and unfortunately interverse.com just wants to cash in on the interest in me, without disseminating any of my ideas.</p>

<p>you could see how it was in 1997 or later</p>
<p>hmm.. hey! But &quot;under construction&quot; there only from &quot;Jul 13, 2003&quot;. Before there are pages!</p>
<p>But I agree &#8211; this sign is a lie. Still it serves sometimes as an persuading thing. People could ask you &quot;when?!&quot;. :)<br /></p>

		<p>The &quot;closed ports&quot; solution is a good one. But a blank page or a page with just a logo is better than &quot;Under Construction&quot;, which is a lie!</p>

		<p>Hmm, I already tried to post this once . . .</p>
<p>Matt, a lot of people get their domain through someone like Yahoo Website Services.  In those circumstances, you have no control over whether your webserver is running.  Even if you&#8217;re just using it for the email, you&#8217;ve got some standard, &quot;no content yet&quot; notice.</p>
<p>Another (probably) common scenario is the file server.  i.e. Keeping a website up just to host files on, but with no intention of ever making a proper website.  Again, the standard message stays up unless someone changes it.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
