<p>In 1999, Eric Schulman published <a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze3fs8i/bhtes/reviews.html"> <i>A Briefer History of Time</i></a>, based upon his previous effort to <a href="http://members.bellatlantic.net/~vze3fs8i/hist/hist.html"> capture the history of the universe in 200 words</a>. The book takes the initial 200-word summary and expands upon each phrase, surreptitiously teaching you some science among the jokes. (You can even <a href="http://www.nsf.gov/news/mmg/mmg_disp.cfm?med_id=54447"> watch a video</a>.)</p>
<p> And then <a href="http://www.hawking.org.uk/"> this Hawking guy</a> shows up and gives his book <a href="http://search.barnesandnoble.com/booksearch/isbnInquiry.asp?isbn=0553804367"> the exact same title</a>. What a rip-off. </p>
<p> (I'm told this Hawking guy has a lot of fans. Those who live in the Seattle area might be interested to know that <a href="http://www.theparamount.com/artists/artist.asp?key=261"> he'll be in town</a> in mid-November.) </p>

		<p>This reminds me of a limerick I read in the book &quot;One Two Three.. Infinity&quot; by George Gamow.</p>
<p>There was a young lady named Miss Bright,<br />
<br />Who could travel faster than light.<br />
<br />She departed one day, in an einsteinian way,<br />
<br />And cambe back the previous night.</p>
<p>Cheers.</p>

		<p>Although Professor Hawking&#8217;s A Briefer<br />
<br />History of Time is briefer than his A Brief History of Time (176 pages compared to 208 pages), my A Briefer History of Time is briefer still at 171 pages.</p>

		<p>Seems that article is better renamed &quot;The History of the Universe for human in 200 Words or Less&quot; The lower half words are nothing significant about Universe, just significant words about lifes on Earth. &quot;Life formed on some planet(s)&quot; could be well concluded that on the Universe perspective.</p>
<p>Perheps adding words like &quot;Human-made satellite construction&quot;(For the first time satellite is not necessarily something that must be formed by the nature) would be more relevent.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
