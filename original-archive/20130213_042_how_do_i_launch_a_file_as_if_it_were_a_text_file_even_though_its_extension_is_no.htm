<p>You might have a program that generates log files or other text content with an extension other than <code>.txt</code>. You naturally might want to open these documents in the user's default text editor.</p>
<p> You might decide to ask the Windows developer support team, "How can I figure out what program is the handler for text files?" The idea being that once you get this program name, you can then run it yourself, with the document on the command line. And you would also be running into the trap of <i>looking for the answer to a question rather than a solution to a problem</i>. </p>
<p> For one thing, the default handler for the file type might require special command line parameters, parameters which you won't get if you merely get the executable path. For example, on Windows&nbsp;7, the default command line for JPG files is <code>%SystemRoot%\<wbr>System32\<wbr>rundll32.exe "%ProgramFiles%\<wbr>Windows Photo Viewer\<wbr>PhotoViewer.dll", ImageView_Fullscreen %1</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></code>, and if you merely asked for the executable, all you would get back would be <code>rundll32.exe</code>, and trying to execute <code>rundll32.exe Boats.jpg</code> doesn't get you very far. You lost all the command line arguments. </p>
<p> For another thing, the default handler for the file type might not even be a command line. It might be <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/02/26/1763683.aspx"> an old program</a> that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/hh127429"> uses DDE</a>. Or the handler might be a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/03/10006065.aspx"> drop target</a>. Or it could be an <code>IContext&shy;Menu</code> or an <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/03/12/9977246.aspx"> <code>IExecute&shy;Command</code></a>. In these cases, there is no command line in the first place, so asking for the command line template is meaningless. </p>
<p> But we saw the answer to this question before, just in a different guise. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/01/10033224.aspx"> The <code>lpClass</code> member of the <code>SHELL&shy;EXECUTE&shy;INFO</code> lets you open a file as if it were another type of file</a>. In that article, somebody was passing a class when they didn't mean to; here, we're passing it on purpose. </p>

		<p>Of course if you do something like this the user still won&#39;t be able to open the actual log file by clicking on it.</p>
<p>Sometimes the simplest solution is the best: Give the file an appropriate extension that matches its contents and trust the file associations to match the user&#39;s preferences. &nbsp;In this case, .log files are associated with Notepad by default (IIRC they might even be considered to be class txtfile).</p>

		<p>Wouldn&#39;t you actually want to open default.html is the user&#39;s default HTML editor? So shouldn&#39;t you just be invoking the Edit action on the html file rather than the default Open action?</p>

		<p>@saveddijon: That only works right up through Windows Vista. Starting on 7 that can induce extra linebreaks on long lines.</p>
<p>Basically these days if you want to deal with .txt files with other line endings you have to ship an editor. Notepad++ is a very good choice due to its licensing. The only real gotcha to just shipping it in its installer is you have to make a configuration option to change the editor.</p>

<p>Because even if you give the customer a way to get the answer with arguments, they&#39;re still doing things the wrong way. There are tons of ways for bugs to creep into their parser/argument replacement code, when they really should be using a completely different and much simpler solution.</p>

		<p>I notice the docs for SHELLEXECUTEINFO still don&#39;t say what the lpClass member is actually for. They say what it should look like, but not why you would want to use it. Would it really kill Microsoft to provide a bit of background information in their documentation?</p>

		<p>A connecting issue: there&#39;s a software which handled entities with attachments. Attachments like what you can have with an e-mail. The user wants to open and edit these attachments. From the software point of view this would mean:</p>
<p>1. Extract the attachment file to a temporary location.</p>
<p>2. Spawn the registered editor for the particular file.</p>
<p>3. Let the user edit the file. And here comes the tricky part:</p>
<p>4. Get some kind of notification, when the user closes the editor!</p>
<p>I couldn&#39;t tackle the last one. In this case it would be _really_ handy to get hold of the process which edits the file. It is absolutely valid user requirement to be able to do that, but&#8230;</p>

		<p>Two simple steps to solve this problem; both taken from this blog!</p>
<p>Step 1. Programatically change the user&#39;s default text editor to notepad.exe. Reference: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/12/11/9193695.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/9193695.aspx</a></p>
<p>Step 2. swprintf_s( commandLine, L&quot;C:\Windows\notepad.exe &quot;%s&quot;&quot;, filePath ) &#8211;&gt; CreateProcess( commandLine &#8230; ). Reference: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/01/28/9954432.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/9954432.aspx</a></p>
<p>Success!</p>

		<p>Csaba Toth, 7-Zip falls victim to this problem. If you want to play a music file inside an archive, and you try to do so by double clicking the file while Media Player is already running, 7-Zip deletes the temporary file before Media Player can play it.</p>
<p>It would be really nice if instead of giving Media Player a file name, you could give it a handle to a (real or virtual) file and get notified when Media player is done with it (the final reference to the handle is closed).</p>

		<p>The &quot;proper&quot; solution for that (for very over-engineered enterprisey values of proper) probably is to mount the archive file in a virtual file system and give the media player a file name inside of that.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
