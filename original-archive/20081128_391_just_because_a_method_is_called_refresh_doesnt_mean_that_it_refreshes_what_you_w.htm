<p>Here's a question from a customer:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I made some changes related to my shell extension [details omitted], but the changes don't show up in the Explorer window when I refresh it. Any suggestions on how to solve this problem? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> When we asked how they were refreshing the Explorer window, we were expecting something like pressing F5 or calling <code>SHChangeNotify</code> with <code>SHCNE_UPDATEDIR</code>, or maybe calling <code>IShellView::Refresh</code> or possibly even calling <code>WebBrowser.Refresh</code> from script. But we definitely didn't expect this response: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I'm invoking the <a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.diagnostics.process.refresh.aspx"> Process.Refresh() method from the </a><a href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/15t15zda.aspx"> <code>System.Diagnostics</code></a> namespace. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Just because a method is called <code>Refresh</code> doesn't mean that it refreshes what you want. I think this is somebody who just saw a method name, perhaps <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/09/02/8918130.aspx#8920037"> inspired by IntelliSense</a> and&mdash; <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/09/02/8918130.aspx#8920189"> Boom! You have it!</a>&mdash;assumed it did what was needed without actually reading the documentation to check. But you don't even need to read the documentation to know that <code>Process.Refresh</code> has no chance of working. </p>
<p> Since it's a method on the <code>Process</code> class, the method is applicable to all processes. But certainly there is no generic way to tell a process to refresh. This magical <code>Refresh</code> method would have to know how to refresh Explorer windows, Firefox web pages, iTunes mp3 tags... And what would it even mean to refresh, say, a Notepad window? Does that mean to throw away all changes and reload the original document? </p>
<p> How do you know that there is no generic way to tell a process to refresh? Well, for one thing, a single process like Explorer can be viewing multiple objects that can be refreshed; which one are you refreshing? Second, when you write your own program, how do <i>you</i> implement refresh? Do you respond to some standard system Refresh message? Or do you just add a Refresh option to your program's main menu and give it some arbitrary command ID? If there's not even a standard way to refresh <i>your</i> program's window, then how can there be a standard way to refresh <i>all</i> program windows? </p>
<p> In this specific case, the <code>Process.Refresh</code> method refreshes the <code>Process</code> object's internal cache of process properties. It doesn't actually do anything to the process itself. How could it? </p>
<p> It's like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/09/02/8918130.aspx#8920421"> thinking that the <code>Matrix.Rotate</code> method rotates the entries in a matrix</a>. </p>
<p> <b>Epilogue</b> </p>
<p> Actually, I'm scared by this customer's question for another reason: The fact that they even mentioned <code>Process.Refresh</code> suggests to me that they wrote their shell extension in managed code, which we already know <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/18/1317290.aspx"> is strongly disrecommended</a>. </p>

		<p>On the other hand, there are such gems as Control.Refresh() vs Contorl.Update(). Not to say they both don&#8217;t serve useful purposes, but somewhat more descriptive (and distinctive!) names would be less confusing.</p>

		<p>Isn&#8217;t it true that as of .NET4 multiple versions of the CLR will be able to be loaded per process so writing things like shell extensions in managed code will be less of an issue?</p>

		<p>I know this is drifting off-topic, but since the .NET 4 framework supposedly will be able to coexist with .NET 2 in the same process, doesn&#8217;t that mean that I can write a shell extension *today* in .NET 2? (Assuming, of course, that I completely ignore the existance of .NET 1, but that will still be an issue when .NET 4 comes.)</p>
<p>So, seriously, should we really be careful not to write extensions to native hosts in managed code anymore?</p>
<div class=post>[<i>This &#8220;.NET 4 framework&#8221; thing is news to me. But I like that parenthetical. &#8220;Assuming, of course, that I completely ignore the reason why shell extensions shouldn&#8217;t be written in managed code.&#8221; -Raymond</i>]</div>

<p>You can inject the CLR into *any* process by using COM interop or IJW, and the native code will not even know that it has happened.</p>

		<p>The median person IS the average person, because the median is an average. &nbsp;The biggest problem is saying &quot;the average&quot; like there&#8217;s only one average. &nbsp;But even saying &quot;the mean&quot; glosses over the difference between arithmetic, geometric, and other means.</p>
<p>Regardless, if we assume a gaussian distribution of intelligence (and we often do), then the statement works even the mode and arithmetic mean (and geometric mean depending on how you define it).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m being ABSURDLY pedantic here, but only because your own dismissive pedantry (&quot;nice try, here&#8217;s a screwdriver&quot;) irked me so much. &nbsp;People scanning for any potential flaw or nitpick in anything ever said instead of, you know, communicating.</p>

		<p>If the distribution is approximately normal, then the median, mean, and mode are approximately equal.</p>

		<p>Ok, ok, I think everyone even mildly interested in the subject got it. Yes, the median is an average but the average is not necessarily the median &#8212; except for some distributions.</p>
<p>Now I know the feeling of people missing the point entirely and concentrating on peripheral details.</p>
<p>&#8230; the irony.</p>
<p>People commenting on blogs are definitely not normally distributed.</p>
<p>To bring this conversation back to Refresh &#8212; I&#8217;m just going to clarify my initial reaction by saying that it was not totally unreasonable for the user to assume that there was a standardized mechanism for refreshing all the windows of a process.</p>
<p>There is after all a similar mechanism for repainting.</p>
<p>Sure, relying on unproven assumptions is not a good strategy when programming, but this is something that&#8217;s learned with experience.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not necessarily a sign of irrecoverable incompetence. After a short while users will be able to not only realize they&#8217;re making assumptions, but experiment or read the appropriate documentation to validate/invalidate them.</p>

		<p>&quot;The median person IS the average person, because the median is an average.&quot;</p>
<p>Actually, the median is the middle element in a sorted set. This *is* not the same as an average. </p>

Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
