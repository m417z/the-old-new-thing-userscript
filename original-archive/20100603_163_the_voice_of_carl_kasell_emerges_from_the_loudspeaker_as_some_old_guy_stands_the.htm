<p>Some time ago, the NPR news quiz <a href="http://waitwait.npr.org/"><i>Wait Wait... Don't Tell Me</i></a> taped a show in Seattle. (<a href="http://www.stgpresents.org/artists/?artist=1064">They're back in town tonight</a>.) I was fortunate to score tickets to that show, in part because I ordered them nearly a full year before taping. Watching the taping of the show is quite a treat, and I recommend it for any fan of the program. You can watch <a href="http://www.npr.org/about/people/bios/psagal.html"> Peter Sagal</a> pace back and forth as he talks and contrast it to old-school radio man <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2100708"> Carl Kasell</a>, who stands perfectly still as he delivers his lines.</p>
<p> The strangest part of the experience was putting the face to the voice. When Carl Kasell started talking, my reaction was, "Hey, I hear the voice of Carl Kasell, and that old guy on stage is doing a really good job of lip-synching." </p>
<p> After the show, the on-air talent hung around on stage, and enthusiastic audience members approached the stage to chat, get autographs, and generally be adoring fans. Most of the talent hung around in a group at one end of the stage, but not Carl Kasell. He stood at the other end of the stage, because Carl is special. Whereas the others dealt with a small crowd, the people waiting to see Carl stood patiently in a line. And he also had a bodyguard to facilitate the process. </p>
<p> You don't expect a public radio news announcer to have a security detail, but that's the level of fame Carl Kasell has risen to. </p>

		<p>Now I&#39;m jealous, <em>Wait wait don&#39;t tell me</em> is my sole source of US news (just as <em>Friday Night Comedy</em> is that of British news).</p>
<p>My views of the English speaking world may be considered to be slightly warped&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#39;ll back Raymond&#39;s recommendation about seeing a taping if you can, they did one at UNC about 6 months ago and it was absolutely worthwhile.</p>

		<p>Wait wait. &nbsp;Didn&#39;t you have Carl Kasell on your answering machine at one time? &nbsp;I thought I saw a WAV file with this on it once on Microsoft corpnet. &nbsp;What happened to it?</p>

		<p>Yep, Carl Kasell has a really cool voice. &nbsp;I am in Chicago occasionally, and I was thinking about getting tickets. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t know they were so hard to score!</p>
<p>On a slightly related note, I did see Garrison Keillor&#39;s show taped live here in town once. &nbsp;That was interesting.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
