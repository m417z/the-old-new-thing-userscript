<p>I've been informed that the Redmond branch of the Microsoft Company Store has begun stocking the dead tree edition of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/07/1233002.aspx"> my book</a>.</p>
<p> "But wait, your program isn't printed by Microsoft Press; it's published by Addison-Wesley Professional. I thought the company store only stocked Microsoft Press titles." </p>
<p> I'm told that this is a pilot program. (And no, I don't know what the success criteria are.) </p>
<p> When I stopped by the store a few days ago, they were in the process of reorganizing the book section, so not only was my book not up, neither were any others! But it should be there "any day now." </p>
<p> And remember, I'll gladly sign your book <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/01/31/1565656.aspx"> but you have to tell me what to write</a>. </p>

		<p>Raymond, what I&#8217;ve seen some other authors do is to briefly chat with the reader and make their inscription based on that. &nbsp;It&#8217;s quite amazing, to me, to come up with something vaguely good in that amount of time.</p>
<p>If I ever order one, I will have no choice but to request the inscription, &quot;RTFM&quot;. (But maybe that&#8217;s preprinted on &#8217;em?) ;)</p>

		<p>Raymond, a well deserved congratulations!! &nbsp;You definitely have some very interesting knowledge to share with other developers. &nbsp;Any chance you&#8217;ll be tasked with writing more of your commentary in MSDN magazine?</p>

		<p>Someone told me that MSFT employees are not allowed to engage in profitable side ventures of any type. &nbsp;Is that incorrect, or was an exception made for your case?</p>

		<p>Since this post is likely to end up being a high-ranking search result for &#8220;old new thing book&#8221; and other such queries, I&#8217;ll take this opportunity to say that I just finished reading the book and, despite the fact that I&#8217;d read much of the information on your blog before, I still found it very entertaining and informative.</p>
<p>My only minor critique is that some bits of it are very code-heavy. Most of it is fine, but there were a few parts where there were just several consecutive pages that were almost entirely program listing, which I found I had to skip over. In my younger years I used to enjoy studying program listings from magazines and books, but it seems that my brain is no longer wired for quickly scanning code in printed form*. I found the text around the code in most cases told me everything I needed to know to understand the point you were making.</p>
<p>(* I wonder if perhaps this is because books don&#8217;t generally have &#8220;syntax highlighting&#8221; as you&#8217;d see in the programming editors of today. I wonder if there are enough possible shades of grey to print legible syntax highlighting in a book.)</p>
<div class="post">[<i>I too hate long tedious chunks of code. Any large chunks of code you find in the book were entirely reluctant. (I&#8217;m thinking specifically of the one in the Taxes chapter.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Now, what would the success criteria be? After all, everyone who reads your blog and enjoys it probably already has a copy of it. Unless, I suppose, those at Microsoft are made blissfully unaware of your insights and thus might actually come around to the store seeking knowledge, but then they wouldn&#8217;t know what &quot;The Old New Thing&quot; really is.</p>
<p>Such is the irony &#8211; those who know and wanted a copy probably already got one, and those who don&#8217;t, probably won&#8217;t. Unless the peer recommendation grapevine is really strong at Microsoft.</p>

		<p>&quot;Someone told me that MSFT employees are not allowed to engage in profitable side ventures of any type.&quot;</p>
<p>Writing a book (especially a technical one) is not exactly a *profitable* side venture.</p>
<p>Having said that, I do know of Microsoft employees that *do* have a &quot;profitable&quot; side venture (for example, Rick Brewster who makes Paint.NET &#8212; the software is free, but apparently he makes a tidy profit from the advertising and donations on the website)</p>

<p>Since the idea of Raymond signing copies of his books first came up, I have been wondering what I would ask him to write should the situation ever present itself.</p>
<p>That quest is now over. Daev, this is utterly superb.</p>

		<p>I heard a joke about an English author in Australia who dedicated a book to Emma Chissit, since that what he thought the woman holding a copy said to him.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
