A long-ago discussion of
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20151229-00/?p=92731">
the fates of the various cat-themed precursor projects that
led to Windows 95</a>
prompted
Jack to ask
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20151229-00/?p=92731#comment-1220602">
whether the Panther project was abandoned
because it was impossible or was it abandoned
because doing it properly would take much more
work than just writing a new kernel</a>?
</p>
<p>
From an engineering standpoint,
the two options are almost the same.
Something is rarely "impossible" so much as
"not feasible from a cost/benefit point of view."
Even
"make a change that breaks every program ever written"
is strictly speaking not "impossible",
but it is definitely comes at a very high cost.
</p>
<p>
I suspect that the cost/benefit calculations
also included the discovery/realization that
getting the Windows NT kernel to run in 4MB of memory&sup1;
would require so many changes that it would
no longer be what it wanted to be.
You couldn't really
call it a scaled-down Windows NT kernel any more.
</p>
<p>
But it was worth a try.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus clarification</b>:
My colleague who provided the
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150824-00/?p=91751">
Windows 95 ship date predictor</a>
(and also
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160831-00/?p=94215">
missed out on his Nobel Prize in Project Management</a>)
corrected some of my hazy memories of the Panther project.
</p>
<p>
The Panther project was more than just running the Windows NT kernel
in 4MB.
It also ported the 32-bit USER and GDI from Windows NT,
and the 16-bit versions of USER and GDI forwarded to their
32-bit counterparts.
</p>
<p>
When the Panther project was abandoned,
the design flipped:
Instead of having the 16-bit window manager and graphics engine
forward to the 32-bit window manager and graphics engine,
Windows 95 had the 32-bit window manager and graphics engine
forward to the 16-bit window manager and graphics engine.
Over time, the 16-bit window manager and graphics engine
themselves
<a HREF="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2008.09.windowsconfidential.aspx">
did some growing up</a>
and
became
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140826-00/?p=143">
a hybrid 16/32 system</a>.
</p>
<p>
The memory manager from Panther's version of KERNEL32
remained,
but the rest of the kernel was rewritten,
using Win32s as a reference in many places.
Win32s didn't support multithreading,
so that code needed to be written from scratch.
</p>
<p>
&sup1;
Given that 4MB was the memory for the entire system,
getting the Windows NT kernel to run in 4MB of memory
meant in practice that it had to run in under 2MB of memory,
in order to leave enough memory available
to run, y'know, programs.</p>

		<p>I remember when I got a machine with 32MB of EDO ram around the 98 (not SE) era, we thought that was awesome; of course the same machine had 256MB within a year. Then we bought a AMD Athlon in the Windows ME era, that had a massive 1GB. It&#8217;s amazing just how for granted we take the absurd amounts of memory we have today.</p>

		<p>Youngsters!  My first &#8220;PC&#8221; had 2K of RAM &#8211; 2K!  We were thrilled when we hacked together enough parts to increase the RAM to 16K.  (Literally hacked together &#8211; chips hand-soldered on top of other chips, wires running around, good times).</p>

		<p>Well, yes and no, though Raymond could probably clarify this. The OS/2 3.0 that turned into Windows NT was not the same as the OS/2 3.0 that IBM released a year later.  What I do remember about OS/2 was having to reinstall it every time it&#8217;s config file got corrupt and stuck in a loop. IIRC, it was 33 3.5 inch disks.</p>

		<p>I always liked the way with VxDs you could have real mode, 16 bit protected mode and 32 bit protected mode code all in the same LE/LX file and it had the relocation entries to support them all. No other x86 executable file format could do that. </p>
<p>And it had to be that way because you needed to have code running before and after the switch to protected mode.</p>

		<p>&gt; also included the discovery/realization that getting the Windows NT kernel to run in 4MB of memory¹ would require so many changes that it would no longer be what it wanted to be</p>
<p>Did anyone think it would be possible to optimise the code and data so that it would be functionally identical in much less memory?</p>
<p>What changed when Windows CE was based on NT? As that can run in 1mb of ram.</p>

		<p>I think at the time the Win32 stuff was in CSRSS in NT. I wonder what was the plan for Panther.</p>

		<p>Windows CE was a different kernel from NT.  So at one point Microsoft had three complete Win32 implementations &#8211; Windows 9x, Windows NT and Windows CE, each with a different kernel. </p>
<p>Windows CE was a lot smaller than NT and was hard realtime. Curiously it only supported the wide char versions of APIs, not the Ansi ones.</p>

		<p>It seems like the right move if you&#8217;re trying to remove complexity: By getting rid of the ANSI functions, you don&#8217;t have to include code page support (at least I can&#8217;t think of any reason for keeping that in!)</p>

		<p>CE still needs code page support because it has to support things like MultiByteToWideChar type APIs (which you need since you may encounter things like some .txt files which are store as ASCII).  You also need to convert between UTF-16 and UTF-8.</p>
<p>What CE doesn&#8217;t try to do is auto convert for most APIs, so you don&#8217;t need A and W versions of every function that takes a string.</p>

		<p>I wonder if Windows 95 would have been as successful with an NT core. My memory is hazy but I think it wasn&#8217;t until Windows 2000-ish that 3D games and such worked on NT with its HAL or whatever. But maybe this Panther thing was supposed to solve that at the same time as it trimmed memory.</p>

		<p>It has nothing to do with the HAL, but with support for the different DirectX versions. Windows 95 OSR2 and Windows NT 4, for example, both included DirectX 2 out of the box, so they could run the same games and multimedia applications. NT required more memory and sometimes had a lower framerate, but compatibility at that point was excellent, and it didn&#8217;t let crash games crash the OS as Windows 95 sometimes did. DirectX 3, which introduced Direct3D, was also available on both platforms.</p>
<p>Your memories may be based on the fact that DirectX 5 and 6 were never released for NT 4 &#8211; only Windows 2000 (NT 5) would get DirectX 7 at launch, two years later, putting NT and 9x on par. Anyway, in that timeframe, there were a surprising amount of games that worked in Windows NT, maybe because its developers used NT in their machines. Better OpenGL support was also a big win: OpenGL, intended as an API for graphical workstations, was developed for NT and then a subset was ported to 9x, so OpenGL-based games (such as the Quake series) actually ran better on NT 4 than on Windows 95/98.</p>
<p>But what happened to DirectX 4? Raymond has the answer: <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040122-00/?p=40963" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040122-00/?p=40963</a></p>

		<p>My memory is rusty, but wasn&#8217;t part of the problem that NT originally ran video in user-mode, which severely limited its performance.</p>

		<p>Looked it up on Wikipedia. NT 3.x did run video in user-mode, but it was moved to the kernel in NT 4. I don&#8217;t recall running any games in NT 4, but did in Windows 2000 and, of course, XP later than year. (My kids had two games, though, that ran only in Windows 98, so I had a second system set up for that. I remember having to run chkdsk a lot on that system.)</p>

		<p>NT 4 didn&#8217;t support Hardware Accelerated Direct3D (only supported Accelerated OpenGL and vendor specific APIs). NT 5 on the other hand did support Hardware Accelerated Direct3D</p>

		<p><i>Windows 95 had the 32-bit window manager and graphics engine forward to the 16-bit window manager and graphics engine.</i></p>
<p>And then us third-party developers would go and stuff 32-bit code into our 16-bit video drivers to get decent performance on more modern CPUs, and kludge up the segments to make it work&#8230; If I remember correctly, it also required using an undocumented return instruction to convince the CPU to go back to where it came from without having to mangle the return address from 16bit to 32bit on every driver entry point (a big-enough cost to show up in lower benchmark scores).</p>
<p>Then there was figuring out how to call from 32-bit assembler code in a &#8217;16-bit&#8217; driver into 16-bit C code. And stuffing read-only data into code segments because the 16-bit linker wouldn&#8217;t let us have more than 64k of initialized data.</p>
<p>Programming was much hairier in those days.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).

<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
