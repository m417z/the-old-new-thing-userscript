<p>         If the taskbar is not wide enough to display the entire word "Start", then the word         "Start" is hidden. To get it back, resize the taskbar wider until the word "Start"         reappears.      </p>
<p>         This behavior is by design. From a design point of view, a partial word looks very         broken.      </p>
<p>         Also, there is an apocryphal story of clipping text causing embarrassment during localization.         The word "Start", after being translated into some language, and then being clipped,         turned into a rude word. (As an analogy, suppose the text on the Start button said         "Start button", but it got clipped to "Start butt". Now you have to explain to people         why they have to click on the "Start butt".)      </p>

		<p>I get &quot;SQL Query Anal&#8230;&quot; button on my toolbar at work all the time.</p>
<p>I have an unrelated question though.  What is the algorithm that determines where an icon from a downloaded file is going to be placed on the desktop (given that the auto order thing is off)?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve noticed on my copy of XP it seems to take the cursor position at the exact point the download finishes, when I&#8217;m dragging and dropping from an FTP site. Which is often really confusing.</p>

		<p>Funny i use a vertical task bar and if i make it smaller it cuts the word, no elipse either.<br />
This may be a Win2k thing?</p>

		<p>Here (Windows XP Pro) it removes the buttontext like Raymond writes, but the algorithm doesn&#8217;t look very good, IMHO. Seems like it first tries to write &quot;Start&quot; but after that decides that it couldn&#8217;t write the whole word and removes it. Is there some good reasons for this behaviour?</p>

		<p>Why is &quot;the alternative&quot; truncated text instead of vertical text.</p>

		<p>I have issues in XP with the quicklaunch icons on a vertical taskbar.  Depending on the order I do things, they end up either full sized or small.  If they&#8217;re small, they are not centered on the taskbar and it looks silly.  So I ended up fenagling it until I got the large icons back.  I don&#8217;t think the vertical functionality was tested that much :)  (I&#8217;m sure not many run this way).</p>
<p>As it is now, I have a narrow taskbar on the left, with just the windows logo for the start button, large quicklaunch icons, and my running tasks have just the small icon for the app, with no text.  My systray, err, notification area can fit two icons next to each other, and I turned off the &quot;AM/PM&quot; on the time (otherwise it got clipped).  It&#8217;s actually very clean looking, and (IMHO) a good use of space.  If I have several, say, IE windows open, I can quickly tell which is which by the tooltip text.</p>

		<p>My cousin was messing around with my cpu, now I can&#8217;t figure out how to dock the taskbar horizontally again! I have tried dragging, but there is no response.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
