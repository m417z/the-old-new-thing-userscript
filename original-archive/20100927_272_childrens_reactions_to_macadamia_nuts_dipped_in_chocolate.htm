<p>Some time ago, we had some people over our house for dinner, and we had a selection of desserts including chocolate-covered macadamia nuts. The children in attendance finished their dinner before the adults (because the adults were busy <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/08/10/9862759.aspx"> doing boring things like talking</a>) and were excused to go play.</p>
<p> It so happens that the play room is right next to the kitchen, and in the kitchen was the dessert table, including a bowl of chocolate-covered macadamia nuts, which the children managed to consume in their entirety before the adults <i>finally finished talking</i> and went to get dessert. </p>
<p> The second half of the story didn't come until a few days later, when we were taking out the recycling. At the bottom of the recycling bin was a collection of macadamia nuts with all the chocolate sucked off. </p>
<p> (I was reminded of this story by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/09/24/10067120.aspx#10067324"> laonianren's comment on chocolate-covered Brazil nuts</a>.) </p>

		<p>My one-year-old recently went through a phase of sucking all the cheese sauce off macaroni and cheese, and then spitting out the pasta. &nbsp;She was really good at getting all the cheese off.</p>

		<p>But macadamia nuts are great, even without chocolate! &nbsp;I wonder if that&#39;s an age thing&#8230; Kids seem to like sugar in all its forms.</p>

		<p>In reference to your recent post, I much prefer Brazil nuts to Macadamias. And I&#39;m Australian!</p>

		<p>A pastor was visiting his elderly parisheners at their home, and got into a long conversation with one kindly old lady. While they were talking, he took peanuts from a bowl on her table, one by one.</p>
<p>Eventually, he realized he had eaten them all and said, &quot;I&#39;m sorry I seem to have eaten all your peanuts.&quot; and she replied &quot;That&#39;s OK, I only like to suck the chocolate off.&quot;</p>

		<p>My father likes to remind me of how when I was little I&#39;d lick the salsa off chips and just discard the chip. &nbsp;At least I didn&#39;t try to go back for more with the same chip.</p>

		<p>When I was a kid I remember eating fresh(well fresh fallen) Macadamia nuts, they are great for motor skills if you only have a hammer ;). As an eight year old it is was so disappointing when the shell got mashed into the nut&#8230;..</p>

		<p>When I was a kid I said ‘Desertleating, desertleating!’ at the start of every meal. Desert was the only part I cared about, the rest seemed to be just an unnecessary hurdle to get there.</p>

		<p>those spoiled kids these days. In my time we seldom had dessert at meals. Usually only when we had visitors&#8230; or maybe some fruit salad or so when my mother was generous (or &#8211; more likely &#8211; the fruit &quot;needed eating&quot;)</p>

		<p>I would relate this &quot;experiment&quot; with the fact that we start in life with a uni-dimensional perception of things, from physical objects to morality. And, only with time, do our motor skills and moral compass get to a point where we can make fine adjustments or distinctions. And so would taste, with an appreciation for combinations of textures and flavors.</p>
<p>(Of course, the fact that kids would sell their parents for a pound of sugar may not be foreign to this phenomenon.)</p>

		<p>At least they knew to recycle the uneaten nuts. &nbsp;I hope you did the ecologically friendly thing and recycled them :)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
