A customer had a programming problem regarding tab stops:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
I create a parent window (child of main frame) as below
</p>
<pre>
// Create the popup window that holds the toolbar.
if (!CreateEx(
        <b>WS_EX_TOOLWINDOW | WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT</b> | WS_EX_LAYERED,
        _T("ToolbarPopupWindow"),
        _T(""),
        WS_POPUP | WS_CLIPSIBLINGS,
        0, 0, 0, 0,
        pParentWnd-&gt;GetSafeHwnd(),
        NULL))
</pre>
<p>
This window hosts 2 toolbar windows.
Each toolbar window
has the <code>WS_TABSTOP</code> style set using
<code>SetWindowLong</code>.
</p>
<pre>
// Set tab stop for accessibility
DWORD dwStyles = ::GetWindowLong(GetSafeHwnd(), GWL_STYLE);
::SetWindowLong(GetSafeHwnd(), GWL_STYLE, dwStyles | WS_TABSTOP);
</pre>
<p>
MSDN states 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
<b>WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT</b>
Allows the user to navigate among the child windows of the window
by using the TAB key.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
But I am not able to use TAB to navigate to second toolbar.
I tried handling <code>WM_GETDLGCODE</code> and return
<code>DLGC_WANTTAB</code>. But this message is not sent to parent.
</p>
<p>
I can try subclassing the toolbar to handle TAB key, but if
I do that, then what's the point of the <code>WS_TABSTOP</code>
and <code>WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT</code> styles?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
You already know how to solve this customer's problem.
The quoted documentation comes
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/61fe4bte.aspx">
from the MFC documentation on extended window styles</a>.
You may find that
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms632680.aspx">
the documentation in the Platform SDK to be a bit better</a>.
Which is not unexpected,
since extended window styles are a Platform SDK
feature; MFC is merely surfacing the underlying Win32 functionality
in its own framework.
</p>
<p>
Final clue:
Look at
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/21/55384.aspx">
this old blog entry</a>,
but come to it with a different point of view.
</p>
<p>
I used my psychic powers to solve this one.
A close reading of the description of the problem reveals
that the window in question is not part of a dialog box,
which means that the standard dialog message loop is not active.
Which means that a crucial step is missing.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=m><p>
Did you remember to
call <code>IsDialogMessage</code> in your message loop?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The customer confirmed that this was the missing step.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
You are right, my window is not a dialog box.
Handling <code>IsDialogMessage</code> solved the issue.
</p>

		<p>So that&#39;s the explanation for that.</p>
<p>I always thought putting code in WinMain to detect and handle VK_TAB was weird.</p>

		<p>IsDialogMessage() has a huge side effect? This naming convention is as brilliant as the Windows registry. Keys are directories, values are keys, and data are values.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
