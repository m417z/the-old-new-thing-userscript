<p> Unless you've been living under a rock, by now you know about MSDN's <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/innovation/archive/2009/04/22/launching-low-bandwidth-loband-v1-and-new-ide-view.aspx"> low bandwidth view (aka ScriptFree)</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/innovation/archive/2009/10/26/launching-lightweight-beta-view-for-msdn-library.aspx"> lightweight</a> view. But there are other views too, like PDA view (for when you want to look up MSDN documentation on your phone?), Robot view, printer-friendly view, unstyled HTML view... (See that first link above for more details.) </p>
<p> But in addition to all the views, you can go directly to the back-end that drives all the data: The <a href="http://services.msdn.microsoft.com/ContentServices/ContentService.asmx"> MSDN/TechNet Publish System (MTPS) Content Service</a>. With that interface, you can request the back-end data and format it any way you like. Here's <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163541.aspx"> an MSDN Magazine article which builds a documentation viewer</a>, and <a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/community/blogs/craig/"> the author of that article</a> also developed <a href="http://www.pluralsight-training.net/community/blogs/craig/archive/2006/06/12/27288.aspx"> a command-line tool which returns the content as a man page</a>.

		<p>What are the terms of service?</p>
<p>Would it for example be legal to create an Eclipse plugin that fetches documentation from the online MSDN?</p>
<p>How about crawling the service for offline use, &agrave; la the Platform SDK? Is that okay? Is there a way to get a list pages changed since a certain date?</p>

		<p>Wow, I can&#39;t believe the awesomeness of how awesome this is! Must code now &#8230;</p>
<p>About the Terms of Use: Where I come from, things left unspecified are usually limited only by the local laws. And considering Microsoft&#39;s continual phobia of BitTorrent for downloads, I assume they don&#39;t care about bandwidth.</p>

		<p>@peterchen: I&#39;m not sure that bandwidth or &quot;number of open connections&quot; qualify as common use words (particularly in legal documents). &nbsp;Anyway, the terms of service cover bandwidth abuse in the following clauses &#8211; no hard numbers given, just that you&#39;re not allowed to cause problems and they can cut you off for whatever reason:</p>
<p>==================================</p>
<p>&quot;You may not use the Services in any manner that could damage, disable, overburden, or impair any Microsoft server, or the network(s) connected to any Microsoft server, or interfere with any other party&#39;s use and enjoyment of any Services&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Microsoft reserves the right to terminate your access to any or all of the Communication Services at any time, without notice, for any reason whatsoever.&quot;</p>
<p>==================================</p>
<p>On the other hand, the terms of service also say that you will not use &quot;any material or information, including images or photographs, which are made available through the Services in any manner that infringes any copyright&quot;. I wonder if the fact that Microsoft has made the MTPS service available is enough of an implicit permission to use their copyrighted MSDN materials. &nbsp;I&#39;d assume so, but I don&#39;t know to what extent.</p>

<p>Try the common sense one &#8211; use the materials for reference. However, don&#39;t use it as a way to scrape the contents of MSDN and publish it as a book you own, or basically copy it all and put it in some program that you sell as an offline reference. You can write the program, but your users have to download the content themselves since you can&#39;t distribute.</p>

		<p>Raymond, you assume too much. I had checked the general MSDN terms, but apart from a little bit of vague language (already pointed out) and some conditions on what you can do with the MSDN documentation *content*, it keeps pretty silent on (pull). Also, (pull) obviously doesn&#39;t contain a link to terms, so I&#39;m still wondering. Are there no terms of service beyond the law, or can I just not find them?.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
