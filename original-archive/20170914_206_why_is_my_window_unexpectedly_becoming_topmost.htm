<p>
A customer had a problem where one of their program's
windows was somehow receiving the
<code>WS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>TOP&shy;MOST</code>
extended window style, thereby becoming topmost.
The scenario was that they created a popup window with the
<code>WS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>TOP&shy;MOST</code>
extended style,
and subsequently opened a document window.
If they destroyed the popup window before creating the document
window, then everything was fine.
But if they created the document window before destroying the
popup window,
then their main app magically gained the
<code>WS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>TOP&shy;MOST</code>
extended style.
Their investigation revealed that nobody was calling
<code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Long</code> with
<code>GWL_</code><code>EXSTYLE</code>
and
<code>WS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>TOP&shy;MOST</code>.&sup1;
Are there other ways that a window can become topmost?
</p>
<p>
One way that a window can become topmost is if it is created
with the
<code>WS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>TOP&shy;MOST</code>
extended style.
</p>
<p>
Another way that a window can become topmost is if you
call
<code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Pos</code> and pass
<code>HWND_</code><code>TOP&shy;MOST</code> as the
<code>hwnd&shy;Insert&shy;After</code>.
</p>
<p>
Yet another way that a window can become topmost is if you
pass a topmost window as the
<code>hwnd&shy;Insert&shy;After</code>.
</p>
<p>
Armed with this information, the customer did some more
investigation and reported back:
They found a call to
<code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Pos</code> that was
making the window topmost.
</p>
<p>
Mystery solved!
</p>
<p>
&sup1;
Not that anybody should be doing that anyway.
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/ff700543(v=vs.85).aspx">
The documentation for the
<code>WS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>TOP&shy;MOST</code>
extended style</a>
says that you shouldn't be manipulating the extended style
bit directly.
"To add or remove this style, use the
<code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Pos</code> function."</p>

		<p>I would expect that setting WS_EX_TOPMOST using SetWindowLong would result in some kind of crazy delayed-topmost behavior.</p>
<p>Incidentally, turning on and off WS_CHILD using SetWindowLong causes surprising behavior; but not doing it when you need to causes more surprising behavior (abusing SetWindowParent to give an overlapped window a parent kind of works &#8230;).</p>

		<p>I think I tried doing that back on Windows 3.1 to turn a child window into a popup window although unsurprisingly Windows didn&#8217;t appreciate it and I switched to creating a dummy parent popup window instead.</p>

		<p>It seems a little confusing that a style (WS_EX_TOPMOST) is also a state value reflecting that the window is, in fact, topmost. This begs the question as to whether it is ever possible that a window have WS_EX_TOPMOST style without being on top.</p>

		<p>A topmost window can be behind another topmost window. So, all topmost windows are in front of all non-topmost windows, but there&#8217;s an order within each of those groups.</p>

		<p>And you get a bonus if you can figure out how to always keep your topmost window on top of all the other topmost windows.  :)</p>

		<p>For once, a customer that was not stupid or incompetent! I feel that the scenarios mentioned should be added to the documentation for WS_EX_TOPÂ­MOST to help anyone else with the same potential problem.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
