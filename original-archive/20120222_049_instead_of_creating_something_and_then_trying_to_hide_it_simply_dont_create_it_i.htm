<p> It's a good thing the customer explained what they wanted, because they started out asking for the impossible part. Arbitrary control of notification icons is not programmatically exposed because all the awesome programs would just force themselves on. But they clarified that what they really want is a way to reduce the visibility of their icon so it displays only when a notification is being shown. </p>
<p> And there's a way to do that, and it doesn't involve having to programmatically configure anything. </p>
<p> If you don't want your notification icon to appear in the notification area, then <i>don't show your notification icon in the first place</i> unless you have a notification. </p>
<ul>
<li>When your program starts, don't call     <code>Shell_<wbr>Notify&shy;Icon(NIM_<wbr>ADD)</wbr></wbr></code>.     Since you don't call the function, you don't get a notification icon. </li>
<li>When you want to display a notification,     call     <code>Shell_<wbr>Notify&shy;Icon(NIM_<wbr>ADD)</wbr></wbr></code>. </li>
<li>When the situation that calls for the notification has passed,     call     <code>Shell_<wbr>Notify&shy;Icon(NIM_<wbr>REMOVE)</wbr></wbr></code>. </li>
</ul>
<p> In other words, use the notification icon in the manner it was intended. </p>
<p> It's sad that notification icon abuse has become so popular (and application frameworks make it so easy to create an abusive notification icon) that people forget how to create a well-behaved notification icon. Instead, they start with the abusive method, and then try to figure out how to make it less abusive. </p>

		<p>I also see lots of &quot;minimize to tray&quot; or similar ideas where the minimized application shows up as a notification icon, which is really desirable for a program that must be always running to function but doesn&#39;t need to real-estate that an application would need.

		<p>I have to agree with Joshua. It&#39;s probably not how the notification area was envisioned, but an extremely common use these days is to keep a discrete indication about resident apps, and this is probably what the customer wanted to do.</p>

		<p>Wait, what if a program wants the /default/ to be &quot;Only show notifications&quot; instead of &quot;Show icon and notifications&quot; but wants to still allow the user to change that if the user disagrees? &nbsp;(Assume here that the program doesn&#39;t want to force itself to be &quot;Only show notifications&quot; when the user has set the default to &quot;Hide icon and notifications&quot; (assuming you can do that &#8212; I don&#39;t have my Win7 box in front of me at the moment.))</p>
<p>Sure, the program could put its /own/ setting in for whether to show up or not, but then, what&#39;s the point of centralizing the pretty Win7 support for it?</p>

<p>Action Center. Sync Center. Fully hiding Action Center is possible but breaks Windows Update notifications. Too bad actually permitting the notification area to show all icons is no longer realistic.</p>

		<p>&quot;When the situation that calls for the notification has passed, call Shell_NotifyIcon(NIM_REMOVE)&quot;</p>
<p>How does the program know when this has happened? Supposedly they want to hide the icon after the notification is dismissed &#8211; which you&#39;d think should be handled by the OS which is displaying the notification and handling the dismissal. I still see why they&#39;d want to do it the original way (letting the OS manage the display of the icon). Otherwise they have to try work out when the notification is dismissed (perhaps there is a message?)</p>

<p>There are other common notifications like &#39;Download complete&#39;, &#39;New wireless networks discovered&#39; where the condition persists even after dismissal. It is after-all a &quot;notification&quot;, not necessarily a &quot;state&quot;. I can certainly see a requirement for a generic means to &quot;notify&quot; without having to do icon management.</p>

		<p>This &quot;solution&quot; has very different behavior than what was requested.</p>
<p>&quot;No one&quot; already mentioned the possibility for the user to configure the notifications.</p>
<p>But even absent that, the &quot;Show only notifications&quot; causes an icon to appear when the little arrow beside the notification area is clicked to expand hidden icons. &nbsp;Icons there provide access to nifty things like a popup menu to exit the daemon. &nbsp;Exiting the daemon allows things like upgrading dependencies (Java, for instance) without a reboot (if the daemon is left running, the files requiring replacement are in use).</p>
<p>By not creating the icon at all, instead of creating it in the hidden list, there&#39;s no UI to access the daemon.</p>
<p>Now, in Windows 7 the running applications bar is no longer as scarce a resource as it used to be, but having an icon there still uses considerably more screen estate than a notification icon (let alone a hidden notification icon).</p>
<p>So where do you put an exit menu where the user can get to it when needed, but it doesn&#39;t take up screen space otherwise?</p>

		<p>Strange, I can&#39;t think of any applications which have a Start menu item for quitting a running process. There&#39;s a certain comedy value to spawning a new process from a Start menu shortcut just to tell an existing process to quit, but I suppose it could make some sense.</p>
<p>Creating things only to show them again was actually the culprit in a performance issue I debugged earlier this year: we had an outsourced application to gather weekly data on project progress. In order to display the current week&#39;s data, it generated ALL the UI elements for every week of the whole project, then hid all but the current week &#8211; so the longer the project duration, the longer it took to load. (This was a web application, rather than desktop.)</p>

		<p>When I am asked to work on someone&#39;s computer, due to slowness or other issues, I often set it to show all notification icons. &nbsp;Then I go through each program and ask the user if they need program XYZ or not, and often their answer is &quot;I don&#39;t know what that program does, and I don&#39;t use it&quot;. &nbsp;So I uninstall it.</p>
<p>Showing all icons all the time has the terrific side-effect of reminding people to clean up junk that they don&#39;t need. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, I am surprised that more people don&#39;t use a two-row-high taskbar. &nbsp;You get the added benefit of date and &quot;day of the week&quot; below the clock, along with allowing all notification icons to be shown without taking up so much of the taskbar.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
