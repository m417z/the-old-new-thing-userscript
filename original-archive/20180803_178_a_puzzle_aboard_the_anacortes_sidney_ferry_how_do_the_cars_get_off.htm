For a ferry that goes from one point to another
with no stops in between, cars are loaded onto
the ferry from one end, and
en route, the cars face the direction of travel.
When the ferry reaches the destination, the cars
drive off.
Easy peasy.
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="http://www.wsdot.com/ferries/schedule/scheduledetailbyroute.aspx?route=ana-sj-sid">
The ferry from Anacortes to Sidney
makes a stop at Friday Harbor</a>.
This makes for some interesting logistics.
</p>
<p>
At Anacortes, cars are loaded from the rear,&sup1;
and the cars destined for Friday Harbor
are loaded first, so that they wind up at the front of
the ferry.

The ferry continues onward to Sidney,
but things are interesting
because you have cars
on the deck which are facing directly at each other.
The cars which boarded in Anacortes are in the back
of the ferry facing forward,
but the cars which boarded in Friday Harbor are in the
front of the ferry facing backward.
They are pointed at each other nose-to-nose.

<p>
We wondered how the three lanes of
cars were going to get off the ferry,
since
<a HREF="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2018/04/06/599888104/so-two-goats-were-stuck-on-a-beam-under-a-bridge">
they appeared to be blocking</a>
<a HREF="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1308577/Goats-stuck-bridge-ledge-Montana-days.html">each other</a>.
</p>
<p>
We split up to find the answer.
</p>
<p>
But why don't you try to puzzle it out yourself.
I'll wait.
</p>
<div STYLE="height: 500px"></div>
<p>
One person asked the clerk at the gift shop,
who said,
"The wrong-way-facing cars back out."
</p>
<p>
Another person asked someone who was identified
as an engineer,
who said,
"The wrong-way-facing cars make a
three-point U-turn on the deck."
</p>
<p>
I asked somebody wearing a bright orange safety
vest, figuring they worked on the car deck.
"We leave one lane with all the cars pointing
in the direction of travel
and empty them first.
We use that empty lane
to unload the other cars pointed the same way.
And the cars that are facing the wrong way
make a big loop on the deck to turn around.
We call that <i>flipping</i>."
</p>
<p>
I joked,
"Maybe you could get a
<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_Susan">
Lazy Susan</a> to turn the cars around."
</p>
<p>
"Actually,
<a HREF="http://www.romancingalaska.com/southeast/SE_alaska_marine_highway_system.htm">
that's what they do on some Alaska ferries</a>."
</p>
<p>
Okay, so we asked three different people and got three
different answers.
Who's right?
</p>
<p>
Turns out everybody was right.
(Though I was most right.)
</p>
<p>
The last vehicle to load at Friday Harbor was a
large camper van, which blocked multiple lanes.
They backed out off the ferry.
They were closely followed by the cars in the
lane where everybody was pointing the right way.
(Like, no pressure on the camper van driver.)
</p>
<p>
The ferry crew then used that empty lane to get the other
two lanes of forward-facing cars off the ferry.
</p>
<p>
Finally,
the wrong-facing cars made U-turns to get off.
Most of them used the open space
on the deck to make a U-turn,
but a few made three-point turns.
</p>
<p>
&sup1;
The ferry is symmetric and doesn't really have a
"front" or a "rear",
but I gave them names based on the direction of travel.</p>

		<p>I came up with orange safety vest guy&#8217;s solution. The gift shop clerk&#8217;s proposal was also a possibility, but seemed far less efficient. I didn&#8217;t even consider the self-identified engineer&#8217;s option and I&#8217;ve been on enough car ferries to strongly doubt there would be enough room on a full car deck.</p>

		<p>I have been on that ferry several times, but only before about 1990. Never thought about the situation before. Thank you for a most excellent diversion just now. Well played.</p>
<p>I now live in Georgia now. Like that matters&#8230;</p>

		<p>The problem statement has misleading information.  It says &#8220;the cars which boarded in Friday Harbor are facing backward. And they are pointed at each other nose-to-nose.&#8221;  </p>
<p>There is no mention that there is more than one lane on the ferry (although we could maybe guess that, it wasn&#8217;t in the illustration).  The mention that the cars pointed at each other &#8220;nose to nose&#8221; doesn&#8217;t say that there are some lanes where this is not true.  I suppose that the complete info would have made the problem too easy&#8230;.</p>

		<p>I too read &#8220;We wondered how the three lanes of cars were&#8230;.&#8221; and then thought &#8220;What!??&#8221;.  I reread and couldn&#8217;t see reference to the lanes earlier.  I guess mentioning what was observed &#8211; that there was an entire line still facing one direction may have given the game away (assuming you could see the entire line in one view, which is probably unlikely)</p>

		<p>Easy solution: have the cars which board at Friday Harbor drive backwards onto the ferry.  Perhaps even employ one of the orange-safety-vest people as a valet.  All cars would be facing the direction of travel at the last dock which should ease the deboarding process.</p>

		<p>Ferry from Bari to Durres does that with big vehicles like trucks. No wonder the ferry left two hours after original departure time :-)<br />
It is loaded from back only, not the normal ro-ro style.</p>

		<p>Dumb question.  How do more people get on the ferry at Friday Harbor than get off??  Do they not fill the ferry to capacity and leave space at the front of the line(s)?  Just curious?  I&#8217;ve made this run multiple times and never paid attention as to how it was done.  It didn&#8217;t even register that the cars loading at Friday Harbor were facing the cars loaded at Anacortes.  And wouldn&#8217;t Orcas, Shaw, and Lopez be handled the same way?</p>

		<p>If more people are getting on at Friday Harbor than off, then they have to leave room at the front of the ferry at Anacortes.</p>

		<p>I wonder what the fuss is about. Backing off a ferry in reverse for one or two car lengths, to me, seems to be a manageable challenge. Once you are on dry land, you can always make a three-point turn and continue forward in the right direction.</p>

		<p>Think of it from the perspective of the ferry operator: what cheaper to operate?  The ferry as-is, with people backing out/turning around on board, with guidance from crew members, or a massive investment in their fleet of ships, to equip them with some sort of lazy susan?</p>

		<p>My memory is a little hazy, but IIRC, the ferry &#8220;The Cat&#8221; that formerly operated* between Bar Harbor, Maine and Yarmouth, Nova Scotia only had a vehicle ramp on one end, and it had a semicircular turnaround lane at the other end.  During loading, some of the cars would board, use the turnaround, then face backwards during transit, while the cars that boarded later would stay facing forwards and fill in the remaining lanes.  During unloading, the cars facing backwards would exit, then the other cars facing forwards would drive through the turnaround and exit.</p>
<p>* I&#8217;m specifically referring to the ship that operated between 2002–2005.  The ship that currently operates between Portland, Maine and Yarmouth is a different one, though it looks quite similar.  Interestingly, the FAQ for that one <a href="https://www.ferries.ca/thecat/faq/" rel="nofollow">https://www.ferries.ca/thecat/faq/</a> mentions that RVs must board *and* exit backwards.  I can&#8217;t think of why that would be necessary.</p>
<p>(I might also be confusing this with the M/S Scotia Prince, a different ship that formerly operated between Portland and Yarmouth.  Like I said, my memory is hazy.)</p>

		<p>Once cars have driven off at Friday Harbor, all remaining vehicles move forward as far as possible.<br />
Ferry backs out, turns around, and re-docks the other way.<br />
New cars drive in.</p>

		<p>Only a few cars get off at Friday Harbor. Your plan would require the entire ferry to get back in their cars just to let 20 cars off. And turning a ferry around and redocking takes a long time as well.</p>

		<p>My solution was to divide the ferry vertically, so that all of the cars travelling the full distance park on one side and the cars going half-way park on the other side; they then leave forwards at the half-way point and the new cars drive on facing the other way; those new cars then leave forwards at the destination while the other cars can then use the space to turn around. However I see now the benefit of single lane approach, as long as you arrange for a diagonal border something like this (if the blog formatting doesn&#8217;t get in my way):</p>
<p>[oo} [oo} [oo} [oo} [oo} [oo} [oo} [oo} [oo} 9 facing forwards<br />
[oo} [oo} [oo} [oo} {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] 4 forwards 5 backwards<br />
[oo} [oo} [oo} {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] 3 forwards 6 backwards<br />
[oo} [oo} {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] {oo] 2 forwards 7 backwards</p>
<p>After emptying the 18 facing forwards the 7 facing backwards U-turn in the available space and the other 11 cars can then follow them.</p>

		<p>My first idea was to drive the cars that are in reverse out backwards. </p>
<p>But then I remember that I sometimes have trouble driving my car backwards out of my 3 car garage&#8230;</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
