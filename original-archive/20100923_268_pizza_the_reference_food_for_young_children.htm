<p>Where they drunk at the time? Okonomiyaki is more like an omelette or a pancake than a pizza. :P</p>
<p>Then again, considering the atrocities that some restaurants have the gall to call Pizza over here (I live in Japan) I wouldn&#39;t be all that surprised if you&#39;re telling the truth. ;)</p>

		<p>I have just asked my 16 year old whether he might like to try some quiche. Not having been in-vogue for many years, the aforementioned dish (quiche) is as alien to him as are plover&#39;s eggs. &nbsp;I therefore mooted the suggestion that quiche is rather similar to a deep-dish pizza.</p>
<p>The somewhat diffident ripost came back:</p>
<p>&quot;Why do they mess around with the original?! Those we had in Italy were thin and crisp exactly as they should be. You know the Italians laugh at the &nbsp;rubbish we put on Pizzas here?&quot;</p>
<p>I suspect the Italian girl-friend might be bringing some influence to bear!</p>
<p>I also suspect that there is simply no pleasing some people! :))_</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve found authenticity to be a mixed blessing; of the two Chinese buffet restaurants near work, the one a Chinese co-worker (which I actually mistyped then as co-woker, which somehow seemed apt!) as being more authentic is the less appealing (worse hygiene for one thing, and the food itself isn&#39;t as nice) &#8211; and I&#39;d far rather have a big chain pizza with lots of toppings and a stuffed cheesy crust than an &quot;authentic&quot; Italian-style pizza with sparse toppings. In general, I suppose there are good reasons for dishes getting Westernized for our palates.</p>
<p>Having said that, I did have a very nice pizza in an Italian restaurant in London a few years ago: extremely light and fluffy with just a little tomato sauce, and some good Thai dishes built around food which is rare in Thailand but more common here.</p>
<p>I still remember studying Latin in high school and having a Roman dish described as a precursor of pizza &#8211; probably not too far from the truth, in this case.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve enjoyed Italian pizza and American pizza. I know some eclectic pizza joints here (ATL) that have decent margherita-style pizza among others. &nbsp;The thing to remember is they may all be called pizza, but they&#39;re different. &nbsp;People like what they like. For example, the canned lemon-flavored tea; if you can get over the fact that it says &quot;tea&quot; on the can, it&#39;s actually kind of nice, but it&#39;s nothing like tea.</p>
<p>Q: Why is pizza in America better than pizza in Italy?</p>
<p>A: We use imported cheese and they use domestic.</p>

		<p>James: The canteen on our research campus opened a wok station (i.e. where you could get &quot;live cooked&quot; Chinese-style food as opposed to the conventional offerings) back when Windows NT 4.0 Workstation was current. I had fun with taking the default-user background image with the &quot;Workstation&quot; lettering and made a version that read &quot;Wokstation&quot;. Sadly, I never found a good opportunity to use it anywhere&#8230;</p>

<p>Just to clarify: I don&#39;t want to seem smug about food: I too enjoy my junk food now and then, and we too have fast foods that sell uneatable pizza. My point is, don&#39;t think that pizza is like American pizza &#8211; real pizza is a whole different thing.</p>

		<p>You know the world is really #$%$#%$ up when you have to tell your kids that a quesadilla is like a Mexican pizza.</p>
<p>For the record, in Mexico, a quesadilla is made out of cheese (no meat involved at all, just cheese, that&#39;s why it&#39;s called quesadilla, because it&#39;s made out of queso) in a corn (or flour) tortilla (again, no hard shell). The original recipe doesn&#39;t mention any slicing or cutting the tortilla in pieces. You&#39;re supposed to grab the whole quesadilla with your hand and eat it bite by bite. And there&#39;s no kids version of the quesadilla in Mexico.</p>

		<p>I think it&#39;s a bit of stretch comparing quiche to pizza, given the egg custard and pastry crust.</p>
<p>You could say Naan is Indian pizza (but the toppings are not as lavish). Perhaps uthapam too, although it&#39;s made from rice. (IMHO any &quot;pizza&quot; should be made from wheat :P)</p>
<p>How about Welsh Rarebit as English/Welsh pizza?</p>

<p>I spent some time in Oaxaca as a student. Some of the locals there did eat quesadillas with meat in them. Cold cuts, to be specific. And they sliced it. es.wikipedia&#39;s article on &quot;quesadilla&quot; also says there are variants with meat.</p>

		<p>[ I&#39;d far rather have a big chain pizza with lots of toppings and a stuffed cheesy crust than an &quot;authentic&quot; Italian-style pizza with sparse toppings. ]</p>
<p>We too in Italy have many pizza types with lots of toppings (e.g. pepperoni pizza with sausages, onions and everything it&#39;s perfectly fine), some of which imported from abroad (e.g. pizza with pineapple or with chips &#8211; both horrible in my opinion), but the key of a good pizza is in the base.</p>
<p>The bread base should be about 3 mm thick (thinner is often dry or not satisfying, higher tends to become gummy, which often happens with fast-food pizzas, ugh), and there must be all around a border of about 1-2 cm, which, if done correctly, can be one of the best parts of the pizza &#8211; shame on those who leave it in the plate!</p>
<p>Needless to say, tomato sauce and mozzarella (*real* mozzarella ~shudder~) should be of good quality and put on the pizza in abundance.</p>
<p>[ Clearly you&#39;re right. &nbsp;If they were exposed to Deep Dish, I&#39;m pretty sure they wouldn&#39;t laugh. &nbsp;They&#39;d probably cry. &nbsp;:-) ]</p>
<p>Just seen it on the Wiki. I think that it actually *can* be good (when you&#39;re in the mood of eating junk food/McDonald&#39;s/kebab/&#8230;), but it&#39;s definitely not pizza. :)</p>

		<p>I visited a friend in Italy for a couple weeks, and she took me several times to a great pizzeria near her apartment. &nbsp;I&#39;m a big fan of deep-dish pizza (I&#39;m a doughboy), but despite being closer to what we&#39;d consider a thin crust, that stuff was pretty fantastic. &nbsp;Cooked in a brick oven and topped lightly with tomato sauce, prosciutto, artichoke, and olives. &nbsp;Mmmmm! &nbsp;I&#39;m not giving up my Pizza Hut deep-dish super-supreme anytime soon, but I&#39;d cheerfully go back.</p>

		<p>The last time I was in Chicago, I went to one of the places that claims it&#39;s famous for its deep dish pizza. &nbsp;The stuff was horrible &#8212; doughy, undercooked, tasteless, yuck. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, Chez Panisse in Berkeley makes great pizzas with all kinds of eclectic toppings on them. &nbsp;And great calzones. &nbsp;(Upstairs, not downstairs. &nbsp;And that was 20 years ago. &nbsp;The last time I went there, 4 years ago, I didn&#39;t have pizza.)</p>
<p>@Poochner: Funny. &nbsp;It&#39;s like the joke that says Europe is nice to visit, but there are too many foreigners there.</p>

		<p>@Anonymous</p>
<p>Sure they did. Just like they put queso fresco and avocado on tacos in Matamoros. There&#39;s no single standard when it comes to what to put in a quesadilla. I was thinking more about the &quot;original&quot; (as in the base class) recipe. The simplest, lowest common denominator, basic quesadilla. Those oaxaqueÃ±os must have had very small hands or very large tortillas, otherwise, no real need to slice a quesadilla (again, no standard for the size of a tortilla, but they tend to be hand-size, at least in southern Mexico).</p>

		<p>Come on, guys, the point wasn&#39;t that the referenced foods were like pizza. The point was that it&#39;s easier to get kids to eat them if you *call* them pizza. I can attest to this observation.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
