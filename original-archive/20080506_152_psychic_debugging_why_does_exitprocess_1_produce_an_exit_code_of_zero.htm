		<p>Wild guess, based on reading the hint article: They see that the exit code is 0 in the debugger, because their debugger is creating a new thread during process termination to be able to debug the process. And the debug thread terminates successfully.</p>

		<p>From MSDN</p>
<p>&quot;Terminating a process does not necessarily remove the process object from the OS. A process object is deleted when the last handle to the process is closed. &quot;</p>
<p>So, they are in a circular loop where they can&#8217;t retrieve the Exit Code until they close their handle?</p>
<p>Maybe they should call DuplicateHandle with the DUPLICATE_CLOSE_SOURCE flag.</p>

		<p>(Especially in light of the provided hint article) I would guess they are waiting for the process to end in the wrong way&#8230; probably by waiting on a mutex. &nbsp;Thus they race with the dying process to read the exit code.</p>

		<p>If the process were still running, the exit code would be 259 and not 0.</p>
<p>I have no clue what the problem is. They are doing everything right. If they are doing something incredibly stupid like calling ExitProcess from DLL_PROCESS_DETACH, we wouldn&#8217;t be requested to invoke psychic powers to debug that, that would just be plain dumb.</p>

		<p>I believe it&#8217;s involving DLL_PROCESS_DETACH &#8211; something they&#8217;re doing is pooching the exit code.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my guess anyway.</p>

		<p>Joel: You don&#8217;t want the OS to delete the process object, that&#8217;s where your exit code is stored.</p>
<p>El Guapo: (rereads documentation) Ah, you&#8217;re right. d&#8217;oh!</p>
<p>Calling RaiseException with 0 doesn&#8217;t seem like psychic debugging, either.</p>
<p>Maybe we can get to ExitProcess(0) with a better story behind it&#8230; something like: DLL_PROCESS_DETACH handler tries to use a critical section, ends up reading something in an inconsistent state, faults, the exception filter runs and ends the process with 0.</p>
<p>Would such an exception be handled by a try/catch block? &nbsp;The thought of an exception unwinding the stack past ExitProcess is pretty scary.</p>

		<p>Yeah, a crash is probably happening in a DLL_PROCESS_DETACH, which is just causing TerminateProcess to be called on self and thus an exit code of 0.</p>

		<p>My psychic powers are weak; my guess is that some loaded DLL is either crashing or calling ExitProcess(0) during DLL_PROCESS_DETACH.</p>

		<p>Maybe they aren&#8217;t checking the return value from GetExitCodeProcess? The process might be racing or hung in which case the return value would be STILL_ACTIVE (259), but they wouldn&#8217;t know that, since they didn&#8217;t check it?</p>

		<p>I am able to reproduce this with an UnhandledExceptionFilter (using ExitProcess again) and with structured exception handling (returning control to main.) &nbsp;I imagine there are other permutations of this approach as well.</p>
<p>Kudos to whoever made ExitProcess behave so well in these circumstances.</p>

		<p>My guess is that they&#8217;re using ShellExecute to launch the program. &nbsp;Then they&#8217;re passing the return value of ShellExecute to GetExitCodeProcess. &nbsp;But since ShellExecute doesn&#8217;t return a process handle this causes GetExitCodeProcess to return 0 for error.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
