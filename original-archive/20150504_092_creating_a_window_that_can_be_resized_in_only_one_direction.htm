Today's Little Program shows a window that can be resized in
only
<a HREF="http://www.onedirectionmusic.com/">
one direction</a>,
let's say vertically but not horizontally.
</p>
<p>
Start with the
scratch program
and make these changes:
</p>
<pre>
UINT OnNcHitTest(HWND hwnd, int x, int y)
{
 UINT ht = FORWARD_WM_NCHITTEST(hwnd, x, y, DefWindowProc);
 switch (ht) {
 case HTBOTTOMLEFT:  ht = HTBOTTOM; break;
 case HTBOTTOMRIGHT: ht = HTBOTTOM; break;
 case HTTOPLEFT:     ht = HTTOP;    break;
 case HTTOPRIGHT:    ht = HTTOP;    break;
 case HTLEFT:        ht = HTBORDER; break;
 case HTRIGHT:       ht = HTBORDER; break;
 }
 return ht;
}

HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_NCHITTEST, OnNcHitTest);
</pre>
<p>
We accomplish this by removing horizontal resize behavior
from the left and right edges and corners.
For the corners, we remove the horizontal resizing, but
leave the vertical resizing.
For the edges, we remove resizing entirely by reporting
that the left and right edges should act like an inert border.
</p>
<p>
Wait, we're not done yet.
This handles resizing by grabbing the edges with the mouse,
but it doesn't stop the user from hitting
<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Space</kbd>,
followed by <kbd>S</kbd> (for Size),
and then hitting the left or right arrow keys.
</p>
<p>
For that, we need to handle
<code>WM_<wbr>GET&shy;MIN&shy;MAX&shy;INFO</code>.
</p>
<pre>
void OnGetMinMaxInfo(HWND hwnd, LPMINMAXINFO lpmmi)
{
 RECT rc = { 0, 0, 500, 0 };
 AdjustWindowRectEx(&amp;rc, GetWindowStyle(hwnd), FALSE,
                    GetWindowExStyle(hwnd));

 // Adjust the width
 lpmmi-&gt;ptMaxSize.x =
 lpmmi-&gt;ptMinTrackSize.x =
 lpmmi-&gt;ptMaxTrackSize.x = rc.right - rc.left;
}

HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_GETMINMAXINFO, OnGetMinMaxInfo);
</pre>
<p>
This works out great,
except for the case
of being
<!-- backref: How does the window manager adjust ptMaxSize and ptMaxPosition for multiple monitors? -->
maximized onto a secondary monitor</a>,
because we run into the mixed case of being small than the monitor
in the horizontal direction,
but larger than the monitor in the vertical direction.
</p>
<pre>
void OnGetMinMaxInfo(HWND hwnd, LPMINMAXINFO lpmmi)
{
 RECT rc = { 0, 0, 500, 0 };
 AdjustWindowRectEx(&amp;rc, GetWindowStyle(hwnd), FALSE,
                    GetWindowExStyle(hwnd));

 // Adjust the width
 lpmmi-&gt;ptMaxSize.x =
 lpmmi-&gt;ptMinTrackSize.x =
 lpmmi-&gt;ptMaxTrackSize.x = rc.right - rc.left;

 <font COLOR=blue>// Adjust the height
 MONITORINFO mi = { sizeof(mi) };
 GetMonitorInfo(MonitorFromWindow(hwnd,
                    MONITOR_DEFAULTTOPRIMARY), &amp;mi);
 lpmmi-&gt;ptMaxSize.y = mi.rcWork.bottom - mi.rcWork.top
                    - lpmmi-&gt;ptMaxPosition.y + rc.bottom;</font>
}
</pre>
<p>
The math here is a little tricky.
We want the window height to be the height of the work area of the
window monitor,
plus some extra goop in order to
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/03/04/10597470.aspx">
let the borders hang over the edge</a>.
</p>
<p>
The first two terms are easy to explain:
<code>mi.rcWork.bottom - mi.rcWork.top</code> is the height of the work area.
</p>
<p>
Next, we want to add
the height consumed by the borders that hang
off the top of the monitor.
Fortunately, the window manager told us exactly how much the window
is going to hang off the top of the monitor:
It's in <code>lpmmi-&gt;ptMaxPosition.y</code>,
but as a negative value since it is a coordinate that is off the top
of the screen.
We therefore have to negate it before adding it in.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we add the borders that hang off the bottom of the work area.
</p>
<p>
Yes, handling this mixed case (where the window is partly constrained
and partly unconstrained) is annoying.
Sorry.</p>

		<p>The beginning of my programming career having roughly coincided with the release of the .NET Framework, I&#39;m thankful for all the smart people who hid Win32 (which I&#39;ve never used directly) behind a simple and intuitive API. &nbsp;In Windows Forms, this is a matter of setting MaximumSize and MinimumSize such that their heights or widths are equal.</p>

<p>The window then would show the resize cursors on the sides where it doesn&#39;t allow to resize. And wrong resize cursors on the corners.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
