<p>All geeks who enjoy cooking (and who have cable television) worship Alton Brown's program <i><a href="http://www.foodnetwork.com/food/show_ea">Good Eats</a></i>. It's the cooking show for engineers.</p>
<p> And recently I discovered a cooking blog that is designed for engineers, named, not surprisingly, <a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/"> Cooking for Engineers</a>. Marvel at the elegance and beauty of the recipe diagrams. I have no idea whether the dishes are any good, but the recipes themselves are works of art. </p>
<p> (And don't miss the <a href="http://www.cookingforengineers.com/2004/10/off-topic-orange-juice-shelf-life.html"> analysis of orange juice shelf life</a>.) </p>
<p> Side remark: I found it somewhat odd that many Slashdotters responded to <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/09/16/230388.aspx"> my spam graph of a few days ago</a> with remarks like "This guy needs to get a hobby." I guess they don't consider cooking, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/13/72477.aspx"> knitting</a>, or studying <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/25/62762.aspx"> German</a>, <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/12/130455.aspx"> Swedish</a>, or <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/07/01/170857.aspx"> Mandarin</a> to be valid hobbies. </p>

		<p>Raymond&#8230; Learning multiple foreign languages, knitting, cooking, and posting tons of interesting posts on your blog don&#8217;t count as hobbies.  What you need to be doing is spending all day and night posting comments on Slashdot.  Now that&#8217;s a hobby.  ;)</p>

		<p>At a recent conference I picked up Barham&#8217;s Science of Cooking <a target="_new" href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/3540674667/" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/3540674667/</a> (published by&#8230; Springer Verlag!). </p>
<p>I absolutely love its detailed explanations of the physical and chemical processes underlying everyday kitchen adventures: e.g., how sugars and starches work, what meat proteins do exactly under different temperature ranges as you cook them, or why Maillard reactions are so incredibly important (and how to get them going faster). It&#8217;s the perfect high-detail companion volume to Good Eats. :)</p>

		<p>Try &quot;Americas Test Kitchen&quot; for a scientists view of cooking. They do double blind tastings of everything from chocolate to oyster sauce. And try recipies out multiple ways to find the best method to cook something.</p>
<p>They have a web site and I think the show is on PBS.</p>

		<p>The people that associate with Slashdot are some of the most close-minded, negative people I know of. The moderation system hurts as much it helps &#8211; groupthink is an easy way to get moderated up. Meanwhile, if you had invented a spoon capable of knitting German fleeces together and it ran embedded Linux they would think you were a true Renaissance man. Until they heard who your employer was&#8230;.then you&#8217;d be Satan himself.</p>
<p>Usually people who say things like &quot;you need to get a x,&quot; don&#8217;t have x themselves. Freud was so dead-on when it came to the concept of projection.</p>

		<p>Regarding &quot;America&#8217;s Test Kitchen&quot;, which is indeed a great show for those of us who enjoy the scientific method, it is an outgrowth of a equally good (if not better) magazine called &quot;Cook&#8217;s Illustrated&quot; that has been around much longer.</p>
<p>Cook&#8217;s Illustrated consistently explains from a first-person perspective how they arrived at any given recipe, and what choices had to be made to fix problems that arose. They do blind tasting as well as objective testing of kitchen tools and techniques.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve found, walking the halls of the IT world, that many (not all, just many) avid SlashDotters only consider Slashdotting a worthwhile hobby.  This may have been the problem you ran into.</p>

		<p>Engineer cooks looking for a dead-tree publication could do worse than check out Cooks&#8217; Illustrated (<a target="_new" href="http://www.cooksillustrated.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.cooksillustrated.com/</a>).  They take a scientific approach to food and cooking, somewhat like a &quot;consumer&#8217;s digest&quot; for food.  Their typesetting is elegant and spare, thanks to a no-advertising policy.</p>
<p>(The recipes are, unfortunately, uneven in my experience).</p>

		<p>Cooks&#8217; Illustrated has really nice illustrations too.  Hand drawn and all.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if I buy their no-advertising rationale though.  In particular, I don&#8217;t think they review enough products to make it necessary to have that independence.  Yes, the magazine is much more of a work of art w/o garish ads, but it&#8217;s also rather pricey.</p>

		<p>I engjoy grilling, but I absolutely loathe cooking. There are more efficient methods of acquiring food than preparing it yourself (grilling is intrinsically valuable as an artform and, thus, requires no measurement of efficiency). However, this speaks to me (via&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve had a subscription to Cooks Illustrated for about 6 years now, it&#8217;s amazing.  Absolutely amazing.</p>
<p>Their investigation on how to make the best hard boiled egg was fascinating.  They spent 5 pages on it &#8211; think about that&#8230; :)<br /></p>

		<p>You should also check out Harold McGee&#8217;s books:<br />
<br />On Food and Cooking<br />
<br />  the Science and Lore of Cooking</p>
<p>is the one closest at hand.  Again as intersting as Rob&#8217;s &quot;Barham&#8217;s Science of Cooking&quot; sounds.</p>

		<p>Also check out &quot;Cookwise&quot; by Shirley O. Corriher.  She&#8217;s the &quot;food scientist&quot; that shows up frequently on Alton Brown&#8217;s &quot;Good Eats&quot;.  In some ways, that show is close TV relative of Shirley&#8217;s book.<br /></p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
