John explained to me that the human eye is surprisingly quick at spotting     issues.     The effort required to automate the process is significant.     (Build robots to physically connect each printer,     programmatically install the printer driver, print the test notebook,     then collect and collate the output, feed it into a scanner,     then use image processing to compare the results against     reference output.)     This degree of testing is performed only twice     per OneNote release (once for the beta and once for RTM),     so the cost of developing the automation would never be     earned back with interest. </li>

		<p>I am a tester by profession, and I can relate to your second item. We had a project to generate PDF&#39;s which will then be printed to sent to end customer. My teammate &nbsp;tested the intermediate pdf&#39;s on the screen with reference template, and both looked exactly same (color, font etc). Then cam user acceptance testing, and our business user came with a ruler, and asked for printout. He logged defects for font (Arial Narrow in template a different but similar used by code) color and indentation (2mm difference) which is impossible to catch just by looking at content on screen.</p>

		<p>For several years I&#39;ve observed a direct relationship between how much automated testing is done and how buggy software is. I have concluded that automated testing fools people into thinking the software is being tested more thoroughly in real terms than it actually is. With this in mind, as management spends the money on automated testing, they tend to reduce manual testing.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
