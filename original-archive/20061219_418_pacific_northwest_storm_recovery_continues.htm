<p><a href="http://www.pse.com/">Puget Sound Energy</a> has a <a href="http://www.pse.com/InsidePSE/serviceAlert.aspx"> service status page</a> where they update how things are going in the power restoration process. The repair crews (<a href="http://www.metrokc.gov/exec/news/2006/1217storm.aspx">some from as far away as Kansas</a>) are working <a href="http://www.heraldnet.com/stories/06/11/30/100loc_a1snowside001.cfm"> 40-hour shifts</a> with eight hours' rest between shifts. (That article is from a snowstorm a few weeks ago. A manager is quoted as saying. "I've been in this industry 30 years, and I haven't seen anything like this." Well, now he gets to see it twice in one year, and it's not even winter yet!)</p>
<p> Electricity was restored to my house after only 36 hours. All of a sudden I was popular! (If you can't be popular for who you are, at least be popular for what you have.) </p>
<p> I know people who have been told that "the lines through the mountain between the main station and the substation are heavily damaged. ... Right now with the current information, Thursday night or Friday morning are the best-case scenarios" for having power restored to their neighborhood. But that explanation makes me wonder. First, how do you repair lines that run through a mountain? And second, how do you <i>damage</i> lines that run through a mountain? (Now, it's entirely likely that by "through" the mountain, they really meant "over the mountain", but it's funnier to think that the lines actually run <i>through</i> the mountain.) </p>

		<p>It astounds me that we still use over-head cabling. &nbsp;Up in my region during the Ice Storm of 1998, all power outages were due to fallen lines. &nbsp;Most of the time the lines just couldn&#8217;t handle the stress and broke; but some metal structures actually buckled from the weight of the ice. &nbsp;It has to be cheaper to bury lines then have to repair an overhead line just once.</p>
<p>My neighbourhood at the time was really new, so most of the local power lines were subterranean, so, like you, I was pretty popular having power restored relatively quickly.</p>

		<p>The entire grid in the sunny island of Singapore is underground, from the power station right to apartment buildings. I don&#8217;t know why, because we don&#8217;t have any hurricanes/typhoons/snowstorms of any sort</p>

		<p>Your &quot;through the mountain&quot; comment reminds me of a passage from the Hitchhiker&#8217;s Guide:</p>
<p>&quot;The difference between something that can go wrong and something that can&#8217;t go wrong is that, when the thing that can&#8217;t go wrong goes wrong, it&#8217;s usually impossible to get at or fix.&quot;</p>
<p>(From memory.)</p>

		<p>Underground lines are very expensive to repair. &nbsp;Corrosion and leakage can cause problems that are hard to locate. &nbsp;It is easier to see a break in a line above ground as well.</p>
<p>In places with a possibility of flooding, underground lines become a real issue.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m glad you have power :)</p>
<p>We do, but only because we&#8217;re currently in New York City &#8211; we left yesterday morning.</p>
<p>I checked &#8211; our house still doesn&#8217;t have power &#8211; 4+ days and counting.</p>

		<p>Sure, overhead power lines are vulnerable to ice, wind, trees, and trucks hitting the poles. Unfortunately buried lines are vulnerable to flooding, backhoes, rodents, and will still go dark whenever one of the above-ground links in the chain is affected by weather.</p>
<p>Although buried cables are less likely to result in an outage, the outage is likely to take much longer to fix because the cables are so hard to get to (and it&#8217;s much harder to find the fault in the first place).</p>
<p>When you consider that it costs 10 times as much to bury a cable as it does to string one up on a pole, and the buried ones last only half as long, it&#8217;s no surprise that people are still stringing up wires on poles.</p>
<p>Under most conditions it makes sense not to bury cables. Singapore buries their cables for the aesthetic value.</p>

		<p>The link that Gabe shows has some interesting papers. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Things that seem intuitively true, like putting electrical distribution wires underground will improve reliability to customers, isn&#8217;t necessarily true, and can be incredibly expensive. &nbsp;Interesting.</p>

		<p>I am feeling nostalgia for a certain old apartment located a mere quarter-mile from the Eastside Group Health Hospital.</p>
<p>Power outtage? What&#8217;s a power outtage?</p>
<p>(We lost power at 10pm Thursday. &nbsp;No, it isn&#8217;t working yet.) &nbsp;</p>
<p>Have you noticed that &quot;Do you have power?&quot; is becoming the new Eastside greeting?</p>

		<p>This was a benefit of moving to the South part of Auburn, I guess. We only got a couple of power flickers. Our friend&#8217;s family is staying with us until their Redmond house comes back online. It&#8217;s definitely cozy, but I&#8217;m sure it beats paying for a hotel room. [And keeping two kids in a single hotel room for several days has to be a special kind of hell.]</p>

<p>Sorry, I cannot see how it will solve the backhoe &nbsp;problem. People in the utility business really hate underground lines, and yes, IANEEBWIAUC :-) (I am not an electrical engeneer but I work in an utility company). The big advantage of underground lines is aesthetic/regulatory 95% of the times.</p>

		<p>Backhoes preferrentially eat fiber over buried power lines, so it&#8217;s a simple matter to trap them when they munch the decoy fiber strand. Yuo can then prevent them from going after the power lines.</p>
<p>Simple, really.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
