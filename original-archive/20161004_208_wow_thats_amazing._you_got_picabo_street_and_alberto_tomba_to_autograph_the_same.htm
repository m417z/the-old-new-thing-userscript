I've written about my colleague Danny
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050926-15/?p=34043">
some time ago</a>.
Danny is an accomplished skier, and for a time, he had a poster in his
office that was a split-screen of Picabo Street and Alberto Tomba,
and autographed by both skiers.
</p>
<p>
I remarked,
"Wow, that's amazing.
You got Picabo Street and Alberto Tomba to autograph the same poster!"
</p>
<p>
Danny copped to the truth.
</p>
<p>
"Well, sort of.
That autograph of Picabo Street is authentic.
After she signed her name on her half of the poster,
I asked her to forge Alberto Tomba's signature on the other half."</p>

		<p>I have never been asked to forge someone else&#8217;s autograph.  But, then again, I&#8217;ve never been asked for my own autograph!</p>

		<p>Maybe I&#8217;m missing something, but couldn&#8217;t you just get one of them to autograph it, then take it to the other and get them to autograph it too?  Autograph hunters have been doing this for years, a friend of mine has a book with autographs from John Lennon, Ronald Reagan, Albert Einstein, Queen Victoria, Leonardo da Vinci, William the Conqueror, and Augustus Caesar, all collected by him in person.</p>

		<p>What&#8217;s even more remarkable is that Lennon, Reagan, Einstein, da Vinci, and Caesar and the rest all have the same handwriting, which in turn is remarkably similar to my friends&#8217;.  Who&#8217;d have thought?</p>

		<p>Exactly. That&#8217;s what I thought he did: Got a poster signed by one of the skiers, then saved that poster until he had a chance to meet the other one. This means the inconvenience of carrying a poster tube to the second signing (because posters are easily damaged). But it turns out that&#8217;s not how he did it.</p>

		<p>A real Tomba fan actually would have asked for an autograph over the movie poster of &#8220;Alex l&#8217;Ariete&#8221;, the terrible film where Tomba &#8211; who isn&#8217;t definitely able to act &#8211; is the main actor (it&#8217;s &#8220;reading from the script on screen&#8221;-bad level). That would probably be worth something, given that the movie was retired maybe three days after launch, its movie posters probably are something of a rarity.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m amazed the 11-year old NPR links in the referenced post (even the RealMedia one) still work.</p>

		<p>Thanks, nice tip, will ask you to forge Bill Gate&#8217;s signature on my Raymond and Bill poster, the next time I meet you ;-)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
