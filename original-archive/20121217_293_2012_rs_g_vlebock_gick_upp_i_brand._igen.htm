<p>The town of G&auml;vle in Sweden erects a large straw goat every year. The Yule Goat is a Scandinavian tradition, but the G&auml;vle goat (<i lang="sv">G&auml;vlebocken</i> in Swedish) is by far the most famous, or perhaps the most notorious, because it has been the center of conflict from its very beginning, and over the years since its first appearance in 1966, it has only gained <i>more</i> notoriety. (For something that is supposed to bring people together, it sure does a good job of dividing them.)</p>
<p> The first conflict is between those who want the goat to last the entire season and those who want it to be lit on fire. (And anecdotal evidence suggests that <a href="http://americablog.com/2012/12/the-yule-goat-it-burns.html"> a large number of Swedes are in the second category</a>.) It is such a big deal that <a href="http://www.thelocal.se/37690/20111202/"> you can place bets on whether the goat will survive or what day it will succumb to flames</a>. </p>
<p> The second conflict is between the Southern Merchants organization, who built the Yule Goat in its initial years but gave up out of frustration over the repeated arson, and the Natural Science Club (<i lang="sv">Natur&shy;veten&shy;skap&shy;liga F&ouml;r&shy;ening&shy;en</i>) of the School of Vasa, who took up the tradition, even though their goats didn't fare much better. The Southern Merchants resumed constructing a Yule Goat, leading to a bitter rivalry between the two groups. </p>
<p> Wikipedia has <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A4vle_goat"> a rundown of the goat's fate every year since its inception</a>, including its burning in 2001 by a tourist from the United States who claims that he <a href="http://www.aftonbladet.se/debatt/article10419990.ab"> intended only to burn one piece of straw</a> but was unable to stop the spread of the flames. (The article in <i lang="sv">Afton&shy;bladet</i> is far more insightful than any of the other reports I've seen, despite the fact that <i lang="sv">Afton&shy;bladet</i> is a tabloid. Unfortunately, as far as I can tell, the article is available only in Swedish.) </p>
<p> The G&auml;vle goat <a href="http://merjuligavle.blogspot.com/"> blogs</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Gavlebocken"> tweets</a> in both Swedish and English. </p>
<p> And for those keeping score: On the evening of December 12, the 2012 Yule Goat of G&auml;vle <a href="http://www.aftonbladet.se/nyheter/article15923481.ab"> went up in flames</a>. </p>

		<p>From way back when&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;If you ask the Internet to show you pictures of goats on fire, the Internet will ask you, &#39;What kind of goats?&#39;&quot;</p>
<p>I guess this time it&#39;s straw, or Swedish&#8230;</p>

		<p>Mer fr친n svenska petimeter-h칬rnan:</p>
<p>I&#39;ve never heard &quot;gick upp i brand&quot; (or &quot;gick upp i eld&quot;, both kind of mean &quot;went up in fire&quot;). There really is no literal translation for &quot;went up in flames&quot;. (&quot;Gick upp i r칬k&quot; (&quot;went up in smoke&quot;) exists, but means the same thing as the English expression)</p>
<p>I&#39;d say &quot;2012 친rs G칛vlebock brann upp&quot; (&quot;burned down&quot;). Perhaps &quot;br칛ndes upp&quot; (&quot;was burned down&quot;) would be even better.</p>

		<p>@Rick, heh. Actually, you can say both &quot;brinna upp&quot; and &quot;brinna ner&quot; (up and down, respectively). Both would mean &quot;burn down&quot;, but there&#39;s an unclear (to me), subtle difference. I&#39;d say things burn up while buildings burn down, and after something burns down, there&#39;s just a pile of ashes (as opposed to, say, the metal skeleton of a giant straw goat) left.</p>

		<p>I recall Raymond writing in the past about doing something, and then repeating it and expecting something different to happen. From the point of view of the fake goats surviving, it seems like quite the futile matter. However, when viewing it from the &#39;how does it get destroyed?&#39; angle, it is actually a quite interesting experiment that deserves repeating!</p>

		<p>This is hilarious. &nbsp;While reading through the list, I was thinking how a ranged attack, like a flaming arrow, would do the trick if you really wanted to burn the goat with observers and guards around. &nbsp;But you&#39;d really have to be obsessed. &nbsp;And then I read about the burning in 2005&#8230;</p>

		<p>Both &#39;up&#39; and &#39;down&#39; work in English also. &nbsp;&#39;Up&#39; in this sense would be interpreted as &#39;completely consumed&#39;. &nbsp;In Australia, beginning at this time of the year, most of the news concerning burning tends to be about forests; not so trivial to most of us, although there always seems to be a few who look at a forest the way that some look at that goat&#8230;</p>

		<p>I find the table near the end of the Wikipedia article especially funny: &quot;&#8230; &#8211; Number of goats burned &#8211; Number of goats vandalised &#8211; Number of goats run over &#8211; Number of goats stolen &#8211; &#8230;&quot;.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just asking for a few new columns.</p>

		<p>For all I know, this goat-burning may be a well known tradition in Sweden, but through my 50+ years I have been living all over Norway (&quot;Scandinavia&quot; is Sweden, Denmark and Norway), and I have never heard about it before. While Sweden certainly is one of the Scandinavian countries, you probably should consider this a Swedish tradition rather than an (all) Scandinavian one.</p>
<p>Actually, while the Scandinavian countries have very closely related &quot;everyday culture&quot;, traditions around celebrations of all kinds vary greatly, from Christmas celebration to midsummer celebration, both in activities, dressing traditions and not the least: Which food is associated with various celebrations. At a Swedish Christmas party, or some other yuletime event in Sweden, I might feel just as strange and misplaced as a person from any other country&#8230;</p>
<p>(Don&#39;t misunderstand: It can be great fun, and I love some of the Swedish food traditions &#8211; they just are not _my_ traditions!)</p>

		<p>Regarding the title, I think &quot;gick upp i l친gor&quot; is most appropriate (and also happens to be a literal translation of &quot;went up in flames&quot;. It&#39;s not the most common expression, but feels better than &quot;gick upp i brand&quot;.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
