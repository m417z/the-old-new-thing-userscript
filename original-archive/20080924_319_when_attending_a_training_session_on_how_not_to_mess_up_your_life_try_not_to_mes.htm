		<p>Well, maybe they didn&#8217;t get to the part in the program yet where they tell you not to put yourself in a position where it appears that you&#8217;re doing drugs and sleeping with hookers. :)</p>
<p>Sending them home from the program, meaning they don&#8217;t get to complete it the first time round, does seem like a bit of a dumb thing to do. It would be like being in rehab, getting caught with booze (or whatever it is you&#8217;re in for) and then, instead of just staying there until you are actually dry, being thrown out and told you&#8217;ll have to come back later in order to start again.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t see how their privacy was invaded. &nbsp;The fire alarm went off and (probably by law) the room had to be inspected. &nbsp;And as far as getting &quot;ripped off&quot;, they knew the rules when they joined the league; I have no sympathy for them. &nbsp;It doesn&#8217;t even matter in the long run; they are still going to make their millions of dollars. &nbsp;They just have to suffer some temporary public embarrassment. &nbsp;Sounds like a pretty good deal to me; Stern probably would have liked the punishment to be much harsher.</p>

<p>Then imagine, as I said, that they set an actual fire in the room, and prevented anyone from entering their room long enough for the fire to spread to other rooms, causing untold amounts of damage as well as putting the lives of other people (who are probably asleep, considering it was 2 AM) in jeopardy. Is it unethical now?</p>
<p>Yes, a real fire didn&#8217;t occur (besides the lighter and the joint), but the fire alarm went off, and hotel management had a duty to ensure that there was no actual fire, and the players hindered them in their duty.</p>

		<p>&gt; So they made an oopsie and set off the fire alarm.</p>
<p>And then refused to let anyone in the room to inspect it, which, if there were an actual fire, would be interpreted as being extraordinarily callous towards the personal safety of the other patrons of the hotel.</p>
<p>&gt; In the end they were just having a bit of fun with some hookers and marijuana.</p>
<p>*Just* prostitution and drug use? My bad, I thought they were breaking the law.</p>
<p>The NBA has had an image problem for a while now, culminating with the Palace brawl and now the Donaghy scandal. It&#8217;s going to be a while before it&#8217;s going to be seen as a &quot;clean&quot; league; Stern is livid because if the rookies don&#8217;t start living clean now, the league will be tainted by their actions during their entire careers.</p>

		<p>&gt;Erik: When you&#8217;ve paid them.</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t see where it says the women were hookers. &nbsp;So how is spending the night with two women &#8220;messing up your life?&#8221;</p>
<p>If marijuana was involved- well that&#8217;s a crime and I side with the NBA authorities. &nbsp;But the issue with the women is different. &nbsp;Raymond appears to be siding with the NBA authorities here, by saying &#8220;Maybe this time, they&#8217;ll learn something.&#8221; I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a matter of learning. It&#8217;s quite possible the players resent being told how to spend their personal time. They may not care what the NBA thinks of their actions, and if that&#8217;s the case, I agree with them.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>&#8220;&#8230; messing up your life&#8221; was just an attempt at a catchy headline. I had a nitpicker&#8217;s corner ready but decided not to run it. Maybe I should have. One of the things they were supposed to learn is &#8220;Activities you should avoid because they will result in embarrassment to you and the league when they appear in the newspaper.&#8221; That&#8217;s the lesson they failed to learn. Whether this is a valid lesson I don&#8217;t really care. I just enjoyed the irony. -Raymond</i>]</div>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
