		<p>Well, Monty Python and John Cleese are very popular in Germany &#8211; there even are a few German-language episodes of the flying circus.</p>
<p>The &quot;the Germans&quot; episode of fawlty towers is especially well-loved.</p>
<p>Won&#8217;t mend anything, but it might be fun to listen to it :D. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>A common football chant from the England supporters is &#8216;Two world wars and one world cup!&#8217;. Maybe they&#8217;ll stop. Or not.</p>

		<p>Yeah, you&#8217;re right. Don&#8217;t mention the war because is was about 61 years ago. It is not that we germans did not learn anything from it or something like this. It&#8217;s just&#8230; &nbsp;Do YOU like someone mentioning the fault you have once done over and over again??</p>

		<p>@Mark<br />
<br />I think we -should- mention the war. It&#8217;s kind of the idea by the constant reminders peppered around Europe as it is. It&#8217;s a reminder to those that choose not to learn history that we tend to screw up. And as far as World Wars go.. Germany doesn&#8217;t have a great track record. I expect the same thing with mistakes the US has made.</p>

		<p>The Worldcup (and the European soccer cup too) seems to be an extra episode to WW2 for many Englishmen. I think that is something a lot of Germans find very curios.<br />
<br />Apparently we all have learned different lessons.</p>

		<p>Since WitweBolt mentioned that curious connection between soccer and the war, I have to mention the comment reputedly made during the 1966 soccer world cup when it appeared that Germany might be able to gloat that they had beaten England at their national sport, to which the English answer was something like &quot;Well never mind, we beat you twice at yours&quot;. Very politically incorrect, but certainly something I can imagine Basil muttering at his hotel in the episode!</p>

		<p>&gt; Yeah, you&#8217;re right. Don&#8217;t mention the war</p>
<p>You have to understand that<br />
<br />a) the English mainly do it to wind up the Germans (we don&#8217;t do it to the Italians, for example), and<br />
<br />b) we still mention the last successful invasion of Britain by a foreign power* so if you ask us to stop mentioning the much more recent WWII you&#8217;re on a hiding to nothing.<br />
<br />(Oh, and c) we do it &quot;because we can&quot; :-)</p>
<p>If you think &quot;mentioning the war&quot; is bad then never attend an England v. Scotland match.</p>
<p>By the way, you should think yourselves lucky. There are some Britons who think we should invade and retake the parts of France that &quot;rightfully&quot; belong to Britain :-) They&#8217;re joking. I think. Mostly.</p>
<p>* The phrase &quot;1066 and all that&quot; was originally a humourous book from the 30s, but the phrase has lived on far longer than that.</p>

		<p>The last successful foreign invasion of Britain was 1688, not 1066.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
