<p>Why does <code>Print&shy;Window</code> hate <code>CS_<wbr>PARENT&shy;DC</wbr></code>? Because <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/06/04/10314472.aspx"> <i>everybody</i> hates <code>CS_<wbr>PARENT&shy;DC</wbr></code></a>!</p>
<p> Commenter kero claims that it's "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/06/04/10314472.aspx#10318173">easy to fix</a>" the problem with <code>Print&shy;Window</code> and <code>CS_<wbr>PARENT&shy;DC</wbr></code>. You just remove the <code>CS_<wbr>PARENT&shy;DC</wbr></code> style temporarily, then do the normal  <code>Print&shy;Window</code>, then restore the <code>CS_<wbr>PARENT&shy;DC</wbr></code> style. The question is then why <code>Print&shy;Window</code> simply doesn't do this. </p>
<p> The question assumes that the described workaround actually works. It may work in limited situations, but it certainly doesn't work in general. </p>
<p> Since the <code>CS_<wbr>PARENT&shy;DC</wbr></code> style is a class style, removing the style affects all windows of that class, not merely the window you are trying to print. Suppose there are two windows of the class running on different threads, and you remove the <code>CS_<wbr>PARENT&shy;DC</wbr></code> style in anticipation of doing a <code>Print&shy;Window</code>. While that's going on, the other window gets a <code>WM_<wbr>PAINT</wbr></code> message. Since the <code>CS_<wbr>PARENT&shy;DC</wbr></code> style was temporarily removed, that window will be painting with an incorrectly-clipped DC. Result: Incorrect pixels on the screen. </p>
<p> The proposed workaround doesn't actually work reliably, which means that it probably shouldn't be done at all. (Random reinforcement breeds superstition.) </p>

		<p>Far too many programmers out there work on the reverse assumption: &nbsp;If code doesn&#39;t fail reliably, use it (and reuse it, and copy it for use elsewhere).</p>

		<p>I&#39;m still not clear on why PrintWindow hates CS_PARENTDC. Here&#39;s what the docs (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ff729176.aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/ff729176.aspx</a>) say:</p>
<p>Sets the clipping rectangle of the child window to that of the parent window so that the child can draw on the parent. A window with the CS_PARENTDC style bit receives a regular device context from the system&#39;s cache of device contexts. It does not give the child the parent&#39;s device context or device context settings. Specifying CS_PARENTDC enhances an application&#39;s performance. </p>
<p>It looks like this style means you&#39;re just asking for a special clipping rectangle (region?). I don&#39;t see what&#39;s to hate. </p>

		<p>I have never understood the need for PrintWindow. Of course, WYSIWYG editors are supposed to use the same code to draw in both screen and printer. But they are different enough to make you use separate wrapper code. For starts, a window on the screen usually shows only part of the document, or maybe a page scaled to fit inside it. And the window may need to draw additional elements (page borders, window background outside the page, document/margin limits, table rows and columns&#8230;). PrintWindow is, IMHO, a quick and dirty job, and everyone lazy enough to use it should be punished (hey, many times, using it is its own punishment!).</p>
<p>@Gabe: read the linked article. It&#39;s not about clipping regions, but about the window using the wrong DC (in this case, a screen DC instead of the printer&#39;s DC).</p>

		<p>@Antonio &#39;Grijan&#39; : The old ASPX programming model does try to make writing WebForm similar to writing WinForm applications. However the experience is&#8230; quite leaky&#8230; I should say. If you don&#39;t know how to program in web, your application still cannot get smooth user experience, but that doesn&#39;t mean Microsoft should stop support it.</p>

		<p>@chenog00: Ever see somebody call MsgBox from a VB ASPX program? We had one developer not be able to figure out why it didn&#39;t work when we deployed it even though it did on his workstation. We went back and checked. He turned on &quot;Allow service to interact with desktop&quot; on IIS on his workstation.</p>

		<p>Antonio &#39;Grijan&#39;: I did read the linked article &#8212; I even commented on it. And I still don&#39;t see any part that says how the CS_PARENTDC style causes problems when a paint function is passed a printer&#39;s DC. It&#39;s not like CS_OWNÂ­DC, where you would have been expecting a pre-existing DC that might already have things like brushes selected (that obviously wouldn&#39;t work with a printer&#39;s DC).</p>
<p>As I said, the CS_PARENTDC documentation states that the distinguishing factors about that style are that you get a different window&#39;s clipping rectangle, not that you get a special DC.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: All I could say is &quot;Oops&quot;. :P</p>
<p>Btw, this kind of question happens a lot in MSDN forum alone. There are other variant of it like launching notepad or printing to a selected printer&#8230; Some can be solved and others cannot. Hopefully after encounter this once they&#39;ll understand these are two worlds.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
