<p>A customer asked whether the <code>Co&shy;Create&shy;Guid</code> function can ever return <code>GUID_<wbr>NULL</wbr></code>. Their code uses <code>GUID_<wbr>NULL</wbr></code> for special purposes, and it would be bad if that was ever returned as the GUID for an object. "Can we assume that <code>Co&shy;Create&shy;Guid</code> never returns <code>GUID_<wbr>NULL</wbr></code>? Or should we test the return value against <code>GUID_<wbr>NULL</wbr></code>, and if it is equal, then call <code>Co&shy;Create&shy;Guid</code> and try again?"</p>
<p> Some people started running <code>Co&shy;Create&shy;Guid</code> a bunch of times and observing that it was spitting out type&nbsp;4 GUIDs, which will always have a 4 in the version field. Then other people started wondering whether the use of Algorithm&nbsp;4 was contractual (it isn't). Then still other people went back to read the RFCs which cover UUIDs to see whether those documents provided any guidance. </p>
<p> And then I had to step in and stop the madness. </p>
<p> It is very easy to show that any UUID generator which generates <code>GUID_<wbr>NULL</wbr></code> has failed to meet the requirement that the generated UUID be unique in space and time: If it's equal to <code>GUID_<wbr>NULL</wbr></code>, then it isn't unique! </p>
<p> The uniqueness requirement is that the generated GUID be different from any other valid GUID. And if it generated <code>GUID_<wbr>NULL</wbr></code>, then it wouldn't be different from <code>GUID_<wbr>NULL</wbr></code>! (And <code>GUID_<wbr>NULL</wbr></code> is a valid GUID, specifically identified in RFC4122 section 4.1.7.) </p>
<p> If you're so worried about <code>Co&shy;Create&shy;Guid</code> generating a duplicate <code>GUID_<wbr>NULL</wbr></code>, why aren't you worried about <code>Co&shy;Create&shy;Guid</code> generating a duplicate <code>IID_<wbr>IUnknown</wbr></code> or <code>GUID_<wbr>DEV&shy;CLASS_<wbr>1394</wbr></wbr></code> or any of the other GUIDs that have already been generated in the past? </p>
<p> In other words, no valid implementation of <code>Co&shy;Create&shy;Guid</code> can generate <code>GUID_<wbr>NULL</wbr></code> because the specification for the function says that it is not allowed to generate any GUID that has been seen before. </p>
<p> One of my colleagues cheekily remarked, "And even if it did generate <code>GUID_<wbr>NULL</wbr></code> for some reason, uniqueness would require that it do so only once! (So you should try to force this bug to occur in test, and then you can be confident that it will never occur in production.)" </p>

		<p>Amusement and cheekiness seems like a reasonable reaction, but I do appreciate that the customer is questionning their assumptions. Too often, there is the opposite problem. The customer makes assumptions that land them in trouble without even realising it.</p>

		<p>Of course, CoCreateGuid can never return 878eaf34-d1c1-4cdd-851b-70a24d678f74 either. &nbsp;Since I just caused it to be generated. &nbsp; But I can see their confusion&#8230;.</p>

		<p>Well, presumably the client was thinking that maybe GUID_NULL would be returned as an indication of a transient error condition (perhaps insufficient entropy available to generate a UUID yet). You&#39;d hope that would give you a non-success HRESULT, but I suppose it&#39;s a fair question to ask.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t see how this is a valid argument.</p>
<p>As the same can be said about any other GUID, that argument leads us to conclude that a valid implementation can&#39;t return any GUID at all. (Meaning it either has to abort/crash/throw an exception, or from a different angle, there is no valid implementation)</p>

		<p>@AC: It&#39;s a statistical argument framed as an absolute argument because the statistics are so skewed. If you were to remove that skew by enumerating every GUID possible and saying, &quot;HAHA! Now I have them all, you&#39;re all screwed!&quot; it would indeed break the argument.</p>

		<p>&gt; But has GUD_NULL ever been generated by a valid GUID generator?</p>
<p>Nope; there are various generation schemes that are defined, but whichever one you choose, there are four bits you have to set to identify the scheme you used.</p>
<p>None of these schemes use a value of 0000 for those four bits.</p>
<p>So GUID_NULL, while a perfectly valid GUID, can never be generated.</p>

		<p>In fairness, they could have been asking whether CoCreateGuid might fail somehow (e.g. if it uses a MAC address, but finds the computer has no network card), and might return GUID_NULL in that case, rather than just returning it by chance. But obviously the documentation would be the right place to look for that answer.</p>

		<p>Could FFFFFFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFF-FFFFFFFFFF be called GUID_FULL? (I wish it could be INVALID_GUID_VALUE to align an imaginary GUID CreateGuid() function error return with CreateFile&#39;s INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE return, but that&#39;s sort of like comparing apples to handles, since there are no invalid GUID values, or invalid integers for that matter.)</p>

		<p>@BrianG: especially since if generating a GUID takes 1 millijoule it would take the whole energy output of the sun (as is now) over 8 billion years just to generate them all (if I calculated correctly). So if anyone wants to evaporate all oceans of the earth multiple times over just to have that &quot;ha, I&#39;ve seen that GUID before&quot; moment&#8230;.</p>

		<p>An interesting observation is that, from the point of view of a computer with no network card, it&#39;s hard for it to &quot;see&quot; any other computers &#8212; the computer is pretty much isolated. &nbsp;So any generated GUIDs typically stay within that computer, and therefore, they won&#39;t &quot;collide&quot;.</p>
<p>Of course, that computer could generate a GUID, and you could write it down and carry it to a networked computer; or copy some GUIDs from the isolated computer to elsewhere on a flash drive, or whatever. &nbsp;In practice, network card addresses aren&#39;t used much in GUID generation any more anyway (as has already been mentioned); a computer without a network card can use a random-number generator to come up with those 47 bits (or whatever) that came from the network card in the original spec.</p>
<p>Speaking of how many GUIDs you can assign to each star and planet, I thought there were more than enough GUIDs to assign one to every atom in the known universe. &nbsp;This doesn&#39;t cover the &quot;temporal&quot; aspect though.</p>

		<p>I just ran Apache Bench on that website. Sorry, I wasted about 1000 GUIDs. I think we&#39;re still good.</p>

		<p>&quot;In other words, no valid implementation of CoÂ­CreateÂ­Guid can generate GUID_NULL because the specification for the function says that it is not allowed to generate any GUID that has been seen before.&quot;</p>
<p>If CoCreateGuid is called and no one is around to see it, has a Guid been generated?</p>
<p>Most of the distrust of Guid&#39;s comes from the majority of people not understanding collision probability (*). Their definition of never is a little loose which allows them to write the code quicker. The old grumpy guy in the corner saying that it won&#39;t work and it needs more time spent on it is not listened to by management, because they already have an implementation that works and the person who wrote it says it will never generate a duplicate.</p>
<p>I assume Microsoft&#39;s guarantee comes with some caveats like reformatting/changing the time etc resets the contract. The comment about making sure it happens in test so it doesn&#39;t happen in production is either sarcasm, or a tragic misunderstanding of collision probability.</p>
<p>(*) The majority of developers also failed to predict the year 2000.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
