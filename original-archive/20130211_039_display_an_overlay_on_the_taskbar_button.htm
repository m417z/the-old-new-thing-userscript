Today's "Little Program"
displays an overlay on the taskbar button.
I've seen some people call this a "badge",
but "overlay" is the official term.
</p>
<p>
Start with our
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
scratch program</a>
and make the following changes:
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;comip.h&gt;
#include &lt;comdef.h&gt;
#include &lt;shlobj.h&gt;
#include &lt;shellapi.h&gt;

_COM_SMARTPTR_TYPEDEF(ITaskbarList3, __uuidof(ITaskbarList3));
</pre>
<p>
I decided to shake things up and use a different smart
pointer library:
<code>com_ptr_t</code>.
(That'll teach you to complain that I don't use a smart
pointer library in my samples.
Now you get to complain that I use the <i>wrong</i>
smart pointer library.)
</p>
<pre>
HICON g_hicoAlert;
UINT g_wmTaskbarButtonCreated;

BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
  <font COLOR=blue>g_hicoAlert = LoadIcon(nullptr, IDI_EXCLAMATION);
  g_wmTaskbarButtonCreated = RegisterWindowMessage(
                              TEXT("TaskbarButtonCreated"));</font>
  return TRUE;
}
</pre>
<p>
Our overlay icon is the system exclamation point icon.
I chose this because I'm lazy.
</p>
<pre>
bool g_fHasOverlay = false;

void UpdateOverlayIcon(HWND hwnd)
{
  HICON hicon = g_fHasOverlay ? g_hicoAlert : nullptr;
  PCWSTR pszDescription = g_fHasOverlay ?
                        L"Attention required" : nullptr;
  ITaskbarList3Ptr sptb3;
  sptb3.CreateInstance(CLSID_TaskbarList);
  sptb3-&gt;<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd391696.aspx">SetOverlayIcon</a>(hwnd, hicon, pszDescription);
}

void OnChar(HWND hwnd, TCHAR ch, int cRepeat)
{
  if (ch == ' ') {
    g_fHasOverlay = !g_fHasOverlay;
    UpdateOverlayIcon(hwnd);
  }
}

    HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_CHAR, OnChar);

    default:
      if (uiMsg != 0 &amp;&amp; uiMsg == g_wmTaskbarButtonCreated) {
        UpdateOverlayIcon(hwnd);
      }
      break;
</pre>
<p>
A real program would have error checking, of course.
</p>
<p>
Press the space bar, and the overlay will be toggled on and off.
</p>
<p>
If you're really clever, you might generate your overlay icons
on the fly,
say, if you wanted to report the number of
unread messages or something.
</p>
<p>
I've heard that there's one program out there that abuses the
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/desktop/dd391697.aspx">
<code>ITaskbar&shy;List3::<wbr>Set&shy;Progress&shy;State</code></a>
method
by changing its progress state repeatedly,
causing its taskbar button to cycle through different colors
to get the user's attention.
</p>
<p>
Just a reminder: The user interface guidelines say that the way
to get the user's attention is to flash your taskbar button.
Various parts of the system understand this convention and
respond to it.
(For example, the taskbar will temporarily unhide if a button
starts flashing,
and accessibility tools know how to signal the flash state to
the user.)
As always, the shell reserves the right to block this sort of
abusive behavior in the future,
just like it has done with abusive notification icons.</p>

		<p>I bet they cycled colors because it was &#39;cool&#39; and could be done, not because it was better. You remember the good old days of skinned apps, when you had to spend half an hour looking for the close button because a plain window was boring, don&#39;t you?</p>

<p>Man that could be useful. I&#39;ve got a notification program (one I use not one I wrote) that changes its icon repeatedly while working but uses a constant one while idle.</p>
<p>There was in Win 3.1 a backup program that minimized while running the backup to take strain off the UI. Guess how it reported its state?</p>
<p>So the same thing can finally be done again.</p>

		<p>Possibly obvious after the fact but the overlay icon is not displayed if the taskbar appearance is set to use small icons.</p>
<p>I spent way too much time trying to troubleshoot this :&lt;. The behavior is documented.</p>

		<p>For me, the idea of taskbar overlays is cool but most apps I&#39;ve seen that take advantage of it are &quot;mostly always running in the background (startup) apps&quot; which I would have placed in the notification area (which serves the purpose of putting background apps aside nicely besides showing notifications). Taskbar overlays should be used more by apps which are started by the user and closed when the user is done with them. For apps that I want to &quot;keep running but put aside and out of my way&quot; e.g. Messenger or Skype, tray is better. I bet MS telemetry tells them which apps use Taskbar overlays. Will be interesting to peek at that list. Media Player Classic &#8211; Home Cinema is one app that isn&#39;t always running and uses overlays correctly for me. So I feel overlay icons in the taskbar should not be intended to supply long-standing status or notifications. Those are best relegated to the notification area.</p>

<p>This is partially broken in Windows 8 when running in high contrast mode &#8211; the taskbar will unhide, but the button won&#39;t flash, which is slightly annoying when you don&#39;t know which button caused the taskbar to unhide. Having to click every one of them to get the taskbar to hide again gets old pretty fast.</p>

		<p>After reading the whole article, it occurs to me that I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen one of these overlays. I verified that I don&#39;t have small icons selected in the taskbar options.</p>
<p>I use Win7, Excel, Word, Explorer, and VS. Am I just not trying hard enough?</p>

		<p>Just because a particular feature requires Windows 7 doesn&#39;t mean you can&#39;t use it. &nbsp;We support Windows XP, but use the taskbar progress meter, as it is an additional capability. &nbsp;The issue comes in when something is done one way on one OS version, and a different way on another OS version. &nbsp;I am generally slow to adopt things like that, where the behavior of the program is different on different OSes, but when it&#39;s an additional new functionality that provides more information not available on older OSes, that&#39;s another thing. &nbsp;Another example is edit fields with balloon tips or the cue banner on Windows XP and later.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m pretty sure ThomasX was making a sarcastic comment about how MSFT has taken a step back and is apparently moving to eliminate overlayed windows (given that the desktop APIs have been relegated to the legacy dustbin), such that each app uses the full screen &#8211; just like the old MS-DOS apps of yesteryear. &nbsp;Not really sure how that&#39;s supposed to be a productivity boost&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
