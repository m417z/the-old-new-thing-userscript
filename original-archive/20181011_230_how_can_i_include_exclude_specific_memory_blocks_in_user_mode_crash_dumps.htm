You can tweak the information included in crash dumps
created by Windows Error Reporting.
</p>
<p>
To request that Windows Error Reporting
include a dump of another process if the calling process crashes,
use
<a HREF="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/werapi/nf-werapi-werregisteradditionalprocess">
the
<code>Wer&shy;Register&shy;Additional&shy;Process</code> function</a>.
This is useful if your program is split up into multiple processes.
</p>
<p>
You can add additional key/value pairs of data with
<a HREF="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/werapi/nf-werapi-werregistercustommetadata">
the
Wer&shy;Register&shy;Custom&shy;Metadata</code> function</a>.
This information can be used to help categorize and filter
crash dumps automatically.
For example, you might include metadata that says whether
the app is running in trial mode.
</p>
<p>
You can add
a block of memory to user-mode crash dumps
(heap dumps or larger),
with
<a HREF="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/werapi/nf-werapi-werregistermemoryblock">
the
Wer&shy;Register&shy;Memory&shy;Block</code> function</a>.
Note that this memory will be captured in the dump,
but it's not the same as metadata because you can't filter on it.
</p>
<p>
Conversely,
you can exclude
a block of memory from user-mode crash dumps with
<a HREF="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/api/werapi/nf-werapi-werregisterexcludedmemoryblock">
the
Wer&shy;Register&shy;Excluded&shy;Memory&shy;Block</code> function</a>.
This is handy if you have large memory blocks containing
information that isn't all that interesting from a debugging
standpoint,
like video texture buffers or audio output buffers.</p>

		<p>Another good reason to exclude a block of memory from user-mode crash dumps: if that memory contains secrets like passwords or encryption keys, or if it contains PII.</p>

		<p>Hey Raymond, you forgot to mention that this API is Windows 10 only.  This makes it interesting, but less than useful unless you know you&#8217;re only going to be running on Windows 10 systems.  You can dynamically bind to them to deal with their absence in Windows 7 and 8, but you still can&#8217;t use them except for Windows 10.</p>

		<p>Too bad these APIs are Windows 10 only, no good for people who still need to target Windows versions earlier than that.</p>

		<p>I realize this isn&#8217;t a suggestion box, but I would absolutely love it if you would consider doing a &#8220;Debugging .NET crash dumps with WinDbg&#8221; series for CLR Week sometime.  I&#8217;ve dabbled a bit with it but have found it kind of difficult to get a good grasp of.</p>

		<p>Is this still valid for the new Partner Center? It seems all information I can collect now is the stack trace. The memory dumps I could download in the past were very helpful.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
