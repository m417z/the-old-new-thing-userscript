<p> Firefighters hate the Fourth of July, the holiday dedicated to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/07/04/3678225.aspx"> blowing up stuff</a>, because when amateurs try to blow up stuff, they often blow up stuff they didn't intend to blow up. One of my friends has a particular unfortunate knack of drawing disasters to his neighborhood. One July 4th, a house in his neighborhood burnt down due to a stray firecracker landing on a wooden roof. A few years later, he moved to another neighborhood, and the next July 4th,  a house in his neighborhood burnt down due to a stray firecracker landing on a wooden roof. </p>
<p> The Seattle Fire Department lets you <a href="http://www2.seattle.gov/fire/realtime911/getDatePubTab.asp"> view all the incidents to which they responded</a>, and the year I checked (the year of the second house-burning-down), the Seattle Fire Department responded to twice as many reports on the fourth as they did on the third. </p>

<p>That&#8217;s our &quot;blowing stuff up&quot; holiday. &nbsp;More fun when it gets dark before 10pm.</p>

		<p>See, that&#8217;s just bad planning by your founding fathers. If they&#8217;d signed that declaration of independence (or is ID the day of the victory?) in mid-winter, then it&#8217;d be mostly wet, and things wouldn&#8217;t catch fire so easily.</p>
<p>We shoot our fireworks on new year&#8217;s day, when everything is wet.</p>

		<p>In Spain, the official day for blowing stuff up and get burned by accident is 24 June, but there is a special festival in some cities in March when you can blow up your hand with powder too.</p>

		<p>why people have wooden houses in USA is beyond me. Maybe they like seeing their house floating in water when a flood happens or blown to pieces in the case of a hurricane.</p>

		<p>Ricardo,</p>
<p>Wood is cheaper and more easily available in the US. &nbsp;And on the west coast, wood is way better than other materials in the case of an earthquake. &nbsp;It handles the shaking much better than brick, concrete, and clay. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Regarding wood in houses:</p>
<p>Wood is very easily worked, fairly inexpensive, and easy to replace building material. &nbsp;It also has the attribute of retaining some (but not all) of its strength when burnt.</p>
<p>On to fireworks:</p>
<p>We had a package of fireworks that just smoked. &nbsp;They&#8217;re supposed to be safer or whatever, but they&#8217;re really not. &nbsp;Not only are you lulled in to a false sense of security, it&#8217;s possible the designers were too! &nbsp;We&#8217;ve set off hundreds of fireworks over the years, but the only one I&#8217;ve seen seriously malfunction was one of those smokers. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>&quot;why people have wooden houses in USA is beyond me&quot;</p>
<p>The material used for the frame of the house is not particularly relevant when it comes to fire. Most of the stuff *inside* the house is quite flammable, and that&#8217;s where the fire usually starts. Whether the frame is wood or steel, and once a fire engulfs the house, it&#8217;s going down no matter what&#8230;</p>

		<p>@BA &#8211; The signing was August 2nd, not July 4th. &nbsp;July 4th was the day the wording of the Declaration was approved by Congress, but it wasn&#8217;t drafted by hand until July 19th, and not ratified/signed until August 2nd.</p>

		<p>@Sebastian Redl</p>
<p>Around here (unspecified US east coast location) New Years Day is likely to be dry and cold. &nbsp;And so, lacking the fire retardant properties you are advocating.</p>
<p>On the other hand, afternoons and evenings in July carry a 70+% chance of Thunderstorms; so you&#8217;re fairly likely to be ducking in out of brief rain showers while lighting off fireworks on July 4th.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
