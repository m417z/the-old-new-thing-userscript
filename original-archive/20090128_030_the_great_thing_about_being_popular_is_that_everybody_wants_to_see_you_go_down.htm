<p>The servers that run this Web site are under heavy load, even when things are operating normally. And on top of that, they have to fend off a lot of attacks. There's the usual <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/02/18/7761978.aspx"> spam pingbots</a>, but usually when the site starts to get all bogged down, it's because there is an active attack on the site at the network level. And it doesn't matter <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/01/27/9376605.aspx#9378613"> what software is running the site</a>. It's not like the bad guys are going to say, "Oh, this site is using PHP. I guess we'll leave them alone."</p>
<p> For example, the problems earlier this week were caused by two IP addresses saturating all the connections to the server. Last October's slowdown was caused by the server being overwhelmed by 100,000 simultaneous connections (suspected to be a denial of service attack but no proof). The slowdown from last August was caused by a distributed attack from a botnet attempting to perform various SQL injection attacks. (They failed, but they kept trying.) The outage from last July was caused by a computer owned by a different customer of the hosting service that had been hacked, and which was launching its own network attack that took out connectivity for all other computers on the same network subnet. (In other words, blogs.msdn.com just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.) </p>
<p> Those are all the outages for the past six months that I still have records of. (I'm not saying there were no other outages; those are just the ones that the people who run the servers considered significant enough that they sent out an explanation for the outage.) And it's not clear how switching to a different blog engine would have prevented any of them. </p>

		<p>&quot;we traced the calls. They come from inside your house&quot;.</p>
<p>Is there any time the server is not under attack? Judging by its performance, it&#8217;s always overstressed. It&#8217;s pretty normal for it to just drop comments without any error message. It just returns to the blog home. Maybe that&#8217;s because the blog engine is P.O.S.?</p>
<p>PS. Trying submit this for a few hours. Doesn&#8217;t work. Great.</p>

		<p>My biggest complaint with the blog software is that when it /does/ encounter an error, it redirects you to the error page in a way that breaks the back button. &nbsp;This causes big problems when resuming previous browser sessions.</p>

		<p>My only complaint with the blog software is that a valid search often returns &quot;No results&quot;. Only by trying over and over (and over) I can hope to get some results.</p>
<p>Examples: try searching for &quot;windows&quot;, &quot;memory&quot; or &quot;knitting&quot;.</p>

		<p>The amount of hatred and bias against Microsoft is pervasive in both academia and industry. In school my professors refused to teach about Microsoft technologies because it was &quot;proprietary&quot; then when I graduated most of the employers expected .net programming skills. When I tried to join professional software development communities many other programmers thought I was less of a developer because I didn&#8217;t spend my days hacking on Linux systems. These are the types who would spend all their free time trying to get a DDOS attack going against blogs.msdn.com. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>@taralluccio: A good workaround for searching is to use a google search term like this:</p>
<p>windows site:blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/</p>
<p>This is helpful for a great deal of web forums, all of which somehow have crappy search functions.</p>

<p>no, speaking as a unix bigot working in an MS shop, I just like how it works better and have noticed that MS stuff tends to work best with other MS stuff, while unix stuff isn&#8217;t as picky.

<p> Ha you&#8217;re very clever! The point is that short sighted hate and bias can lead some to eventually attempt DDOS attacks. I didn&#8217;t say *specifically* they did it but I do believe that their overall sentiment could lead to this type of irrational behavior. </p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
