<p>I didn't think this was all that common a request, but it came in twice from two different customers, so I guess there are still people creating toolbars, and creating them with right-aligned buttons (even though it violates Windows user interface guidelines, though I can't find a citation right now).</p>
<p> You may have noticed that the toolbar common control doesn't provide a facility for creating right-aligned buttons. Partly because it's a violation of the guidelines anyway, but mostly because the default state of every feature is "not implemented." <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/53298.aspx"> Adding a feature requires work</a>, and since there is only a finite amount of work available to apply, you have to decide where to spend it. And generally speaking, you don't <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/07/19/3945339.aspx"> focus your efforts on helping people violate the guidelines</a>. </p>
<p> If you want to create a right-aligned toolbar button, you can cobble one together by combining things you already have. I can think of two ways of doing this off the top of my head. </p>
<ul>
<li>Create two toolbars, one for the left-aligned buttons and     one for the right-aligned buttons, then size and position     them appropriately. </li>
<li>Create a separator between the left-aligned buttons and     the right-aligned buttons, and set the separator size appropriately. </li>
</ul>
<p> Which comes to a third reason why there is no feature for right-aligned toolbar buttons: Because you can already do it yourself without too much effort. </p>

<p>Display toolbar buttons left aligned. The Help icon, if present, is right aligned.</p>
<p>(Picture: All toolbar buttons are left aligned except for Help.)</p>
<p>Exception: Windows 7-style toolbars left align program specific commands, but right align standard, well-known commands such as Options, View, and Help.</p>

		<p>What if all the buttons were right-aligned and the application was in a language with a right-to-left reading order? &nbsp;Well, it&#39;s just a guideline (even if [citation needed]), not a hard-and-fast rule, so that&#39;s probably a reasonable situation in which to deviate from the guideline. &nbsp;Of course, using mixed left-aligned and right-aligned buttons, that&#39;s a whole other story.</p>

		<p>@Roman I was going to call out Office 2007 for having a right aligned toolbar button, but it is in fact the Help button so I suppose it followed the guidelines then (and I guess it&#39;s not really a toolbar if it just has one button, too).</p>
<p>@Adam Rosenfield In an RTL language toolbars are flipped, so anything right aligned would end up on the left, as expected.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a bit confusing, some toolkits use the terms &quot;Near&quot; and &quot;Far&quot; instead to be LTR/RTL neutral.</p>

		<p>Some people use Toolbars disguised as menu bars (text only without icons). &nbsp;Menu bar items support MFT_RIGHTJUSTIFY, which was once commonly used to push the Help menu off to the right side of the menu bar.</p>
<p>The resource compiler still allows the HELP option on a menu bar item. &nbsp;This used to map to MFT_RIGHTJUSTIFY, but I think it&#39;s a no-op in more recent versions.</p>
<p>On one project I worked on, debug builds had a special Debug menu with MFT_RIGHTJUSTIFY to make it clear it wasn&#39;t part of the normal product.</p>
<p>A lot of Windows 7 toolbars (like the one in the basic Explorer view) seem to be pushing some toolbar items off to the right side.</p>

		<p>&quot;I guess there are still people creating toolbars&quot;. That&#39;s because the people on the shell team removed customizability from Explorer toolbars. Or the floating toolbars on the desktop. Or the image toolbar from IE. Or the toolbars from Office.</p>

		<p>As there are languages you read from right to left, I suppose the customers was looking for a full right-to-left application. No ?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>No, they wanted some left-aligned buttons and some right-aligned buttons. The RTL case is handled automatically.

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
