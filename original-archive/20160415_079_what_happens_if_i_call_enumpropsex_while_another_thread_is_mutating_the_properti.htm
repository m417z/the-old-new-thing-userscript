Following up on the question
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160303-00/?p=93111">
Are SetProp and RemoveProp thread-safe?</a>,
you might wonder what happens if you call
<code>Enum&shy;Props&shy;Ex</code> while another thread
is mutating the properties?
</p>
<p>
The answer is similar to what you get if
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160210-00/?p=93011">
you call
<code>Find&shy;First&shy;File</code> / <code>Find&shy;Next&shy;File</code>
while somebody else is creating or deleting files</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>If a property is created after the enumeration starts,
    then it is unspecified whether it will be reported by
    <code>Enum&shy;Props&shy;Ex</code>.</p>
<li>If a property is deleted after the enumeration starts,
    then it is unspecified whether it will be reported by
    <code>Enum&shy;Props&shy;Ex</code>.
    Special exception: The enumeration callback is allowed
    to remove the property being enumerated.</p>
<li>If a property is modified after the enumeration starts,
    then it is unspecified whether the value reported by
    <code>Enum&shy;Props&shy;Ex</code>
    is the old value or the new value.
</ul>
<p>
Hopefully,
nobody is playing games with properties that are so crazy
that any of these rules will actually come into play,
aside from the special exception.</p>

		<p>I submit it&#8217;s manifestly obvious. The load-balanced servers are having db synchronization trouble.</p>

		<p>Agreed. If you open the page and set it to idle like 5 minutes before posting, it seems the load balancer can redirect you to another server so you&#8217;ll have posting errors.</p>
<p>The same happens in MSDN forums too, which makes it quite annoying when writing long replies.</p>

		<p>I always write long forum replies in a text editor and then copy paste. Problems like this are all too common&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
