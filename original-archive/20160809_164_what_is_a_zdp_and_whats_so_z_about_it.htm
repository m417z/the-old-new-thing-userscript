You may see an
occasional mention of
the acronym ZDP,
such as
<a HREF="http://www.urtech.ca/2014/12/solved-what-is-oobe-zdp-in-wsus-update-services/">
this article explaining what OOBE ZDP are for</a>,
and this one that says,
"<a HREF="http://www.infoworld.com/article/3100039/microsoft-windows/microsoft-releases-another-cumulative-update-bringing-windows-10-beta-version-1607-up-to-build-1439.html"
>I don't know why</a>..."
</p>
<p>
ZDP stands for "Zero Day Package",
sometimes redundantly called a "ZDP Package".
However, this is not using the term Zero Day
in the security vulnerability sense.
Rather, it's referring to day number zero:
The first day the product is available to the public.
The Zero Day Package is a Windows Update package
that is made available on launch day.
These patches are reserved for addressing serious functionality
issues in important scenarios.
For example, if there's a fix for a crash in a commonly-used scenario,
that's a candidate for a Zero Day Package.
</p>
<p>
Note, however, that even though the package is available
on Day Zero,
it won't be <i>installed</i> on Day Zero.
Windows Update will download the package and stage it for
installation, but it won't install it right away.
It'll wait a few days (I forget exactly how many)
before starting to encourage you to update.
The theory is that you get a few days of playing around
with the new system before you start getting nagged about
updates.
</p>
<p>
This artificial delay before installing the ZDP means that
the official release version of Windows needs to be solid
enough to survive a week without any help.
If you have a problem that is super-critical that cannot
wait a week, then you need to get your fix into the OOBE ZDP.
</p>
<p>
OOBE (pronounced /oo-bee/) stands for
"Out of Box Experience".
It's the program that runs when you turn the computer
on for the very first time after you take it out of the box.
OOBE doesn't have the luxury of taking a fix in a ZDP,
because by the time the user signs in and installs the ZDP,
it's too late. OOBE is already over!
OOBE needs to run right the first time.
No second chances, no patches.
</p>
<p>
Okay, back to the OOBE ZDP.
The term OOBE ZDP does not mean
"The ZDP to fix OOBE bugs."
Rather, it means
"The ZDP that is installed by OOBE."
</p>
<p>
The OOBE ZDP is a special ZDP that is downloaded and
installed at the end of OOBE,
part of the "Please wait while we apply the finishing
touches" phase.
Since the user is sitting there waiting anxiously to start
using the computer they just got for Christmas,
the OOBE ZDP needs to be small,
so
only the most critical fixes go there.
</p>

		<p>So in other words, OOBE asks Windows Update for just the high-priority ZDPs.</p>
<p>And if the machine is not connected to the internet during OOBE, are the OOBE ZDPs treated as normal ZDPs or do they get installed as soon as you connect?</p>

		<p>I helped build the feature to download and install the OOBE ZDP in Windows 8.1. Having been there, I have some minor quibbles in terminology.</p>
<p>First, the P in ZDP did not stand for &#8220;Package.&#8221; It may do so now through usage, but in the original specs, the P was for &#8220;Priority,&#8221; as in &#8220;Zero Day Priority update.&#8221; We often talked about the &#8220;ZDP update&#8221; in the Windows Update team; unlike &#8220;ZDP package&#8221; in your definition, this was no redundancy.</p>
<p>Second, while I think the User Experience team folks who built the OOBE part of the feature called the update installed by OOBE the &#8220;OOBE ZDP update,&#8221; our custom in Windows Update was just to call it the &#8220;ZDP update.&#8221; The update that is available on Windows&#8217; release day, but _not_ installed by OOBE, was called the &#8220;General Availability update,&#8221; or &#8220;GA update,&#8221; not the ZDP update or ZDP. And of course this update existed for Windows versions prior 8.1, when the OOBE ZDP was introduced.</p>
<p>These definitions by me are probably about 2 years out of date, but they were correct then as I remember it.</p>
<p>Besides those minor definition issues, the discussion seems 100% right. No complaints there&#8230;</p>
<p>skSdnW:<br />
&gt; And if the machine is not connected to the internet during OOBE, are the OOBE ZDPs treated as normal ZDPs or do they get installed as soon as you connect?</p>
<p>My memory is fuzzy on what happens if the computer starts OOBE disconnected but then gets the network cable plugged in/connected to the wireless network during OOBE.</p>
<p>But if the computer is disconnected throughout all of OOBE, then the OOBE ZDP update is downloaded and installed automatically during normal computer usage, but may still be installed faster than other updates.</p>
<p>This is because OOBE ZDP updates are published in a special update category within the Windows Update system. (You can see this category in the WSUS list in the first linked blog.) This category makes OOBE ZDP updates, at least in Windows 8.1, eligible for &#8220;accelerated install&#8221; &#8211; download and install during the first 24 hours after OOBE completes, during which time automatically downloading and installing other updates is suspended to reduce the frequency and length of reboots when you are first using the computer.</p>

		<p>That would result in much less new features, since every feature you add or change is one that could potentially fail. Nice-to-haves like virtual desktops would not make it over the then much higher hurdle.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s safe to say there was never a say when the release-day version of Windows was solid enough to last forever.</p>
<p>It just meant that bugs were not fix &#8211; because it was the days when people did not have Internet access. If you were ambitious, you could go to <a href="http://ftp.microsoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://ftp.microsoft.com</a> and download a service pack. I still have the box with the twenty-some-off 3.5&#8243; floppies of Windows NT 3.5 in my closet. But it has bugs that would today would be classified as critical.</p>

<p>And still with load of bugs and missing features (either old promised or new wanted by users). And cost of maintenance continually rising&#8230;</p>

		<p>Let me say that, in fact, we didn&#8217;t get anything but yet another level of UX complexity by nagging a user with requests to update (or just updating silently, like some version of a well-known S-something-E messenger used to do).</p>
<p>In those days one wouldn&#8217;t update if (s)he didn&#8217;t want/feel the need to, now they still ignore the requests, but the experience became more annoying. Maybe some statistics lie^Wshow that the new way to force updates made our world safer, I can&#8217;t believe it is true: from what I can see, those who do update at least weekly would do it even if it meant downloading (or buying a disc with already downloaded) a service pack manually or &#8220;offline&#8221;. But the rest, those who are in the group of the biggest risk, just cancel it. Because it&#8217;s annoying. Because it takes &#8220;too long&#8221;.</p>
<p>I even saw notebook owners who thought their notebooks were broken. Why? Because Windows got stuck updating itself for a few hours. I also had a few &#8220;chances&#8221; to update Windows on a brand new notebook the whole night with about 300-400 updates. Installing service packs took much less time.</p>
<p>What I try to say is that the way updates are delivered nowadays don&#8217;t really solve any of the problems of past days. Maybe just hides some of them. People still use slow and expensive Internet connections (hello, 3G Internet in a country-side house far from towns and cities!), still need to do their work no matter how important and critical the update is. People are still lazy. It&#8217;s not the way it should be done. What is &#8220;the right way&#8221;? I don&#8217;t know either. But was it worth changing anything? Not for me.</p>

		<p>I still think that every programmer only releases code that he or she thinks is not only defensible, but good.  Despite this, humanity still sent probes to Mars and to Jupiter&#8217;s moon with bugs. Meh. It&#8217;s a learning experience, and the more people and complexity involved the better.</p>

		<p>Humm&#8230; I&#8217;d imagine that if those ZDP exists and internet connection is available when the product installer is launched, those patches should have had slipstreamed into the update process, much like when I install the VS IDE updates. (The installer will also download other updates applicable and try to install them in one go in order to reduce the number of reboot involved.)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
