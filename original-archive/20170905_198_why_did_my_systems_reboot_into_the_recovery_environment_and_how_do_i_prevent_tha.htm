Earlier this year,
a customer reported that they had a cluster of systems running
a mix of Windows Server 2003&sup1; and Windows Server 2008 R2 Service Pack 1.
The cluster node crashed, causing the machines hosted on it
to fail over to another node.
On the new node, the Windows Server 2003 system showed an error
and restarted,
but the Windows Server 2008 R2 systems showed
a system recovery dialog.

<p>
The customer had to connect to each machine and click the "Restart"
button in the recovery dialog.
This was a tedious operation because they had so many systems.
</p>
<p>
The Recovery Environment team explained that the system should
not have entered recovery after a single crash.
It requires that the crash be followed by a failed boot as well.
(You can read more about
<a HREF="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/manufacture/desktop/windows-recovery-environment--windows-re--technical-reference#span-identrypointsintowinrespanspan-identrypointsintowinrespanspan-identrypointsintowinrespanentry-points-into-winre">
the conditions under which the Recovery Environment will start
automatically</a>.)
</p>
<p>
What probably happened is that the subsequent boot also failed,
and that triggered the entry into the Recovery Environment.
The customer was not sitting in front of the systems
as they rebooted,
so they didn't notice this second reboot.
</p>
<p>
If the customer wants to prevent the system from automatically
entering the Recovery Environment, they can set the following entries
in the BCD (Boot Configuration Data):
</p>
<pre>
bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled No
bcdedit /set {default} bootstatuspolicy IgnoreAllFailures
</pre>
<p>
The <code>recovery</code><code>enabled</code> variable
is set by default to <code>true</code>,
and the
<code>boot</code><code>status</code><code>policy</code>
is not set by default.
To return the system to its default configuration,
use the commands
</p>
<pre>
bcdedit /set {default} recoveryenabled Yes
bcdedit /deletevalue {default} bootstatuspolicy
</pre>
<p>
&sup1;
Yes, the customer is still using
Windows Server 2003
two years after it

		<p>Use of Windows Server 2003 kind of made sense right up until you couldn&#8217;t get security patches anymore. In my experience it tended to work better. Also, 2008 R2 chewed through many times its published disk space usage.</p>

		<p>Raymond says they were using two years after it stopped receiving security updates. In a cluster that, presumably, is accessible from the Internet.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter wether it&#8217;s more efficient or not. It isn&#8217;t even a Russian roulette &#8211; at least on the roulette you know you can get away unharmed. It&#8217;s a disaster waiting to happen: the only question is when.</p>

		<p>We do this on corporate workstations now. If a workstation &#8220;fails&#8221; to boot (maybe the user held in the power button for too long), users are presented with a scary looking recovery screen, and if they click around in there, they can end up screwing up their computer. Easier to just disable it. If their computer is messed up enough to not boot they will call for help anyway.</p>

		<p>&gt; &#8220;Yes, the customer is still using Windows Server 2003 two years after it exited support.&#8221;</p>
<p>Ironically, Windows Server 2003 is the last version of Windows Server to have offline support documentations included with it. The next versions of Windows Server still have those &#8220;Show me how to do this&#8221; buttons (e.g. when installing R&amp;RA service) but pressing them does nothing.</p>

		<p>Windows Server 2008 R2 offered to System Restore? How do I turn that on?</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, the customer is still using Windows Server 2003 two years after it exited support.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Is there an option to prevent Windows from ever changing the &#8220;bootmenupolicy legacy&#8221; setting with every other update? Having to restore this value again and again is very annoying.</p>

		<p>I sometimes see this with other programs that have rules like &#8220;if sessions ends three times in a crash, launch installation repair tool&#8221;.</p>
<p>Too bad that in my workflow, I often end up leaving programs running for months, until something unexpected causes a forced reboot. So to the program, it appears that every time I use it, it ends up crashing!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
