<p>I will be heading down to Los Angeles the Friday before the PDC in order to visit friends and relatives and to check out <a href="http://www.kingtut.org/"> the King Tut exhibit</a> at the <a href="http://www.lacma.org/"> Los Angeles County Museum of Art</a>. The last time Tutankhamun came to the United States was back in the late 1970's. I was an elementary school student and a few of my classmates were lucky enough to have obtained tickets to the exhibition; they gave it rave reviews.</p>
<p> I will show up at the Convention Center when the PDC proper begins on Tuesday. I am officially scheduled to be in the Fundamentals Lounge from 11:30am to 2:30pm on Tuesday, then again on Thursday all day after my talk. Unofficially, I plan to be in the Fundamentals Lounge pretty much the entire time, though I may step out every so often to check out the exhibitors' booths and hands-on labs, to eat, or just to tease the people in the other lounges. </p>
<p> What this means for you is that if you have something you want to discuss with me, you can just drop in the Fundamentals Lounge and there's a good chance I'll be there. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ricom/archive/2005/07/30/445341.aspx"> No need to make an appointment</a>. Don't be afraid to approach me; if I didn't want to be disturbed I'd have stayed in my hotel room! If I'm not around, you can call the main Microsoft switchboard +1-425-882-8080 and ask for me, and the call will be forwarded to my mobile. </p>
<p> As for my talk, it will be in the style of a lecture, so there will be no slides. Slides will be provided in the handouts for completeness, but I won't use them. I'm told the talk will be recorded, and it is my understanding that the post-conference DVD will contain copies of every talk, so those of you who attend will be able to re-live the excitement in the comfort of your very own cubicle. (And to pre-empt the inevitable follow-up question: The PDC team own the recording of my talk, so don't ask me if I can make a copy available. It's not mine to give out.) </p>
<p> One consequence of giving a lecture-style talk is that  I will be using a Tablet&nbsp;PC as a sort of electronic chalkboard. There's one catch, though: I don't own a Tablet&nbsp;PC myself. I'll try to borrow one from a colleague for my talk, but in the worst-case scenario, I may get up on stage and ask to borrow one from an audience member. (Downside of loaning me your Tablet&nbsp;PC: You can't take notes on your Tablet&nbsp;PC during the talk. Upside: You get a copy of all the notes and diagrams!) </p>

		<p>Does anyone know if MSDN Subscribers will be able to order/download the post-conference DVD to PDC 05 even if you didn&#8217;t attend?  My wife is scheduled to give birth (c-section) to our second son the week of PDC so there is very little chance I can attend this year ;) hehe</p>
<p>But I am very interested in getting a copy of the post-conference DVD if possible, even if it means I have to wait a couple of months afterwards.</p>

		<p>Anybody that&#8217;s going to be there on Sunday and is a motocross buff :-), can go see an AMA National Pro Motocross at Glen Helen near San Bernadino.</p>

		<p>Be sure to find Raymond early on and politely ask him to borrow *your* Tablet PC from you.  How often does a professor offer to take notes on behalf of a student?</p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry about borrowing a Tablet. I&#8217;ve asked and we&#8217;ll be providing you with a loaner shortly.</p>
<p>Sorry all you audience members!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
