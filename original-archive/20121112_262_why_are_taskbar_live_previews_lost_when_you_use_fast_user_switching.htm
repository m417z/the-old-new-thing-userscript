<p>Anonymous asks a metric buttload of questions, which means that I feel compelled to answer all or none. And given the choice, I decided to answer none.</p>
<p> Okay, I will answer one and ignore the rest. </p>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/20/10040074.aspx#10040995"> Why are taskbar live previews lost when you use Fast User Switching</a>? </p>
<p> When you switch away from a user via Fast User Switching, the Desktop Window Manager for that session is turned off. After all, since that session no longer has access to the screen, there's no point running all this code and consuming all this memory for something nobody can see. </p>
<p> When the Desktop Window Manager restarts upon reactivation of a session, it can recovery nearly all of the information it needs: It can enumerate all the windows and obtain their positions and styles. For each visible window, it can send a <code>WM_<wbr>PAINT</wbr></code> message to ask it to paint its contents afresh. But if the window is minimized, the Desktop Window Manager has no way to get at the application's non-minimized pixels, because the application will respond to the <code>WM_<wbr>PAINT</wbr></code> message by saying, "My client area is 0&times;0. I will therefore paint nothing!" </p>
<p> This is one of those tradeoffs that you have to make when engineering software. The benefit of shutting down the Desktop Window Manager when it is not being used exceeds the cost of losing thumbnails for minimized applications. Until the application is restored (and can therefore be sent a <code>WM_<wbr>PAINT</wbr></code> message to get it to paint its client area at its restored size), the Desktop Window Manager merely shows a placeholder bitmap. </p>

		<p>Probably explorer always paints placeholder, then usually DWM paints thumbnail over it if it can.</p>

		<p>From what I can tell, a lot of technical Windows users do not share their computers with anyone else. &nbsp;I always turned off Fast User Switching in Windows XP, so I never saw this issue anyway. &nbsp;In Windows 7, I never &quot;Switch user&quot;, so I still never see the issue. &nbsp;:-)</p>

<p>I would imagine the DW manages both the live previews and the screenshots, and Explorer manages the window menu and text.</p>

		<p>In the temp dictionary? I really wish they would have implemented that. The thumbnails get lost here all the time. Not only while user switching, also after starting fullscreen games.</p>
<p>They also could have introduced a new window flag which makes minimized windows only move offscreen. This wouldnt break anything in most applications, so everybody could just enable this flag.</p>

		<p>There is another related &quot;problem&quot; caused by the behavior Raymond is describing: &nbsp;minimized windows don&#39;t get a thumbnail updated. &nbsp;This is easy to reproduce:</p>
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;Run media player with visualizations.</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Hover mouse over taskbar; notice the slick thumbnail with a smooth view of the animated visualization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Minimize the media player.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;The thumbnail is now stale and isn&#39;t updated with the latest visualization.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Some ideas for solutions for both this problem and the original one Raymond describes:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Restore the window, send it a WM_PAINT, then minimize it. &nbsp;Implement some hacks in DWM/explorer to prevent the restored windows from showing up. &nbsp;But this will probably be slow and cause app compatibility problems, and would make the Windows architecture smell a little worse. &nbsp;Probably a terrible solution. &nbsp;Probably wouldn&#39;t work for my scenario either, because you&#39;d have to poll the minimized windows for updates so would be very slow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Save thumbnails like hacksoncode describes; actually DWM obviously is already doing this, as evidenced by my steps above; it&#39;s just not retaining them across session switches. &nbsp;But this will surely introduce performance penalty when switching sessions if DWM is being shut down.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Perhaps the architecturally cleanest solution is to rectify the original problem, which is that there&#39;s no way for a window to be minimized and have a client area needing painting at the same time &#8211; a limitation that at first glance seems to date back to Win16 and the transition to Win95 taskbar. &nbsp;In Win16, window area was the minimized icon; in Win95 this was eliminated entirely when minimized. &nbsp;There was never a concept of separating the rendering of the minimized icon from the rendering of the restored window itself. &nbsp;Perhaps the appropriate window functions and messages could be modified, with new messages added, to rectify this. &nbsp;For example, a new message for painting that supersedes WM_PAINT and might be called if window is minimized. &nbsp;Downside would be apps would need to support it. &nbsp;But there would be no big performance penalty like with the other two options and you could still shut down DWM. &nbsp;This option seems like it would fit in relatively cleanly with the rest of DWM.</p>
</li>
</ol>

		<p>Would it *really* have cost that much to save the bitmaps as the session was exiting? Of course, they might change while the session is inactive, but at least you&#39;d have the last view.</p>

		<p>Microsoft should have allowed the user to choose. Have an option to save the last known thumbnail or restore the minimized window temporarily in a hidden (not visible to the user) screen space to be able to get a fresh thumbnail on request.</p>
<p>Microsoft could have had the option turned off by default and allow advanced users to turn if on.</p>

		<p>Windows may forget many important thingch to that login screen.</p>
<p>For example, when a user changes password, the keyboard shortcuts are lost. The ones that trigger specific input languages (I use Alt-Shift-1 for US English, Alt-Shift-0 for Hebrew). Alt-Shift to cycle around the input languages is remembered, though.</p>

The point of these icons is do give a visual hint of what document the application has open, not to provide an alternate way to work in miniature. You are asking to create enormous complexity to solve a problem nobody else perceives as such. (There&#39;s already too much of this in about every product.)</p>

		<p>@JoeWoodbury: Basically it would continue to render itself normally when minimized. &nbsp;The fact that it is minimized wouldn&#39;t affect things any more. &nbsp;It would be drawing to some buffer on the video card managed by DWM, which I assume is already the case when rendering today. &nbsp;Where and how DWM decides to display that buffer is up to DWM &#8211; not the app.</p>
<p>The notion of the window&#39;s slate being directly placed on the video buffer driving the screen &#8211; like in Win16 &#8211; went away a long time ago.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>The point is that there is no existing message that says, &quot;Hey, I know you&#39;re minimized, but please paint as if you weren&#39;t.&quot; To do that, you&#39;d have to invent a new message, which means that only new-style applications could take advantage of it, and hey look, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd938874(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">that message already exists</a>. So the answer is &quot;We are so smart, we did what you are requesting 3 years ago.&quot; -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Seldom programs keep state of if they are minimized. A faked WM_PAINT could have been used in 99% of the cases to get the window bitmap. WM_DWMSENDICONICLIVEPREVIEWBITMAP is unnecessary cruft, as most thing in post-Vista.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>But <code>GetClientRect</code> returns 0 when minimized, so if you asked them to paint, they would paint nothing. And &quot;seldom&quot; is nowhere near good enough for compatibility. If only 0.1% of Windows programs crashed when minimized, that&#39;s still 4,000 programs. -Raymond</em>]</div>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
