<p>Back in 2002, I read <a href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB1027028372329483200.html"> an article about luxury camping</a> in the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, and it struck me as kind of missing the point of camping.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  For campers too busy to shop for marshmallows, one place stocks a s'mores kit -- skewers included -- in its gourmet general store. Another provides blow dryers, putting an end to "river hair." </p>
<p> When Karen Schaupeter and her husband arrived at El Capitan Canyon in Santa Barbara, Calif., they were chauffeured to their campsite in a golf cart. Dinner was tamales with mango salsa prepared by the staff, in front of a roaring bonfire -- also prepared by the staff. In the morning, Ms. Schaupeter ordered a latte at El Capitan's store. "I thought I was being snooty," says the Oakland photo stylist. "But people were coming in saying, 'a double no-foam mocha, please.' " </p>
<p> A tent site at the Chattooga River Resort, for example, is just $18 a night. Beverages are extra (1955 Chateau Latour: $1,100), as are rented DVDs for your laptop. Tack on a "room-service" steak dinner for four and it'll run you $75. Plus, because you are camping, you'll still have to cook the steaks. In Northern California, a barebones pitch-your-own-tent site is $30 at Costanoa, but if you want a maid to fluff the down comforter, you've got to spring for at least a canvas cabin at $130 a night. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Now all this sounded pretty extravagant at the time, I mean, $350 a night for camping? Room service? But at least you have to cook the steak yourself, that's <i>something</i> at least. </p>
<p> Apparently, in the years since the article was written, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003852600_glamcamp25.html"> things had gotten even worse</a>: Now you don't even have to cook your own steak. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  "We don't pitch tents. We don't cook outdoors. We don't share a bathroom. It's just not going to happen. This is a kid who has never flown anything but first class or stayed anywhere other than a Four Seasons." </p>
<p> The Bondicks, who live near Boston and have a personal chef, shelled out $595 a night, plus an additional $110 per person per day for food. </p>
<p> It's a hefty price to sleep in a tent, but the perks include a camp butler to build the fire, a maid to crank up the heated down comforter and a cook to whip up bison rib-eye for dinner and French toast topped with huckleberries for breakfast. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> (Put that job title on your r&eacute;sum&amp;eacute: <i>Camp Butler</i>.) </p>
<p> The end of the article describes some of the "luxury nature" events you can sign up for, like being driven to the start of a scenic section of a hike and picked up at the other side, so you don't have to "hoof it past the same view twice." </p>
<p> What a horrific ordeal it must be to experience nature twice. </p>

		<p>And to think, I thought my nice backpacking tent, mummy bag and backpack was extravagent. &nbsp;While there are nights I just don&#8217;t want to cook (and I confess, I own a camp stove, because you can&#8217;t have Bar-B-Que all night for a week, and cleaning cookware used on wood is a pain.) I can&#8217;t imagine going camping and eating at an onsite resturant every night.</p>

		<p>All jaw-dropping except for the last bit about being driven to the first portion of a hike &amp; from the last portion&#8230;it sounds like an Appalachian Trail through-hike to me.</p>

		<p>And I thought camping at a place with an outhouse was luxurious!</p>

		<p>&quot;it sounds like an Appalachian Trail through-hike to me.&quot;</p>
<p>&#8230; except the Appalachian Trail goes between cities, and these hikes are maybe 5 miles long.</p>

		<p>Well, he&#8217;s right about driving to and from the termini of the A.T. &nbsp;Springer Mountain&#8217;s 75 miles or so from Atlanta (probably the most likely starting or ending point for travel to/from Springer), and there&#8217;s also about an hour drive from the nearest parking lot to Springer just to get to paved roads; Katahdin is six miles from the entrance to the state park where it resides plus a further 28 or so miles to Millinocket, the nearest town. &nbsp;The problem of &quot;getting somewhere&quot; while on the trail, other than further down it, is pretty much non-existent outside of starting and ending travel; hitchhiking or a little extra walking suffice to get most places off-trail that one would have much need to visit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too bad the kid&#8217;s not a few years older or so, else I&#8217;d suggest Boy Scouts instead, which would be far better in any number of ways. &nbsp;At that age Cub Scouts is the other option, but truth be told you do much less camping as a Cub Scout than as a Boy Scout (or at least that&#8217;s how it was for me) due to the younger age. &nbsp;Still, Cub Scouts wouldn&#8217;t be a bad thing either for him even if it didn&#8217;t mean too much camping. &nbsp;Another, less time-consuming option would be to just find some nearby hiking trails with good views and go for some walks; hopefully these people can stomach a modicum of physical exertion.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
