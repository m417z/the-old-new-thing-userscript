<p>A customer maintained a database which recorded information per user. The information in the database is keyed by the user's SID. This works out great most of the time, but there are cases in which a user's SID can change.</p>
<p> "Wait, I thought SIDs don't change." </p>
<p> While it's true that SIDs don't change, it is also true that the SID associated with a user can change. Since SIDs encode the domain to which they belong, a user which moves from one domain to another within an organization, will <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc961625.aspx"> need to be assigned a new SID</a>. </p>
<p> But wait, does that mean that the user lost access to all their stuff? After all, all their stuff was marked "Owned by X\UserName" but the user's SID is now Y\UserName. </p>
<p> No, the user doesn't lose access to their stuff thanks to <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc779590(v=WS.10).aspx"> SID history</a>, and if you move users around a lot, <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/ashleymcglone/archive/2011/05/19/using-powershell-to-resolve-token-size-issues-caused-by-sid-history.aspx"> the SID history can get quite large</a>. </p>
<p> A token for a user contains not only their current identity but also all of their earlier identities. That is what permits Y\UserName to continue to access things that was marked "Owned by X\UserName": The token for Y\UserName includes an entry that says, "Oh, I used to be X\UserName." </p>
<p> The customer's database can take advantage of the SID history to match up users with their former selves. Our customer was lucky in that their database recorded only users who had logged into the local machine, so that list is typically pretty small. The simplest solution for this particular customer is just to go through all the users in the database, and for each one, see if the current user has that database user in their SID history. And the easy way to do that is to make the security system do the work for you: To see if the current user has user X in their SID history, create a security descriptor that grants access only to user X, then call <code>Access&shy;Check</code> to see if the current user can access it. If so, then that means that the current user was at one point in the past known as X. </p>
<p> (If you have a large database where iterating over all users is impractical, you can ask for the current user's SID-History attribute and walk through the previous identities manually.) </p>

		<p>Sounds a little unfortunate.</p>
<p>Would it have been better to make SIDs like GUIDs instead if it were possible to start over from scratch?</p>

		<p>The idea was that they would not ever change in that case. So the domain would not be encoded in the GUID/SID but stored elsewhere.</p>

		<p>&quot;What domain does this SID belong to?&quot;</p>
<p>But if you moved users to a new domain and deleted the old domain, how can you answer &quot;What domain does this SID belong to?&quot; for the old SID&#39;s?</p>

		<p>[The tradeoff is that the question &quot;What domain does this SID belong to?&quot; becomes unanswerable, which is kind of a problem if you need to authenticate that SID. -Raymond]</p>
<p>Let us suppose for a moment another way.</p>
<p>S-1-0-* = Well Known SID (Administrator, etc.)</p>
<p>S-1-1-* = Local Machine SID</p>
<p>S-1-2-* = Remote Machine SID (expression of S-1-1-* when seen on a share)</p>
<p>S-1-3-n-* = Domain SID</p>
<p>Where * is a guid and n is the guid established for the domain on create. The map-reduction table on domain migration would now be old-n to new-n and doesn&#39;t contain user ids. This keeps it short enough you should never have to purge.</p>

		<p>Actually that elsewhere is easy. You ask yourself. You ask the DC (don&#39;t care which) and you ask a DC for each trusted domain. If you can&#39;t find it that way you never will. This is still a worse choice then direct encoding though.</p>

		<p>@Joshua. : If that&#39;s the case, things get funny when VPN and VM enters the scene.</p>
<p>Consider what if your VPN client connects you to 2 different network with same domain name (these 2 domains never have connection so don&#39;t know each other exist). Now when you accessed share drive of first domain and then try to access share on second domain, your machine thinks you&#39;ve logged in while the remote side does not.</p>
<p>In the current implementation this problem does not exist because just the SID is exchanged, and the second domain&#39;s server will know it&#39;s not their SID.</p>
<p>This case is common for first-line support environments. AFAIK 2 secondary schools in HK have the same domain name because the abbreviation of the schools&#39; name are the same.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
