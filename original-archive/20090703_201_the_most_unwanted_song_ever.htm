		<p>The list of undesirable elements in the Wired article sounds like the attitude of global kool-aid drinkers with a disdain for strong connections to people, place, and tradition. &nbsp;No doubt, listening to a few measures, it was composed to grate on the ears.</p>

		<p>This song is just really great, definitely worth tracking it down. The paired &quot;Most Wanted Song&quot; is certainly less distinct&#8230;</p>
<p>Soldier has a number of other great records as well, if you&#8217;re interested in outside sounds.</p>

		<p>My 4 year old liked about half of it. My 2 year old liked the other half. So on average, there are only 199 slots left.</p>

		<p>So, have anyone else check out the The Most Wanted Paintings for the various countries? &nbsp;While they are different paintings, many are remarkably similar: &nbsp;A beach scene with a hill/mountain to the left.</p>

		<p>Ingrained in the human brain is the recognition of pleasant scene which has some hills, is green and has water. All desirable things for living off the land.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve always thought they had it backwards. The so-called unwanted song appeals to my absurd sense of humour, while the most wanted is just nauseating. Several of my friends agree. Although less than 200 of them&#8230;</p>

		<p>Jax184: Agreed, it sounds like the Bonzos or various sampled music. &nbsp;The levels are balanced, and it has a good rhythm and structure. &nbsp;Badly produced music is far less listenable.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know the others, but I think the &quot;China&#8217;s most wanted painting&quot; is wrong.</p>
<p>Most Chinese would want plenty of white color, plus a little bit red in the painting.</p>
<p>And I don&#8217;t know if there would be lots of people like a painting that only contains &quot;cold colors&quot;.</p>

		<p>But Mark, that&#8217;s the whole point &#8211; their &quot;worst song&quot; could have been a 3-year-old banging randomly on a piano or some other kind of discord or poor quality audio, but that wouldn&#8217;t really have demonstrated anything interesting. &nbsp;The idea was to put out something well-written and well-produced that people would hate anyway on the basis of the music itself.</p>
<p>Anyway, it&#8217;s obviously satirical, and so I don&#8217;t think it should shock anybody that the &quot;most wanted&quot; song is annoying, but as for the &quot;least wanted&quot; song, even if it made you chuckle, would you really put it into your regular playlist?</p>

		<p>There was an episode of Numb3rs (S4E17 &#8211; &quot;Pay to Play&quot;) which featured a program that could &quot;process any song and predict its expected level of success.&quot;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
