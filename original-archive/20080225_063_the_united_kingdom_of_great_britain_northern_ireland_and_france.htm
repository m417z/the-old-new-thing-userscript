		<p>This is SUCH old news. It was first proposed in 1066 by the French. It was implemented with limited success, but the British pulled out of the deal in 1415 and, to some extent, reversed the terms.</p>

		<p>Yes, the relationship between France and the UK is indeed ambiguous&#8230;</p>
<p>The general public of each country seems to be verbally hostile to each other, hostile in a friendly way :)</p>
<p>There is a long history of wars between France and England and these wars learnt in school may influence durably the perception of the other country, even if in &quot;recent&quot; wars both countries helped each other.</p>
<p>(Incidentally, it is said that France helping the UK win the Falklands war (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2002%2F03%2F13%2Fnot13.xml" rel="nofollow">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2002%2F03%2F13%2Fnot13.xml</a>) &nbsp;also helped the british government accept the idea of joining Europe and therefore tied a little more the two countries together)</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>The Normans were hardly French. France didn&#8217;t reallyexist properly at that point and the Normans were of mixed stock, being partly displaced Vikings. They also didn&#8217;t so much as propose it, they conquoured the ruling class and &quot;enslaved&quot; the people. They ruined the culture of this country and held back the British by a few hundred years. The only reason we stopped having French as the language of the ruling class was because the Continental French were so snobby, they ripped the micky out of the Norman French speakers, so they felt culturally alienated and so began to rely on English as the sole language.</p>

		<p>What is not clear from the documents is whether the merger would address &#8216;the Berwick question&#8217;; whether Berwick upon Tweed is part of Scotland (as it is geographically, being north of the border) or part of england (as it has been since English forces occupied it). The wikipedia article has some good coverage, including discussion as to whether it os still at war with Russia from the Crimean War.</p>
<p>Really the subject should have been: The United Kingdoms of England, Scotland, Wales, Northern Ireland, France and Berwick upon Tweed.</p>
<p>On a related note, US passport/visa forms have a space where you are meant to write down your country&#8217;s name, and they explicit say &#8216;do not abbreviate&#8217;. I have never quite dared to write down &#8216;The United Kingdom of England, Scotland, Northern Ireland, the principality of Wales and Berwick upon Tweed.&#8217; because (a) there&#8217;s never enough space and (b) the border people have no sense of humour.</p>

		<p>I am English. I&#8217;m from the South Coast. I&#8217;m from a lower middle class backgroaund. We hate the French. We don&#8217;t hate them in a &quot;oh, don&#8217;t you just HATE those darned French?&quot;, No we *HATE* the French. The problem with the French is extremely historical. They have a habbit of sticking hteir oar in when not required, being arrogant (the French, never?) and generally boycotting and striking at extremely inconvenient times.</p>
<p>History: at times England have owned big chunks of France. We currently own the Channel Islands, historically fairly French. But we oned all of Normandy and also parts of Brittany at one point or another.</p>
<p>The Bretons are displaced British &#8211; the Anglo Saxons/Vikings made the Celtic Bretons retreat. Their language is extremely similar to Welsh and Cornish. The name Brittany comes from the same place as &quot;Britain&quot;. We owned Normandy throught the 1066 Norman invasion.</p>

		<p>If you&#8217;re a rugby union fan (and there&#8217;s plenty of them about in this Country), then in a way France has been united with the United Kingdom (as was, this now comprises the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland) since 1910.</p>

<p>Evidence is mounting that Germanic-speaking tribes inhabited eastern England before the Roman conquest and may have jointly occupied Britain at the end of the last Ice Age (Germanic from the east, Celtic from the south) while land &nbsp;bridges still existed.</p>

<p>The Normans were Frenchified Vikings that intermarried with French. Norman French language!=Central French language (cf. Guarantee and Waranty, being the same word borrowed once from Central French and once from Norman.) Big differences. They were considered, by Parisians at the time, as being as &quot;French&quot; as French speaking Canadians are.</p>

		<p>In some ways this is a Good Thing. Just imagine a restaurant with french waiters and an english chef. *shudder* Now we have bad cuisine with pleasant service and good cuisine with horrible service, it sort of balances out. Well, mostly. Sort of. Not really, actually&#8230; Kidney pie&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;the French are no longer allowed to die in muddy fields.&quot;</p>
<p>Has anyone told them yet? They don&#8217;t seem to have figured it out by themselves. Not a hundred years ago they did it in droves. Of course, they were all geared up for longbows so the machine guns may have come as a bit of a surprise. :-)</p>

		<p>Well it seems that my memory did not serve me well and that I did not think about what I wrote. The UK joined the European Union way before the Falklands War.</p>
<p>Now I can&#8217;t remember exactly what president Mitterand gained from Mrs Thatcher for the help in this war, but it had something to do with Europe or maybe the Channel Tunnel. In any case, it still was one more little step in bringing the UK and France closer together.</p>
<p>(Sorry that my mistake put me farther away from the topic&#8230;)</p>
<p>@memsom:</p>
<p>The English think they hate the French but in reality it is just jealousy! They surely love France, which really looks like paradise when you come from England. If your teeth weren&#8217;t big enough of a hint, England&#8217;s weather should have proven you that God sided with the French! ;)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
