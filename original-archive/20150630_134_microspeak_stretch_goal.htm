<p>Recall that Microspeak is not merely for jargon exclusive to Microsoft, but also for jargon that you need to know.</p>
<p> A project will set some goals, which are things it intends to accomplish. It may also set <i>stretch goals</i>, which are things it hopes to acomplish. If you fail to achieve a stretch goal, your project is still a success, but if you make it, your project is even more awesome. A stretch goal could be unrelated to an existing goal. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  <b>Goals for this release</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Support dynamic widget recolorization. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Stretch goals for this release</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Improve throughput by 10% compared to previous version. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/03/21/1922203.aspx">Non-goals for this release</a></b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Support offline mode. </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p> But more often, it takes the form of a higher level of achievement for an existing goal: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Goal: 40% of the programs will <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/07/16/10434390.aspx"> land</a> actual <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/09/16/10558167.aspx"> spend</a> within 10% of estimate. Stretch goal: 60%. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Setting a stretch goal is tricky. You want to set it just at the edge of achievability. If you make it unrealistic, then nobody will take it seriously. </p>
<p> You can think of a stretch goal as an "extra credit" assignment. You won't be penalized for missing it, but making it will earn you kudos. </p>

		<p>Ah the luxury of being able to set stretch goals. I get tired of scheduled release dates being utterly unrealistic.</p>

		<p>Is this really just Microspeak anymore? Kickstarter has been using it in what appears to be the same sense, as sort of &quot;extra&quot; goals that they want to accomplish in addition to the basic goals if they receive sufficient extra funding to make it possible. Perhaps the two uses of the term originated independently, maybe Kickstarter borrowed it from Microsoft (former employees?), or perhaps it was a pre-existing term in English that just happened to be rare outside Microsoft. It seems like a sensible enough compound to not just be the second of these three possibilities, but who knows.</p>

		<p>I distrust the stretch goals concept since, in my experience, they all too often become the goal.</p>

		<p>@Brad: Or the reverse will happen, because then anyone what to set a stretch goal has to have right on (re)allocating project budget.</p>

		<p>Ah, yes, we had these at my last job at department level, usually for a metric that had a number, like 99.9% uptime or 25% increase in signups). We usually met them in the IT department too. Of course, that was the expectation as far as our VP was concerned (the CEO didn&#39;t know that, though. In fact, there was a third, lower goal, which we didn&#39;t even know about, that was reported to the CEO as the &quot;meet&quot; goal)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
