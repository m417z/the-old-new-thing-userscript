		<p>I think the issue is not whether American kids would like the joke, but whether their parents would be upset by it. Some parents are easily offended; there is a strict and humorless system for rating video games and the penalites for breaking the rules are fairly severe.</p>

		<p>British kids (and adults, judging from various British comedies) <em>adore</em> fart jokes. I think it must be the Canadians.</p>

		<p>I assure you that we Canadians have no more aversion to flatulence than Americans or the Brits. &nbsp;After all, many of the most recognizable comedians in American media are, in fact, Canadian.</p>
<p>Perhaps &quot;breaking a rotten egg&quot; is simply a Japanese euphemism for farting that was translated literally. &nbsp;Anyone???</p>

		<p>I suppose it&#8217;s possible the translation was bungled (i.e. Zero Wing), but I suspect it was more to avoid possibly offending anyone. &nbsp;The pussification of America continues. &nbsp;Our forefathers didn&#8217;t fight and die so that we could be insulated from fart jokes.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s more likely that, rather than the pussification of America continuing, it&#8217;s that in Japan the fart joke isn&#8217;t really considered toilet humour. For that matter, they don&#8217;t really have the concept of &#8216;toilet humour&#8217;, which makes for a whole lot of fun when you see Japanese game shows where the aim is to run around in Y-fronts and get the front of them as dirty as possible without using your hands.</p>
<p>Treehouse (Nintendo&#8217;s internal translation house, who are probably some of the best translators working in games &#8211; their Mario RPG localizations are phenomenal) most likely figured that a literal translation would cause some cultural confusion, and so decided to go for something which was the same in spirit to what was intended. You gotta do this a lot in translation &#8211; there&#8217;s no way you can do a 100% accurate translation for things like this, because not only do you need the words to line up, you need the cultures to as well.</p>
<p>(Incidentally: World&#8217;s Deadliest Police Chases also does not translate well.)</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I suggest re-reading the post. &quot;breaking a rotten egg&quot; is from the English translation. The original Japanese clearly states &quot;[you] farted&quot; (onara sityatta).</p>
<p>TÅkyÅ, Japan</p>

		<p>Maybe it wasn&#8217;t the question that caused the sanitized translation but one of the answers.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  You broke a rotten egg in a room. What will you do?

<p>></p>

<p>I think the translators thought people in America could be offended by the possibility that they might want to smell their own farts.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>What relevance is geographical location? It&#8217;s an English translation, so it is applicable to all English readers, not to mention those in Japan.</p>

<p>You should have seen &#8216;Men in White&#8217; on Discovery channel. They do fart, everyone does. It is simple unavoidable. The question is how others behave when one farts.</p>

		<p>I thought Billy Connolly had explained this in excruciating detail in one of his better-known skits from the 80s? Here in the UK, anyone with any money has their fart glad removed. Americans spend all their money on dentistry: we spend it on anal hygiene.</p>
<p>Have you ever seen the Queen fart? No, and you couldn&#8217;t imagine her doing so. The Queen Mum, God rest her soul? Never farted once.</p>
<p>Princess Anne? Due to a rare medical condition she didn&#8217;t get the op, and now farts like a horse.</p>

		<p>Actually, I believe the word &quot;fart&quot; is in a swear-class worse than regular language in Britain &#8211; the &quot;mild vulgarity&quot; class.</p>
<p>It lives there with &quot;piss&quot; and &quot;arse&quot; (or &quot;ass&quot;), which are two words that Americans also seem to find acceptable in regular conversation.</p>
<p>While talking about we-speak-the-same-language-but-are-not-the-same, the translation artifact of the five-letter f word (f.nny) is always a source of amusement, particularly when a middle-class Brit encounters it in Yank conversation for the first time.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
