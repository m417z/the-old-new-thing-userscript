		<p>I’m amazed that they can get speech recognition running on such a small form factor device! I’ve been using Microsoft Voice Command on my xda for a couple of months and it is pretty good… frustrating when it strangely refuses to work sometimes… but mostly works well. But I’m a geek and I’m prepared to put up with less than 100% accuracy, at least for a while. I don’t know if the psychgraphic profile of people working in the industries mentioned in this article, that is healthcare, retail and manufacturing, are willing to put up with less-than-perfect recognition. I wonder how good it is on the Vocera?</p>

		<p>If it is a wireless communications device, it can transmit the speech to a big computer in a closet somewhere, that can do the speech recognition, and send the results over to whatever agent is acting on it.  I haven&#8217;t looked at the current offering, but you can employ the traditioonal telephone network to understand how to &quot;get speech reco on a tiny device&quot; &#8230; the tiny device, like a traditional telephone, is just a simple hookup to the resources of the greater network.  All the magic actually happens in a plain brick building downtown.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
