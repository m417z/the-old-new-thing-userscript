<p>Some time ago, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/"> Larry Osterman</a> wrote about the unofficial game of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2006/10/25/last-checkin-chicken.aspx"> Last Checkin Chicken</a>, wherein teams "compete" to avoid being the one responsible for the last change to a product. The competition is purely virtual; nobody really keeps score, and the "winner" is soon forgotten.</p>
<p> Unless you're that winner. </p>
<p> I know someone who won the Last Checkin Chicken prize not once, but twice! My colleague made the last checkin for Windows&nbsp;2000, and purely coincidentally, also made the last checkin for Windows&nbsp;XP. It's not something to be proud of, but it's not a badge of shame either. </p>
<p> As part of the game, teams will try to make "remora" checkins. (I just made up that term.) These are fixes that you want to get in at the last minute, but which you cannot justify on their own merits as worth delaying the release of the product another day for. You still have to argue your fix to the release management team (and your fix had better be rock solid), and if release management grants you remora status, then your bug fix is set aside. If a serious bug is discovered elsewhere, then your remora bug gets to hitch a free ride on the window opened by that other bug. On the other hand, if no serious bugs are found that force a delay of the product's release, then your fix goes into the next update (be it an online update, a service pack, whatever). </p>
<p> It's sort of the developer version of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jesperh/archive/2006/10/25/bug-bar-limbo.aspx"> bug bar limbo</a>. </p>

		<p>Back in my IBM days doing OS/2 there was &quot;slime&quot; when things were shutting down for a release. &nbsp;The release management team would prevent things from going in that appeared to be risky, but an open defect regarding a spelling error, or other very-safe-sounding-to-fix bug would more than likely be allowed into the build.</p>
<p>Groups would keep a trivial defect open and not fix it so that they always had a way to sneak big changes into the product late if they felt they had to. &nbsp;It&#8217;s my understanding that OS/2&#8217;s entire plug-n-play infrastructure, &quot;device manager&quot;ish control panel, and updating all the standard device drivers was slimed into the build right before golden-master time under the guise of a &quot;Sound Blaster device driver doesn&#8217;t detect IRQ correctly on a white-box PC&quot; defect.</p>

		<p>In our group we call &#8216;remora&#8217; checkins &#8216;limpet bugs&#8217;. I suppose the intent is to compare to mollusks, but &#8216;limpet&#8217; makes me think of &#8216;limpet mines&#8217; &#8212; magnetic naval mines used to sink ships. perhaps apt.</p>

		<p>You make it sound as if products ship bug-free-ish. &nbsp;From experience with being involved in beta programs, there is another dev team behaviour which is along the lines of &quot;must close out as many bugs as possible so a) our dev team doesn&#8217;t look as bad as others, and b) total product bug limit is below what we can ship product with&quot;.</p>

		<p>I believe Iain McDonald introduced the &quot;shark&quot; and &quot;limpet fish&quot; terminology for bugs during the Windows 2000 end game. Maybe it&#8217;s more of an Aussie usage.</p>

		<p>Actually, the sane reason to avoid being the last one in as the final moments are when enough changes can happen that your fix can break the build. And blame for breaking the build always goes to the &quot;winner&quot; who has to prove that his checkin didn&#8217;t break it.</p>
<p>Fun came the other day, when the most senior top guy checked in an innoculous change. His new file wasn&#8217;t used anywhere (yet &#8211; he wanted it in code control). I get called over when the build broke (moi? I touched nothing, but I knpw enough to figure out where blame is to be cast.). He accidentally checked in code through a symlink &#8211; which the build always recreated as part of the build prep stage. Of course, source control didn&#8217;t make a symlink, but a real directory&#8230; the build script couldn&#8217;t create the symlink&#8230; good thing the script checked return values or it would&#8217;ve been very strange during testing.</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a similar thing where I work, too.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;ve always commented that it was a bad attitude for development teams to take since I could see a shy and withdrawn developer might keep their mouth shut about something they see just so they don&#8217;t get teased.</p>
<p>When I bring that up to management, I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s all in good fun, so, I wonder if it really doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>

		<p>Sometimes chicken != developer. It might be management.</p>

  &gt;Pre-emptive Igor Levicki comment: &quot;Windows Vista sucks.&quot;&lt;&lt;

<p>I can&#8217;t decide whether Raymond likes me or hates me or a bit of both but it seems that I have become an important part of his life when he is devoting his valuable time to pre-empting me.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  &gt;Man Igor is famous now. He&#8217;s in Raymond&#8217;s blog! I bet Igor&#8217;s site hit skyrocketed.&lt;&lt;

<p>I don&#8217;t even have a counter on my website.</p>
<p>Back on topic &#8212; it seems that there were considerably less chicken involved in making Windows Vista otherwise it wouldn&#8217;t need SP1 so soon ;-)</p>

		<p>WinXP was released in 2001, SP1 was released in 2002 IIRC. I don&#8217;t see how Vista is that different except that it was first released in late 2006.</p>

		<p>I must be a masochist, I love being the last commit on a project. &nbsp;Sometimes I&#8217;ll commit minor code refactorings or just one more test case to get it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Not sure exactly why but it gives me a feeling of getting in the last word and probably some control freak as well because I know when I commited all the tests passed and the build was solid so no one else better commit and screw things up :)</p>
<p>Hearing that others dreaded it was a bit of a surprise.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
