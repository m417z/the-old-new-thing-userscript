<p>Some Windows settings can only be established as part of the installation process. This is done with a so-called <i>unattend file</i>. (Remember, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/01/14/7103585.aspx"> no matter where you put an advanced setting, somebody will tell you that you are an idiot</a>.) In earlier versions of Windows, the unattend file took the form of an INI file, but Windows&nbsp;Vista hopped aboard the XML bandwagon, and the unattend file format changed to XML. The nice thing about using XML is that you can publish a schema so people can validate their unattend file without having to perform a test install (only to discover twenty minutes later that a typo resulted in an entire section of the unattend file being ignored, say).</p>
<p> If you spend a lot of time setting up computers, you can use an unattend file to answer all the Setup questions (like "enter your product key") so all you have to do is type "setup /unattend:myconfiguration.xml" and go out to lunch. When you come back, your machine will be installed and ready. </p>
<p> Here are two of the most popular unattend settings which must be set during installation. (There are a bunch of popular unattend settings for things that can also be changed post-install; for those other settings, the unattend file is not your only chance.) </p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749506(WS.10).aspx"> CustomDefaultThemeFile</a> - sets the default theme and wallpaper. </li>
<li> <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc749305(WS.10).aspx"> FolderLocations</a> - moves the C:\Users and C:\ProgramData directories, say to a different drive. </li>
</ul>
<p> Wait, the <code>C:\<wbr>Program Files</wbr></code> directory isn't on the list of directories that can be relocated. There's a reason for that, which we'll look at next time. </p>

		<p>I discovered years ago that the unattended file allows you to join Windows XP Media Center to a Windows domain. &nbsp;This is the only way to join XP Media Center to a domain, once XP Media Center is installed joining a domain is not permitted. &nbsp;Although I suspect this is more of a bug and less of a feature. :)</p>

		<p>Out of curiosity: putting the profiles directory on some other drive is not such an uncommon thing, why are these settings made available only via unattended installation file?</p>
<p>@Lockwood: the program files directory name is localised since the times of Windows 95 (e.g. in Italian editions of Windows it&#39;s c:Programmi), and only since Vista they started to create a compatibility symlink, so I wouldn&#39;t think that the problem lies there.</p>

<p>Sure, I know, but what I meant is: why don&#39;t you add a way to set them also during a &quot;normal&quot; (attended) installation, instead of requiring an unattended setup file? Is there some technical reason why it would be complicated to add a step to the installation procedure allowing the user to set them?</p>

		<p>@JamesJohnston: what I&#39;m saying is that if for Microsoft it isn&#39;t a problem to change the Program Files directory name for localization purposes, it shouldn&#39;t even be a problem to let the user customize it freely. I&#39;m quite interested in Raymond&#39;s answer, I think that the problem isn&#39;t the name, but there is some other caveat that prevents a free relocation.</p>

		<p>@MC: heh, I know, and I also know that &quot;any new feature starts with minus 100 points&quot;, I was curious if this has always been omitted because it never got out of the &quot;-100 points well&quot; or there was some other reason.</p>
<p>IMHO it wouldn&#39;t be wrong to add such a setting to the installer: after all, a fresh install isn&#39;t done by complete beginners (and the default would be to just use the &quot;normal&quot; locations). But, again, I may be biased from my needs, and there surely are items of much higher priority on the todo list.</p>

<p>Very, very few people need to change FolderLocations. Adding a question to the setup would take the time of many people who don&#39;t care.</p>

		<p>What is the point of letting users change folders if the installation cannot be serviced?</p>
<p>&quot;This setting should be used only in a test environment. By changing the default location of the user profile directories or program data folders to a volume other than the System volume, you will not be able to service your Windows installation. Any updates, fixes, or service packs will fail to be applied to the installation. Microsoft does not recommend that you change the location of the user profile directories or program data folders.&quot;</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve always thought it was called an unattended file, and the &quot;unattend&quot; name stems only from the 8.3-compliant unattend.ini (it had other extensions too).</p>

		<p>@Jonathan: The file itself is not unattended &#8212; it&#39;s the installation process that is. So the full unfolding would be &quot;[unattended installation] file&quot;, and whether you shorten that first term to &quot;unattend&quot; or &quot;unattended&quot;, it&#39;s a shortening in both cases.</p>

<p>Well, sometimes it can be handy.</p>
<p>But jokes aside, the user-visible Program Files name can be different for different users on the same host, because of localization on the fly. The actual NTFS name is always Program Files now. Or so I think.</p>

		<p>There was the InstallDir=&quot;Windows&quot; setting for Windows XP (Don&#39;t think an equivalent still exists for Windows 7/Vista).</p>
<p>There were also settings which can be easily set by the unattended file which require registry tweaking later because no GUI exists. Like System Restore settings on Windows XP which also no longer work.</p>

		<p>I did some work testing Vista SP1, and while it may have been covered by other test groups, noone I know of tested the relocated folders scenario.</p>
<p>I know of no reason it would fail, but I think it falls into the &#39;Unsupported&#39; category, that you&#39;re welcome to try, and good luck with it, but you&#39;re on your own.</p>

<p>Meh. It was possible in NT4 to move a profile (there was a well-hidden UI function that disappeared somewhere between NT4 and XP) that worked.</p>

<p>No, GetProfilesDirectory() returns the CURRENT path. It is needed only when a new profile has to be setup.</p>
<p>The paths to existing profiles do not depend on GetProfilesDirectory() &#8212; except for &quot;All Users&quot; and &quot;Default User&quot; in NT4 and NT5.x; since NT6.0 the registry holds the full paths to &quot;Public&quot; and &quot;Default&quot;:</p>

<p>&quot;Public&quot;=expand:&quot;%SystemDrive%UsersPublic&quot;</p>

  Very, very few people need to change FolderLocations. Adding a question to the setup would take the time of many people who don&#39;t care.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Btw, just want to let you know that most of my friends like to switch system folders path to D or even E drive just hope to let malwares existance become more verbose.</p>
<p>But then again they may not be considered average users.</p>

		<p>There are people who call API functions to locate folders and then save the result using another API rather than using the first API again? Weird.</p>
<p>And I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s so hard to change the default wallpaper.</p>

<p>That&#39;s why I proved this assumption wrong before you came up with.-)</p>
<p>Since 10 years at least one user profile, and since 5 years 3 of them are not located in</p>
<p>the path returned by GetProfilesDirectory().</p>
<p>JFTR: since 15 years a Domain Administrator can place the &quot;All Users&quot; and &quot;Default User&quot; profiles for Domain Users in the NETLOGON share.</p>

<p>No, you can leave some (or all) parameters for interactive installation.</p>

		<p>And like GetProfilesDirectory(), %ProgramFiles% cannot refer to multiple directories and whould break if you try to adress programs in different directories, thus all batchfiles which use this variable to refer to programs would break.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
