<p>A customer was debugging some code that calls <code>Register&shy;Class</code> on a class that's already been registered. In this case, it was registered by another DLL in the same process. Normally, this wouldn't be a problem, because <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/18/409205.aspx"> each DLL passes its own instance handle to <code>Register&shy;Class</code></a> so that there are no name collisions. However, in this case, both DLLs are passing the <code>CS_<wbr>GLOBAL&shy;CLASS</wbr></code> flag, which means that collisions can occur after all.</p>
<p> The customer found that the call to <code>ERROR_<wbr>CLASS_<wbr>EXISTS</wbr></wbr></code>, which makes sense in the case of a collision in the global class table. The code then calls <code>Find&shy;Atom</code> to look up the class name, but <code>Find&shy;Atom</code> fails, saying, "No such atom." </p>
<p> Does this mean that the class atom created by <code>Register&shy;Class</code> isn't a <i>real</i> atom? How can you get the atom for a window class that somebody else has registered? </p>
<p> Okay, let's look at these questions in order. </p>
<p> Is the atom a <i>real</i> atom? Well, if you ask the atom, it'll say, "I feel real to me." But remember that <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms649053(v=vs.85).aspx"> there are many atom tables</a> in the system. </p>
<ul>
<li>The global atom table. </li>
<li>One local atom table for each process. </li>
<li>The registered clipboard format atom table. </li>
<li>The registered window class atom table. </li>
<li>Possibly others, too. </li>
</ul>
<p> The <code>Find&shy;Atom</code> function searches the process's local atom table, so if you go looking for a registered window class atom there, you're going to come up empty. </p>
<p> There is no way to query the registered window class atom table directly. You only get indirect access to create items in it through <code>Register&shy;Class</code>, and that atom can in turned by used <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/10/11/240744.aspx"> as a synonym for the class name</a>. </p>
<p> Now, it so happens that although the <code>Get&shy;Class&shy;Info</code> function formally returns a <code>BOOL</code>, i.e., an integer that is zero on failure or nonzero on success, the success case of <code>Get&shy;Class&shy;Info</code> actually returns the class atom. This behavior is <i>not documented</i>, but the ATL library relies on it, so if the undocumented behavior changes in the future, it'll have an app compat shim to keep ATL happy. </p>

		<p>Out if interest, how do situations like this (where there&#39;s no supported way of doing something, but there&#39;s an undocumented-yet-commonly-used solution) usually get resolved? Does the behaviour get formally documented and committed to, or is a new mechanism introduced and the undocumented solution deprecated (and potentially relegated to an app compat shim)?</p>
<p>I&#39;d guess that the answer is &quot;both&quot;, but it would be interesting to know what approach is preferred when you have a choice.</p>

		<p>&gt; This behavior is not documented, but the ATL library relies on it, so if the undocumented behavior changes in the future, it&#39;ll have an app compat shim to keep ATL happy.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#39;t rely on it. It&#39;s possible that for instance the theoretical app compat shim only enables itself if it detects that the process uses ATL, or only does its work if it has been called by a DLL called &quot;atlXX.dll&quot;.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also possible that the app compat shim does only the minimum it has to do for ATL, and whatever ATL needs is less than what you need.</p>
<p>It&#39;s ALSO possible that one of these annoying evil intercepting DLLs replaces your GetÂ­ClassÂ­Info call with its own &quot;shim&quot; which returns only 0 or 1, because the DLL writer looked only at the documentation and treated it as a &quot;bool&quot;.</p>
<p>So yeah, better treat it as an opaque value as much as possible.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s almost like someone should have realised that if ATL need the information then somebody else does, and made it officially supported. Though I&#39;m going to guess that this is most likely a case of bad communication between teams.</p>

		<p>Considering that ATL code usually winds up embedded in the EXE or DLL which consumes it, and it&#39;s usually used to create ActiveX controls that could be loaded by any process in the system, it would be a bad idea to change the return behaviour of GetClassInfoEx. Better to document it so that no-one does break it in future.</p>
<p>Mind you, examining the source for ATL 6.0 (SP6), ATL 9.0 (SP1) and ATL 12.0 (Update 4), although CContainedWindowT::RegisterWndSuperclass does return an ATOM, CContainedWindowT::Create only tests whether the return value is 0. Unfortunately, CContainedWindowT::RegisterWndSuperclass is public and is documented in MSDN.</p>

		<p>I think &quot;not documented&quot; means &quot;no public documentation exists for this&quot; rather than &quot;no documentation exists&quot;, i.e. the functionality is almost certainly documented internally within Microsoft.</p>

		<p>Question:</p>
<p>Why not make an option to pass all class info straight to CreateWindowEx, without having to register a class? Classes only make sense for reusable windows. For app windows, who cares?</p>

		<p>@alegr1: Well, then you would have two kinds of windows, reusable and one-off, with different ways of creating them. I&#39;m not sure what is simpler.</p>
<p>I always use the value returned by RegisterClass as a class name in CreateWindow, kind of &quot;registered window class&quot; handle.</p>
<p>Makes the code prettier than using a magic string twice.</p>

		<p>&quot;There is no way to query the registered window class atom table directly&quot; this is of course not 100% true, this atom table is shared with some other things and just by using public APIs you can glean useful information, for debugging purposes only of course&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Chris Crowther: Are you implying that for all APIs, there&#39;s one version of public documentation and one version with &quot;secret&quot; details?</p>
<p>I can understand not publishing documentation of an API at all if you don&#39;t want others to rely on it. But what would be the point of making an API public but keeping some details secret? This seems like a huge waste of resources to me.</p>

		<p>@Sven2: Keeping track of we-need-this-for-compatibility behaviors without binding them as part of the public contract is one reason for having separate documentations. &nbsp;Keep in mind this documentation could be captured in a source comment, changelog, or something more formal. &nbsp;I don&#39;t think Chris was implying that Microsoft had a secret MSDN or anything like that.</p>

		<p>Why didn&#39;t they either make the function actually return a BOOL (by converting the value to TRUE or FALSE explicitly) or declare it to return an atom (which is what it actually returns)</p>

		<p>I suspect the scenario is much less nefarious than hidden docs. &nbsp;I suspect it was more along the lines like one of the ATL guys (at a much younger, smaller Microsoft) was talking to one of the Windows guys and mentioned that he needed this functionality. &nbsp;The Windows guy realized he could sneak in the extra behavior without breaking the contract to GetÂ­ClassÂ­Info and just did it. &nbsp;The ATL guy used it and pretty much no one else noticed.</p>

		<p>@SimonRev: I suspect the scenario is even less nefarious than that. Back when the function was introduced memory was more precious, so I suspect that return the atom handle directly would save space and be faster than doing an additional check. Why the function was officially returning a BOOL is a mystery though; perhaps the designers didn&#39;t want to be hemmed-in by exposing an implementation detail in the future if they changed the behaviour of the function.</p>

		<p>About ClassName/ClassAtom table, by personal experience:</p>
<p>from NT4 to Win7&#8230; we can build a table of names by scanning the range C000-FFFF via GetClipboardFormatName (not via GlobalGetAtomName), and this table will contain not only all ClipboardFormatNames, but also all Registered Window Messages and all Registered Window Classes.</p>
<p>Actually formats, messages and the classes lie in different tables, but share common values: for example, if the Name of Registered WindowMessage and the Name of Registered WindowClass are equal, then its return values (atoms) are equal also.</p>
<p>And so we can get ClassName/ClassAtom via GetClipboardFormatName/GetClassInfoEx, respectively.</p>

		<p>Serious question: Why doesn&#39;t Microsoft just change the return value of this function to ATOM in Windows.h, and take this as a formal dependency? There&#39;s no app-compat risk in this case, since code that previously relied on the function returning a BOOL will silently continue to work, but it will avoid the undocumented behavior by documenting it in the return type of the function itself.</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
