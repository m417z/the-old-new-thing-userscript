        I get called on frequently to do troubleshooting, so I figure I'd share some entries
        from my private bag of tricks.&#160; (And there are some remarks for programmers hidden
        here too.) 
    </p>
<p>
        Problem 1. A folder like <code>C:\Program Files\LitWare</code> opens each time you
        log on. 
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
        <b>Reason</b>: Your system contains two sibling directories where one is a strict
        prefix of the second. For example, 
    </p>
<pre>C:\Program Files\LitWare
C:\Program Files\LitWare Deluxe
</pre>
<p>
        If you go to regedit, you will likely find under 
    </p>
<pre>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
</pre>
<p>
        or 
    </p>
<pre>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Run
</pre>
<p>
        an entry that refers to a program in the longer directory, like 
    </p>
<pre>Reminder=REG_SZ:C:\Program Files\LitWare Deluxe\reminder.exe
</pre>
<p>
        What's more, the reference such as the one above will not have quotation marks to
        protect the embedded spaces in the name. 
    </p>
<p>
        What's going on is that LitWare Deluxe wants to run <code>C:\Program Files\LitWare
        Deluxe\reminder.exe</code>, but due to the spaces, this first gets parsed as 
    </p>
<pre>app = C:\Program
command line=Files\LitWare Deluxe\reminder.exe </pre>
<p>
        This fails, so the system tries again with 
    </p>
<pre>app = C:\Program Files\LitWare
command line=Deluxe\reminder.exe </pre>
<p>
        and this succeeds because you have a folder called <code>C:\Program Files\LitWare</code>.
        Edit the string and add the quotation marks. 
    </p>
<p>
        Note to programmers: This is why it's important to quote your filenames if they contain
        spaces. 
    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>
        Problem 2. A desktop.ini file opens when you log on. 
    </p>
<blockquote>
<p>
        <b>Reason</b>: The System and Hidden attributes for the file <code>desktop.ini</code> in
        the directory 
    </p>
<pre>C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Start Menu\Startup</pre>
<p>
        or 
    </p>
<pre>C:\Documents and Settings\<i>yourname</i>\Start Menu\Startup</pre>
<p>
        have been lost. Alternatively, you went to the advanced Folder Options and disabled
        "Hide protected operating system files (Recommended)". 
    </p>
<p>
        If a file is marked with both the System and Hidden attributes, Explorer will not
        enumerate it, thereby hiding it from the user. If you disable "Hide protected operating
        system files", then this rule is suppressed. 
    </p>
<p>
        When you log on, one of the things that Explorer does is enumerate the contents of
        your Startup folders and runs each file it finds. If the desktop.ini is not marked
        System+Hidden (or you disabled the rule that filters them out), then it will be opened. 
    </p>
<p>
        What is this file for? 
    </p>
<p>
        This file is used to support Windows XP's <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/DrIntl/faqs/MUIFaq.mspx">Multilingual
        User Interface</a>, which allows you to change the language you use to interact with
        Windows, so for example you could say, "I want everything to be in French" and Windows
        will translate all its menus, shortcuts, dialog boxes, <i>etc.</i> into French. Specifically,
        this file instructs Windows how to translate the word "Startup" into French, German,
        Spanish, <i>etc. </i>
    </p>
<p>
        Programmatically, you use the <code><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/functions/shsetlocalizedname.asp">SHSetLocalizedName</a></code> function
        to set the multilingual name for a file or folder. 
    </p>

		<p>Hello,</p>
<p>On my Windows XP machine the two folders that you mentioned:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINEMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USERMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun</p>
<p>are each inside a &#8216;sofware&#8217; folder like so:</p>
<p>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun<br />
HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionRun</p>
<p>Just thought I would mention it in case you have a typo.</p>

		<p>Problem 2 is common with Samba domain controllers &#8211; most configs don&#8217;t preserve the hidden and system bits, as this is a performance hit</p>

		<p>Problem 1 is familiar.  Actually the familiar problem has symptoms that look completely different but the cause is exactly what you described.  Now, can you say why there wasn&#8217;t a patch for PhotoDraw to fix this bug in the keys that PhotoDraw put in the registry?  I know that PhotoDraw is discontinued, but either before or after discontinuing, this would have been such a simple thing to include in an Office 2000 Service Pack.</p>

		<p>A very big thankyou for this tip, it was driving me nuts.  The problem was associated with Kodak photo software.</p>

		<p>Another BIG thank you for the desktop.ini fix. We have XP and samba domain controllers and none of the other &quot;fixes&quot; on the web worked. Yours did!</p>
<p>Thanks again</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
