<p>The story of <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/The-Next-Big-Thing,-The-Best-Interview,--Too-Primitive-for-COBOL.aspx"> <i>The Best</i></a> reminded me of a classmate from school who was inordinately fond of the phrase <i>any intelligent human being</i>. For example, our classmate would say, "Any intelligent human being would do&nbsp;X" or "It's obvious to any intelligent human being that&nbsp;Y." (I often&mdash;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/11/02/251070.aspx">but not always</a>&mdash;consider myself to be an intelligent human being, yet sometimes the things "any intelligent human being" would do were things I personally wouldn't.) On the other hand, you wouldn't hear our classmate use the phrase in sentences like "I cannot comprehend how any intelligent human being would be fooled by&nbsp;Z."</p>
<p> Eventually, one of my friends determined that the phrase <i>any intelligent human being</i> was our classmate's replacement for the first person singular pronoun. By "It is obvious to any intelligent human being that&nbsp;Y," our classmate really meant "It is obvious to <i>me</i> that&nbsp;Y." </p>
<p> Thenceforth, we referred to our classmate as <i>Any Intelligent Human Being</i> (or AIHB for short, and capitalized since it's now a proper noun). Example: "I saw Any Intelligent Human Being in the cafeteria yesterday." </p>

		<p>Such qualifiers as &quot;obviously&quot;, &quot;it goes without saying&quot;, &quot;naturally&quot; etc. always make me perk up my ears to catch the logic error that usually follows.</p>
<p>Intensifying &quot;obvious&quot; with the &quot;to any intelligent human being&quot; just makes it worse. &nbsp;To me this just suggests that the speaker has no real support for the point they&#39;re about to posit, and is relying on brute intimidation tactics.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately I used to use words like &quot;obviously&quot;, but that just got me labeled as intellectually haughty and unintentionally pissed people off. &nbsp;Even if what I was saying was actually obvious, it never pays to use such words.</p>

		<p>@Kyle &#8211; I agree. I occasionally catch myself using these types of phrases and have to correct course. I find that these types of phrases can serve two purposes, to boost the ego of the speaker, or to preemptively lock out and mock any protests against a particular statement. These are not things you want to do if you are seeking an enlightened and open debate.</p>

		<p>I seem to recall, probably from Fowler, not from Gibbon, that one of Gibbon&#39;s favorite gambits was &quot;as any schoolboy knows.&quot; But that probably sounds less impressive when uttered among schoolboys. (Obviously.)</p>

		<p>In #225 of &quot;What is the name of this book?&quot;, Raymond Smullyan records the following explanation of the meaning of the word &quot;obvious&quot; when used by different members of the Princeton mathematics department, although the original explanation used names, not letters.</p>
<p>When Professor A. says something is obvious, it means that if you go home and think about if for a couple of weeks, you will realise that it is true.</p>
<p>When Professor L. says something is obvious, it means that if you go home and think about it for the rest of your life, the day might come when you will see that it is true.</p>
<p>When Professor C. says something is obvious, it means that the class has already known it for the last two weeks.</p>
<p>When Professor F. says something is obvious, it means that it is probably false.</p>

		<p>I can&#39;t stand it when people use this phrase (&quot;any intelligent human being&#8230;&quot;). It such a defensive and negative comment, as it implies that if you don&#39;t agree with what the speaker says next then you are an idiot.</p>

		<p>@Gechurch: It seems to me that the degree of &quot;intellegent&quot; can vary from one to another. It sounds quite reasonable to have his/her defination of &quot;intellegent human being&quot; the same of your defination of &quot;average people&quot; or even &quot;idiot&quot;. :P</p>
<p>Note: When people are using overly subjective arguments, it&#39;s usually vulnerable to attacks from &quot;I have a different perspective&quot; side.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
