<p>While <strike>surfing the Web aimlessly</strike> doing valuable background research, I happened across a page that had a picture of a package of <a href="http://www.ahoj-brause.de/" lang="de"> Ahoj-Brause</a> (pronounced <i>ahoy browse-uh</i>). Seeing that package triggered a bunch of memories.</p>
<p> My <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/18/55006.aspx"> emergency vacation</a> from several years ago included a visit to a friend spending the year at Uppsala University in Sweden. The following year, he invited one of his classmates (a student from Germany) to the United States to join his family for the Christmas holiday season. </p>
<p> She brought with her some small gifts, among them a package of <span lang="de">Ahoj-Brause</span>. On its own, <span lang="de">Ahoj-Brause</span> is just a drink mix powder, but those in the know consume it by <a href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Souvenir-Potpourri-Surprise!.aspx"> dumping the contents of a packet into your mouth, then adding a shot of vodka</a>. </p>
<p> (When written by hand, it looks like <span lang="de">Ahoj-Bra&#365;se</span> with a breve over the u. That's a trait of German handwriting: A breve is written over the u so that it isn't confused with a handwritten n. Compare putting a slash through a 0 or a crossbar through a 7 to avoid confusion with O and 1, respectively.) </p>
<p> During her visit, I got to practice some German, telling her the story of <a href="http://jobsblog.com/blog/raymond-chen/"> Bill Gates and the hotel next door</a>. Her conclusion was that my German was fairly good, and with one month's immersion, I could become fluent. Unfortunately, it's not practical for me to spend a month in Germany just to bring my German skills from "fairly good" to "fluent". For one thing, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/10/02/9902148.aspx"> my wife would be pretty annoyed</a>. (And this is completely setting aside the question of "Why would you devote an entire month of your life to becoming fluent in German? If you're going to devote an entire month of your life to becoming fluent in another language, shouldn't it be Chinese?") </p>
<p> Man, that's a lot of digressions before getting the story I actually wanted to tell. </p>
<p> My friend's classmate wanted to head into downtown Seattle to do touristy things, so she was taken to the neighborhood bus stop and given instructions on which bus number to take and where to get off in downtown. That part of the plan worked great. The part that didn't work so great was returning home. </p>
<p> When you're unfamiliar with an area, traveling a road in the opposite direction doesn't quite trigger the memory cells. My friend's classmate got on the return bus, but couldn't quite remember where to get off to get back home. She got off somewhere close, but the houses didn't look familiar. "Okay, now I'm lost. What do I do?" She had my friend's address and phone number, but she didn't have a mobile phone or a map of the residential neighborhood. </p>
<p> She walked down the street and saw a house with the sign <i lang="es">Mi casa es tu casa</i> hanging by the front door. She considered this an indication that the people in the house were friendly and welcoming, so she knocked on the door. She was okay with the possibility that the people in the house spoke only Spanish, because she had been learning Spanish in anticipation of studying there the following semester. (For those who are keeping score, this means that my friend's classmate speaks at a minimum German, Swedish, English, and Spanish.) </p>
<p> The assumption that they spoke Spanish was correct. (They also spoke English.) The assumption that the family was friendly and helpful also held up. What she didn't expect was that <i>they spoke German, too!</i> Apparently, the family spent a few years in Germany because the father was assigned there by his work. </p>
<p> It so happens that she was only two blocks or so from my friend's home; the hard part of course is knowing which two blocks to go. </p>
<p> The family was so enamored of their unexpected German-and-English-and-Spanish-speaking visitor that they invited her to stay for dinner, but she had to decline due to other plans for the evening. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: When my friend sent back some photos from Uppsala, he didn't include any description with the photos, so I made up my own narrative. I had to make up names for all the people in the photos, and Astrid was the name I chose for the subject of today's story. She liked the name so much that she adopted it as a secret nickname. </p>

		<p>And yes, the Ahoj shots were actually very popular when I was in my twenties. One time we took an empty package, filled it with dry salad seasoning and gave it to a friend for the shot&#8230; hilarious, though he was not particularly amused.</p>

		<p>Er, I didn&#39;t quite understood the part about learning Chinese instead of German. Is it because China and Germany are on the opposite ends of the continent? (One in the far west and one in the far east?) Or is it because Microsoft has a language input lab in China?</p>

		<p>So I&#39;m Austrian and not German (still know enough Germans, my father for one..) and I&#39;ve never seen anyone write a breve over the u &#8211; if I&#39;d have to guess I&#39;d say Scandinavian custom. The 1 and 7 on the other hand is indeed very common, always leads to confusions on the other side of the ocean, by now I actually have taught myself to write the American way.</p>
<p>Ahem anyhow: Great story! It&#39;s always fun to unexpectedly run into people who speak the same language in a foreign country. I remember the one time I walked into a store in southern New Mexico and it turned out the shopkeeper&#39;s mother was German and had taught her a bit when she was a kid.</p>

		<p>In Sütterlinschrift, the script that was common in Germany at the beginning of the last century, the lower case letters u and n are actually identical, except for the breve, which distinguishes them and is therefore necessary for legibility. Many people who grew up writing Sütterlin (the *** banned it, because they mistakenly thought it was Jewish) kept the habit of putting an accent on the u even when writing Latin Script, where the letters n and u are clearly distinguishable. It appears that Raymond met some people who wrote or read Sütterlin.</p>

		<p>Whoops, I didn&#39;t expect to be bowdlerized! What I meant to say is that a number of type faces and even styles of handwritings were bannend in 1941 by people who had little knowledge of German culture.</p>

		<p>@Martin And there I thought you were censoring yourself for unexplained reasons! Surprising what gets filtered.</p>
<p>Thanks for the explanation, really interesting. So at least to some degree an age thing &#8211; probably also a bit locality. Sütterlin/Kurrentschrift do use the breve, Frakturschrift (the one I&#39;m used to when talking about &quot;old script&quot;) on the other hand doesn&#39;t. </p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
