		<p>I&#8217;ve seen those before, in English.  My bet is your Dutch version probably said something along the line that &quot;had you had a popup blocker, you wouldn&#8217;t see this popup message&quot; :)</p>

		<p>A friend received a spam e-mail a little while ago advertising a spam blocker, which he then bought!</p>

		<p>So Raymond, have you played with crazybrowser? It should protect you from further doses of irony.</p>

		<p>I once got a spam mail advertising &quot;The powerful, effective and intelligent anti-spam tool.&quot; I had blogged about it here: <a target="_new" href="http://www.vasanthdharmaraj.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=69e1b942-51ce-4bc7-8a1a-4319520b9a45" rel="nofollow">http://www.vasanthdharmaraj.com/PermaLink.aspx?guid=69e1b942-51ce-4bc7-8a1a-4319520b9a45</a></p>

		<p>A few weeks ago there were reports in newspapers about a US court ruling, saying that a US operator who was sending spam pop-ups advertising their spam pop-up blocker for sale would be allowed to resume doing so.</p>
<p>&gt; There&#8217;s something wrong about that.</p>
<p>Ditto.</p>

		<p>For tabbed IE browsing (with popup blocker of course), I prefer AvantBrowser: <a target="_new" href="http://www.avantbrowser.com/faq.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.avantbrowser.com/faq.html</a></p>
<p>It appears a little more polished than CrazyBrowser and has some neat features, like hiding to tray, open in background, disable Flash, etc. Of course, this is IMHO&#8230; both are good, your opinions may vary.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t really think it&#8217;s such a bad idea.<br />
<br />This way, people who actually need the blocker<br />
<br />will get the message, in well, pop-up form.<br />
<br />People who are already using a blocker wouldn&#8217;t know it&#8217;s there.</p>
<p>There is some irony to that but not totally irrational.</p>

		<p>I also have seen this before and I find it genious :) It is:<br />
<br />1. 100% targeted ad &#8211; if you have blocker, you will not see it;<br />
<br />2. get clients from competitors &#8211; if you have blocker and see it, you need another one;<br />
<br />3. makes their users &#8211; if you have forgot about popups, it reminds you what it is :)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
