<p>
I'm going to spend the next few weeks developing a Little Program
in several parts.
This is a program I wrote for my nieces,
who always wanted to play with my laptop
(instead of playing with <i>me</i>).
</p>
<p>
Initially, I fired up Notepad and maximized it,
and cranked the font size,
but that became cumbersome, because I had to reset
the font size and Word Wrap setting when they were done.
On top of that, my eldest niece complained that some
of the the letters were "wrong":
The shape of the capital J in the font that I use
does not match the shape of the capital J that my niece
was taught.
(The top serif didn't match.)
</p>
<p>
Having to change the font and then reset it was enough
to make me decide to write my own program for my nieces
to play with.
I started with
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
the scratch program</a>
and made these changes:
</p>
<pre>
<font COLOR=blue>HFONT g_hfEdit;

#define MARGIN 20</font>

void
OnSize(HWND hwnd, UINT state, int cx, int cy)
{
  if (g_hwndChild) {
    MoveWindow(g_hwndChild,
               <font COLOR=blue>MARGIN</font>, <font COLOR=blue>MARGIN</font>,
               cx <font COLOR=blue>- 2 * MARGIN</font>,
               cy <font COLOR=blue>- 2 * MARGIN</font>, TRUE);
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
The <code>MARGIN</code> puts a little space around the edit control
so it doesn't jam up against the edges of the screen.
</p>
<pre>
void
On<font COLOR=blue>Nc</font>Destroy(HWND hwnd)
{
    <font COLOR=blue>if (g_hfEdit) DeleteObject(g_hfEdit);</font>
    PostQuitMessage(0);
}

    // <font COLOR=red><strike>HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_DESTROY, OnDestroy);</strike></font>
    <font COLOR=blue>HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_NCDESTROY, OnNcDestroy);</font>
</pre>
<p>
The cleanup of the font is done in the
<code>WM_<wbr>NC&shy;DESTROY</code> handler
because that runs
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/07/26/443384.aspx">
after the child windows have been destroyed</a>.
That way, we don't destroy a font while the edit
control is still using it.
</p>
<pre>
BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
  <font COLOR=blue>g_hfEdit = CreateFont(-72, 0, 0, 0, FW_NORMAL,
                        FALSE, FALSE, FALSE, DEFAULT_CHARSET,
                        OUT_DEFAULT_PRECIS,
                        CLIP_DEFAULT_PRECIS,
                        DEFAULT_QUALITY,
                        DEFAULT_PITCH,
                        TEXT("Miriam"));
  if (!g_hfEdit) return FALSE;

  g_hwndChild = CreateWindow(
      TEXT("edit"),                   /* Class Name */
      NULL,                           /* Title */
      WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE |
      ES_UPPERCASE | ES_MULTILINE,    /* Style */
      0, 0, 0, 0,                     /* Position and size */
      hwnd,                           /* Parent */
      NULL,                           /* No menu */
      g_hinst,                        /* Instance */
      0);                             /* No special parameters */
  if (!g_hwndChild) return FALSE;

  SetWindowFont(g_hwndChild, g_hfEdit, TRUE);</font>
  return TRUE;
}
</pre>
<p>
When our main window is created,
we create our helper edit control.
It is a multi-line edit control
without any scroll bars
that forces its contents to uppercase,
since they haven't learned lowercase letters yet.
</p>
<p>
My program doesn't do any painting, so I deleted the
<code>WM_<wbr>PAINT</code>
and
<code>WM_<wbr>PRINT&shy;CLIENT</code> handlers.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand,
it needs to transfer focus to the edit control,
so that switching to the application puts you in typing mode
immediately:
</p>
<pre>
<font COLOR=blue>void OnSetFocus(HWND hwnd, HWND hwndOldFocus)
{
  if (g_hwndChild) {
    SetFocus(g_hwndChild);
  }
}
    HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_SETFOCUS, OnSetFocus);</font>
</pre>
<p>
Finally, I create the window as a fullscreen popup,
so that all my nieces get is a clean screen with no
window chrome.
(I was using the new Microsoft design language before it was cool.)
</p>
<pre>
    hwnd = CreateWindow(
        TEXT("Scratch"),                /* Class Name */
        <font COLOR=blue>TEXT("ABC"),                    /* Title */
        <a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/05/05/414910.aspx">WS_POPUP</a>,                       /* Style */
        0, 0,                           /* Position */
        GetSystemMetrics(SM_CXSCREEN),
        GetSystemMetrics(SM_CYSCREEN),</font>  /* Size */
        NULL,                           /* Parent */
        NULL,                           /* No menu */
        hinst,                          /* Instance */
        0);                             /* No special parameters */
</pre>
<p>
And there we have it.
A simple program with an edit control
that my nieces can use for typing.
</p>
<p>
They call this program
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/08/25/10053862.aspx">
<i>ABC</i></a>.
Now when I go over to their house,
they ask,
"Can I play ABC?"
</p>
<p>
This program served well for a first pass,
but my nieces naturally discovered problems with it.
We'll look at them in future weeks.
</p>
<p>
Remember, since this is a Little Program,
I'm skipping a lot of error checking,
and I'm assuming that the system has only one monitor
(because it runs on my laptop).</p>

		<p>Thanks for reminding me just how much fun a small child can have with Microsoft Word. &nbsp;I remember literal squeals of laughter when my son figured out how to change the font size on his own. &nbsp;For several days, nothing was more hilarious that 3 point font followed by 300 point font.</p>

		<p>&quot;The account is not an administrator, and the nieces are actually quite good at following instructions.&quot;</p>
<p>I get that the concerns of security, unsupervised use of your account, etc. are overblown, and of no concern.</p>
<p>Yet, this is still a great illustration of the &quot;hammer/nail&quot; metaphor.</p>
<p>Our own kids loved using Notepad as an intro to the computer too. And yes, to suit their needs we had to change the font face and size. I could have written a whole new program for them to address that need. But as the _parent_ of said kids, I didn&#39;t exactly have a lot of spare time to waste on a project like that (granted, uncles without their own children have more time to spend on such things :) ).</p>
<p>But giving each kid their own individual account fixed the problem in a matter of minutes, no coding required.</p>
<p>I submit that as a programmer, one&#39;s first inclination might be to always write a program to solve a problem. But that&#39;s not always the best or most efficient way to do so!</p>

		<p>@pete.d &#8211; I would say you&#39;re reading too much into this. I assume that Raymond, as a very competent programmer, felt that this was a super-simple task. He could make a program that does exactly what he needs and less room to accidentally mess things up with unwanted features. He probably also thought that it would make a very simple example problem for this blog. Kill two birds with one stone, so to speak.</p>

		<p>Not related to this post, but related to your niece: an old post mentioned she came up with the girl&#39;s name Alula. &nbsp;Turns out the alula is a part of some birds&#39; wings, analogous to the slats of an airplane&#39;s wings. &nbsp;Not sure if that&#39;s where she got the name from, but it isn&#39;t a nonsense word.</p>

<p>Ah, that brings back memories of the Oscar the Grouch program that someone wrote for the Macintosh many years ago. &nbsp;Oscar would pop out and sing a little song when you dumped files in the trash, and then a different one (if I recall correctly), when you emptied the Trash.</p>
<p>More than one parent paid the price for amusing their two or three year old by installing the program when, in their absence, the child proved his or her observational skills and made Oscar sing with no adult intervention at all&#8230;</p>

		<p>@John Doe: Absolutely every single one of the things in that comic is something that is (effectively) per-account or can be configured to be. All the major desktop OSes have facilities for keeping accounts quite firmly separate, that being the entire damn POINT of user accounts.</p>

		<p>I assume you were using the font Verdana, as you mentioned the shape of the capital J didn&#39;t match what your niece had been taught.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;Finally, I create the window as a fullscreen popup, so that all my nieces get is a clean screen with no window chrome. (I was using the new Microsoft design language before it was cool.)&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>That&#39;s really nice shop-talking stuff. I think it was in the &quot;What&#39;s new&quot; section coming with Visual Studio 2012 where I read it, or somewhere else along these lines. For what it is worth, I did give VS 2012 a serious try, but reverted to VS 2010 not before long as there was just a little too much contents, and no chrome left at all as far as I am concerned.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
