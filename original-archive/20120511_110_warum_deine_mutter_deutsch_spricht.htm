This upcoming Sunday is
Mother's Day in the United States.
In recognition of the holiday last year,
a local church displayed the following message on its message board:
"God couldn't be / everywhere / so God made mothers / German speaking."
</p>
<p>
This explains why your mother speaks German.

<p>
The church in question has an evening German-language service,
and the advertisement for that service juxtaposed against the
Jewish proverb produced an unexpected result.</p>

		<p>So, &quot;GOD COULDN&#39;T BE EVERYWHERE&quot; is a Jewish Proverb?</p>
<p>That explains the Golden Calf, I think.</p>

		<p>@Anonymous: That was always my perception as well, until someone pointed out to me that the Bible mentions places where God is not. But that was a long time ago, so I will leave it as an exercise to find the relevant passages. Personally, I like to stick with my original perception.</p>

		<p>@Random User 2389547</p>
<p>The Bible doesn&#39;t support the idea of God being everywhere. Take a look at 1 Kings 8:43, Matthew 6:9, and Hebrews 9:24.</p>

		<p>@Random User 2389547: True, but even so omnipresence is part of central doctrine in most mainstream faiths. But in my experience arguing such things isn&#39;t very effective, since there are several good roads open to a seasoned apologist. For example, plugging his ears while chanting la-la-la, or simply deciding on the spot that an omnipresent god isn&#39;t *his* True God, or explaining that those verses aren&#39;t to be taken literally, or the plain old ‘some things we just weren&#39;t meant to understand, son’.</p>

		<p>While I&#39;m not at all religious, this church often has very creative signs that I can appreciate. Last night it was: prayer &#8211; wireless access to god with no roaming fees.</p>

		<p>God not everywhere: as mentioned by several people: bible does seem to make references to heaven being where God dwells, Jesus being in God&#39;s presence etc. That said if God is omnipresent than heaven would also be his dwelling place, going there would be in the presence of God. Doesn&#39;t explicitly say that going somewhere to be in God&#39;s presence means you weren&#39;t already. A lot of traditions get added on from outside of the bible though. My guess: christians trying to sell their God over roman gods started saying &quot;my God is bigger than yours&quot; sort of like children on a playground arguing about who&#39;s father can beat up the others.</p>

		<p>A the location of a former employer, I walked up to another white man and, shaking his hand with a smirk on my face, said to him, &quot;Hello, Uncle Tom.&quot; &nbsp;Several black people that overheard, but did not necessarily see, the exchange became instantly offended. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Little did they know that just three days ago my mom married his brother and had gone off to the Bahamas for their honeymoon.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
