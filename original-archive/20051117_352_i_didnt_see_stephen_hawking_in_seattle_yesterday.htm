<p>I didn't see the Stephen Hawking lecture in Seattle yesterday, but then again, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/artsentertainment/2002627474_webhawking16.html"> nobody did</a>. I did see him when he came to town back in 1993 and again in 1996. I think it was during the 1996 appearance, after his presentation on  <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imaginary_time"> imaginary time</a> was complete and the floor opened to questions, the first person to the microphone asked, "Hello, Dr.&nbsp;Hawking, my name is ABC, and I'm an oneironaut. That means that I travel through space by means of dreams. I was wondering if your imaginary time has any connection to my ability to travel in this manner."</p>
<p> The sound of a thousand people rolling their eyes filled the room. "We have in our presence what many people consider to be the smartest living human being, we have time to ask him three questions, and one of them is this one!?" </p>
<p> We waited patiently for Dr.&nbsp;Hawking's response, which was basically, "No, I don't think so." </p>

		<p>Reminds me of when Homer reaches the top of the mountain and says, &quot;Are you really the president of QuickieMart?&quot;<br />
<br />&quot;Yes&quot;<br />
<br />&quot;Really?&quot;<br />
<br />&quot;Yes&quot;<br />

<br />&quot;Yes. Thank you, please come again.&quot;</p>

		<p>If you live in Cambridge (the real one not the recent imposter) then he is well known for being out and about in pedestrian areas.  One of my friends has had his foot rolled over, twice.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve also seen Stephen Hawking speak (in Cambridge), and can attest that he gets asked pointless/trite/kooky questions fairly regularly.</p>
<p>What makes this really annoying is that he takes a very long time to answer each question. Literally 5 minutes of silence while he works his speech synth to build the reply. So it&#8217;s not as though he can quickly blow off the goofy questions and move on.</p>

		<p>Some short-cuts for Dr. Hawking:</p>
<p>F1 &#8211; No, I don&#8217;t think so.<br />
<br />F2 &#8211; Hell no!<br />
<br />F3 &#8211; &lt;Beep&gt; &lt;Beep&gt;<br />
<br />F4 &#8211; For the last time, I don&#8217;t know if Commander Data is a good poker player!<br /></p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t typically read your blog, but I happened by and saw this post.  I was only a young lad, but I was there!  I remember that question, and I also rolled my eyes!</p>

		<p>Given the time it takes Dr Hawking to reply wouldn&#8217;t it have been quicker if you had just beaten the idiot to death with his own shoes and just moved on the the next question? I&#8217;m sure Dr Hawking would have been more than happy to move on. The side effect on the gene pool of the Pacific NW would also be beneficial.</p>

		<p>at the very least, there&#8217;s a certain amount of entertainment to be had from people like this. i mean, this anecdote itself made my hour!</p>

		<p>Here&#8217;s an anecdote for you. Stephen is often around in the brand-new Center for Mathematical Sciences in Cambridge (UK), eats lunch/talks with students and faculty regularly. While I was visiting for a conference a couple of years ago, I really needed to use the bathroom.</p>
<p>So I go to the toilets, which are in the basement next to the lecture theaters. But a lecture has just finished and there are only two stalls available. I&#8217;m really desperate, so I use the disabled bathroom next door&#8230;. When I come out, who do I see but old Stephen? He didn&#8217;t seem too happy!</p>
<p>Before I get flamed please realize that he was the only disabled guy around, the chance of this happening was low, and I REALLY REALLY had to go.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also heard interesting stories about him getting &#8216;pennied&#8217; at Gonville and Caius formal hall &#8211; a undergraduate Cambridge tradition where you &quot;have&quot; to down your wine glass when someone puts a penny in it.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
