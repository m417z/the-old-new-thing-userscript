A long time ago in a processor architecture far, far away,
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150727-00/?p=90821#comment-1222171">
mikeb</a> commented,
"the help file for the Debugging Tools for Windows package has
(or maybe "had")
really, really good Itanium information
in the Debugging Techniques/Processor Architecture section."
</p>
<p>
I'll take that as a compliment,
because I'm the author of that part of the documentation.
</p>
<p>
The story begins with
a "Bluffer's Guide to the Alpha AXP Processor"
document that I wrote as a way to capture the information
I learned from reading the processor manual.
That document led to a little side gig doing
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20140610-00/?p=773">
brownbags</a>
for teams interested in bringing their developers up to speed
on this Alpha AXP processor thing.
The recently-completed Alpha AXP series was an expansion of that
original document.
</p>
<p>
When the Itanium project started up,
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130401-00/?p=4793#comment-1048433"
>Richard Bond</a>
taught me the rudimentary elements of Itanium assembly language.
As I recall, it happened only by chance:
The two of us happened
to be in the same meeting room at the same time,
and there was some time to spare.
</p>
<p>
Armed with a very basic understanding of the Itanium,
I dove into the official documentation from Intel and
emerged with a corresponding
"Bluffer's Guide to the Itanium Processor" document.
That document served as the basis for the Itanium section
in the Debugging Tools for Windows package,
and the Itanium series from 2015 was an expansion upon
that document.
</p>
<p>
With two new processor architectures under my belt,
I developed a reputation for being
"the guy who knows all about these exotic processors."
(Where "exotic" has the rather parochial definition of
"anything that isn't x86 or x86-64".)
When Windows 8 was ported to ARM, people just assumed that
I knew ARM assembly language too.
</p>
<p>
I didn't, but I found the documentation and
taught myself.
Once you know a few processors,
adding another one to your repertoire isn't that hard,
assuming it's similar to one you already know.&sup1;
</p>
<p>
So at this point, I may as well try to live up to
my reputation.
I have written up
series for the other two defunct processors that were
at one point officially supported by Windows NT:
The MIPS and the PowerPC.
They'll show up someday.
</p>
<p>
&sup1;
This is also why I stick to Germanic languages:
Once you know English, German, and Swedish,
adding Norwegian to the collection isn't so hard.</p>

		<p>Might as well go for a completist reputation and do a guide for the i860 too (even though it doesn&#8217;t fall into the &#8220;at one point officially supported by Windows NT&#8221; category).</p>

		<p>If you understand Itanium (or even if you just read Raymond&#8217;s series on it), the i860 will be VERY familiar. Itanium was very obviously just an extension/evolution of i860; they&#8217;re both VLIW, but the Itanium has massively more and larger registers, and of course the i860 has no concept of bundles. The assembler mnemonics are different, but should be fairly familiar once you figure out the mapping.</p>

		<p>Interesting. I&#8217;d forgotten (if in fact I ever knew) that the i860 had adopted the VLIW model until I read the i860 Wikipedia article just before making my first comment on this blog post. As it turns out, I was a grad student in the Yale CS Dept. at the time the VLIW concepts were being invented, and although I wasn&#8217;t personally involved in the project, several of my friends were, and I worked briefly at Multiflow, a company founded to productize the hardware and software concepts. Alas (or maybe all for the best), the x86 steamroller was unstoppable.</p>
<p>And while we treading down memory lane and &#8220;unique&#8221; architectures, how about the Intel 432? :-)</p>

		<p>I enjoy these delves into the assembly of other processor architectures. </p>
<p>Since you have experience with several different processors, I&#8217;m curious: Are there any features from the other architectures that you&#8217;d like to see in x86/x64? Perhaps the &#8220;always in 64-bit mode&#8221; of the Alpha would remove a whole bunch of headaches from the boot process. The register rotation of the Itanium looks useful (as does the raw quantity!), but I&#8217;m not sure how frequently it would be used.</p>

		<p>I take this opportunity for a very &#8220;flattering&#8221; comment which sadly just turned out like this because reality sucks so hard.<br />
I wish I&#8217;d ever meet a developer like Raymond IRL, capable of teaching himself, doing documentation how it should be and apparently also coding (at least half) sanely. Even if he&#8217;d have the temperament of a thermonuclear device. Better than an idiot screaming at you just because he doesn&#8217;t understand you&#8217;re doing things with a healthy human mind. Meeting only clodcoders over the last ten years here in Germany made me lose interest in the computer industry.</p>

		<p>I hear you on that.  I do code review for H1Bs.  You can correct the same mistake a hundred times and they&#8217;ll just keep making it.  Teaching them to code is like teaching a dog how to read, a complete and utter farce that only continues because management is insulated from the chaos.</p>

		<p>Back when the NT version for PowerPC was under development I was working on the build team for Systems Management Server and was tasked with finding out why the MFC based UI would not work. After some assembly level debugging I found that a register was set according to whether you were in the users exe or the MFC dll and that mechanism didn&#8217;t work when you had tables with pointers to functions to call in the exe that were processed by the code in the DLL as the register was set for the DLL. I didn&#8217;t know PPC assembly language but as you say if you know one processor you can figure out another.</p>

		<p>Speaking of x86-64, I get confused with the naming because the 64-bit architecture is called AMD64 (in the bootup entries inside the Event Log, and in any dump files, for example), on both my Intel and my AMD machines.  </p>
<p>I finally figured out that AMD64 is probably just the name of the architecture.</p>

		<p>&gt; Speaking of x86-64, I get confused with the naming because the 64-bit architecture is called AMD64 on both my Intel and my AMD machines.</p>
<p>Some history to explain this:</p>
<p>Intel invented the 32-bit x86 architecture.  So it&#8217;s often called the i386 architecture after the Intel 80386 chip that introduced it.  Or it&#8217;s called the i586 architecture if you&#8217;re using some of the newer instructions that were introduced in the Intel Pentium chip.  AMD and others produced clones of the 386 and 486 chips, and developed chips that could run i586 code.  But those Intel-centric names are often used by software developers even though the software runs on chips from AMD and others as well as chips from Intel.</p>
<p>Then Intel invented a new 64-bit architecture for Itanium, called IA64 (Intel Architecture 64-bit).</p>
<p>Then AMD invented the 64-bit x86-64 architecture.  Since it was only in use by AMD, this was called the AMD64 architecture to distinguish it from Intel&#8217;s 64-bit Itanium architecture.</p>
<p>Then Intel decided to copy the AMD64 architecture but rename it to x86-64.  Many software developers decided to continue calling the architecture AMD64 even though the software now runs on chips from Intel as well as chips from AMD.  Many people considered it fair that the AMD64 architecture has an AMD-centric name &#8211; after all, the architecture was invented by AMD, and the i386 architecture that was invented by Intel had an Intel-centric name.  Of course, Intel doesn&#8217;t ever use the name AMD64, they use x86-64 and encourage software developers to use that name too,</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
