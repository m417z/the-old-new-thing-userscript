<p>
Many years ago,
one of my colleagues interviewed a candidate for a position in his group.
The candidate worked with the data generated by a grocery store's
<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loyalty_program">customer
loyalty cards</a>.
(Today, we would use the buzzword <i>Big Data</i>,
but back then, it was just another thing.)
</p>
<p>
Most customer loyalty programs allow you to enter your phone number
at the register to identify your account, in case you forget your
card (or simply don't feel like carrying it around with you everywhere).
Many Microsoft employees use
the phone number of the main Microsoft switchboard.
We treat it as a community account.
Everybody gets their discount,
and once in a while, somebody randomly wins a discount prize
when the number of points reaches whatever target level is
currently set by the program.
</p>
<p>
The candidate said that these massively shared accounts
are easy to detect and filter out from their data analysis.
What messes up their data analysis is when two people with
different lifestyles swap cards.
The system sees that somebody who used to buy yogurt and
bulk brewer's yeast
is now buying potato chips and frozen pizzas,
and it can't figure out what is going on.</p>

		<p>Wegmans is a Rochester thing. We&#8217;re just nice enough to share it around other parts of the Eastern US. Kind of like how Buffalo shares its (generally) poor-performing major sports teams with us.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s a good point to raise.  So I&#8217;ll try to answer it. (Ex-contractor to Bing here.)</p>
<p>We&#8217;ll have to narrow down &#8220;big data analysis&#8221; to &#8220;collecting and analysing a large number of data points about a single individual,&#8221; which I suspect is the variety you propose to frustrate.  A billion data points on cancer research? I&#8217;m assuming you&#8217;re OK with that.</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;re looking at Big Data as a surveillance technique here.  If you worry about these things, you&#8217;re probably more worried about Big Government at the top level of danger, or maybe Facebook/Bing/Google at the next level, but in all honesty I can&#8217;t see why you&#8217;d want to frustrate Safeway. (Frankly I&#8217;m not that worried about the top two levels, but this is a personal view.)</p>
<p>If you frustrate Safeway Big Data analysis, all that happens from your immediate point of view is that you don&#8217;t get a 50&cent; coupon off your next purchase of Folger&#8217;s, because Big Data said you don&#8217;t need to be encouraged to buy Folgers, you need to be encouraged to buy a pair of Jimmy Choos. (Or whatever.)  It isn&#8217;t obvious how this helps you.  Or, indeed, frustrates Safeway, although they might have to discount that pair of Jimmy Choos in order to sell it to somebody else.</p>
<p>And from the general Safeway point of view, all that happens is that they restock things they won&#8217;t sell as fast as they thought they would, and understock things that people actually want to buy.</p>
<p>Saying Boo to the Man might make you feel good, but I wouldn&#8217;t take it to absurd levels, really.</p>

		<p>I went out of my way with loyalty cards to &#8220;frustrate big data&#8221;. What I actually did was ensure a few swaps shortly after creating them and then kept using the same one for years and years. Actual objective: disconnect the card number from my name and phone number.</p>

<p>Though the minute you use a credit card to pay for a checkout linked to that card I assume they correlate the event and tag your loyalty account with the name from that credit card.</p>

		<p>&#8220;A billion data points on cancer research? Iâm assuming youâre OK with that.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure whether I&#8217;d be OK with that.  It depends a lot on how the data was collected, how it&#8217;s used, how it&#8217;s protected, whether it links cancer data to individuals or other PII.  But I&#8217;ll focus on the points you do raise.</p>
<p>&#8220;I think weâre looking at Big Data as a surveillance technique here. If you worry about these things, youâre probably more worried about Big Government at the top level of danger, or maybe Facebook/Bing/Google at the next level, but in all honesty I canât see why youâd want to frustrate Safeway.&#8221;</p>
<p>The third-party doctrine essentially makes the business records of corporations easily accessible to government, often without warrants or notification, as in the government collection of cellphone call metadata.  If you are concerned about government surveillance, you should be worried about letting your grocer keep track of how many coffee filters and Sudafed you buy.  Or whether your tastes lean toward Middle Eastern cuisine.</p>
<p>Of course, this will be sold to us as a feature rather than a bug.  For example, if your grocer knows you bought some bad eggs, they can notify you directly about the recall.  But having the grocers do this kind of notification can be expensive and inefficient, so we&#8217;ll just have the grocers share your purchase records with the government and have the government do the notifications instead.  Don&#8217;t you feel safer already?</p>
<p>&#8220;And from the general Safeway point of view, all that happens is that they restock things they wonât sell as fast as they thought they would, and understock things that people actually want to buy.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure inventory management can be done based on aggregate sales that don&#8217;t require linking specific purchases back to individuals.  You can even analyze which types of products are bought at the same time without privacy implications.  I see no need to enable mass surveillance, profiling, and price discrimination to ensure that there will be enough coconut-flavored gelato in the freezer aisle.</p>
<p>Frustrating big data analysis at all levels is the duty of all citizens.</p>

		<p>One can imagine an environment in which &#8220;all citizens&#8221; have a duty of some sort.  My perspective (and you are free to disagree) is that such a duty, as applied to nebulous things like &#8220;big data,&#8221; is only really asserted by various groups in the USA.  Which is fine and all, but the USA is actually <i>less</i> in danger of Big Government intrusion than, say, China, Iran, or even my favorite foreign government (France) or my own (the UK).</p>
<p>Now, given ten really important things to worry about, which one would you pick? Quick! If you answer &#8220;Big Data perverted to government usage,&#8221; then I wish you well, and make sure you look out for the black helicopters hovering overhead at midnight.</p>
<p>Not that it&#8217;s relevant, because my main point was &#8212; you can feel free to check this out by actually reading what I said &#8212; <i>there are categories here</i>.</p>
<p>Big Data a la Safeway is only a threat to paranoid nutters.</p>

		<p>Honesty compels me to admit, however, that your concerns have forced me to check out the threats you suggest.  And, do you know what? You are right, and I am wrong.</p>
<p>Apparently, Safeway has acquired <b>twenty three</b> helicopters. (I hope they used Big Data coupons to save money.)  Devious fellows, these Safeway guys: not only do they claim that the helicopters are used purely for the purpose of ferrying executives around, but they&#8217;ve also colored them bright pink, just to confuse Big Data algorithms that assume all such menaces are colored black.</p>
<p>Now, you have to forgive me.  The IRS have just driven up outside my house in a couple of Humvees.</p>
<p>Why they chose pink Humvees is a mystery to me.  Perhaps this is a sign of Collusion With Safeway Big Data?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll get back to you on that one.</p>

		<p>Name calling (e.g., &#8220;paranoid nutter&#8221;) isn&#8217;t consistent with the Ground Rules Raymond instituted for comments on his blog.  Also, naming specific brands (e.g., Safeway), especially in a negative light, is frowned upon here, which is why I didn&#8217;t include links for the events I referenced.</p>
<p>I did not write about conspiracy theories.  I referenced a few of the bad side-effects that actually have occurred as a result of massive collection of personal information and from drawing inferences from those database, both by private corporations and by the government in collaboration with those private corporations.</p>
<p>The social norms of how acceptable big data collection and analysis has become have transformed substantially in an astoundingly short period of time, partially because the folks asking questions about the ethics of it are dismissed as &#8220;paranoid nutters.&#8221;  Just a couple decades ago, more than half of all residential telephone customers in my state paid a monthly fee to be kept out of the phone book.  (Clearly they were all nutters!)  And the phone companies had to get your explicit permission to look at your calling history (also known as their business records) in order to see if they had a plan that could save you money.  And Congress passed a bill to protect our video rental histories.  And a bookstore famously went to court to resist a federal subpoena requiring the purchase record of a single customer.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not talking about black helicopters.  I&#8217;m talking about monitoring of private communications by the government that bypass the usual checks and balances&#8211;possible we gave the government the right to claim business records without a proper warrant and judicial review.  I&#8217;m talking about destructive drug-enforcement raids of private homes based on nothing more than high electricity bills and the time of day your put your trash bins at the curb for collection.  I&#8217;m also talking about corporations and the government (often unintentionally) discriminating against groups of people under the guise of statistical algorithms that rely on purchase histories and credit scores among other inputs.</p>
<p>Yes, this is in my top 10 list of things to worry about.  If it&#8217;s not in yours, fine&#8211;we can have different priorities.  But calling me as a &#8220;paranoid nutter&#8221; is uncalled for and inappropriate for this forum.</p>

		<p>They shouldn&#8217;t be reliant on loyalty card data to predict stock, that prediction should be tied to the registers/barcode/inventory system. That won&#8217;t help if management screws up though, a local store in a national chain (that has a loyalty card and coupons) here constantly run out of stock of heir own branded things and have been doing so for a few years now.</p>

		<p>Realistically, isn&#8217;t the only outcome of &#8220;frustrating&#8221; big data that you just get more poorly targeted ads?  Yay you.  The volume of ads you receive probably will remain unaffected.  Nor are you likely to make the analysis become systematically ineffective, what with a probably small number of bad data lost as noise in the ocean of big data.</p>

		<p>Along the lines of &#8220;frustrating Big Data&#8221; (how an amorphous concept can become frustreated is another matter), I remember a time when I was regularly asked for me Zip code at retail checkout lanes.  This wasn&#8217;t to verify my credit card info, as I still sometimes see when I (very infrequently) stop for gas.  This was an attempt on the part of the stores to gather demographic information.  If the checkout clerk didn&#8217;t take my polite &#8220;no, thanks&#8221;, then I answered &#8220;90210&#8221;.  Either they got the hint and hit the &#8220;decline&#8221; button, or they dutifully entered that Zip code into the system; either way, they&#8217;re not getting my Zip code.  It was completely unnecessary to complete the transaction.  And no, I didn&#8217;t have the loyalty cards at the time.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the only time that I find myself in the checkout lane is for the weekly grocery shopping trip, and I do have the store&#8217;s loyalty card.  I&#8217;m sure that I gave them some information when I signed up for it, but I don&#8217;t remember what they asked for on the form.  I&#8217;m far less concerned with that stuff now.</p>

		<p>You can use Jenny&#8217;s phone number if you don&#8217;t have a loyalty card:<br />
&#8220;your local area code&#8221; &#8211; 867 &#8211; 5309</p>
<p>From what I have seen, there is a good chance that someone used that number when setting up their account as a prank.</p>

		<p>Once upon a time, there was a certain retailer who wanted to allow non-unique 7 digit alternate IDs, since they operated in many, many area codes. The system would return the entire set of matches to the point-of-sale so the proper account could be selected from them,  Seems like a good idea, right? </p>
<p>But many people don&#8217;t like to give their real phone number&#8211; many, many, many people. What&#8217;s an easy number to remember? </p>
<p>Jenny, I&#8217;ve got your number!<br />
I need to make you mine!<br />
Jenny, don&#8217;t change your number,<br />
867-5309! </p>
<p>Bad things happened when thousands of matching records were returned to the POS.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
