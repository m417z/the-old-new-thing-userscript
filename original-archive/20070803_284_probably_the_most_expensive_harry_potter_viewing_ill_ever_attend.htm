<p>Last week, I arranged to meet a friend downtown to see <a href="http://www.harrypotterorderofthephoenix.com/"> the latest Harry Potter movie</a>. Traffic across the 520 bridge during the evening rush is always a disaster, so whenever I have to head into the city by myself after work, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/06/01/3019282.aspx"> I usually take the bus</a>, and today is no exception.</p>
<p> It is a sunny day, which makes for pleasant weather but horrible traffic. For some reason, traffic is significantly worse on sunny days. Short version: The bus is running behind schedule, and it's caught up in downtown traffic, so I get off at an earlier stop than I planned and walk/run the rest of the way. It is during this stretch of "run to the next traffic light, cross if possible, else wait for the light" that <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0000EWYB4?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tholneth-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=B0000EWYB4"> my clip-on sunglasses</a> must have fallen out of my pocket, because when I reach the theater, they are gone. </p>
<p> And I didn't need to have run anyway, because my friend is late, and we miss the 6:40 showing. Fortunately, that is the only glitch in the day. We grab some dinner and catch the next show. </p>
<p> A few days later, I stop by the eyeglasses store to order a replacement sunglasses clip. $85. That was one expensive Harry Potter movie. </p>
<p> (By the way, I liked the movie.) </p>

<p>Funny, here is the opposite! (and the reason is understandable.. if you take a bus you&#8217;d probably have to walk a bit and under the rain&#8230;.)</p>

		<p>In Atlanta, the traffic is notorious for being worse in rain. &nbsp;The two philosophies seem to be, &quot;There isn&#8217;t any problems with wet roads which can&#8217;t be solved by driving faster and closer together,&quot; and, &quot;instant idiots, just add water.&quot;</p>

		<p>I live north of Seattle (north of Bothell), and the traffic is way worse running north/south when it rains. &nbsp;Maybe it is just my luck :)</p>

		<p>clip-on sungalsses = &nbsp;bad design</p>
<p>The Rayomnd suffers problem created by bad desing = looses clip-ons from normal carryingplace. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Raymond replaces bad design with identical bad design rather than solving the problem but upgrading the sun-protection design. &nbsp;Or have you simply not informed this nit-picker of the preventative steps you&#8217;ve taken to overcome this design inadeaucy?</p>
<p>Admittedly reactalite glasses often react rather slowly, &nbsp;too slowly for diring into a tunel, &nbsp;but they may reduce your replacement costs&#8230;. &nbsp;&#8230;and maybe they&#8217;ve been made more responsive since I last purchased a pair&#8230;</p>

		<p>Wendy, for a nit-picker, you sure make a lot of mistakes. I counted at least 11.</p>
<p>Btw Raymond &#8211; &quot;Traffic across the 520 bridge during the evening rush is always a disaster&quot; &#8211; could have phrased that better, really &#8211; we must remain politically correct! :-)</p>

		<p>I had the expensive clip-ons for my glasses disappear as well. They were the &quot;rare-earth magnets on the hinges&quot; type. I had my visor up and turned my head to make a lane change and the airstream just sucked them right off.</p>
<p>I replaced them with clip-ons where there&#8217;s a claw at each corner and the temple is spring-loaded so you pull them apart to release them.</p>

		<p>So did you see Harry in IMAX 3D? That&#8217;s WELL worth hunting down an IMAX theatre, and I&#8217;m probably going again since that&#8217;s something you&#8217;re not going to ever get at home on DVD.</p>
<p>I had the expensive clip-ons for my glasses disappear as well. They were the &quot;rare-earth magnets on the hinges&quot; type. I had my visor up and turned my head to make a lane change and the air stream just sucked them right off. Price: $116 bucks</p>
<p>I replaced them with clip-ons where there&#8217;s a claw at each corner and the temple is spring-loaded so you pull them apart to release them. They&#8217;re also a little darker. Price: $25 clams</p>
<p>So more expensive does not always equal better.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  clip-ons are easier to carry than a second pair of glasses
</p></blockquote>
<p>My problem is that I can&#8217;t find a case for them. If they&#8217;re not in a case, they&#8217;re GOING to get crunched, and the enormous cases out there are big enough to hide an elephant in, and totally ridiculous. You expect me to fit THAT in a pocket??!!</p>

		<p>::Wendy:: &#8212;</p>
<p>Photochromic lenses are great, but they&#8217;ve got a few quirks that prevent them from being used in every situation.</p>
<p>Most photochromics work nice and quick (&lt;60 sec for full range), but they usually *don&#8217;t* work inside a car (glass, such as the windshield, blocks most UV, and photochromics react to UV). There are special designs (&#8220;Drivewear&#8221;) that do work in cars, but they lighten only to amber, not clear, so they&#8217;re not very useful at night. One way or another, &#8220;The Raymond&#8221; (I like that!) would still have to change glasses, or use clip-ons, at some time.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>I prefer to control when I&#8217;m wearing sunglasses and when not, because tinted lenses carry social connotations that may not be appropriate for all situations. And clip-ons are easier to carry than a second pair of glasses. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Hey, it just occurred to me: the problem here was that the clip-ons fell out of your pocket while you were running. So the issue is that the clip-ons weren&#8217;t properly fastened in place when you weren&#8217;t wearing them over your glasses.</p>
<p>Easy solution: flip-up sunglasses! Stylish *and* practical. Well, practical. Well&#8230;</p>

		<p>Gene: Agreed, it cost me 1/3 more to see it in 3D, which was well worth it just to ooh and aah &#8211; that&#8217;s come a long way since the old red/green lenses of twenty years ago.</p>
<p>I thought that was pretty good value &#8211; of course my sunglasses remained in my pocket the entire time, I imagine my verdict might have been similar to Raymond&#8217;s had they not.</p>

		<p>But did you see it in 3D?!?!&#8230; they could have provided you some high quality sexy glasses!</p>
<p>The 3d trailers were far better than the 3d in the film! One upside, I&#8217;ve got a new photo with the posse in some full retro geddup!</p>

		<p>Sometimes I wonder what value blogging provides, and every now and then, I happen across a delightfully insightful specimen that reminds me of the enormous power of open, free, mass communication of thoughts and ideas.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just unfortunate that I have to sort through this sort of rubbish to find it.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
