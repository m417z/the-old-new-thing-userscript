<p>A customer was running into this problem with a shell extension:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I am writing a shell namespace extension. I need to get data from a COM server, which requires impersonation via <code>CoInitializeSecurity</code> with <code>RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_IMPERSONATE</code>. As I am just writing an extension into <code>explorer.exe</code>, I am not able to call <code>CoInitialize</code>, <code>CoInitializeSecurity</code> anymore from my extension. Is there a way I can start <code>explorer.exe</code> by setting <code>RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_IMPERSONATE</code> in its COM initialization? I was browsing through web, and <code>explorer.exe</code> seems to take some settings from registry, but couldn't find anything related to this one.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> First of all, who says that the host process is <code>explorer.exe</code>? If I open Notepad, then do a File.Open, and then navigate to your shell extension, boom, your shell extension is now loaded into Notepad, and I doubt you told Notepad that you wanted it to initialize COM in a special way, just for you. Same goes for Quicken, Lotus Notes, all those other programs that use the shell. Even if you solved the problem for Explorer, that doesn't solve your problem in general. </p>
<p> Second, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/06/07/426294.aspx"> what if two shell extensions did this</a>? Your shell extension requires <code>RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_IMPERSONATE</code>, but another one requires <code>RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_DELEGATE</code>. Who wins? Or are those shell extensions mutually incompatible? And what about the effect your decision has on the other shell extensions hosted by Explorer? Now they are running with <code>RPC_C_IMP_LEVEL_IMPERSONATE</code> even though they didn't ask for it. Will that introduce a security vulnerability? Will those other shell extensions stop working or even crash? </p>
<p> A shell extension is a guest in the host process's house. You don't go and change the color of the carpet when you are invited over for dinner. </p>
<p> This question is yet another example of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/12/11/9193695.aspx"> using a global setting to solve a local problem</a>. To solve your local problem (<i>I need this specific COM interface to run with impersonation</i>), <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ms686614.aspx"> use a local solution</a>. </p>

		<p>Developers with an attitude like the one presented in this article are the primary reason I try my hardest to keep my shell extensions as close to stock standard as I can. Inevitably when I come across someone complaining about Explorer&#8217;s stability they&#8217;ll have a million new entries in their context menus.</p>

		<p>Another very hard-to-grasp concept is that when shipping 64-bit product which has shell extension, you really want to ship both 32 and 64-bit shell extension dlls. After the third time I got the replay &quot;but on 64 bit Windows Explorer is 64-bit, so a 32-bit shell extension is useless&quot;, I stopped trying to educate people.</p>
<p>People do believe that Explorer is the only entity that has the holy right to touch shell extensions.</p>

		<p>I understand it was probably a good idea at the time, when programmers could be expected to actually know what they were doing and memory was limited, but wouldn&#8217;t it be time to move shell extensions outside Explorer again?</p>
<p>Some sort of &quot;ShellExtensionProvider.exe&quot; that would be started by explorer (sort of like MSN Messenger always starts ctfmon.exe or TortoiseSVN always starts TSVNCache.exe) and would answer to &quot;shell extension requests&quot; from explorer views hosted in all processes, 32 or 64-bits.</p>
<p>Of course, because of backwards compatibility, the current shell extension model would have to stick around for another 10 years, but slowly all major extensions would be migrated to the new model.</p>

<p>I can see the cycle. As you speed up the machines, you can then dumb down the programmers and still end up with the same responsiveness of machines twenty years ago. Then despite upgrading your machine every couple of years the machine still feels as slow. Brilliant!!!! That&#8217;ll keep us on the gravy train for life!</p>

<p>Did you actually use a computer, say, 20 years ago? Those things were slow compared to an adequate machine running 7 or XP (I won&#8217;t touch Vista here &#8230;), if only because of I/O. Actually, that&#8217;s still the most limiting factor.</p>

		<p>Since MS pwns the house, they don&#8217;t care about whether changing the carpet could make the guests fall or not visit their house again. With this same mentality, I guess was why IColumnProvider was removed citing pseudo performance reasons. I have loyally stuck with XP because of this (Extensible column handlers are far too valuable to me than fancy Aero or Peek). How the hell can I display certain info like extension or size (especially folder size) thru extensions? Not possible with the Property system which only allows extracting static metadata from files. I hope Windows 8 or Windows 7 SP1 brings back IColumnProvider. Whatever happened to giving choice to users/developers?</p>

		<p>@porter: I posit that having ONE copy of the shell extension running in a separate process, instead of having a copy of it loaded into each process that shows an Open/Save dialog box, would have net memory savings in the end, as it would not need to allocate its per-instance data for each process. It would also remove the need for shell extension helper processes like TSVNCache.exe.</p>
<p>It would also have the benefit of not &quot;polluting&quot; the list of DLLs loaded into a process as soon as an Open/Save dialog would be shown.</p>
<p>@Jonathan: Actually, ctfmon.exe is related to msctf.exe, which I *think* is related to IME&#8217;s and advanced text input&#8230; which MSN indirectly uses since it uses windowless RichEdit&#8217;s for its input.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
