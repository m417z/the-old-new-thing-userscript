<p>It appears that  I will have an opportunity to visit Sweden during the first  week of June.  I'll have three days in Uppsala  and three days in Lund, with a travel day in between.  Now, I've already spent a week and a half in Uppsala,  so perhaps I could spend the Uppsala days taking a ferry  to Helsinki and back.  (And I could visit Denmark from Lund...)</p>
<p>  My Swedish won't be any better  (well, okay, I learned a little more about formation of  past participles, not like that counts for much),  but I still enjoy trying.  The hard part is finding  someone patient enough to put up with all my fumbling  and not switch to English out of frustration.  </p>
<p>  (In Finland and Denmark, I'm just going to start in English  with German as a fallback.  Sorry, guys.)  </p>
<p>  The question facing me now is whether I should go.  It hasn't even been a month since my previous trip,  and if the Finland thing doesn't come together,  I'll be spending half my time in a city I've already visited.  Hm...  </p>

		<p>Of course you should go &#8211; and this time make a hop to BLL and have lunch with me and my cow orkers :-)</p>

		<p>And from Helsinki you could take a ferry to Tallinn, Estonia’s capital ;-) Seriously, though Estonian climate generally shall we say “has significant room for improvement”, June is already pretty acceptable. <a target="_new" href="http://www.visitestonia.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.visitestonia.com/</a> ;-)</p>

		<p>Have you tried frisbeegolf? If you happen to pass by Alings&#229;s or Gothenburg again I would love to go for a round. It is a great sport since you don&#8217;t have to carry any heavy clubs and still have the chance to chat all the way around the course.</p>

		<p>Too bad you don&#8217;t plan to go to G&#246;teborg this time because in June when the weather is good the archipelago is really nice to visit.</p>
<p>Wherever you go (in Sweden) you&#8217;ll probably see a lot of highschool graduates celebrating their freedom in the beginning of June, which can be interesting to see&#8230;</p>

		<p>Unfortunately Swedish is the 2nd language in Finland, so depends a bit on the dude you bump in to whether he prefers Swedish or English in Finland. If i were asked English should be the 2nd official language in every place where it isn&#8217;t the 1st..</p>

		<p>You will be just fine with English. Everybody speaks English fluently. Even the sweet old lady I met on the train.</p>

		<p>Just in case I happen to go to Sweden next summer, which I might &#8230; will I be fine with just English (OK, I know Spanish, too, but I have a feeling that won&#8217;t get me anywhere unless I happen to confuse Spain with Sweden when ordering plane tickets&#8230;)? We have a foreign exchange student with near-native fluency (seriously the best I&#8217;ve ever heard) and, from what I&#8217;ve heard and read, it sounds like most of them know English pretty well thanks to government/educational encouragement.</p>
<p>Just wondering&#8211;because it sounds like I&#8217;ll be fine, maybe even better off that I *don&#8217;t* try. &lt;g&gt;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
