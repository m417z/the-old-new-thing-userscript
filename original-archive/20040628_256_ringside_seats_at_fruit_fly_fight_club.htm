<p>The first rule of  <a href="http://labworks.hms.harvard.edu/thriller/">  Fruit Fly Fight Club</a>:  Flies can't talk about Fruit Fly Fight Club.  Because they can't talk at all.  At least not to humans.</p>
<p>  Researchers at Harvard Medical School took a break from  <a href="http://www.hms.harvard.edu/bss/neuro/kravitz/moviepage.html">  studying lobster fighting</a> and shifted their focus to  fruit fly fights, and even  <a href="http://labworks.hms.harvard.edu/training_room/">  mutant fruit fly fights</a>.  </p>
<p>  (Via  <a href="http://improbable.typepad.com/improbable_research_whats/2004/06/fruit_fly_fight.html">  The Annals of Improbable Research</a>.)  </p>
<p>  Fruit flies are strange creatures.  Or perhaps it's that fruit fly researchers are strange creatures.  </p>
<p>  One of my cousins was a fruit fly researcher.  She took fruit fly testicles and squashed them and then studied  them under a microscope, looking for... something... I forget.  I think just finding the fruit fly testicles in the first place  was accomplishment enough.  </p>
<p>  Fruit fly researchers like to give their discoveries strange names.  Typically, a gene is named after what results when you disable it.  For example,  a gene without which fruit flies die in two days is named  <a href="http://www.southparkstudios.com/news/list.html?sect=1&amp;month=08&amp;year=2002&amp;min=3">Kenny</a>,  after the South Park character.  </p>
<p>  My favorite: The gene without which fruit flies get  drunk really easily is called  <a href="http://tinman.vetmed.helsinki.fi/eng/drosophila.html">  cheap date</a>.  (That last page has several more funny gene names.)  </p>
<p>  Yes, that's right.  <a href="http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/19980514045427data_trunc_sys.shtml">  Fruit flies get drunk</a>.  There's a fruit fly drunk-o-meter, though I forget how it works.  But one amusing aspect of fruit fly drunkenness is that just before  they finally pass out, there's a big burst of activity.  </p>
<p>  Strange gene naming has spread beyond the fruit fly world.  There is a human gene named  <a href="http://www.hhmi.org/jessell/sonic.html">  sonic hedgehog</a> after the Sega video game character.  (It's related to the fruit fly gene "hedgehog", so named because  disabling it causes the fly to develop into a ball with spikes.)  </p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think all the &quot;sonic&quot; genes are related to the fruit-fly hedgehog one.  I heard something about a gene that would change the orientation of your heart, called &quot;sonic&quot; because hedgehogs have their heart &quot;put in backwards&quot; relative to us.  I imagine if we humans had it we&#8217;d feel for our heartbeats on the right side of our chests rather than the left.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
