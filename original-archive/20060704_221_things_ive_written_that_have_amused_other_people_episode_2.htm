In our internal blogging discussion mailing list, somebody asked,
"How do you guys manage your blogs?
I mean stuff like revising old posts, managing links, categories, etc."
</p>
<p>
My reply:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
What specific sort of "management" activities are you trying to do?
Typically, once you post an entry that's the end of it.
You don't manage a blog so much as keep feeding it.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
For some reason, people got a kick out of that last sentence.

		<p>The questioner&#8217;s expectation is hilarious. Microsoft employee expects post blog-posting management overhead. &nbsp;Is this based on their own work environment &#8211; post-product shipped work &#8216;managing&#8217; it (e.g. QFE&#8217;s Windows Updates),</p>

		<p>Well, it&#8217;s not an unreasonable question. I mean, writing a &quot;popular blog&quot; means dedicating some time to fight off the spammers and slashdot effect every once in a while, and it also involves making sure to stop allowing new posts on threads after a while.</p>
<p>Obviously the aspect of &quot;feeding&quot; the blog is where most of the effort happens, but there is still overhead, and to some people that&#8217;s the hurdle to get over.</p>

		<p>Of course a blogger isn&#8217;t subject to requirements to fix bugs in old blog entries, but there are reasons why it would be really nice to do so. &nbsp;For stuff that is misdocumented in MSDN but almost properly documented in this blog, where it is better for programmers to read old blog entries and reduce the amount of experimenting, a bug fix would be as useful as the original blog entry was in the first place. &nbsp;Of course it&#8217;s not a responsibility, just a help.</p>
<p>(An ivory tower idealist might hope for MSDN to be fixed too. &nbsp;Today Microsoft gave me two more examples showing how silly such hopes are.)</p>

		<p>Maurits: Surely you realize that Raymond has an autoposter &#8211; That&#8217;s why all posts show up at 7AM sharp. It feeds from an async queue which is several months long.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s a valid question. When I started my blog, I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be posting anything much about gay rights, but I was wrong. So I added a category for it, and then I had to go back and identify all the posts that belonged in that category. </p>
<p>When you come down to it, it depends on the kind of blog you&#8217;re running, and how you categorise your posts. Raymond&#8217;s categories are very simple, although I still don&#8217;t quite get the difference between &#8220;Non-Computer&#8221; and &#8220;Other&#8221;. My blog has something like a dozen categories, but still rather general ones like &#8220;Politics&#8221; and &#8220;Gay Rights&#8221;. I&#8217;ve seen other blogs that have more like a hundred very specific categories like &#8220;Bush&#8221; and &#8220;Rush Limbaugh&#8221; and &#8220;North Korea&#8221; and &#8220;Iraq&#8221;, such that any given post &#8211; like &#8220;Rush Limbaugh reported that Bush compares North Korea to Iraq&#8221; &#8211; is likely to fit into several categories. </p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
