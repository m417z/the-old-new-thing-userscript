<p>For some reason, there are a lot of Microspeak terms related to personnel. (Maybe you folks can tell me how common these terms are outside Microsoft.)</p>
<p> We start with a term that is not actually used much outside the personnel world: The <i>Position Control Number</i>, or PCN. The PCN represents a place where an employee could be hired. If somebody is actually hired for the position, then the PCN is <i>filled</i>; if not, then it is <i>unfilled</i>. </p>
<p> The term you are likely to hear outside of the personnel world is <i>headcount</i>. (Pronounced as the two words <i>head count</i>, accent on the first word.) This is a filled PCN, and it is often abbreviated to just <i>head</i>. </p>
<p> Another term you are likely to hear is a <i>req</i>, short for <i>requisition</i>, and pronounced like the word <i>wreck</i>. A req is a requisition to recruit; in other words, it is permission to look for somebody to fill a position. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We have an open req to find somebody to frob the whatsit so it can futz the doodad. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> An <i>open req</i> is a req that has not yet been filled. This sounds redundant to me, because a req by definition is unfilled, isn't it? </p>
<p> Yet another personnel term you may encounter is <i>backfill</i>. This refers to hiring someone to take over a position that has been vacated by somebody who left the team. You will sometimes hear the term used in a metaphorical context. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Who is the backfill for Bob while he is on vacation? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Bob has not actually left the team; the person merely wants to know who is covering Bob's responsibilities while he is on vacation. </p>
<p> The last term I'm going to expose you to is the <i>ROP</i>, or <i>Recruiting Only Position</i>. A ROP is permission to interview someone for a position that doesn't exist yet. You open a ROP with a particular person in mind, and once obtained, you have permission to interview them. You can think of a ROP as unapproved headcount, since if you decide to hire the person, you still have to find a PCN to put them in. And if you decide not to hire the person after you interviewed them, you close the ROP. </p>
<p> I have no idea how useful these terms are for people not in the personnel world, but I figured I'd write them down for my own benefit, so I have something to refer to when I run across them. </p>

		<p>But isn&#39;t this clearly a case of abstractions leaking from the human resources department, so all you really need to do is open a req for the official HR plumber? After all, just as you wouldn&#39;t be expected to understand company-wide congratulations to Team X for having released Doodad Futzer 2.0 (as related in the relevant blog post), there&#39;s no need for you to understand this HR terminology either.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m struck the fact that you refer to &#39;someone&#39; to fill a position. &nbsp;Don&#39;t you know those are &#39;resources&#39; :-)</p>

		<p>| This sounds redundant to me, because a req by definition is unfilled</p>
<p>In my workplace the difference between a &quot;req&quot; and an &quot;open req&quot; is whether there is budget to fill it.</p>
<p>I have 5 reqs &nbsp;(5 positions that need to be filled) &nbsp;but only 1 open req (I have budget to fill one of them)</p>

		<p>We use all of those, and they mean pretty much the same thing. Not sure whether I&#39;ve heard &quot;head&quot; in that way, but I&#39;ve heard pretty much every other variation &#8211; headcount (as in &quot;headcount reduction&quot;), heads (as in &quot;we have 10 heads on this project&quot;), etc &#8211; so it wouldn&#39;t surprise me. They seem to be words managers like to use, so they&#39;ve worked their way into my vocabulary (which is how language generally works).</p>
<p>PCN is a new one on me, but maybe our HR guys use it.</p>

		<p>Re: backfill</p>
<p>I&#39;ve worked with people who IMO should have been described as &#39;landfill&#39;, but I don&#39;t think HR recognizes the term.</p>

		<p>We use headcount and open req in the same way. Backfill is the same concept, but it usually refers to when one of our FTE&#39;s gets assigned to a long term project, and we bring in a contractor to perform their regular work. Generally in the 6 month to 2 year range. </p>

		<p>I agree with Susan; the most common usage seems to be that an &quot;open req&quot; is one with a budget. I actually hear that phrase more than just &quot;req&quot;.</p>

		<p>The 0 month ago thing is interesting. It appears that the posts on February 16 and 17 are labeled such, which happen to be 28 and 29 days ago. Seems like there are two criteria to consider a post a month old, but 28 days, yet exactly 28 days ago has the same day of the month trips it up.</p>

		<p>In here, headcount is the total of approved filled and unfilled slot for the position.</p>

		<p>Is &#39;backfill&#39; really the best word to use, most of the time at least? According to the dictionaries, it consists of the actual earth that was dug out of the original hole.</p>
<p>In my experience, whenever someone goes on vacation, the replacement is more like &quot;stopgap&quot; in the best case, and in the worst case, &quot;remote control&quot; for the actual backfill.</p>

		<p>This is one way of using an ROP &#8211; there are others. &nbsp;REQs (including ROPs) are ways of &quot;marketing&quot; the position. &nbsp;So sometimes you&#39;ll open an multiple ROPs with an expectation that you will use one to fill the PCN and then you write multiple job descriptions &#8212; e.g. a &quot;funny&quot; one, a serious one, etc. &nbsp;When you find the candidate you want, you fill the PCNs and close the ROP.</p>

		<p>We also use &quot;Req&quot; which was confusing for me at first since it&#39;s the same pronunciation as ריק the Hebrew word for &quot;empty&quot; so at first I thought it referred to an un-filled position (hence empty).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
