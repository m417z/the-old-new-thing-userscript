<p>Windows&nbsp;XP introduced the ability to provide icon images which contain an 8-bit alpha channel. Up until this point, you had only a 1-bit alpha channel, represented by a <i>mask</i>.</p>
<p> The representation of an alpha-blended image in your ICO file is pretty straightforward. Recall that the old ICO format supports 0RGB 32bpp bitmaps. To use an alpha-blended image, just drop in a ARGB 32bpp bitmap instead. When the window manager sees a 32bpp bitmap, it looks at the alpha channel. If it's all zeroes, then it assumes that the image is in 0RGB format; otherwise it assumes it is in ARGB format. Everything else remains the same as for the non-alpha version. </p>
<p> Note carefully that <i>everything else remains the same</i>. In particular, you are still required to provide a mask. I've seen some people be a bit lazy about providing a meaningful mask and just pass in all-zeroes. And everything seems to work just fine, until you hit a case where it doesn't work. (Read on.) </p>
<p> There are basically three ways of drawing an alpha-blended icon image. </p>
<ol>
<li><code>Draw&shy;Icon(DI_<wbr>NORMAL)</wbr></code>:     This is by far the most common way icons are drawn.     In the alpha-blended case, this is done by     blending the <i>image</i> with the destination according to the     alpha channel. </li>
<li><code>Draw&shy;Icon(DI_<wbr>IMAGE)</wbr></code>:     This draws the <i>image</i> portion of the icon image,     completely overwriting the destination. </li>
<li><code>Draw&shy;Icon(DI_<wbr>MASK)</wbr></code>:     This draws only the <i>mask</i> portion of the icon image,     completely overwriting the destination. </li>
</ol>
<p> The <code>DI_<wbr>IMAGE</wbr></code> and <code>DI_<wbr>MASK</wbr></code> flags let an application draw just one of the two images contained in an icon image. Applications do this if they want finer control over the icon-drawing process. For example, they might ask for the mask so they can build a shadow effect under the icon. The mask tells them which parts of the icon are opaque and therefore should cast a shadow. </p>
<p> If you understand this, then you can see how people who set their <i>mask</i> image to all-zeroes managed to get away with it most of the time. Since most programs just use <code>DI_<wbr>NORMAL</wbr></code> to draw icons, the incorrect mask is never used, so the error never shows up. It's only when the icon is used by a program that wants to do fancy icon effects and asks for <code>DI_<wbr>MASK</wbr></code> (or calls <code>Get&shy;Icon&shy;Info</code> and looks at the <code>hbmMask</code>) that the incorrect mask results in an ugly icon. </p>
<p> The ironic thing is that the people who incorrectly set the mask to all-zeroes are probably the same people who will then turn around and say, "When I try to use alpha-blended icons, the result is hideously ugly under conditions X&nbsp;and&nbsp;Y. Those Microsoft programmers are such idiots. More proof that Windows is a buggy pile of manure." What they don't realize is that the hideous ugliness was caused by their own error. </p>

		<p>Or, or, or&#8230; the guys doing the fancy processing could just upgrade their code to take into account the alpha. I guess that even with a proper mask, given that if someone uses alpha it&#39;s because their icon has semi-transparent regions, doing a drop shadow based solely on the mask will still look ugly in many cases.</p>
<p>The ARGB icon format basically has two places where masking information is kept. Ignoring proper alpha processing is no better than ignoring to need for a mask.</p>
<p>(Yes, I&#39;m being unfair and ignoring backward compatibility. In my mind, as a user, if a program requires backward compatibility it&#39;s because it&#39;s being poorly maintained and is probably not evolving with the new OS releases, and I&#39;ll vote with my feet and move on to something that keeps up with the days.)</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve been wondering how this worked.</p>
<p>I used to use a downscaler program to make icons from 24bit bitmaps that made Win95 compatible (actually wouldn&#39;t surprise me if they were Win31 compatible) icons that did a pretty good job of mimicking the WinXP style.</p>
<p>The hard part was always un-antialiasing the icons before generation as otherwise they&#39;d look ugly when on the wrong color background.</p>
<p>I suppose the ARGB format was intended to do away with the need to do that, although you wouldn&#39;t believe how many people do it wrong by antialiasing to white and then transforming the outside white to transparent with something like paint&#39;s bucket tool. The correct way to do it is to extend your base colors over the entire antialias range and ARGB blend those pixels according to what the antialias algorithm would say you do.</p>

		<p>On one hand, The Real WTF was the failure of the OS to use the alpha channel as the mask.</p>
<p>On the other, a zero mask would work favorably for creating dynamic shadows. XP&#39;s very own 32-bit icons bake in a shadow. You want ugly? Try generating a shadow for an icon that already has one!</p>

		<p>I remember lots of Borland VCL based apps would show ARGB icons (XP folder icon etc) with a ugly all black fat shadow, I&#39;m guessing they painted them just like older icons and the XP gdx designers included all of the shadow in the mask (instead of just 1 pixel, or 0 pixel shadow)</p>

		<p>While I don&#39;t use Delphi/C++ builder these days, using a 24bpp imagelist looks very much like the thing I&#39;m talking about: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://img834.imageshack.us/img834/829/wndsksontico3shadow.png" rel="nofollow">img834.imageshack.us/&#8230;/wndsksontico3shadow.png</a></p>

		<p>That&#39;s because you&#39;re using 24bpp&#8230; so the alpha channel is discarded and only the mask is used.</p>
<p>At least that&#39;s how I assume it&#39;s doing it. &nbsp;I never knew WHY some apps did this before but now I do. &nbsp;They&#39;re converting to 24bpp first.</p>

		<p>@Dan Bugglin: Yes, I know I&#39;m using a 24bpp imagelist, but that was just to reproduce the issue. I have no clue if that is what the older apps did or if they draw the icons with custom code. Either way, the fault is with the icon designer for not checking the mask.</p>

		<p>I think I remember running into issues on XP where GetIconInfo didn&#39;t preserve the alpha channel in the image portion of the icon. I was using trying to use SHGetFileInfo to get an icon and then GetIconInfo to extract the image and mask for serialization. To preserve alpha, I eventually had to create a dib and copy the bitmap with alpha channel from the imagelist bitmap. It seems like most of the icon and bitmap functions are not aware of the alpha channel.</p>

		<p>Blah is right. The bug isn&#39;t in the icon files missing the mask, since they have already got a mask (in the form of the alpha channel) but in Windows for using the 1bpp mask for icons, which looks ugly even if it is present, since the 32bpp icon is probably anti-aliased while the 1bpp mask cannot be. (Note: I&#39;ve had to do some special processing on icons in the past, and I had to let go of DrawIcon(DI_MASK) since it&#39;s unusable even for icons shipped with Windows.)</p>
<p>@Joshua: Microsoft&#39;s own &lsquo;artists&rsquo; have been doing this on occasion&#8230; with bright magenta as the background colour. An example of the horror that can result is in Windows XP&#39;s file copy dialogue. Apparently the author of that animation didn&#39;t even look at it before sending it in.</p>

		<p>I thought the mask was to control hit testing. I.e. you would set the alpha channel to set whatever visibility you wanted, but the mask indicated which pixels you actually intended to be part of the icon. Fortunately Explorer only requires that you click on the icon&#39;s rectangle, but you could use the mask to implement a system that requires you to click on one of the foreground pixels of the icon (like Mac Finder used to).</p>

		<p>I suspect that for most apps that suffered from incorrect icons, the fault can be laid at the feet of the icon-creation tools. &nbsp;One of the drawbacks of not providing &quot;official&quot; resource editors with the OS/SDK. &nbsp;(Although no doubt if you did, there&#39;d be cries of &quot;monopoly abuse&quot;&#8230; despite Apple including ResEdit as standard in older versions.)</p>
<p>@Gabe: That was actually a really useful feature, at times. &nbsp;I remember making &quot;labels&quot; that could be moved around on the desktop or in a folder, which were created by creating a file with an invisible icon. &nbsp;It could be dragged about by its name and renamed as desired, and it didn&#39;t show an icon (or hitbox for an icon), allowing them to be stacked closely together without interference.</p>

		<p>Raymond, you haven&#39;t read my post or Joshua&#39;s post carefully enough. The point isn&#39;t that the background colour is magenta (as you said, it gets colour keyed) but that the &lsquo;artist&rsquo; anti-aliased the image to magenta. And apparently never previewed his animation before sending it in; that&#39;s what&#39;s unforgivable. Everyone makes mistakes, so handing in your work without looking it over is a sin, although in his defence apparently no one else at Microsoft checked his work either.</p>

		<p>i never understood (and still don&#39;t after reading the last 3 blog entries and the linked Technical Article) what a 1-bit mask is supposed to represent in an alpha-blended world. It can&#39;t be used to determine &quot;where icon stuff is, since there isn&#39;t a binary &quot;inside&quot; verses &quot;outside&quot;. It could be used for hit-testing, but is not documented as such. It could be used to help generate a drop-shadow, but with an alpha-blended image that drop-shadow would not be accurate (e.g. a half-transparent folder would not cast a fully darkened shadow). i guess i would have to understand why someone would choose to ever call Draw Icon(DI_MASK), or GetIconInfo and look at the hbmMask member. (If they are expecting the mask to contain something useful then they are mistaken).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
