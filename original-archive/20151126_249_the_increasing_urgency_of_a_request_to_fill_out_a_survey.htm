Here are some email messages I received from an automated system.</p>
<p>
October 20:
"This survey must be completed no later than November 14."
</p>
<p>
October 31:
"Reminder, this survey must be completed no later than November 14."
</p>
<p>
November 12:
"Final reminder, this survey must be completed no later than November 14."
</p>
<p>
November 14:
"Extension, this survey must be completed no later than November 19."
</p>
<p>
November 19:
"Final reminder, this survey must be completed no later than November 19."
</p>
<p>
November 28:
"This survey must be completed no later than December 16."
</p>
<p>
I gave in and clicked the survey link.
</p>
<p>
The link was broken.
</p>
<p>
I guess the people running the survey said,
"Gosh, we're getting no responses.
Let's extend the deadline."

		<p>Based on the 3-in-ten-thousand who responded to that magazine card a few days ago, I suppose &quot;no-one at all tried to respond&quot; is at least as plausible as &quot;no-one at all was able to respond&quot;.</p>

		<p>I guess even if you filled the survey, you&#39;ll still receive the email. There&#39;s no constraint that any survey have to be conducted exactly once only.</p>
<p>See if there will be more email on Dec 16.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of the progressively more and more silly E-Mails I sent round my firm as we approached &quot;strong password enforcement day&quot;. And of course, plenty still ignored them!</p>

		<p>(this is many years ago so when some Internet stuff for the general public was very new). I owned the domain for my late brother&#39;s company. There was a marketing company with almost the same name (2 Ls instead of one) &#8211; and they did a major marketing campaign with the web form set up to send things to the wrong domain i.e. mine. IIRC correctly I sent an email and didn&#39;t get any response so I found out the name of the MD and phoned him up. He was very exasperated with his staff. </p>

		<p>Our place has away days (essentially team building days, but mostly full of boring speeches) and your emails remind me of the ones they sent around for that, though not for exactly the same reason. We had a string of &quot;this is a mandatory staff activity, all staff are required to attend&quot; and then eventually &quot;we have filled up all the places, apologies to any staff who hadn&#39;t yet confirmed their attendance&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Benjy</p>
<p>I bet &quot;strong password enforcement&quot; decreased security measurably across the entire company, too.</p>
<p>Now everyone just uses !p4ssword as their password, instead of mary100179spotnewjersey</p>
<p>Which is why smart people don&#39;t send those emails in the first place.</p>

		<p>@Kemp</p>
<p>&quot;This is a mandatory activity. Sign up by COB X/Y/ZZZZ&quot;</p>
<p>COB X/Y/ZZZZ:</p>
<p>&quot;Any staff who haven&#39;t yet confirmed their attendance should clean out their desks by the end of the day tomorrow.&quot;</p>

		<p>@Kemp: Weird: &quot;We had a string of &quot;this is a mandatory staff activity, all staff are required to attend&quot; and then eventually &quot;we have filled up all the places, apologies to any staff who hadn&#39;t yet confirmed their attendance&quot;.&quot;</p>
<p>Which means 1) that the company can&#39;t count, and 2) if you don&#39;t want to attend, you are rewarded for not confirming your attendance!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
