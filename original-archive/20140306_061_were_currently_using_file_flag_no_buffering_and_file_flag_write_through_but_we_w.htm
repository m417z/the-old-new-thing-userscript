<p>A customer said that their program's I/O pattern is to open a file and then every so often write about 100<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/11/9725386.aspx">KB</a> of data into the file. They are currently using the <code>FILE_<wbr>FLAG_<wbr>NO_<wbr>BUFFERING</wbr></wbr></wbr></code> and <code>FILE_<wbr>FLAG_<wbr>WRITE_<wbr>THROUGH</wbr></wbr></wbr></code> flags to open a file, and they wanted to know what else they could do to make their writes go even faster.</p>
<p> Um, for one thing, you stop passing those two flags! </p>
<p> Those two flags in combination basically mean "Give me the slowest possible I/O performance!" because they force all I/O to go through to the physical media right away. </p>
<p> Removing the <code>FILE_<wbr>FLAG_<wbr>WRITE_<wbr>THROUGH</wbr></wbr></wbr></code> flag will be a big help. This allows the hardware disk cache to do its normal job of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/09/09/10059575.aspx"> completing the I/O immediately and performing the physical I/O lazily</a> (perhaps in an optimized order based on subsequent writes). A 100KB write is a small enough write that your I/O time on rotational media will be dominated by the seek time. It'll take five to ten milliseconds to move the head into position and only one millisecond to write out the data. You're wasting 80% or more of your time just preparing for the write. </p>
<p> Much better would be to issue the I/O without the <code>FILE_<wbr>FLAG_<wbr>WRITE_<wbr>THROUGH</wbr></wbr></wbr></code> flag so that the entire 100KB I/O request goes into the hard drive on-board cache. (It will fit quite easily, since the on-board cache for today's hard drives will be 8 megabytes or larger.) Your <code>Write&shy;File</code> will complete immediately, and the commit to physical storage will occur while your program is busy doing computation. </p>
<p> If the writes truly are sporadic (as the customer claims), the I/O buffer will be flushed out by the time the next round of application I/O begins. </p>
<p> Removing the <code>FILE_<wbr>FLAG_<wbr>NO_<wbr>BUFFERING</wbr></wbr></wbr></code> flag will also help, because that allows the operating system disk cache to get involved. If the application reads back from the file, the read can be satisfied from the disk cache, avoiding the physical I/O entirely. </p>
<p> As a side note, the <code>FILE_<wbr>FLAG_<wbr>WRITE_<wbr>THROUGH</wbr></wbr></wbr></code> flag is largely ineffective nowadays, because SATA drivers ignore the flush request. The file system doesn't know that the driver is lying to it, so it will still do all the work on the assumption that the write-through request worked, even though we know that the extra work is ultimately pointless. </p>
<p> For example, NTFS will issue metadata writes with a flush to ensure that the data on the physical media is consistent. But if the driver is ignoring flush requests, all this extra work accomplishes nothing aside from wasting I/O bandwidth. Even worse, NTFS <i>thinks</i> that the data on the drive is physically consistent, <i>but it isn't</i>. The result is that a poorly-timed power outage (or device removal) can result in metadata corruption that takes a <code>chkdsk</code> to repair. </p>
<p> Now, it may be that the customer's program is using the <code>FILE_<wbr>FLAG_<wbr>NO_<wbr>BUFFERING</wbr></wbr></wbr></code> and <code>FILE_<wbr>FLAG_<wbr>WRITE_<wbr>THROUGH</wbr></wbr></wbr></code> flags for a specific purpose unrelated to performance, so you can't just go walking in and ripping them out without understanding why they were there. But if they added the flags thinking that it would make the program run faster, then they were operating under a false assumption. </p>

		<p>I am aware that a lot of programming forums/blogs of suspicious quality are spreading myths for years that FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING and FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH are the &quot;magic&quot; that makes your writes and reads faster. Based only on false beliefs and the lack of understanding and tests.</p>
<p>Raymond is of course right: unless you&#39;re making video conversion software (or antivirus scanner) that should push a lot of gigabytes through the CPU just because, you probably don&#39;t want to use FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING. And using FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH has even less sense unless you write your own file system.</p>

		<p>Legacy IDE drives provide no support for the equivalent of SCSI FUA in drives based on any version of the Advanced Technology Attachment (ATA) specification prior to version 7. This issue was addressed in ATA-7, on which most Serial ATA (SATA) drives are based. Of course that doesn&#39;t mean it is honored or correctly implemented in all cases..</p>

<p>Ughhh. A very popular program I used then didn&#39;t do NO_BUFFERING. Good times. Well, at least you don&#39;t have to run PATA in PIO mode (or, worse, 8 bit SCSI in PIO mode) anymore.</p>

		<p>The issue of the hardware lying to the software gets especially fun when you stick a battery-backed RAID controller in the middle. Now, the controller being battery-backed can lie with impunity because it won&#39;t lose data across a power outage. But if the disks continue to lie to the RAID card (or worse, the RAID card doesn&#39;t even try to turn the disk&#39;s write cache off), then that cache becomes worthless and tends to result in a scrambled RAID array. I recall LiveJournal getting hit by exactly this issue many years ago. Their datacenter did have UPS, but that&#39;s not much use when someone hits the &quot;switch everything off now damnit&quot; button thinking it&#39;s the &quot;unlock door&quot; button&#8230;</p>

		<p>&gt; Large files opened in caching mode is a bane of Windows users.</p>
<p>This is a frustrating reality. &nbsp;For example I love using Robocopy for backup purposes, but it doesn&#39;t have an option to bypass the filesystem cache. &nbsp;This means that my entire hard drive filled with movies, games, disk images, etc all are getting written to memory. It&#39;s also annoying because Robocopy shows the progress of the copy and then just sits and hangs at 100% while it waits for the file to actually get written someplace. &nbsp;I much prefer the behavior of tools such as TeraCopy which have an option to bypass the cache. &nbsp;The copy speed is much more realistic and when a file is complete it really is complete. &nbsp;It also doesn&#39;t cause me thrashing/paging grief.</p>
<p>What&#39;s even worse is that this is a known issue in &quot;write only&quot; usage scenarios and various Microsoft utilities (originally ESEUTIL and later XCOPY) have options to bypass the cache. &nbsp;I just looked online to see if Robocopy got some love in Windows 8, but a first glance seems to indicate that it&#39;s actually pretty broken in Win8. Fantastic.</p>

		<p>@Nico:</p>
<p>One issue with writing files in NO_BUFFERING mode is that it doesn&#39;t allow to set the file length other than multiple of block size. SetFilePointer will explicitly fail if the offset is not a multiple of block size, even though no I/O happens at that time, and the actual offset validation also happens inside ReadFile/WriteFile. So if you want to write a file with non-round size, you have to reopen it in buffered mode, and set its length. This is totally stupid.</p>

		<p>@Lawrence, the driver is telling what it thinks is the truth, which is what the drive says. &nbsp;If the driver, or the driver&#39;s developer, could tell the difference when the drive is lying, then you could say it&#39;s lying as well. &nbsp;Timing isn&#39;t safe: a fast response might be suspicious from a plate/disk drive, but not from a flash/SSD drive. &nbsp;And having an enumeration of all drive IDs doesn&#39;t work either: manufacturers often keep the exact same ID between what they regard as minor revisions or fixed glitch that no one outside is (yet, with luck, ever) aware of.</p>
<p>The liar is the drive, the one getting hurt is the file system module, the driver is just the messenger. &nbsp;Don&#39;t shoot the messenger.</p>

		<p>Ah, great. Another instance of storage hardware manufacturers atrocious behavior: Not honoring specs, using a different size for kilobyte/megabyte/gigabyte/etc. and lying to the OS. I wish there was a happy ending to all this.</p>

		<p>I think I&#39;ve used at least one of those flags before when I needed to know that the write had completed. Windows mobile writing to an sd card, writes go awol if the unit suspends before the write hit the sd card because the os briefly forgets the card was there when it wakes up. Most of the I/O was on a background thread, so fast wasn&#39;t a huge deal. Not helped by compact framework not being able to give you any idea that the previous write failed.</p>
<p>I&#39;d probably suggest they leave well alone. You would be better off telling them you can make their car go faster by removing the brakes.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m unclear as to what &quot;write&quot; means in this context.</p>
<p>If you preallocate the file, you could use overlapped I/O, although I don&#39;t know whether this makes the call to WriteFile faster or not*. Alternatively you could map the file into memory, eliminating the call to WriteFile altogether, thus reducing the time taking to call WriteFile by 100%!</p>
<p>If they&#39;re referring to the physical write of the blocks to disk, then bypassing the cache would presumably reduce the time it takes to get the bits on the disk. In the pathological worst case, the OS doesn&#39;t have any standby memory available and has to swap something anyway.</p>
<p>*Separately for each combination of the flags discussed.</p>

		<p>Your &quot;lying&quot; drive firmware may of course be provided by your VMM host, which may have UI options to let the end-user decide how much dishonesty is required.</p>
<p>Windows *may* be running on the bare metal and talking to honest hardware/firmware, or it may not. These days, it quite frequently isn&#39;t.</p>

		<p>How does &quot;Enable write caching on the disk&quot; and &quot;enable advanced performance&quot; integrate with FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING and FILE_FLAG_WRITE_THROUGH?</p>

<p>(using an OS which supports the options of course)</p>
<p>Can we have a table to explain all combinations?</p>

		<p>For us who still depend on Windows 7, robocopy got the /J switch starting with Windows 8, but good old xcopy has it even in Windows 7:</p>
<p>C:&gt;xcopy /?</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p> &nbsp;/J &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Copies using unbuffered I/O. Recommended for very large files.</p>

		<p>Copying files without /J will evict possibly very interesting pages from the cache (aka the standby list).</p>
<p>Copying small files with /J is slower than normal copies.</p>
<p>This is am ongoing hard problem. &nbsp;CPUs have the same cache dilution/poisoning issue with memcpy() implementations leading to cached and uncached memory move instructions but that doesn&#39;t necessarily help the middleware coder. &nbsp;You probably know at the top of the stack if you&#39;re copying 1kb or 1tb but it&#39;s hard to have things in the middle guess the superior policy. &nbsp;(Copies are particularly bad since you can end up with both the source and destination in the cache if you&#39;re not careful. &nbsp;You *may* use one of them soon after so it *may* be useful but it&#39;s extremely unlikely you need both.)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
