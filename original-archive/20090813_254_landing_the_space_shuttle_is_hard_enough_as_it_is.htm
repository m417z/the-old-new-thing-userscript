		<p>The one in Armageddeon had an armored car with a Vulcan. Of course, you couldn&#8217;t use that in flight without shooting up the cargo bay.</p>
<p>(It also raises the question: what exactly did they expect to find on the asteroid in that movie? Nazis?)</p>

		<p>Fun story, those simulators are actually harder than the &quot;real thing&quot;. Of course, I don&#8217;t know what the actual real thing is like. But I have had the opportunity to land the full-motion cockpit simulator at Johnson Space Center, which is used for astronaut training. The flight model the &quot;game&quot; you played seems to introduce porpoising quite frequently and requires a lot of pitch movement to dampen out. The &quot;real thing&quot; is much more stable, and consequently far easier to land. I&#8217;ve done it with several people that have never even flown flight sim video games before, and they were able to successfully land it on the first try.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite easy if the HUD is working, because you just keep the crosshairs in the diamond and the computer tells you exactly where to go. :)</p>

		<p>Wow, talk about a coincidence &#8211; I watched Space Cowboys last night (great movie, btw) and for those who&#8217;ve never seen it, a main plot point involves attempting to land the space shuttle without on-board computers. It&#8217;s a flying brick.</p>

		<p>I worked on the Space Shuttle flight simulators some 30 years ago (as an employee of Link Simulations, one of the three major contractors &#8212; along with IBM and Ford &#8211; on the simulators). I never got to fly the motion-base simulator (sigh), but I did fly the fixed-base simulator a few times. On one such occasion, I attempted to do an inverted loop and bring the Shuttle back to the landing strip. I crashed horribly. :-) ..bruce..</p>

<p>But, it&#8217;s a flying brick, and the autopilot does a lot of the grunt work. It worked so well that it compensated for the hole in the wing on Columbia.</p>
<p>And never to miss a Halo reference&#8230; Sgt. Johnson commented how well Master Chief &#8216;flew&#8217;. I think it went &quot;(thump as Master Chief lands on the Pelican) For a brick, he flew pretty good!&quot;</p>

		<p>Of course, there was the alleged military Space Shuttle (probably born out of confusion over the Air Force&#8217;s Shuttle; they were originally going to be allowed launch one from Vandenburg for their classified payloads; it never happened).</p>
<p>The Almaz Soviet military space station (a modified Salyut), though, did indeed have a gun. There was some complex messing with rockets so that the gun firing didn&#8217;t effect its overall velocity.</p>

		<p>I flew a real, actual, 707 simulator once, which was used for training pilots at a major airline. &nbsp;This (old) jet airliner had two engines under each wing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Each time I tried to taxi to take off, the plane would slowly spin around. &nbsp;The part-time instructor who was giving me the tour finally realized that I had neglected to power up two of the engines. &nbsp;The simulator was so real that it knew that only two engines were thrusting; hence the off-center propulsion.</p>
<p>I finally took off, flew around a while, and came in for a hard landing. &nbsp;The auto voice in the cockpit recommended that I &quot;go around&quot; to try the landing again, but the instructor said &quot;oh, go ahead and land it&quot;. &nbsp;There was a hard bump and then I slowly skidded off the runway. &nbsp;Fun times!</p>
<p>I also toured the maintenance hangar, and went inside a brand new 747 (to the first-class lounge upstairs). &nbsp;It&#8217;s the only time I have been on, or in, a 747&#8230;</p>

		<p>I remember playing the 80&#8217;s game &#8216;Orbiter&#8217; as a kid, which was a crude simulator of the space shuttle allowing users to take part in everything from the pre-launch checks to landing the shuttle in one of four different landing sites, along with a handful of missions to complete, usually involving deployment or testing of some satellite. The manual was rather thick.</p>
<p>I clearly remember one of the panels full of buttons and such was labelled &#8216;weapons&#8217;, and there was at least one mission to test-fire them. Not sure whether they were missiles.</p>

		<p>When some months ago I visited Microsoft offices in Redmond as a business guest of the ABU, I visited also The Museum of Flight in Seattle and also I cratered the Space Shuttle&#8230;</p>
<p>By the way, the museum was very nice, as well as Seattle and Redmond surroundings. And the Starbucks coffee at Microsoft kitchenettes was very very good (that might sound strange because I&#8217;m from Italy, but I like so much Starbucks&#8217; coffee).</p>
<p>Any chance to meet you when I&#8217;ll come back in Redmond later this year?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
