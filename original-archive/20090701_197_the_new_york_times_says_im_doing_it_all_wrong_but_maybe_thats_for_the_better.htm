<p>Some time ago, <i>The New York Times</i> ran a story titled <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/06/technology/06sweat.html"> <i>In Web World of 24/7 Stress, Writers Blog Till They Drop</i></a>, which mentions that "those on the lower rungs of the business can earn as little as $10 a post."</p>
<p> Dude, if that's what people on the lower rungs earn, then I'm below ground level! (Nevermind that just the previous month, an article in <i>The New York Times</i> wrote about the business of blogging: <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/20/technology/personaltech/20basics.html"> Don't expect to get rich</a>.) </p>
<p> Then again, I probably shouldn't complain, seeing as what most people took away from the article was that <a href="http://blogs.chron.com/techblog/archives/2008/04/blogging_kills_1.html"> blogging kills</a>. </p>
<p> <i>Slate</i>'s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timothy_Noah"> Timothy Noah</a> noted in his article <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2188424/"> <i>Death by Blogging</i></a> that the <i>New York Times</i> article employs a magic phrase which, once it appears, is a signal to the reader that the subject matter of the story is completely made up: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Give Richtel credit for admitting high up in the story that what follows is purest fancy. Newspaper reporters call these caveat-rich passages "to-be-sure grafs." </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The "to-be-sure" paragraph appears as paragraph number six: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <u>To be sure</u>, there is <u>no official diagnosis</u> of death by blogging, and the premature demise of two people <u>obviously does not</u> qualify as an epidemic. There is also <u>no certainty</u> that the stress of the work contributed to their deaths. <u>But</u>... </p>
</blockquote>
<p> It opens with the magic phrase that says "What you are reading in the remainder of this article is complete fantasy," then adds a few more statements saying that "None of what this article says is true." And then, as if to say, "Let's not let facts get in the way of a good story," it immediately resumes the fabrication with a "But..." </p>

		<p>Raymond, I know it&#8217;s not something you&#8217;d like to dwell on, but given that you already have about a year or two&#8217;s worth of posts queued up, have you thought about what you&#8217;d like to happen to that queue if anything were to happen to you?</p>

		<p>Raymond, you can fix your per-post income by simply rethinking what Microsoft is paying you to do. Just think of your paycheck as being for your &quot;Old New Thing&quot; posts &#8211; the other stuff you do at Microsoft is simply research for the bulk of the postings.</p>
<p>Now you&#8217;re a top-dollar blogger.</p>

		<p>Well, Raymond could have died from blogging long ago and we wouldn&#8217;t even know for another couple of years. &nbsp;How do we even know Raymond is a real person? &nbsp;I bet this entire blog is a long forgotten joke set up as a cron job many years ago. &nbsp;Raymond does not exist, nor has he ever existed.</p>

		<p>I can personally vouch that Raymond does (still) exist, or at least that someone who looks suspiciously like his photos is inhabiting his office. I happened to walk by it the other day (I didn&#8217;t stop and stare like someone else did, who was previously mentioned on this blog).</p>
<p>He could still be a robot, as already postulated&#8230;</p>

		<p>I tried searching nytimes.com for the phrase &quot;to be sure&quot;.</p>
<p>I found &quot;To be sure, several of Manhattan&#8217;s appealing features are found in small towns,&quot; which seems unlikely. &nbsp;Except that it&#8217;s an amazingly nice feature to find a parking space in Manhattan, but there are plenty of them in small towns. &nbsp;But I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s what they meant.</p>
<p>OTOH, another article said &quot;To be sure, squeezing suppliers would have unpleasant side effects.&quot; I didn&#8217;t click through to find out what the article meant by &quot;suppliers&quot;, but I am nevertheless inclined to believe the Times on this one. &nbsp;Squeezing things tends to result in annoyance, leaks, and/or unpleasant odors.</p>

		<p>I think it is implied that in order to make money, you need to have advertisements on your site. &nbsp;The more intrusive, the more lucrative.</p>
<p>I suppose you *could* always pull your MSDN site down and put up your own personal blog, complete with ads. &nbsp;I have no idea what your traffic looks like, but I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;d make more than you do now ;)</p>

		<p>Every piece of news I&#8217;ve seen in the last decade doesn&#8217;t bother with any little thing like facts. &nbsp;Entertainment news isn&#8217;t just Extra or Access Hollywood&#8230; it&#8217;s all news.</p>

		<p>Larry- I think you&#8217;re applying the rule incorrectly. The words immediately following &quot;To be sure&quot; should be true, it&#8217;s the rest of the article that is a complete fabrication.</p>
<p>&quot;To be sure, there is no official diagnosis of death by blogging&quot;. That statement is true. The entire rest of the article is how &lt;dramatic music&gt; Blogging will KILL you.&lt;/dramatic music&gt; I guess the more logical headline &quot;Blogging Doesn&#8217;t Render You Immortal!&quot; wouldn&#8217;t be as catchy.</p>
<p>The suppliers article you mentioned doesn&#8217;t seem to perfectly fit this mold. The entire article is critical of Person X&#8217;s health care plan. The &quot;To be sure&quot; paragraph is also critical of the plan. However, is paragraph immediately prior talks about how the plan will drive prices down, and the To Be Sure graph explains why this is a Bad Thing.</p>

		<p>Which is why if you&#8217;re paying for the NYT you&#8217;re doing something wrong. Mind you, I stopped reading the NYT for a number of reasons quite some time ago. Contributing factors where many, including that they let fact checking go down the drain and that their newsfeed became more and more broken over time.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
