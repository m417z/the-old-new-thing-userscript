<p> Another round of the semi-annual link clearance. </p>
<ul>
<li>    Do you hear any Christmas music right now? Good.    Christmas songs can be played    only 1/12 of the year, and    <a href="http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/christmas-music-season-data/">    people who write algorithms    for computer-generated playlists    need to identify Christmas songs</a>    so that they don't select them during the other 11/12 of the year.    Also, so that when Christmas standards suddenly become popular,    they don't decide that Bing Crosby is an up-and-coming artist.    (The article also talks about the arms race among    stations which switch to playing only Christmas songs    during the holiday season.) </li>
<li>     Your Bank of America debit or credit card     gets you     <a href="http://museums.bankofamerica.com/">     free admission to a variety of museums     around the country on the first weekend     of the month</a>. </li>
<li>     <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/culturebox/2014/12/letterman_top_ten_a_statistical_analysis_of_30_years_of_top_ten_lists_from.html">     A statistical analysis of 30 years of David Letterman's Top Ten Lists</a>.     What takes this beyond your basic "I generated a lot of graphs"     article is the involvement of     Joe Toplyn, one of Letterman's writers, to help explain the results. </li>
<li>     The TSA's controversial     <a href="http://www.tsa.gov/traveler-information/advanced-imaging-technology-ait">     millimeter-wave Advanced Imaging Technology</a>     scanners (aka "nudie scanners")     were taken out of service last year,     but what happened to them?     <a href="https://www.techdirt.com/articles/20140520/08421227293/expensive-tsa-nudie-scanners-find-new-home-prisons.shtml">     They went to prisons</a>.     If they had been available for sale to the general public,     I'm pretty sure all of them would have been bought by     fraternities.     For security purposes, I assure you.     (Actually, the occasional unit appears to be     <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/i.html?_nkw=rapiscan+backscatter">     put up for sale on eBay</a>.     Earlier this year, one went up for     <a href="http://www.loweringthebar.net/2014/12/assorted-stupidity-68.html">     $8000 from a government-surplus reseller</a>.     Today, there is a     <a href="http://www.ebay.com/itm/111519265986">     $3,995 or best offer</a>.) </li>
<li>The SpaceX project's Falcon 9     landed successfully,     but the video captured from the lander was     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m8H8OlJ3o8">badly corrupted</a>.     The folks at the NASA Space Flight Forums     <a href="http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/06/recovering-falcon-9-ocean-landing-video-done/">     accepted the challenge to recover as much as possible</a>     and the results are amazing.     Don't watch the     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CjZ33C9JZTM">     reconstructed video</a> until you've seen     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7m8H8OlJ3o8">the original</a>. </li>
<li>     The air traffic control service     <a href="http://nats.aero/">NATS</a>     runs the Shanwick Oceanic Control Area,     a large chunk of the north Atlantic west of Great Britain.     They produced this     <a href="http://nats.aero/blog/2014/06/north-atlantic-skies-gateway-europe/">     mesmerizing video</a>     of air traffic over the north Atlantic in a single day.     They have also produced     <a href="http://nats.aero/blog/2014/03/europe-24-air-traffic-data-visualisation/">     24 hours over Europe</a>     and     <a href="https://vimeo.com/90787669">     24 hours over the Middle East</a>. </li>
<li>     The mellifluous tones of Stephen Fry     <a href="http://www.lords.org/lawsanimations">     elucidate the laws of cricket</a>.     The problem I have with a lot of this introductory material     is that they tend to get all bogged down in details that     are not relevant to an appreciation of the game.     For example,     <a href="http://www.dangermouse.net/cricket/equipment.html">     the precise composition of the bat and ball are not important</a>.     You can assume for the most part     that the bats and balls conform     to applicable regulations.     Here's something never before asked in the history of cricket:     "I didn't understand what just happened.     Can you tell me the number of pieces of leather which comprise     the ball covering?"     (Someday, I will try to write "The rules of &lang;sport&rang;     for the casual viewer.") </li>
<li>     <a href="http://aneurismic.tumblr.com/post/87185178513/seattle2">     Judgmental map of Seattle</a>. </li>
<li>     AHL (hockey) referee David Banfield     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZEBoOr12BrI">     wears a GoPro helmet cam on the job</a>.     I'm impressed by how much effort is expended     trying to defuse situations before they turn into fights.     Or at least before they turn into bigger fights     than they already are.     "Good job boys, good job."     It's like he's managing a group of toddlers.     (NHL referee Wes McCauley     <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/blogs/nhl-puck-daddy/nhl-official-wes-mccauley-mic-d-yankee-stadium-214512005--nhl.html">     did the same thing a month later</a>, but the result of the editing     was less insightful.) </li>
<li>     The first     <a href="http://www.ethicsinsports.ch/">     World Summit on Ethics in Sport</a>     was hosted by FIFA.     (Motto: "We will not give up until we are more corrupt than the IOC!")     <a href="http://www.fifa.com/aboutfifa/organisation/homefifa/news/newsid=2423590/index.html">     I am not making this up</a>. </li>
<li>     The IOC responds by     <a href="http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/10/02/ioc_demands_oslo_drops_bid_after_over_the_top_list_of_requirements.html">     making absurd demands from the City of Oslo     for hosting the Winter Games</a>.     I like how they backpedal and say,     "Oh no, those weren't demands.     They were merely suggestions!"     Let's look at one of those suggestions:     "All IOC members shall receive a new mobile phone with     Norwegian service.     The phone must be Samsung brand."     That sure is an oddly-phrased suggestion. </li>
<li>FIFA strikes back:     <a href="http://deadspin.com/fifa-investigator-blasts-report-based-on-his-own-invest-1658279291">     FIFA Investigator Blasts Report Based On His Own Investigation</a>.     Or, the headline as FIFA would have written it:     "FIFA cleared of all wrongdoing in FIFA-sponsored investigation     of FIFA, says FIFA."     <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/news/fifa-ethics-investigator-garcia-resigns-161558043--sow.html">     Garcia later resigned in protest</a>. </li>
<li>The IAAF says, "Hey don't forget us! We're corrupt too!"     <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2014/nov/25/iaaf-doha-incentive-fair-world-athletics-2019">     IAAF insists Dohas &pound;23.5m last-minute incentive was totally fair</a>. </li>

		<p>Quote: &quot;[Wait a second, whose blog is this? -Raymond]&quot;. Oh my bad, I thought is blog of a person who doesn&#39;t give a flying xxxx about stupid things Micro$oft does, but that kinda change it since you worked so hard on Flop3 (aka Win8) and especially us, your readers, attack it so hard in past couple years. Yeah, you&#39;re growing old and bitterness is growing inside as well. Ray I know from 2005 would jump on this, but meh, this new Ray &gt;2012 apparently doesn&#39;t. Don&#39;t tell me, Win8 stuff are out of question here? Only &lt;Win7 OS&#39;es stories of &quot;other side of the air hatch&quot; are allowed?</p>

		<p>@Danny I&#39;m not sure what you expect him to say about it. There are really only two viewpoints (three if you count the &quot;this &#39;vulnerability&#39; is a non-issue&quot; side) and I think they&#39;re all covered well enough in the comments of the ticket in question on Google&#39;s tracker. (Which, oddly enough, is a much more appropriate place to discuss this than an unrelated blog post.)</p>

		<p>[And it was my example of a bad explanation. I mean, who cares about the number of piece of leather which comprise the ball cover? -Raymond]</p>
<p>I think the composition of the ball is a bad example to pick on, as its one of the key things that changes during play, outside of the score.</p>
<p>In all forms of the game, it&#39;s important to know that the ball has a raised seam around the equator, as this is the dominant aerodynamic feature of a new ball. The ball is also bounced, and the seam is important as to how it behaves once it does.</p>
<p>Particularly in one day and test matches, the fact that it is leather, and has a hard core is important: as the same ball is used for 50 or 80 overs(~a day), and the seam wears off, the core softens, and the ball wears unevenly/is polished on one side by the bowling team, which affects the aerodynamics(so called &quot;reverse swing&quot;)</p>
<p>Interestingly (at least to me), if the ball is &quot;damaged&quot; during play (for example, if it is no longer round, or if it is a white ball and has picked up too much green colour from the grass), it is replaced with a ball that is roughly as worn as the ball in play: that is, the umpires will get the ball, and a selection of pre worn replacement balls, and compare them to find the best match.</p>
<p>Granted, this information is not necessary to start to watch cricket, but the fact that it has a seam and a shiny side(eventually) is useful to all but the most casual of viewers.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>My target audience is the casual viewer, however. Secondary considerations (e.g. ball wear, choosing the batting order, fielder positioning) can wait. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>[(But probably not. I&#39;ve learned to steer away from controversy.) -Raymond]</p>
<p>As soon as a demonstrated non-bust is out there won&#39;t be much problem. (I refuse to debate whether or not 8.1 is non-bust and the uptake is too slow to have yet demonstrated one way or the other).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
