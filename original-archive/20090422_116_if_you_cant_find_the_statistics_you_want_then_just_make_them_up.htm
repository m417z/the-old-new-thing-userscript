<p> I found this number hard to believe, so I followed the <i>Source</i> link to the information from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. I found that, yup, in a May 2007 survey, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated that there were indeed 555,770 lawyers, 394,710 computer programmers, 299,160 chief executives, and 289,710 fire fighters in the United States. </p>
<p> Bloggers? Didn't even make the list. The number 452,000 appears nowhere in the Bureau of Labor Statistics report. </p>
<p> If you can't find the statistics you want, then just make them up (but claim somebody else provided them). </p>
<p> (The comments on the article suggest that the number 452,000 was derived from a Technorati report that there were 20 million blogs, of which only 4.7 million have been active in the past four months. The number 20 million was then combined with a Technorati survey of active bloggers in which 2% of them self-reported blogging as their primary source of income.) </p>
<p> <b>Pre-emptive snarky comment</b>: "Microsoft's current advertising campaign uses made-up numbers." </p>
<p> <b>Bonus statistics</b>: The claim that "It takes about <a href="http://technorati.com/blogging/state-of-the-blogosphere/blogging-for-profit/"> 100,000 unique visitors</a> a month to generate an income of $75,000 a year" is a total misrepresentation of the Technorati report. Technorati said that the average annual income among people with 100,000 <u>or more</u> unique monthly visitors is $75,000. That's like seeing that the average salary for a professional baseball player is <a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/yearly/yr2008a.shtml"> $3.1 million</a> and concluding that once you reach the big leagues, you'll be pulling down $3.1 million, when in fact&mdash;as the new guy&mdash;you'll most likely be making the baseball minimum wage of $390,000. </p>

		<p>That&#8217;s attrocious journalism. The response from &#8216;Mark Penn&#8217; at the bottom indicates that the data in the chart comes from actually three sources.</p>
<p>The Bureau of Labor Statistics is one, as you mention, but the total blogging population apparently comes from &#8216;a research report from eMarketer&#8217; and the 2% from the Technorati poll. For a start how do we even know if those two sources have the same definition of a blogger?</p>
<p>The Technorati poll also was international (&#8216;received 1,290 completed responses from 66 countries&#8217;), it is not clear whether the eMarketer one was too. If it wasn&#8217;t then you&#8217;re comparing statistics from two differenct populations, if it is international then the 452,000 figure is certainly an over estimation as it includes all international full-time bloggers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like trying to claim that your indie film is more successful than a prime-time TV show because the film&#8217;s international DVD sales are more than the TV shows domestic viewing figures.</p>
<p>Astonishing.</p>

		<p>Furthermore, if they really wanted to go w/ the Technorati figures, they should have at least taken 2% of the 4.7 million active blogs instead of the 20 million total (since the 2% applies to active bloggers).</p>

		<p>&quot;Blogging is my primary source of income&quot; = &quot;I got laid off 2 years ago, and I don&#8217;t do much but lounge on my sofa and eat Cheetos&#8211; oh I guess I wrote a blog post last week.&quot;</p>
<p>I mean, yeah, there&#8217;s the blogs like BoingBoing and Neatorama that probably pull in a good salary for their owners, but that&#8217;s a pretty tiny minority.</p>
<p>I also agree with Mark: Virtually everybody on the Internet is a blogger. Live accounts come with a blog, so do MySpace, Facebook, and LiveJournal. And Slashdot, for the geeky types. Arguably, Flickr and places like DeviantArt are blog sites. There&#8217;s no way that 2% of this group has blogging as their primary source of income.</p>

<p>Then the rest of the numbers should have come from Technorati too. Numbers from two different sources don&#8217;t belong in the same chart.</p>

		<p>One sentence that probably is not true but still unnerving: &quot;At some point the value of the Huffington Post will no doubt pass the value of the Washington Post.&quot; I suppose the writer envisions the value of the Huffington Post going steadily up; as a reader of The Washington Post, seeing it get thinner and thinner, and familiar names disappear, I picture it happening otherwise.</p>
<p>And to the extent the values converge it will have nothing to do with the bloggers, but rather that flight of advertising from print to the web.</p>

Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
