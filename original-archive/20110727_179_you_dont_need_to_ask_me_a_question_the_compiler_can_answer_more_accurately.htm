A customer reported having problems developing the correct
p/invoke signature for the
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/08/13/9867383.aspx">
<code>INPUT</code> structure</a>.
"The code works on 32-bit machines, but on 64-bit machines,
the call to <code>Send&shy;Input</code> returns
<code>ERROR_<wbr>INVALID_<wbr>PARAMETER</code>."
The sample code included the lines
</p>
<pre>
INPUT[] inputs = new INPUT[1];
inputs[0].type = INPUT_KEYBOARD;
...
int size = Marshal.SizeOf(inputs[0]);
if (!SendInput(1, ref inputs, size))
{
 Console.WriteLine("Failed with error {0}", GetLastError());
}
</pre>
</p>
<p>
My response was simply,
"I bet you are passing the wrong structure size.
Note that on 64-bit Windows, the alignment of the inner structures
is 8-byte rather than 4-byte.
Write a C++ program that does the same thing and compare."
</p>
<p>
The customer decided to read only the first sentence of my reply,
possibly the second, and ignore the third.
"So what size should the <code>INPUT</code> structure be on 64-bit
machines?"
</p>
<p>
There are a few
ways you can go about finding out the size of a structure.
</p>
<p>
One method is to ask Raymond.
This may work, but it makes Raymond rather grumpy
since it demonstrates that you are lazy and just want the answer
handed to you with no effort (or demonstration of understanding)
on your part.
</p>
<p>
Another method is to sit down with the structure definition
and work out the size on a piece of paper,
bearing in mind that various <code>#pragma pack</code> directives
can change how the structure packing is applied.
</p>
<p>
But the easiest way to get the size of a structure is to use
the <code>sizeof</code> operator, because that is after all
the method the compiler uses.
To get the same value as the C++ compiler,
just ask the C++ compiler!
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
#include &lt;stddef.h&gt;

int __cdecl main(int argc, char **argv)
{
 printf("the size is %d\n", sizeof(INPUT));
 printf("the offset of mi is %d\n", offsetof(INPUT, mi));
 return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
You can now use this amazing technique to answer

		<p>Some people are C++phobic. I wish there was an easy way to fix that, but I know when I&#39;m not working on a C++ project I&#39;d normally find it easier to calculate the structure size myself than open the C++ compiler.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t understand this &#8212; I don&#39;t write in C++ or C# much, but I see that even the erroneous code is already using SizeOf. &nbsp;What am I missing?</p>

		<p>Of course, this is the wrong question. Marshal.SizeOf would give the right answer, <em>if their managed definition of the INPUT struct were correct</em>. And if it&#39;s not, passing a different size will just make it harder to debug (actually, it&#39;ll probably just cause an access violation).</p>
<p>The size being wrong is just a side effect.</p>

		<p>I agree with Random382 &#8212; you need to fix the structure itself at which point Marshal.SizeOf will return the right value. &nbsp;Of course the associated C++ code can give some nice hints as to what you did wrong, so there is value there.</p>

		<p>&quot;This may work, but it makes Raymond rather grumpy&quot; &#8211; yes, but you should be aware that there&#39;s an entire cadre of people here who relish the thought of making Raymond grumpy. My evidence, such as it is, is the continuing practice by some people of doing things that Raymond has already stated he doesn&#39;t like :-)</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t even bother writing a program to print the size anymore. I just attach to a process that compiles with the structure I want to test (usually you have a process like this, or otherwise you wound&#39;t be interested) and ask the debugger to print the sizeof() the structure.</p>

		<p>Since a .NET programmer (be it in VB.NET or C#) doesn&#39;t need to know how to write program in C++ (for example, I don&#39;t know how to write a program beyond the console program level students were taught to write in school&#8230; :P), I&#39;d say I&#39;m not surprised to see the customer ignore the third part.</p>
<p>Actually if this were a paid support request or the question is asked in these managed newsgroups, I&#39;d expect direct answer be supplied too.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
