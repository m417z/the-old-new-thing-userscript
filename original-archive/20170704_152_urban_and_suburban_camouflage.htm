When you have a city,
you also need infrastructure,
but the buildings for that infrastructure
tend to be ugly,
so you now have the need to camouflage your infrastructure
as something inoffensive.
And not just utilities need camouflage.
An oil company might need to disguise a well.

		<p>&#8220;2017 mid-year link clearance: municipal infrastructure edition&#8221;.</p>
<p>Some of the tall buildings in my area have cell tower antennas fasted to their four corners.  The antenna arrays are unobtrusive enough that you don&#8217;t notice them at first, but if you stop to look at the buildings, then they stand out readily (despite their attempts to mimic the building&#8217;s brick exterior).</p>

		<p>The first buildings in Edinburgh&#8217;s New Town were Thistle Court. Nos 1 &amp; 2 are now offices, but 3 &amp; 4 were gutted some time in the 1960s and turned into a substation.</p>

		<p>Verizon is doing a pilot program in the city where I live, involving large numbers of much smaller cells. Each cell is a utility pole with a single small antenna structure on top, and with various utility boxes mounted at about eye level. The ones in my neighborhood are fairly obtrusive because all of the normal utilities are underground. I imagine that they mostly blend in in older neighborhoods.<br />
There was some tension when they were first installed, because homeowners would step out of their houses one day and discover that a pole had been planted in their front yard (in pre-existing utility easements) without any notice. Fortunately, Verizon&#8217;s contractor turned out to be fairly receptive to relocating their poles upon the receipt of a complaint.<br />

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
