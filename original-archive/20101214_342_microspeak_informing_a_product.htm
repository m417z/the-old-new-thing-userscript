<p>Microspeak is not always about changing a word from a verb to a noun or changing a noun to a verb or even changing <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/08/18/9873193.aspx"> a noun into a verb and then back into a noun</a>. Sometimes it's about data compression.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> This testing won't inform <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.03.windowsconfidential.aspx"> RC</a>, but we'll need it  to inform an RTM release. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> First, you need to familiarize yourself with a less-used sense of the verb <i>to inform</i>, namely <i>to guide or direct</i>. A typical use would be something like "This data will inform the decision whether to continue with the original plan in Product&nbsp;Q." In other words, this data will be used to help decide whether to continue with the original plan. </p>
<p> But of course, at Microsoft, it's all rush rush hurry hurry no time for slow sentences just get to the point. So we drop out a few words from the sentence and instead of informing a decision about something, we just inform the thing itself: "This data will inform Product&nbsp;Q." </p>
<p> Therefore, the sentence at the start of this article is shorthand for "This testing won't inform [some sort of decision regarding] RC, but we'll need it to inform [that same decision in] an RTM release." In other words, the result of this testing won't have any effect on the release candidate, but it will be used to help make some sort of decision regarding the RTM release. </p>
<p> Another citation, taken from an executive slide deck: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><ul>
<li>Other take-aways     
<ul>
<li>What learnings can we get today to inform the release?     </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p> I like how that brief snippet combines three pieces of Microspeak: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/11/30/10097857.aspx"> <i>take-away</i></a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/01/06/9284334.aspx"> <i>learnings</i></a>, and <i>inform</i>. </p>

		<p>My first reading of your example phrase left me confused. If someone were speaking like that in a satirical way, I would be amused. If anyone were to take himself seriously while using this kind of phrase, I would quickly learn to avoid him. The world can wait 30 seconds for you to compose a clearly worded sentence. It is not right to simultaneously demolish the English language and to make oneself less understandable.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m sure that if the executive had just a few more seconds of precious time, it would have been &quot;Net net, what learnings can we get today to inform the release?&quot;</p>

		<p>I&#39;m beginning to suspect that MS is heavily infiltrated by the cult created by a bad science fiction writer last century. I&#39;ve read some of their papers and they&#39;re similarily infected by strange neologisms to confound outsiders. Please tell me that this isn&#39;t so&#8230;? ;-)</p>

		<p>Sounds like a redundant synonym for &quot;impact&quot;, in the relatively common meaning of &quot;have an effect on&quot;, to me.</p>
<p>e.g. &quot;This testing won&#39;t impact [the] RC, but it will impact an RTM release.&quot; or &quot;This data will impact the decision whether to continue with the original plan in Product Q.&quot; or &quot;This data will impact Product Q.&quot;</p>
<p>As I understand it, the last abomination could be written in English as follows: &quot;What can we learn today which will impact the release?&quot;. It even uses the same number of words.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>&quot;Impact&quot; is not quite the same here. &quot;Impact&quot; carries a negative connotation. &quot;Inform&quot; implies that this is an information-gathering exercise. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Removing words started in newspaper headlines. Fair enough &#8211; you have very limited space to convey a lot. Cutting out an &#39;and&#39; or &#39;does&#39; in this situation I can handle.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t believe it&#39;s done in spoken language though. How long does it take to say an extra word or two mid-sentence? Maybe a second. Maybe. It&#39;s ludicrous to take something understandable and make it confusing to save a second here and there.</p>
<p>As I grew up I noticed the local TV news reporters doing this. At first I found it amusing that people who&#39;s job it is to convey important information clearly started breaking grammar rules I learnt in grade 2. It&#39;s lost its lustre very quickly though. Now I can&#39;t stand to watch. Sometimes I have to sit and think hard, only to realise that they completely changed topic mid-sentence and were now talking about something totally different!</p>

		<p>&gt; If there is already a simple, easy-to-understand way of saying something, why substitute jargon that requires a special Microspeak dictionary to decode? </p>

		<p>In a way, yes, that is what I&#39;m arguing(although that&#39;s a bit of a leap from my post, in which I only meant to imply that it was of equal understanding): The jargon in question is understood by the people involved, and there isn&#39;t really a good word to describe this sense: as you point out, it&#39;s a shorthand for about 5 more words (quite a lot when it comes to discussion in a meeting).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
