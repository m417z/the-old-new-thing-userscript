In the discussion of the
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160503-00/?p=93397">
MS-DOS game that required 32 XMS handles</a>,
it was suggested that a solution to the problem of figuring
out which handles could be used as local handles
without conflicting with existing global handles
was to suck the brains out of the XMS driver,
and thereby have full information about all the
outstanding handles.
From there, Windows 95 could create new handles
that were guaranteed not to conflict with
existing handles.
</p>
<p>
Windows 95 used Windows 3.1 as its starting point,
and the way Windows 95 took over from the MS-DOS XMS
driver matches the way Windows 3.1 did it.
Windows 3.1 had to be able to coexist with third party
XMS drivers,
so it took a conservative approach.
There was in fact a "brain dump" interface for
sucking the brains out of the real-mode driver,
and if the MS-DOS XMS driver supported it,
Windows 3.1 used the "brain dump" interface
as a shortcut to the
"allocate all the remaining XMS handles" loop.
On the other hand, it didn't go the extra mile
and use this information to manufacture new
local XMS handles because there was no scenario
that required it.&sup1;
</p>
<p>There were no major applications that would have
taken advantage of having a larger set of local
XMS handles,
probably because the XMS specification itself
cautioned programs that the number of XMS handles
is limited and programs should use a small number
of large XMS blocks instead of a large number of
small XMS blocks.
Programs which followed the recommendation
of the XMS specification would not have benefited
from a large number of local XMS handles,
which meant that there was little demand for
a large number of local XMS handles.
</p>
<p>
Furthermore,
all of the Windows 3.1 protected-mode
kernel was written in assembly language,
so there was a natural reluctance to go
in and make large changes of marginal benefit.
I was responsible for the Windows 95
XMS driver, and there were things in that driver
that really needed to be done, but adding support
for more local XMS handles was not one of them.
</p>
<p>
That's why Windows 95 didn't try to be awesome
about local XMS handles.
So far, in all of the application compatibility
investigations,
only one application would have benefited from it,
and there was already a workaround that people
were comfortable with:
Run the game in MS-DOS mode.
</p>
<p>
&sup1;On the other hand, Windows 3.1 happily took
advantage of the brain dump interface for the
<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_memory">
expanded memory</a> driver
because a lot of important programs
used expanded memory and would take advantage
of more such memory if it were available.
Adding more expanded memory was such a big
deal that people actually spent real money
buying
<a HREF="http://pcguide.com/ref/ram/umaEMS-c.html">
expansion cards whose sole purpose
was to add more expanded memory to your PC</a>.</p>

		<p>Yep. Yep. Those days with all those HIMEM.SYS, EMM386.SYS, UMB and MEMMAKER were quite hectic. Lots of words for a lot of nothing.</p>

		<p>Yup, requires multiple reboot to check which setting gives more conventional memory.</p>
<p>Then again, those programs / drivers does not announce now much conventional memory they still need when loading high, and whether they&#8217;ll hang when you try to load them there. The only way to find out is to actually try to load them in HMA/UMB.</p>

		<p>The best thing about those days is that the people with a clue had computers that worked better than the people without. It was quite easy to evaluate whether someone knew anything about computers or not. Making it easier for everyone to setup a computer has made it harder. I always cringe when someone says that they are going to build their own computer, when they mean they are going to assemble it from parts. I assume cabinet makers feel the same way about people who are proud to assemble a monstrosity from IKEA and proclaim that they built it.</p>

		<p>For the average Joe, it was fun to get familiar with this without access to the web and playing with the startup files to create all possible combinations to optimize his various DOS programs: load or skip loading in HMA, UMB, load or skip EMM386, and other dozen drivers &#8211; MSCDEX, PS/2 and serial mice, Sound Blaster compatible sound with right IRQs and DMA channels, ASPI driver as needed. Manual tweaking almost always gave better results than memmaker.</p>

		<p>Particularly as neither MEMMAKER nor QEMM&#8217;s optimiser (I forget its name) included environment blocks in their calculations, they would over-estimate how much they could load into a particular UMB.</p>

		<p>Oh, yeah, those were (not) the days.<br />
I had five different startup configurations defined, and that was before you got into the question of whether or not to load the mouse driver, or what mode the sound card should be put in (because those things could be done later and didn&#8217;t need support in config.sys). Switching from one game to another quite often meant you had to reboot in between to get the right config.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
