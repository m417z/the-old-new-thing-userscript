<p>The Office of Government and Commerce needed a new logo, and they hired a design firm to develop one for &pound;14,000. The conversations between the design company and their client may have gone something like this:</p>
<p> Designer: Okay, so here are some ideas we came up with. </p>
<p> Client: I don't like any of them. The lines are too thick.     I want something lighter, more friendly and less bureaucratic. </p>
<p> Second meeting. </p>
<p> Designer: Here are some variations that use thinner lines. </p>
<p> Client: Nope, these are all still ugly.     Give me something with more circles.     Less angular. </p>
<p> Third meeting. </p>
<p> Designer: We came up with some variations on your circle idea. </p>
<p> Client: No, we can't use these. They have colour in them.     A coloured logo would make our letterhead much more expensive. </p>
<p> And so on. Finally, the design team comes up with something the client approves of. Now it's time to order the mousepads and <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2008/04/24/nogc124.xml"> unveil the logo</a>. </p>
<p> Oops. </p>
<p> A friend of mine remarked, "This is why every advertising agency needs to have a review panel of twelve-year-old boys." </p>

		<p>It&#8217;s &quot;The Office of Government Commerce&quot;. Basically it&#8217;s the purchasing department. Like all purchasing departments, it actually wastes money by drawing out the process of drawing up contracts and pushes invalid technology choices on the basis that it &#8216;saves&#8217; money. In the short-term, maybe. In the long term, no, because you have to retrain everyone.</p>

		<p>That cost &#163;14,000? &nbsp;Does no one in the agency know how to use Photoshop? &nbsp;I could have come up with that in an hour, and I have no experience in graphic design.</p>

		<p>These comments remind me of what happened when the Lucent logo was revealed. People said: &quot;they gave a brush with red paint to a 5-year old and they ask him/her to draw a circle&quot;. This being said this became one of the most recognized logo. I also own Photoshop but I have no idea on how to create a branding image. In my opinion the &quot;stupid red circle&quot; was money well spent (until my compatriotes decided to buy the company!).</p>

		<p>This remembers me of the case of the Institute for Oriental Culture Studies from a Brazilian university. Having &quot;oriental&quot; in the name, it was almost natural to place a rising sun and a pagoda in their logo.</p>
<p>However, common sense was not natural to the person who drew the logo and to the person who approved it.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, their site is now offline. Their old logo still lives: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://search.live.com/images/results.aspx?q=instituto+de+estudos+orientais" rel="nofollow">http://search.live.com/images/results.aspx?q=instituto+de+estudos+orientais</a></p>

		<p>Mike Dimmick:</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;ve got it backwards. &nbsp;Retraining is a short-term expense, because you do it once per individual. It can become a continual expense if you have a lot of churn and need to train every newcomer. &nbsp;But that&#8217;s still void if you were training newcomers in your current package, anyway.</p>

		<p>Nearly as good as the Seattle Streetcar&#8217;s original name: South Lake Union Trolley&#8230;or S.L.U.T.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been known to be a horny bastard,</p>
<p>but looking at that logo, even 90 degrees,</p>
<p>I do not see the giggle factor there.</p>
<p>Only thing I can assume is that there are people even more perverted than me out there. (no offense intended Raymond) *laughs*</p>
<p>It&#8217;s almost like how certain soccer moms or &quot;suits&quot; suddenly shout out in panic just because some blurry texture pattern resemble something remotely dirty if you squint your easy and think nasty.</p>
<p>A lot of the times I usually go (when reading such &quot;news&quot;): Oh, wow. I didn&#8217;t even see that one.</p>
<p>How come people that are supposedly so &quot;pure&quot; (purists?) tend to see more dirt than the average person? (or am I assuming wrong?)</p>
<p>It always amuses me.</p>
<p>If you go looking for something dirty, you will find it. In anything.</p>

		<p>In the UK, we&#8217;ve also got the qualification for &quot;Computer Literacy and Information Technology&quot;. The obvious abreviation would be CLIT but, for some reason, we have the awkward CLAiT instead.</p>

<p>Roger Hagensen, according to the dinosaur comic link of JohnCKirk, OGC seems to be an instant messaging smiley-type thing, which is partly why it&#8217;s so funny. &nbsp;Yes, the department existed, but for the logo to be arranged just so, is priceless and makes some of us wonder if it was deliberate.</p>

		<p>In the UK in the early 90s Ken Clarke, the then Minister of Education, had a brainwave: since university degrees were seen as more prestigious than degrees from polytechnics, all polys should be &quot;upgraded&quot; to universities. Bingo! Twice as many university graduates and all that was needed was a simple name change.</p>
<p>[spotting the flaws in this plan is left as an exercise for the reader]</p>
<p>Urban legend has it that when Newcastle Polytechnic was in line for inauguration as a university the preferred new name (since &quot;Newcastle University&quot; was already in use by the existing university) was &quot;The City University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne&quot;.</p>
<p>Sadly, the potential of this name was spotted slightly *before* launch, and the institution currently sports the less amusing moniker &quot;University of Northumbria at Newcastle&quot;.</p>

<p>Could you have? Really? given a blank sheet of paper and the name &quot;The Office of Government Commerce&quot; You would have designed this exact logo in 1 hour? (no time machine or 20/20 hindsight)</p>
<p>Creating an iconic logo is NOT easy, and I&#8217;m amazed it only cost 14K (roughly 28,000 of our worthless USDs)</p>

  And so on.

<p>Ween went through the same process. &nbsp;You can see (and hear) the outcome at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2004/02/weens_unrelease.php" rel="nofollow">http://slice.seriouseats.com/archives/2004/02/weens_unrelease.php</a>.</p>

		<p>The part everyone is forgetting is that the 14K isn&#8217;t to pay for the one logo they used, it also pays for the time spent on many designs not used.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
