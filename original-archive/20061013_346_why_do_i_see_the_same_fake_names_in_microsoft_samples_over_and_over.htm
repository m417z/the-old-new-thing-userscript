<p>If you see a fake name in a Microsoft sample web site, sample code, or sample documentation, you'll probably find that it's usually one from a small set of names. A sample corporation is typically called <a href="http://www.contoso.com/">Contoso</a> or <a href="http://www.fabrikam.com/">Fabrikam</a>. A sample store is typically <a href="http://www.wingtiptoys.com/"> Wingtip Toys</a>. (For a few weeks, they used Wingtip Toys on <a href="http://local.live.com/"> Windows Live Local</a>.) A sample bank is <a href="http://www.woodgrovebank.com/"> Woodgrove Bank</a>. And a sample software company is <a href="http://www.litwareinc.com/"> Litware, Inc</a>. (There are other fake names, but these are the ones you're most likely to see.)</p>
<p> Where did these fake names come from? </p>
<p> The Trademark Group in Microsoft's legal department. </p>
<p> The Trademark Group performed background checks on these names and cleared them for use as fictitious entities by Microsoft samples and documentation. The web sites for all of these "companies" redirect to the main <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/">Microsoft home page</a>. Having a pool of "standard fake names" means that Microsoft samples and documentation don't run into the problem of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/07/13/181733.aspx"> a fake URL turning into a porn site</a>. </p>

		<p>It&#8217;s actually a real problem, I have seen it happen again and again in websites my company built, we finally decided to buy many related domains and domain endings and redirect them to the real site so that no company will buy these domains and ask us (or other porn sites) to pay for them.</p>

		<p>Seeing as Microsoft is not using these names, and that some of them are in areas where Microsoft would have a hard time defending a trademark, what is to stop somebody setting up companies with these names?</p>
<p>I could just imagine &quot;Litware, Inc has a long-standing relationship with Microsoft Corp.&quot; showing up on the new Litware website. &quot;litwaresoftware.com&quot; seems to be available&#8230;</p>
<p>Why dont Microsoft just use obviously-fake names like &quot;Example Company, Inc&quot; or &quot;Insert real data here&quot;?</p>

		<p>I had need of a corporation for contracting purposes. &nbsp;Instead of choosing a generic Advance Technology Group, or some other combination of vague tech sounding words, I picked a name from a sample test..</p>
<p>Industrial MegaWidgets, if you must know.</p>
<p>Incorporation papers went through fine, but I never did try to trademark it.</p>

		<p>So, what happens when some enterprising businessman starts up a company and uses one of these names? &nbsp;The name has (some) national, even worldwide, recognition in certain circles thanks to its use by Microsoft. &nbsp;Microsoft would stand little chance of stopping the use of the name &#8211; it&#8217;s a fictitious name used in their literature. &nbsp;Then what happens if that business demands the url? &nbsp;There might be a financial cost, but it&#8217;d be possible or even likely that the domain would be taken and given to the legitimate business rather than fiction creator&#8230;</p>

		<p>I checked the federal trademarks at uspto.gov and found no trademarks for Wingtip Toys, Woodgrove Bank, Contoso, or Litware.</p>
<p>However, &quot;Fabrikam&quot; was registerd in May 2006 to Mark August of St. Charles, Missouri. The trademark is related to cabinets, so Microsoft&#8217;s Fabrikam Fine Furniture reference app may be conflict with this trademark.</p>

		<p>Fabrikam points to the main Microsoft Site, and I don&#8217;t think this is a good idea. &nbsp;The name Fabrikam immediately reminds one of the words &quot;Fabricated&quot; and &quot;fake.&quot; &nbsp;And then you go to Microsofts website. &nbsp;Not a good association. &nbsp;If anything, it should point to <a href="http://www.kernel.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.kernel.org</a>, or to <a href="http://www.google.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.com</a> :).</p>

		<p>Microsoft also maintains a list of &quot;safe&quot; people names to use for situations such as customer or employee names in sample databases. Many (perhaps all) of the names come from real Microsoft employees who volunteer their nnames for the purpose and sign legal agreements to that effect.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been working with Microsoft training materials (MCSE, MCSA, MCDBA, etc) for a goodly number of years, and I&#8217;m, of course, quite familiar with our friends &quot;Trey Research&quot;, &quot;Fabrikam&quot;, &quot;Contoso Ltd.&quot;, &quot;Ferguson &amp; Bardell&quot;, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>What I find more interesting is the use of names of real Microsoft employees in training materials. I remember some slides from an Exchange 5.5 MOC training course that referenced a &quot;Suzan Fine&quot;. I remembered her name, to me, the first name&#8217;s spelling is a bit odd (I think of &quot;Susan&quot; before &quot;Suzan&quot;). A buddy of mine handed me an article from a 1994 magazine, a couple of years ago, talking about this upcoming Microsoft email server product, &quot;Exchange&quot;, and a &quot;Suzan Fine&quot;, a product manager from Microsoft&#8217;s MAPI group, is quoted in the article.</p>
<p>After that, I started searching for other names that I found in course materals, and discovered that a lot of them were also real Microsoft employees (&quot;Kim Yoshida&quot;, &quot;Adam Barr&quot;, &quot;Tsvi Reiter&quot;, etc). As Microsoft employees started getting blogs, I enjoyed seeing postings from the &quot;example people&quot; from my classes. Apparently I&#8217;m not the only one (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://oakleafblog.blogspot.com/2005/10/microsoft-staff-moonlighting-as.html" rel="nofollow">http://oakleafblog.blogspot.com/2005/10/microsoft-staff-moonlighting-as.html</a>) who has caught onto the use of Microsoft employees in examples, course materials, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>(One of the Exchange classes came w/ a PST file with a bunch of messages in it dated, like, 1995, where various members of the Exchange team talked about restaurants in the Seattle, WA area they liked. I really enjoyed that one&#8230;)</p>

		<p>The creators of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; register all of the domain names they mention on the show. For example, there&#8217;s <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.mrxswebpage.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.mrxswebpage.com/</a> or <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.whatbadgerseat.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.whatbadgerseat.com/</a> or even <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.springfieldisforgayloversofmarriage.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.springfieldisforgayloversofmarriage.com/</a> :)</p>
<p>Also, homer&#8217;s email address <a href="mailto:chunkylover53@aol.com">chunkylover53@aol.com</a> is apparently owned by one of the writers (though I&#8217;ve never actually tried emailing it)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
