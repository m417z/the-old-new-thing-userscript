<p>In London, some of the most expensive real estate is in neighborhoods <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/world/europe/a-slice-of-london-so-exclusive-even-the-owners-are-visitors.html?_r=1"> where relatively few people actually live</a>. According to one company's estimate, 37% of the the residences have been purchased by people who merely use them as vacation homes, visiting only for a week or two per year and leaving the building empty the remainder of the year. In other words, the people who can afford to live there choose not to.</p>
<p> This same phenomenon is reported in other cities. For example, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/12/nyregion/paying-top-dollar-for-condos-and-leaving-them-empty.html"> only 10% of the condos in the Plaza Hotel are occupied full-time</a>. </p>
<p> Another example of a house with nobody living inside is the case where the house is a fa&ccedil;ade for an industrial building, most commonly an <a href="http://weburbanist.com/2013/02/12/faux-facades-fake-buildings-hide-trains-power-more/"> electrical substation</a> or <a href="http://www.messynessychic.com/2013/01/29/the-fake-townhouses-hiding-mystery-underground-portals/"> a subway ventilation shaft</a>. </p>
<p> I find both categories fascinating. </p>

		<p>Venice is another city that has lot of its houses unoccupied much of the time. The city&#39;s population has dropped considerably over the last 40 years.</p>

		<p>I read a story last week about some Russian dude with a 1.4 billion dollar yacht (reported cost, all decked out, and yea: 10^9). Anyways, how much land does a man require?</p>

		<p>Amateurs! In Australia, the middle class keep empty homes in middle and lower class areas, just for the capital gains. The last few censuses have counted close to a million of them.</p>
<p>(Mind you, our bubble outdoes the infamous one in the US, and prices have only recently started to decline)</p>

		<p>Another example is when a telephone central office has to be placed in a residential neighborhood, an example being the Anaheim 17 station on this page:</p>

		<p>@Joao probably right in a lot of cases but also a matter of what do you do when you are a 100+ millionaire? You can only by so big a house before it becomes stupid say $10M max. What do you do with your other 90+ M? Buy more houses. Rather than go to hotels in various cities you drop money and buy property in them. You can then say oh we vacation in our Florence home, I occasionally have business in Manhattan so have a nice flat there etc.</p>
<p>If you are a billionaire you are likely raking in 10&#39;s of millions a year so dropping $10M on a house every once and a while isn&#39;t that big a deal.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
