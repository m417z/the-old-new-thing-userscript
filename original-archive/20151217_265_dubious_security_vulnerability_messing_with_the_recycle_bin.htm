<p>
Today's dubious security vulnerability goes like this:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
The $RECYCLE.BIN directory can be used to drop files into
an arbitrary directory.
To do this, navigate into a user's Recycle Bin directory
and find a file in it.
Edit the file to contain the data you would like to drop,
and edit the Recycle Bin database to say that the file in
question should be restored to a directory of your choosing.
When the user opens the Recycle Bin in Explorer,
right-clicks the file, and selects Restore,
the file will be dropped in the directory you chose.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The idea here is that you can falsify the information
in the Recycle Bin so that it looks like the attack file was
deleted from the attack directory, so that "restoring" the file
will drop the file into the directory.
</p>
<p>
Sure, but you're only messing with yourself.
</p>
<p>
It's like going into your kitchen pantry,
opening a box of cookies,
and replacing the cookies with rocks.
Now, the next time you go to the pantry to get some cookies,
you open the box, and instead of cookies, you get rocks!
W00t! Security vulnerability!
</p>
<p>
There is no vulnerability here, because you are just
attacking yourself.
You have access to the pantry because it's your pantry.
You have access to the box of cookies because it's your box of cookies.
If you want to put rocks in a box labeled <i>Cookies</i>,
then more power to you.
</p>
<p>
There is no elevation because the Restore operation will not
be able to drop the file anywhere the user doing the restoring
doesn't already have write access to.
If you say "Um, yeah, this file should be restored to C:\Windows,"
then the Restore operation will say,
"Sorry, you don't have access there.
But if you enter the administrator password,
then I can do it."
</p>
<p>
The default security on the Recycle Bin folder grants access
only to Administrators, System, and the owner of the Recycle Bin.
Therefore, the only person who can carry out this attack is the
user himself.
And if you want to drop a file in a directory
a much easier way to do this is to use the <code>COPY</code> command.</p>

		<p>It could be part of a sort of &#8220;social engineering&#8221; attack:</p>
<p>&#8211; User deletes a file<br />
&#8211; Malware edits the recycle bin to say it came from C:\WINNT<br />
&#8211; User changes his mind and decides to restore the file<br />
&#8211; Windows asks for the administrator password<br />
&#8211; User trusts the UAC prompt because he trusts Windows, and the prompt is clearly for the operation he just requested<br />
&#8211; Profit!</p>
<p>If it weren&#8217;t able to show a UAC prompt, I&#8217;d agree that messing with your own recycle bin could not be considered a vulnerability. But IMHO UAC changes the rules a bit.</p>

		<p>@Cesar, that sounds, perhaps, a bit far-fetched.  It&#8217;s possible, but any time you trick a user into replying to the UAC prompt, then anything can happen.  Interesting scenario, though.</p>

		<p>The Malware itself could start the deletion, throw up a window like &#8220;now deleting all .DOCX files in My Documents&#8221;, then move the DOCX files to the Recycle Bin, messing with one of them along the way. The panicked user goes to the Recycle Bin, breathes a sigh of relief, selects all his DOCX files and tells Windows to restore them. &#8220;Huh? A UAC prompt? Oh well, whatever, as long as it gives me back my resum√©s and cover letters!&#8221;   And, boom.</p>

		<p>As Raymond is fond of saying, if malware is running on the users machine, it&#8217;s already on the other side of the airtight hatchway.  It&#8217;s not likely that UAC is going to slow it down much at this point.</p>

		<p>If you are able to execute code as the user (i.e. because you are a malware able to edit the users recycle bin) there are many ways to trick the user into confirming the UAC dialog. You could &#8211; for example &#8211; just wait for the user to download some .exe file that looks like an installer and replace it by your own code. A user who has the right to become Admin is likely to install some piece of Software sooner or later.</p>

		<p>The security-conscious user (ha!) would look at the Publisher field, assuming the original installer was signed correctly.</p>
<p>Then again, the security-conscious user would also notice that the restore target in the elevation request (it&#8217;s listed there, I checked) is not where they might expect.</p>

0. he disables any temptation through UAC (see <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/dd835564.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/dd835564.aspx</a>):<br />

1. he creates &#8220;standard&#8221; user accounts for them;<br />
2. he sets up SAFER: see <a href="http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/SAFER.html" rel="nofollow">http://home.arcor.de/skanthak/SAFER.html</a></p>

		<p>Not to mention that the UAC prompt and admin rights in general aren&#8217;t a serious target anymore. You can encrypt everything a user has and extort hundreds of dollars without ever needing admin rights, unless someone uses separate accounts for everything they do on a PC.</p>

		<p>Sure but what about automated attacks that operate on arbitrary files in the Recycle Bin without the user&#8217;s knowledge? It&#8217;s a low-chance thing, but the user may restore a file and make assumptions about its contents being benign, without knowing about the substitution. </p>
<p>If I were to leverage this, I would probably put some really nasty stuff in any .doc or .docx file that landed in the Bin database. The user would then be surprised to find a macro trying to run when they opened their restored document, and there&#8217;s again a non-zero chance that someone who hasn&#8217;t had their morning coffee yet will click &#8220;yes&#8221; on a dialog box not really thinking of the implications. </p>
<p>That said, there are likely much more reliable ways to put the moves on someone who hasn&#8217;t had their morning coffee&#8230;</p>

		<p>I think it can probably be problematic for someone who is mandated to use EFS (say officers of government bodies which process sensitive data) if the Recycle folder is not encrypted with the user&#8217;s credential.</p>
<p>Not sure if that&#8217;s the case, though.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
