<p> My colleague who switched from program management to programming has this to say about unintended consequences: </p>
<blockquote class="m">
<ol>
<li>My wife says that I am much more pleasant to be around. </li>
<li>My social skills appear to have become a lot better, which is really counter-intuitive to the standard image of a developer. </li>
</ol>
<p> My take on this is that I developed through the needs of my job as a lead program manager the ability to talk to anyone at any time to get a particular issue dealt with, but that I didn't necessarily want to do this or enjoy the process. After work or on the weekends, my wife was hard pressed to get me to see other people. Now, there is no such issue. The reduction in forced human interaction is such that I am no longer overstretching my ability to interact with people, thus rendering me able to undertake those interactions and actually enjoy it. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Of course, this doesn't necessarily work for lifelong programmers, since they may not ever have developed these social skills to begin with! </p>

		<p>Keep in mind that most people react favorably to changes that they choose to make. If this guy was feeling a little burned out in his old job, his new job would make him feel a bit more energetic, and that would spill over to his non-working life.</p>

		<p>That is silly-speak. No-wonder he&#8217;s happier being a Dev without having to talk to people too much. &nbsp; Constrain your creativity to the code and avoid having to construct those sentences&#8230;</p>

		<p>All this means is:</p>
<p>a) He has the ego the size of Bill Gates.<br />
<br />b) He is not Bill Gates and is unhappy about that.<br />
<br />c) He does not like anyone he talks too.<br />
<br />d) Since he is not forced into talking to anyone (or anyone he doesn&#8217;t like &#8211; which is everyone &#8211; example c), he can use the patience he once used in the office around people he&#8217;s exposed too after work.<br />
<br />e) He likes producing things (programming) that are relevant and used versus a specification which is largely never used. &nbsp;<br />
<br />f) He&#8217;s really unfortunate that he &quot;overstretches&quot; his &quot;ability&quot; to interact with other people.</p>
<p>Too bad for him. &nbsp;Does your blog get interesting? &nbsp;I expected to find this entry on Dr. Phil&#8217;s website.</p>

		<p>I know! It sounds horribly harsh, but can any rational person honestly conclude much other than this? Even if your afraid to say it? &nbsp;I mean, do we really need the day by day thoughts of an ex-program manager&#8217;s wife on his happiness? &nbsp;LOL. &nbsp;It&#8217;s just not that fulfilling from someone I respect.</p>
<p>In other news, Dr. Phil solves all Windows problems! &nbsp;user-error.dll</p>

		<p>Perhaps this could be seen as Raymond just sharing some parts of what he find interesting IRL when he stumbles across them, and not only hard-code Windows programming? I mean, c&#8217;mon people, it&#8217;s a blog. There is a person, a real living human behind the blog.</p>
<p>I personally found this entry amusing &#8211; a piece that pointed in the complete opposite direction of the stereotype of a developer. Raymonds punchline does however remove any and all hopes for us that started programming at young age. :-)</p>

		<p>Oh good god. &quot;interesting&quot; for the average person usually doesnt mean digging deep into the innards of windows, and even for the less average people that read this blog it gets tiring. By the way, do you not have a sense of humor? This entry is obviously not completely serious.</p>

		<p>&gt;Are you making this stuff up? Nobody I&#8217;ve ever met speaks like that.</p>
<p>Also note, no one said he actually *spoke* those words, they could have been in an email or even an (gasp) old school style paper letter. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve noticed that when I write emails I tend to use more formal (and flowery) language.</p>

		<p>Harsh, Philip</p>
<p>Although I understand very little of the code samples Raymond presents, the essence of the posts and many of the comments (except your&#8217;s) have been helpful. &nbsp; </p>
<p>I read, I think &quot;Hmmmmmm&quot;</p>
<p>To have possible explanations to what was heretofore a mystery, to me, is always a gift.</p>

		<p>What what?&gt;</p>
<p>Thanks for clarifying my original point. &nbsp;Say and spoke are two different things. &nbsp;But that&#8217;s neither here nor there.<br />
<br />Reading through this and the comments I can fully understand where this guy is comming from. &nbsp;Managing any group of people inevitably taxes on your social stamina. &nbsp;In any said group, it&#8217;s likely there will be one person you don&#8217;t like and are forced to deal with to resolve a problem. I can understand how this would eventually tax your social stamina. &nbsp;In any normal situation you&#8217;d probably just not deal with people you don&#8217;t like.</p>

		<p>Okay, I&#8217;ll be the one positive note here, and say &quot;WORD!&quot;.</p>
<p>I love talking with content experts about how things should be done. &nbsp;I loathe having to actively manage people, and having to be the go-between between the grunt troops and upper management.</p>
<p>Some people are introverts. &nbsp;There is no problem with that. &nbsp;But there is this misguided concept that we should take senior programmers and make them into managers, just because they have many years&#8217; experience. &nbsp;Some people &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; to code.</p>
<p>I am one of those people. &nbsp;Coming up on eighteen years in the industry, I prefer architecting, designing, and coding. &nbsp;Colleagues are nice, but managing them, getting estimates from them, and the like, is not up my alley. &nbsp;I have resisted the move up to &quot;management&quot;, much to the detriment of my career &#8212; but I am happier for it.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
