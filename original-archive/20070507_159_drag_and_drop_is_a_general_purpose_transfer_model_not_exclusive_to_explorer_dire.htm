<p>If you've designed your program so that it assumes that the the only thing a user can use drag/drop for is dropping your object into a file system directory, then you've already lost.</p>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#428702"> piers wants to be able to determine the destination of a drag/drop operation</a>. From the description, it appears that what piers really wants is the destination <strong>path</strong>, but who says that the drop destination is a directory? The user might have dropped the item into an email message, onto an FTP site, onto a Web site (via Web Folders), or even a directory on an operating system running inside a virtual machine! </p>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#428714"> The follow-up question makes things even more confusing</a>. If the user drops the files into an FTP site or some other virtual folder, how is your program supposed to be able to restart the transfer? You don't know the user's password on that FTP site. You don't know how to restart that virtual machine and log the user on. And even if you did, you don't know how to write to a directory on a virtual machine; only the virtual machine manager knows how to do that. There are an infinite variety of potential virtual folders out there; I doubt you know how to (or even have the ability to) push your data into each one. </p>
<p> Once the user drops the data object, the remainder of the transfer is a private matter between the data source and the drop target. It's not like a data source can tell all drop targets, "I want to take over the transfer," because even if the drop target agreed to it, that still leaves the data source the problem of  figuring out how to carry out that take-over. </p>
<p> What is my recommendation?&Dagger; </p>
<p> The data object in the drag/drop loop should follow the standard shell data object transfer protocol so that users can drop the object into an email message, onto an FTP site, etc.&deg; </p>
<p> For the special bonus behavior, I would create a drag/drop hook. A user that wants to do a transfer mediated by your program can use the right mouse button&dagger; to drag. When the drop occurs, a context menu will appear, including the drag/drop hook you created. That hook would create a new item called something like "Copy with CoolProgram". (Of course, the hook adds this item only if the data object identifiers itself as coming from CoolProgram.) If the user selects "Copy with CoolProgram", then you can do your CoolProgram-mediated copy. </p>
<p> <b>Nitpicker's corner</b> </p>
<p> &dagger;More properly, the secondary mouse button, since you may have swapped buttons. </p>
<p> &Dagger;<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/13/664448.aspx">Notice that I do not assert</a> that all Microsoft products follow my recommendation. Note also that this is my personal recommendation, not the official position of Microsoft Corporation. </p>
<p> &deg;And you should already understand the standard shell data object transfer protocol before you go off and design a nonstandard one. </p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Trivia: The Windows 95 online help actually used the words &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; when referring to the mouse buttons. I thought that was pretty cool. However, by Windows 98 (IIRC), the words were changed back to &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot;, presumably because users found &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; too confusing.</p>

		<p>@dsn: agreed, it&#8217;s become a game of guessing what the nitpickers will say. They are funny people, those nitpickers.</p>
<p>That said, this was valuable. &nbsp;It makes me want to go back and revisit every drag/drop functionality I&#8217;ve ever implemented.</p>

		<p>Is it just me or does it seem that the number of comments on one if Raymond&#8217;s is reduced in direct proportion† to the number of nitpickers clarifications?</p>
<p>†No, I have not validated this assertion mathmatically it just feels that way to ME.</p>

		<p>Thanks for this, too often people think too narrowly and forget the OS lets you do unusual things that most programmers fail to expect. Unfortunately if you&#8217;re on a deadline &quot;add drag-and-drop support&quot; turns into &quot;add support for drag-and-drop to Explorer windows since that&#8217;s all we&#8217;re testing&quot;, but that&#8217;s the same for much more than this situation&#8230;</p>

<p>It&#8217;s unfortunate that he NEEDS a nitpicker&#8217;s corner. Ideally, people would be able to figure out the nitpicks on their own&#8230;</p>

		<p>WikiServerGuy: the best place to start is probably &lt;a href=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/programmersguide/shell_basics/shell_basics_programming/transferring/transfer.asp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/programmersguide/shell_basics/shell_basics_programming/transferring/transfer.asp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&#038;gt" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/programmersguide/shell_basics/shell_basics_programming/transferring/transfer.asp&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&#038;gt</a>;. &nbsp;Note that having read that and most of the pages linked from it, however, I still find shell drag &amp; drop handling confusing, and tend to stick to the most basic possible method (i.e., put the data I want to drop into a temporary file and just give the shell the filename).</p>

		<p>Best to think about it the other way around.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t worry about where it dropped &#8211; give the D&amp;D the data and let the shell or other target do what it wants. &nbsp;Just give the shell item array and FileContents for each item. &nbsp;You can delay-render so you get called at drop-time.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
