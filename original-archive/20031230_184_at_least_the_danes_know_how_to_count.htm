		<p>You should take a look at the Danish school grading system. That&#8217;s one very weird system. Take a look at it here -&gt; <a target="_new" href="http://www.vitusbering.dk/sw8217.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.vitusbering.dk/sw8217.asp</a></p>

		<p>But if you go to other countries such as Ireland, &quot;half four&quot; means 4:30. As in, &quot;meet me in the lobby at half four.&quot;</p>
<p>I once asked about that phrase on another board, and depending on the country it may mean 4:30 or 3:30.</p>

		<p>Yeah, half four in Swedish would mean 3:30 (because you&#8217;re half-way to 4 from 3), but we only use it when talking about time (unlike the Danes). Half four in Irish sounds like an abbreviation for half past four.<br />
<br />After studying some East-Asian languages (Thai and Chinese), the simplicity in just saying 10-5 (for 15) or 5-10 (for 50) makes me want to use it in Swedish and English as well.<br />
<br />I remember some years back it was said that the Chinese students were so much better at maths (than westerners) just because the counting system was easier. I wonder if that makes the Danes even worse at maths?</p>

		<p>People commonly read the numbers from left to right like &quot;five oh&quot; for 50 and &quot;one five&quot; for 15 in English. 10-5 and 5-10 just sounds too unintuitive.</p>

		<p>&#8216;en og halvfjerdsindstyve&#8217;<br />
<br />is a very old way of saying numbers in Denmark and is most often used in trading &#8211; especially when you want to &#8216;stress&#8217; the value. </p>
<p> When we need to be correct with number saying (on checks for instance) we use the other &#8216;way&#8217;: syvtien (syv-ti-en -&gt; seven-ten-one). </p>
<p>In every day tongue we use the common way: &#8216;en og halvfjerds&#8217;.<br />
<br /> This is of course common Danish (Rigsdansk) &#8211; if you venture into the countryside you will encounter other systems. Even though we are only a little over 5 million in population, and span nothing more than a bread crumb on a world map, we still have dialects used everyday, which are quite impossible to understand for non-dialected Danes. If we were to have a general vote on the subject, I think most younger Danes would just as much scrap the language and use English instead. </p>

		<p>Andreas, &quot;halv fire&quot; is 3.30 in Danish too, and  contemporary Danish doesn&#8217;t really use the construction anywhere else.</p>
<p>The etymology of &quot;halvfjerdsindstyve&quot; (halvfjerde sinds tyve) is fairly specialized knowledge, and while &quot;halvfjerdsindstyve&quot; may not be completely dead yet, it is clearly being replaced with &quot;halvfjerds&quot;.</p>
<p>Both &quot;halvfjerde&quot; (three and a half) and &quot;sinds&quot; (times) on their own are long dead in contemporary Danish.<br /></p>

		<p>&gt; People commonly read the numbers from left to right like &quot;five oh&quot; for 50 and &quot;one five&quot; for 15 in English.</p>
<p>Fifteen is hardly intuitive (5-10), besides in English fifty and fifteen sounds quite similar if you&#8217;re not used to the Germanic sounds. I mean it&#8217;s much more (mathematically) intuitive to say X (times) 10 (plus) Y.</p>

<p>My vote goes to the first country to adopt duo-decimal &lt;g&gt;  I&#8217;m sure learning math would be much easier in base 12, once you get past the &#8216;counting on your fingers&#8217; stage.  Probably too late for anyone to take the jump now though (although if we can teach reading through phonics&#8230;)</p>

		<p>hmm, the Mandarin number system isn&#8217;t radically different from English.<br />
<br />shi 10<br />
<br />er shi 20<br />
<br />san shi 30<br />
<br />bai 100<br />
<br />er bai 200<br />
<br />san bai 300<br />
<br />qian 1000<br />
<br />? 10000 (I forget the word for this one, can&#8217;t find it in my dictionary)<br />
<br />yi 100 million</p>
<p>You just take those number words and aggultinate them just like in English</p>
<p>si qian er bai jiu shi qi<br />
<br />4 thousand 2 hundred 9 ten 7<br />
<br />4,297</p>
<p>Although in informal speech, you&#8217;re likely to hear just &quot;si er jui qi&quot; meaning &quot;four two nine seven&quot;.</p>

		<p>No, it&#8217;s not radically different, but different enough for one to get a better grasp on the relationship between the numbers. Besides it was a long time ago this was said (~15 yrs) and I may remember it incorrectly.<br />
<br />Anyway the word for 10000 in Mandarin is w&#224;n.</p>

		<p>Well, speaking of Danes and counting there&#8217;s another funny point to make.</p>
<p>In English you have million (10^6) followed by billion (10^9) and then trillion (10^12) etc., but in Danish (and probably other languages) it is million (10^6), milliard (10^9), billion (10^12), billiard (10^15) etc. So in a way it is easier for us Danes to name really large numbers.</p>
<p>How would you say septilliard (10^45) in English? Of course you could always trump this by a googol or perhaps even the elusive fantasillion.</p>
<p>Often journalist and other people not interested in such mathematical details gets it completely wrong when translating big numbers from English to Danish. So if the US military budget is $400 billion ($4*10^11) they just use the same number in Danish increasing the budget figure to an even more insane number ($4*10^14).<br /></p>

		<p>Multipliers beyond (American) trillion have yet to appear in common usage. (But just wait a while; I&#8217;m sure our national debt will hit the next multiplier sooner or later.)</p>
<p>Nobody really uses the fancy words like &quot;septillion&quot;; the only people who commonly use numbers that large are scientists, who are content to use scientific notation.</p>
<p>I believe Britain switched from European &quot;billion = 1 million million&quot; to the American &quot;billion = 1 thousand million&quot;.</p>
<p>Ironically, the current American system was based on the French system, and then the French changed their system to match the British, and now the British changed their system to match the Americans&#8230; Perhaps it&#8217;s time for the Americans to change to match the Germans?</p>

		<p>Just adding a little to the mix: In Polish, 4:30 is &quot;wpol do pietej&quot;, literally &quot;one half (hour) to five&quot;. </p>
<p>The Polish number system is fascinatingly complex. In addition to the usual &quot;singular&quot; and &quot;plural&quot;, there are actually two types of plural: 2 to 4 of something, and 5 or more of something. Consider:</p>
<p>One apple = jablko (nominative singular)<br />
<br />Two apples = dwa jablka (nominative plural)<br />
<br />Five apples = piec jablek (genitive plural)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
