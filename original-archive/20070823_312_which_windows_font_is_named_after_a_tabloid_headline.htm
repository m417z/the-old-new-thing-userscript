		<p>I mean, that&#8217;s my font for all chat/IM programs &#8212; it is easy on the eyes to read, and a nice break from others. Sure, it may not be &quot;professional&quot;, but I don&#8217;t write documents in it either..</p>

		<p>Because comic sans is really, really ugly.</p>
<p>I think the general gist of it is that a lot of people thing it&#8217;s &#8216;fun&#8217; so whenever you see an invitation to a lousy party or something, it&#8217;s in comic sans.</p>

		<p>I think the problem a lot of people have with Comic Sans is that it has a tendency to be overused. It&#8217;s great when used for kids party posters or in a cartoony style game etc. but the number of times I&#8217;ve seen it used in more serious newsletters or in university lecture slides makes me sick of the sight of it :)</p>
<p>Having said that I&#8217;m a bit of a typographical nazi in many regards &#8211; I get very uppity when people mix fonts, underline titles and insert random WordArt just because the feature&#8217;s there and it looks &#8216;cool&#8217;&#8230;</p>

		<p>I have to say that the Chalkboard vs. Comic Sans picture did nothing to convince me that Comic Sans was a &quot;good&quot; font because Apple &quot;copied&quot; it. &nbsp;It&#8217;s more like Apple took the /idea/ that a fun font is useful and then designed a fun font. &nbsp;The individual letters look much crisper and cleaner in Chalkboard.</p>
<p>That said, however, I must state that my favorite font is Trebuchet.</p>

		<p>I think Georgia should be called Georgous. &nbsp;I use it for almost everything that doens&#8217;t need to be fixed width (for which I use Lucida Console exclusively). &nbsp;</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have much opinion on sans-serif fonts, except that in general, I avoid them where possible.</p>

<p>Probably driven insane by having to deal with the INS. &nbsp;If you think the I[b]R[/b]S is bad, just remember that they&#8217;re dealing mostly with citizens / voters, and the INS isn&#8217;t. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a &quot;fun font&quot; I like called Jester. &nbsp;Somewhat similar to comic sans (it&#8217;s comic, but it&#8217;s not a sans)</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.dafont.com/jester.font" rel="nofollow">http://www.dafont.com/jester.font</a></p>
<p>I agree that comic sans has unfortunately become a bit cliche in the past 10 years.</p>

		<p>Microsoft&#8217;s Core fonts for the Web are no longer available from the Microsoft website, as far as I know. However, since the EULA allowed redistribution, they can be obtained from places like <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/" rel="nofollow">http://corefonts.sourceforge.net/</a> and the like.</p>

		<p>[Simply enclose any text you want to be displayed in Comic Sans with the following HTML tags. To switch on Comic Sans use &lt;FONT FACE=&quot;Comic Sans MS&quot;&gt; and to switch it off use the familiar &lt;/FONT&gt;. You can, of course, combine the FACE attribute with the COLOR and SIZE attributes.]</p>
<p>That must be my problem. &nbsp;All this time I&#8217;ve been using the font-family attribute of CSS. Silly me ;)</p>

		<p>I love Georgia. Until recently it was the font I used to write code in, until Cambria came along. It sure beats that &quot;Courier New&quot; and &quot;Consolas&quot; fonts all the uncool 80-column-mindset programmers are using. :-)</p>
<p>Incidentally, the TrueType shell extension that will give you tons of information on any font you right-click (including the background history of well-known fonts) is still available here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeProperty21.mspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com/typography/TrueTypeProperty21.mspx</a></p>

		<p>All right! I&#8217;m glad someone else uses proportional fonts for programming. I&#8217;ve been using Georgia myself for a couple of years now. I will have to try out Cambria.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s shocking how many programmer&#8217;s editors fall on their faces when you try to use a proportional font. Luckily, my favorite editor, ActiveState Komodo [1] supports proportional fonts, as does Visual Studio.</p>

		<p>Where&#8217;s the love for fixed-width fonts??</p>
<p>Fixedsys and Courier New forever! (I could settle for Fixedsys New and Courier Newer, though).</p>
<p>I still don&#8217;t get Wingdings, though. Is there some decode procedure I&#8217;ve missed? And why are there 4, including Webdings, sets of these?</p>

		<blockquote><p>

<p>If you&#8217;re on GNUDebian GNU/Linux, shouldn&#8217;t you be using only GPL licensed fonts with your GNU/Iceweasel browser? You do know that non GPL software causes starvation in Kenya and the deaths of many innocent bytes, right?</p>

<p>Everyone knows that the GNUstallman-is-the-one-true-god bdf font collection is 900% more better than MS core fonts if you have 20/20 vision and don&#8217;t use it for more than 1 hour a week, and you get the source code, which means innocent Kenyan bytes are safe.</p>

<p>Presumably because back in the ANSI days when many of these fonts were developed, you were limited to 220ish characters per font. &nbsp;(And in fact many apps are *still* back in the ANSI days&#8230;)</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
