<p>When it's performance review season, all of a sudden you start getting mail about career management. What a coincidence. There are a variety of career management tools available, some mandatory, some optional. I gave one of the optional ones a shot, since it claimed to help me "manage my career and professional development", and as I already noted, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/07/8464281.aspx"> I appear to have been promoted by mistake all these years</a>, so maybe I should figure out how to get promoted for real.</p>
<p> This particular tool sends me to the Web site of an external company that was contracted by Microsoft to provide career guidance services. I went through the sign-up process and answered what seemed like a bazillion questions. You know you're in trouble when you're getting tired and the progress bar says that you're currently filling out questionnaire number 1 (of 3) and you're on page 4 (of 19). </p>
<p> Anyway, I make it through to the end of all the questions and the site offers suggestions as to what my ideal career would be, based on the personality characteristics I demonstrated in the questionnaire. </p>
<p> It says that I would do well working in the field of information technology and that the best company for me is one with well-established processes and procedures, where decisions are guided by practicality and pragmatism, a characteristic common to companies that are market leaders. </p>
<p> I don't know whether I should be disappointed that I didn't learn anything new or whether I should be relieved that I'm not missing out on my secret calling to be a topiarist or something. </p>
<p> (And I guess that having me work at Microsoft <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/12/02/google_hiring_practrices/"> plays right into Google's hands</a>, so it's a win-win.) </p>

		<p>One can practically see a dogbert-consultant selling this thing to some PHB at Microsoft&#8230;</p>
<p>I bet someone got a large bonus for this.</p>

		<p>Why, what a surprise that a Microsoft-contracted service tells its current employees that they are best suited in a job at Microsoft!</p>
<p>&quot;Gosh Steve, I don&#39;t know. &nbsp;Starting about a week ago people started leaving in droves for Google and Apple. We can&#39;t quite figure it out.&quot;</p>

		<p>I think that survey you filled is fake, and always gives everyone the same answer, to make you feel great to be a developer at Microsoft.</p>

		<p>When I took the ACT 32 years ago, it said my best career would be Forest Ranger. After all this time, I&#39;m concluding it was right.</p>

		<p>The long survey is just to fill time while they have someone look up your job title and write a recommendation that matches it.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
