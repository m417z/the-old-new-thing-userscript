<p>I dreamed that I was composing a blog entry about one of my dreams, but I had to do it on a toy cash register which had been paired to my computer. It turns out that this is difficult for a number of reasons.</p>
<p> For one thing, the cash register has only ten letters of the alphabet on it. You have to switch to the alternate keyboard for the rest. </p>
<p> Also, there is a backspace key but no other editing keys. </p>
<p> Finally, there is a key labeled &#8788; which changs the formatting to multi-person mode. Okay, this doesn't actually make typing more difficult, but it's still something unusual. </p>

		<p>Seriously Raymond, what are you eating before bed? Your dreams are way too detailed and technical. All I can usually remember from my dreams are vague shapes and feelings.</p>

		<p>The next difficulty level involved having to use Vim with that setup.</p>
<p>(well, actually, if you had an ESC key or the possibility to map it on some cash register key it would have made editing easier)</p>

		<p>I very rarely remember my dreams, but when I do, they&#39;re always weirdly detailed and just bizarre/insane. But it&#39;s great to read about someone else&#39;s bizarre subconscious insanity rather than just remember my own ;)</p>

		<p>Vim is easy in that setup, you only need two keys:</p>

		<p>&quot;I didn&#39;t push the key to find out.&quot; &#8211; Darned Chrome/Android doesn&#39;t even show me the symbol you used for the key. &gt;:( Time to switch to IE 11 on my mercifully unbricked Surface RT. :)</p>

		<p>These dream posts are cool.</p>
<p>In high school I got into making a dream journal, and the process of trying to remember my dreams in the morning as well as write them down actually caused my dreams to seem more vivid and stick in memory. Eventually, I even started having lucid dreams.</p>
<p>I&#39;m curious if Raymond, too, has lucid dreams from time to time&#8230;</p>

		<p>Still, your dream is much better than my brother&#39;s. He dreamed a battlecruiser from Starcraft (video game) flew above his school and carpet-bombed the playground. He didn&#39;t like this so he reversed time.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
