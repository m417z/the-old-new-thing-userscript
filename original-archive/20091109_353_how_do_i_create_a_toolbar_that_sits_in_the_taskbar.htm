<p>Commenter Nick asks, "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#677853">How would you go about creating a special toolbar to sit on the taskbar like the Windows Media Player 10 minimised toolbar</a>?"</p>
<p> You would look at the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms716696.aspx"> DeskBand API SDK Sample</a> in the Windows Platform SDK. </p>
<p> The magic word is DeskBand. <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb776819(VS.85).aspx"> This MSDN page has an overview</a>. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: I've seen some online speculation as to whether a DeskBand counts as a shell extension, because of the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/18/1317290.aspx"> guidance against writing shell extensions in managed code</a>. As with all guidance, you need to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/11/04/9917052.aspx"> understand the rationale behind the guidance</a> so you can apply the guidance intelligently instead of merely following it blindly off a cliff. Summarizing the rationale: Since only one version of the CLR can exist in a process, any shell extension which runs inside the host process which uses the CLR may inject a version of the CLR that conflicts with the version of the CLR the host process (or some other component in the host process) wants to use. Now that you understand the reason, you also can answer the question, "Is a DeskBand a shell extension (for the purpose of this guidance)?" Yes, because DeskBands (like all other COM objects registered as in-process servers) run inside the host process. </p>
<p> As another example of how understanding the rationale behind guidance lets you know when the guidance no longer applies: In the time since the original guidance was developed, the CLR team came up with a way to <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/CLR-4-Side-by-Side-In-Process-What-How-Why/"> run multiple versions of the CLR inside a single process (for specific values of "multiple")</a>. Therefore, if you use one of those "I won't conflict with other versions of the CLR inside the same process" versions, then you can see that the rationale behind the guidance no longer applies. </p>

		<p>Since only .NET 2.0 and .NET 4.0 CLRs can exist side-by-side in a process, would creating a .NET shell extension still cause a problem for anyone running .NET 1.0 or 1.1 applications?</p>
<p>(i.e. problems with open / save dialog).</p>
<p>I have no idea how widely used such applications are these days but I would have thought that was still a worry.</p>

		<p>Windows Explorer (and Internet Explorer) can also host DeskBands. They are placed in a standard rebar control. However on Windows 7, Windows Explorer insists on adding the RBBS_BREAK style to every band, so every band appears on a new row. If the user rearranges the bars and restarts Explorer the bands will be back to one per row. Vista doesn&#8217;t have this problem. Internet Explorer on Wnidows 7 is also OK.</p>
<p>Is there a way to prevent RBBS_BREAK from being added? IDeskBand::GetBandInfo doesn&#8217;t seem to provide such option. If not, is it a bug or there is a good reason for putting every band on a new line?</p>

		<p>And now, with 7, this may be better solved with help of the SuperBar (like WMP11 does).</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s not the only rationale for the guidance to not make a CLR shell extension. For example, doing so could cause the CLR to load into every process that shows a system Open or Save dialog box. That will significantly increase the memory footprint of every app on the box, which is a very bad idea.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if Explorer had been written to run DeskBands out-of-process, there would likely be no reason that you couldn&#8217;t write them with the CLR.</p>

		<p>After we create the DeskBand, the evil shell team will deprecate it in Windows 8 and suddenly pull the feature and force us to use Windows 7 taskbar functionality.</p>

		<p>@someone else I hate that SuperBar. It&#8217;s much less functional than the old WMP DeskBar from Windows XP/Vista. It doesn&#8217;t show you the currently playing song, you have to hover over it and wait for it to appear vs the DeskBar that is always visible, and it doesn&#8217;t provide a progress bar (let alone a user-interactive one, as the DeskBar did). I can&#8217;t understand why Microsoft changed it. It&#8217;s probably the only regressive change in Windows 7 and I hope it gets changed back in the next version.</p>

		<p>Agreed with Mark Jonson. &nbsp;But sadly it is hardly the only regressive change. &nbsp;Off the top of my head, other stuff I used to use that&#8217;s gone: &quot;Find in Library,&quot; &quot;Advanced Tag Editor,&quot; sidebar (you could already drag gadgets on the desktop, what&#8217;s the point of getting rid of the sidebar? Now I can&#8217;t keep them always-on-top), stocks gadget, column headers in explorer now appear only in details view, you can&#8217;t set group-by in explorer with column headers anymore, explorer advanced search options are gone, ultimate extras are gone&#8230;for what? Lower memory usage, Aero snaps, and jump lists? &nbsp;Pass.</p>

		<p>@Mark Sowul</p>
<p>Gadgets always on top in Windows 7</p>
<p>Right click on a gadget and click always on top.</p>
<p>Advanced Search Options in Explorer:</p>
<p>Enter your search in the top right hand box &#8211; you can also add search filters through the same box.</p>

		<p>@!wmp</p>
<p>No, that&#8217;s not a good thing. A good thing about it is that you decide whether to use it or not. Perhaps you didn&#8217;t know, now you do.</p>

		<p>@someone</p>
<p>No need to wait for Windows 8, deskbands are already deprecated in Windows 7. &nbsp;See for example:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb762067" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb762067</a>(VS.85).aspx</p>
<p>IDeskBand Interface</p>
<p>Deprecated. Used to obtain information about a band object.</p>
<p>Note &nbsp;We recommend that you use thumbnail toolbars in new development in place of desk bands.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
