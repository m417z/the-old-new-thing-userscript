<p>
A customer wanted the items for their context menu shell extension
to appear at the very top of the context menu.
They did this by ignoring the recommended insertion point
passed to the
<code>IContext&shy;Menu::</code><code>Query&shy;Context&shy;Menu</code>
function and just inserting their items at the top anyway:
</p>
<pre>
HRESULT MyContextMenu::QueryContextMenu(
    HMENU hmenu, UINT indexMenu,
    UINT idCmdFirst, UINT idCmdLast, UINT uFlags)
{
    ...
    // Insert at the top (position 0), ignoring the indexMenu
    InsertMenuItem(hMenu, 0, TRUE, &amp;mii);
    ...
}
</pre>
<p>
However, they found that this didn't work.
Their context menu item showed up in the middle.
</p>
<p>
Well, sure, their context menu extension broke the rules
and put their menu item at the top,
but that just gets them to the top of the context menu so-far.
But there are other shell extensions, and they may end up going
on top of yours.
And of course there's the shell itself, which has final say over
where things go,
and it might decide to
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20041004-00/?p=37673">
put things on top of yours as well</a>.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day, it's the context menu host that decides
where the menu items go.
If you break the rules, you may be able to trick the host for
a little while,
but you're living on borrowed time.
</p>
<p>
(And of course there's also the question

		<p>One wonders why the API allows its users to select an insertion point, even though based on the discussion above, it would be much more straightforward to not have an &#8216;insertion point&#8217; parameter at all, and just use the &#8216;recommended&#8217; value. Could you shed some light how the designers thought the insertion point parameter might be used in a non-selfish/constructive way?</p>

		<p>The insertion point parameter is useful if you are inserting multiple items and wish for them to be in a specific, contiguous order.</p>

		<p>I would imagine it exists to allow you to insert multiple menu items of your own in an order of your choosing, which is a very valid use case.</p>

		<p>It allows for <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20041007-00/?p=37633">context menu composition</a>, without which context menu shell extensions wouldn&#8217;t work at all.</p>

		<p>You could implement composition without this, if you planned for it from the get go.  What you can&#8217;t fix is where two or more apps want to claim the top spot, one always has to win. </p>
<p>The reason that I say that is for example, in my XAML based app, I have plug-ins and I allow them to change some context menus in certain situations &#8211; I&#8217;m even starting to experiment with it on Vive with projected XAML in VR space (* still think Microsoft should buy that company, neither here nor there).</p>

		<p>A stricter design would have abstracted away the parameters and just provided a instance of an interface like &#8220;IMenuInsertService&#8221; or something like that where you told it about your menu items and the shell (the implementer of &#8220;IMenuInsertService&#8221;) would insert the items at the Win32 level. IContextMenu goes all the way back to Windows 95 and back then you trusted developers not to be evil.</p>

		<p>If you create a static registry entry instead you can set the Position value to &#8220;Top&#8221; which is the best you can do while playing by the rules. MSDN says &#8220;If there are multiple verbs that specify this attribute then the last one to do so gets priority&#8221; which probably involves the unspecified registry enumeration order.</p>

		<p>But from the POV of a user, or, more realistically, of an enterprise admin who&#8217;s task is to configure a unified system image access the organization, this is a totally legitimate question. Do they have tools to ensure their preferred order of this menu?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve never seen one, and short of it being walled behind an elevated desktop all the abusive craplications attempting to make themselves first would just automate whatever that method was (via injected keyboard/mouse events if nothing else) in their attempt to win the war over every other scumbag dev doing the same.</p>

		<p>IMO, the admin only have interest in show/hiding items in context menu, not in the order itself.</p>
<p>As long as you limit the number of items to like 10 items, the sort order difference isn&#8217;t that huge.</p>

		<p>A fixed order has some advantages from a training point of view.  If you know the order, you can describe things more easily and screen shots are more accurate.<br />
However, having worked for an ISV who loved to try to own his customers&#8217; desktops, I&#8217;m quite happy that Microsoft keeps these folks at bay.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s impossible here because there can only ever be one thing on top, but in the super-topmost window example in the linked post, well, wasn&#8217;t that how Windows 1.0 worked? Tiled windows? Every window is on top, none are above the others, they just can&#8217;t all be maximized. Now it&#8217;s impossible, eh? How soon we forget, eh?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
