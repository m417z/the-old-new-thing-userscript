<p> In the Internet Explorer time machine video, I was struck by the remark, "Appearance-wise, very little had changed [in Internet Explorer 4] since IE3. Not much changed in terms of functionality, either." In fact, Internet Explorer&nbsp;4 was probably the most significant revision of Internet Explorer in its history, because that's the version that completely replaced the old layout engine with a new one code-named <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trident_(layout_engine)"> Trident</a>, the layout engine that continues to power Internet Explorer today. Another case of "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/25/141253.aspx">When you change the insides, nobody notices</a>." </p>

		<p>That&#39;s an incredibly stupid remark. I was about eleven when I upgraded from Internet Explorer 3 to Internet Explorer 4 in 1998, and I was completely stunned! The web didn&#39;t look the same after the upgrade! I was amazed by the fact that many (the majority?) of the web pages I used to visit had now become &#39;dynamic&#39; due to mouse-hover effects and things like that. (&quot;Is this how the web &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; looks?&quot;, I said to myself) Later upgrades (to IE5 and then to IE6) were not at all as impressive.</p>

		<p>By the way, back in ~1999, I recall that every time I had formatted the hard drive and reinstalled Windows 95, I used to install IE4 and then, after that, I installed IE5. Of course, I &lt;em&gt;could&lt;/em&gt; have skipped IE4 and upgraded straight to IE5, as far as the browser itself was concerned. The reason why I used this two-step upgrade process was that IE4 was shipped with &quot;Active Desktop&quot; (&quot;Windows Desktop Upgrade&quot;) that integrated Explorer with Internet Explorer (making folders and web pages open in the same GUI). I actually miss the times when the folder and browser GUI was the same one&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Jérôme Laheurte: You know that video was actually done by the Microsoft marketing guys, right? It&#39;s a parody of what they really go through when doinf the packaging.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t remember the original point of why they did it, though.</p>

		<p>Dare I say the bootscreen and packaging of Windows XP was really the best but it will always be subjective.</p>
<p>IE4! Oh those were the days when you got huge upgrades to your shell free of cost. I had seen Windows 98 on one of my cousin&#39;s PCs and was so jealous of the Quick launch and all that ingenious shell stuff and I couldn&#39;t believe my eyes when I installed IE4 and saw a Quick launch at the bottom of my Windows 95 Taskbar. And desktop folders contained desktop.ini with XML gibberish. The feel of Active Setup told me as a newbie IE4 was an enormous update under the hood. You can&#39;t say &quot;nobody notices&quot;.</p>
<p>Probably when MS changes the insides and assumes noone notices is why they fiddle and re-invent the UI in nearly every version of their products.</p>

		<p>There probably aren&#39;t many sites around anymore that look significantly different in IE4 as they do in IE3. After all, compare with the big difference between IE2 and IE3, in that IE3 can actually load the HTML for today&#39;s sites, even if it can&#39;t render it.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s the anachronism you mentioned, but I&#39;m pretty sure that picture of Jupiter in the next cube is from Cassini or Galileo. It doesn&#39;t look like any of the true colour Voyager pictures that I&#39;ve seen before.</p>

		<p>I miss how easy it was to change the boot graphic for Windows 95 (original, I seem to recall they tightened it up in one of the service packs that supported USB).</p>
<p>I remember spending an awful lot of time swapping palette entries on a 320&#215;480 bitmap so that the animation would show right.</p>
<p>By the time BIOS boot graphics were standard fare, this was long gone. Now you need a 3rd party tool to even get it there and that makes me sad.</p>

		<p>Changing the boot logo in Windows 95 was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t see the point of doing that today. I would like to spend as little time booting as possible. My desktop computer at home is on 24/7 and needs a reboot only when Windows updates happen..</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
