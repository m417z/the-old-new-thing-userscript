Windows 10 for Phone comes with a variety of
wallpaper images,
and
<a HREF="http://www.windowscentral.com/clever-easter-egg-windows-10-mobile-build">
the timestamp for all of the images is
April 4, 1975</a>.
What's the story behind that?
</p>
<p>
Originally, the wallpaper images didn't have a date-taken
in their EXIF metadata.
This meant that they were treated as taken on the file's
creation date,
which is the date you installed the operating system.
The problem is that if you upgrade your phone,
then the wallpaper image timestamps will be sorted
after the pictures you took with the old operating
system and before the pictures you took with the new
operating system.
</p>
<p>
This is rather unsightly,
so Windows 10 added EXIF metadata to sort all of
those images before any pictures you may have taken
yourself with that phone.
Any date prior to 2007 would probably have sufficed
(assuming people don't backdate pictures in their
Camera Roll),
but the developer who fixed the bug
decided to be a bit clever:
He chose
April 4, 1975,
the date of Microsoft's founding.
</p>
<p>
Okay, that's the end of that story.
What about the question in the title?
</p>
<p>
Last year, I was visiting Canada and
paid a visit to some very distant relatives.
(Distance measured in terms of blood relationship,
not geographic distance.)
They had other relatives visiting
at the time,
and in the course of conversation,
those other relatives mentioned that their son 
worked for Microsoft.
</p>
<p>
Everybody who works at Microsoft has gone through
the "Hey, you work for Microsoft. Do you know...?"
ritual.
And the answer is always "Nope, no idea who you're
talking about."
Because it turns out Microsoft employs
<a HREF="http://news.microsoft.com/facts-about-microsoft/">
over 100,000 people worldwide</a>,&sup1;
so the odds of a hit are pretty low.
</p>
<p>
I guess the relative had gone through the ritual
before, because he never bothered to ask.
</p>
<p>
After we returned home, my wife told me,
"In case you were wondering, their son's name is X.
But I'm sure you've never met him."
</p>
<p>
Oh wait, X?
Why yes, actually I know him.
He's the developer who set the timestamp on the
wallpapers to April 4, 1975.
Works just down the hall from me.
</p>
<p>
The next day, I paid him a visit.
"Just letting you know,
your parents say Hi."
</p>
<p>
&sup1; I like how that page has a footnote to the
breakdown of employees by role.
</p>
<table CELLSPACING="0" STYLE="color: black">
<tr STYLE="background: #505050;color: white">
<th>Role</th>
<th>Percentage</th>
</tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="white">
<td>Engineering</td>
<td>46.5%</td>
</tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#edf1f7">
<td>Sales &amp; Marketing Support Group&nbsp;</td>
<td>47.0%</td>
</tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="white">
<td>Finance, HR &amp; Legal</td>
<td>4.3%</td>
</tr>
<tr BGCOLOR="#edf1f7">
<td>Business Functions</td>
<td>2.1%</td>
</tr>
<tfoot>
<tr BGCOLOR="white">
<td COLSPAN="2">
        <font SIZE="-1">Functional breakout does not include CEO in total.</font>
    </td>
</tr>
</tfoot>
</table>
<p>
Yeah, because adding the CEO would change those percentages
by less than 0.001%,
two orders of magnitude lower than the rounding error in the
table itself.</p>

		<p>While I can probably find out (or wait for someone to comment on it), the obvious question is why Windows 10 for Phone mixes photos with Microsoft wallpaper. I see on my iPhone that Apple keeps theirs in a separate section of wallpaper settings.</p>

		<p>I worked for Microsoft for about a dozen years (ending about 4 years ago).  I&#8217;m surprised at the number of times that I do know the person I get asked about in these situations.  Often, however, it&#8217;s distant knowledge &#8211; knowing that someone is the go-to person for some technology, perhaps having exchanged a handful of emails, etc.  Hey, I even exchanged emails with Raymond several times (I was one of those &#8220;customer representatives&#8221; that he mentions in this blog occasionally).</p>

		<p>Maybe someone had to explain to his manager why the percentages didn&#8217;t sum up to 100%, not including CEO was the accepted answer.</p>
<p>BTW, once I had to explain to a customer why the percentages didn&#8217;t sum up to 100%, it is vexing&#8230;</p>

		<p>Add them all up, subtract from 100 and hide the error in one of the results. It saves having to explain and the customer is happy. There are various strategies for picking which entry the error should be included in, I&#8217;d probably go for the middle one.</p>

		<p>My wild guess is that when people were officially categorizing roles, they were unsure what role to assign to the CEO since a CEO should be touching all of those areas of the business.  (Yes, both Bill and Satya could credibly claim &#8220;Engineering&#8221;&#8230;Satya does have a CS degree)</p>
<p>So, that poor flunky created a separate CEO role with only one member. That&#8217;s why they didn&#8217;t want to include the CEO in the table.  They would have to add a separate &#8220;CEO&#8221; line with either 0.001%  (forcing the other percentages to an absurd precision) or rounded to 0.0% which would be silly.</p>

		<p>Great story.  I can confirm the prevalence of the &#8220;do you know&#8230;?&#8221; question.  </p>
<p>I&#8217;m from Denmark, and on a few occasions, I have even gotten the question in relation to that.  &#8220;Oh, I was there once, and I met Finn Larseks, or something like that.  Do you know him?&#8221;  I have to look at the questioner to see if they are serious, and at least a couple of times, they actually were.  Sure, Denmark is a small country, but it&#8217;s not *that* small.</p>

		<p>When I visited India, I did get a &#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re Canadian, my cousin&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Oddly enough, it turned out that his cousin worked in a nearby store that I frequented.  I didn&#8217;t know him by name, but his description matched my memory of someone working there, so I went in, told him his cousin says hi, and amused us both.</p>

		<p>Let me guess, you&#8217;re part of the 47.0%, who spend their time renaming Windows Mobile, to Windows Phone, to Windows 10 Mobile. ;) Pretty shocking that almost half of Microsoft is Sales and Marketing. Curious what the numbers are for other big tech companies.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s funny when that does happen. Back in 2000, on my first visit to Houston, I was introduced to some people from NASA and got talking. At some point, one of them mentioned that one of the cleaners from my old high school (in Scotland, six time zones away) had died that summer. (It turned out he was Scottish, and this was actually his own old home town, so he kept in touch with people back there too.) A few years later, I bumped into one of those Americans back in Scotland &#8211; she&#8217;d just emigrated, and ended up working for the same university as me, in the building next door.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
