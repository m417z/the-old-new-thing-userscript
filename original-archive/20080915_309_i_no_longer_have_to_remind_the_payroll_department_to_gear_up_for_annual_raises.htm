<p>September&nbsp;15 is the date on which annual raises take effect. This means that on the 15th, the payroll servers are swamped with people eyeballing their new paycheck breakdown to see what has changed.</p>
<p> And every year, on September&nbsp;15th, the servers would become overloaded and people would be unable to connect. Instead they'd get a message like this: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  Due to unexpectedly high demand, the payroll servers are unable to service your request. Please try again later. </p>
<p> We apologize for the inconvenience. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> <i>Unexpectedly high demand</i>? This happens every year on exactly the same date! How could it be unexpected? </p>
<p> For a few years, I set myself a recurring task for August&nbsp;15th that said, "Remind the payroll department to increase capacity for September&nbsp;15th." </p>
<p> I don't know if my reminders helped any, but it appears that the payroll department finally figured out on their own the elusive pattern to their high demand days and added additional capacity accordingly. I no longer have to remind them. </p>

		<p>Is the increase in capacity from the previous year insufficient for the current year, or do they remove the excess capacity once the rush is over? Otherwise it&#8217;s hard to imagine that they would need to be reminded every year.</p>

		<p>Gabe: &nbsp;I think the assumption here is that the capacity increase is a temporary measure. &nbsp;In other words, the capacity needed around Sep 15th is probably way more than what is typically needed the rest of the year. &nbsp;So, to avoid wasting resources a temporary increase is made.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, folks, it&#8217;s September 15th, you&#8217;re all hitting this server at once and so there&#8217;s no chance of you getting through. Try again next week. It&#8217;s not like you won&#8217;t get paid until you&#8217;ve checked the new figures.&quot;</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s the same here in Scotland, Ilia: every year the roads are blocked with snow, which apparently comes as a nasty shock to the council every single year.</p>
<p>It would be nice to think there&#8217;s a big pool of servers with flexible roles, so in mid-September Finance gets some extra intranet servers, then they shift to be download servers to handle the next Service Pack release or whatever. They probably just got a rack of extra servers which sit taking up space the other 364 days, though.</p>
<p>Still, it could be worse. I can imagine Raymond either getting a reply saying &quot;OK, to even out the peak load we&#8217;ve delayed your rise to October 15 instead&quot; &#8211; or sending an e-mail to a few dozen users telling them their raise has been delayed to comply with Raymond&#8217;s request to manage the peak better. I imagine that would get Raymond&#8217;s reminder cancelled instantly, without a penny spent on extra capacity!</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know if this occurs when they release other large groups of students, but almost every semester in undergrad, the honors college crashed the class registration servers by about 12:02am on the first day we could register.</p>
<p>The recovery times decreased with each crash; the first time it was basically down until the next morning, while by senior year it was only down for a few minutes. I think that it even survived us one year.</p>

		<p>Raymond, did Payroll ever respond to your reminders? Or did they mutter under their breath, &quot;damn engineer, what does he know&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;It would be nice to think there&#8217;s a big pool of servers with flexible roles&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>Hyper-V, anyone?</p>
<p>Or they could spread out everyone&#8217;s raises through out the year, or give raises on your anniversary.</p>

		<p>Shouldn&#8217;t there be another similar hit at the next pay period, after all bonuses have cleared out? &nbsp;Although I suppose the take-home from a bonus might be more interesting to people than their new sustained take-home pay.</p>

		<p>Sorry to double-post, but I am amused that some suggested solutions to this are to stagger pay-raise dates. &nbsp;This is not some insurmountable technical problem that is severely negatively impacting employees. &nbsp;If they can&#8217;t raise capacity &#8212; which they can &#8212; then the next logical thing to do is nothing at all.</p>
<p>I know, I know; all suggestions are in good fun. &nbsp;So in that spirit, let me add the suggestion of a one-off email once per year overnight to each employee detailing the same things payroll can detail, using some fixed dedicated resources over a fixed time. &nbsp;Microsoft has lots of employees, but not so many that this is impractical.</p>

<p>Anyway, that begs a question: what kind of crappy server cannot withstand 50 thousands queries per day? Is it 32 MB NT4 system, running on 33 MHz 80486?</p>

		<p>@Wolf: Actually, many ATMs (prior to 2000) ran OS/2, with good reason. It was rock-solid. Most ATM failures were due to trivial things (ran out of money, receipt paper, jammed, etc), rather than the OS or ATM software itself crashing. Most ATMs at the time date back to OS/2 1.x &#8211; running so long that their screens got burned in. (This is quite an achievement, given that OS/2 could run in 32-bit mode with 16-bit real mode drivers working alongside 32-bit protected mode drivers just happily &#8211; talk about backwards compatibility).</p>
<p>Then the year 2000 issue became big, and OS/2 1.x and 2.x weren&#8217;t Y2K ready. Given a lot of these machines were already, they were ripped out and replaced with new machines, often running Windows (9x, NT, 2000, XP&#8230;). Most banks also used OS/2 for their terminals for the same reason &#8211; they were rock solid. Of course, by the time Y2K came about, OS/2 was old news, and Windows was everywhere, so they started building ATMs out of Windows, which leads to the many, many, many pictures of ATM blue-screens ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://images.google.ca/images?hl=en&amp;q=atm+bsod&amp;btnG=Search+Images&amp;gbv=1" rel="nofollow">http://images.google.ca/images?hl=en&#038;q=atm+bsod&#038;btnG=Search+Images&#038;gbv=1</a> )</p>
<p>OS/2 worked just fine for what the banks needed &#8211; a dependable operating system (dating back to 1987!), that got put out to pasture and replaced. It worked, it beat DOS and Windows (3.x) in stability, so the banks used it for its reliability. Machines have been walled up and &quot;lost&quot; while quietly performing their duties and forgotten (Novell servers, IBM mainframes, Sun servers). A few bits of asset recovery done by asking &quot;where&#8217;s this cable go?&quot;.</p>

		<p>@bcthanks, Worf:</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t so much the OS/2 part that made me wince (though it should have, I&#8217;ve done plenty of OS/2 programming in my day &#8212; yes, I&#8217;m old); it was the &quot;Warp&quot; part. The OS/2 kernel was quite good, but Warp was (to my mind) a waste. I assume the ATM network was originally written using OS/2 back inna day (probably connected to AS/400s somewhere), and the Warp upgrade was due to some support contract somewhere. I&#8217;m just imagining the poor sods writing GUIs for OS/2 Warp, though &#8212; this wasn&#8217;t an old ATM, and its software is recent vintage.</p>

		<p>I saw an ATM in my downtown mall a few years ago as it booted. &nbsp;I can&#8217;t quite believe what I saw, but it looked like a Mac Finder screen (pre OSX)! &nbsp;Sad Mac, and sad you, bereft of your card and your balance&#8230;</p>

<p>&quot;This is quite an achievement, given that OS/2 could run in 32-bit mode with 16-bit real mode drivers working alongside 32-bit protected mode drivers just happily &#8211; talk about backwards compatibility&quot;</p>
<p>Are you sure? I thought OS/2 1.xx was 16 bits.</p>
<p>From wikipedia:</p>
<p>&quot;Until release 2.0 in April 1992, OS/2 ran in 16-bit protected mode and therefore could not benefit from the Intel 80386&#8217;s much simpler 32-bit flat memory model and virtual 8086 mode features.&quot;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
