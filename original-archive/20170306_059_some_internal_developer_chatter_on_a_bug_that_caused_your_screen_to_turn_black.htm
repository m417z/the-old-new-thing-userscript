<p>
There was a bug in an internal build of Windows
(let's call it build <var>N</var>)
where if you were sufficiently unlucky,
your screen would turn black and get stuck that way.
The team responsible for the bug was busy
working on a fix.
They later reported that verification in their branch
was successful
and that the fix was
awaiting
(but had not received)
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130820-00/?p=3453">
fasttrack</a> approval
for build <var>N</var> + 2.
</p>
<p>
The person who reported the problem asked,
"So am I to assume that I shouldn't install build <var>N</var>+1?"
</p>
<p>
The team dryly replied,
"You should if you're really into black."</p>

		<p>People ARE really into black. There is a site called Colour Lovers that lets people vote on colours, and black is _by far_ the most popular.</p>

		<p>Seems weird that the person that reported it would ask that question.  If the team is trying to get it into N+2, how would it be in N+1?  I&#8217;m confused.  Does Microsoft skip merging/cherry picking some changes to later releases?</p>

		<p>The original reply from team the said that it was awaiting fasttrack approval. I added the build number to help clarify the situation. (Still, the fact that approval had not been received means that it doesn&#8217;t matter what build number you pick, since none of them have the fix.)</p>

		<p>Is that totally correct? Wouldn&#8217;t there be a branch build that had the fix? Although I suspect most wouldn&#8217;t be interested in the branch unless it was their charge to test it.</p>

		<p>Yes, but as you noted that is unappealing for many reasons. (For example, installing another team&#8217;s branch means that you can&#8217;t test your own team&#8217;s local changes.)</p>

		<p>Coincidently, my phone got black blank screen (saying this way to avoid confusion to black screen of death) and need reboot to continue at about once per day like two updates before. The problem seems to go away after last Saturday&#8217;s update (could be something released earlier than that, that&#8217;s the time I observed the request to reboot. Didn&#8217;t check actual release time).</p>

		<p>There is actually a bug in Windows 95 that causes the screen to turn black. It appears to be related to the display power saving setting; if I leave the PC so that it &#8220;goes back into power saving mode&#8221; then I can usually bring it out successfully the second time.</p>

		<p>Nothing can get worse by installing build N+1 right? The user already was on build N and suffering from the problem.</p>

		<p>I had a very similar bug with the Windows 8 Intel display driver on old hardware when 8 first came out. My end solution was to just switch back to 7 for a while until it was fixed :P</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
