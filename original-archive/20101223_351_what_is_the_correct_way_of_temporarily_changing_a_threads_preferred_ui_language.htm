A customer ran into a crashing bug in their shell extension.
The shell extension wants to change the thread's preferred UI language
temporarily, so that it can load its resources from a specific language.
You'd think this would be easy:
</p>
<pre>
<i>// error checking elided for simplicity
// There is a bug in this code - read on

// Get the current thread preferred UI languages
ULONG cLanguages;
PZZWSTR pszzPrevLanguages;
ULONG cchPrevLanguages = 0;
GetThreadPreferredUILanguages(MUI_LANGUAGE_NAME,
                              &amp;cLanguages, NULL,
                              &amp;cchPrevLanguages);
pszzPrevLanguages = new WCHAR[cchPrevLanguages];
GetThreadPreferredUILanguages(MUI_LANGUAGE_NAME,
                              &amp;cLanguages,
                              pszzPrevLanguages,
                              &amp;cchPrevLanguages);

... change the thread preferred UI languages ...
... load resources ...

// Restore the original thread preferred UI languages
SetThreadPreferredUILanguages(MUI_LANGUAGE_NAME,
                              pszzPrevLanguages,
                              &amp;cLanguages);
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/03/66660.aspx">delete[]</a> pszzPrevLanguages;</i>
</pre>
<p>
Approximately ten seconds after this code runs, Explorer crashes
with the exception <code>STATUS_<wbr>CALLBACK_<wbr>RETURNED_<wbr>LANG</code>
whose description is
"A threadpool worker thread enter a callback,
which left with preferred languages set.
This is unexpected, indicating that the callback missed clearing them."
(Just before Explorer crashes, the message
"ThreadPool: callback 77180274(05B67430) returned with preferred languages set"
appears on the debugger, which says basically the same thing as the
status code.)
</p>
<p>
<b>Exercise</b>: Why does it take ten seconds before the crash occurs?
</p>
<p>
This crash is puzzling, because it's claiming that the callback didn't
reset the thread preferred languages, but you can see us doing it
right there in the code when we call
<code>Set&shy;Thread&shy;Preferred&shy;UI&shy;Languages</code>!
Somebody's on crack, but who?
</p>
<p>
A closer reading of the error message indicates that the callback
needs to "clear" the thread preferred languages, not merely reset them
to their original values, and the documentation for
<code>Set&shy;Thread&shy;Preferred&shy;UI&shy;Languages</code> says,
"To clear the thread preferred UI languages list,
the application can set this parameter to a null string
or an empty double null-terminated string."
Okay, so now the question is,
"How can I tell, when I call <code>Get&shy;Thread&shy;Preferred&shy;UI&shy;Languages</code>,
that the list of languages I receive back represents the
<i>clear</i> state as opposed to indicating that some other
code called <code>Set&shy;Thread&shy;Preferred&shy;UI&shy;Languages</code> before I did?"
</p>
<p>
The magic is the flag
<code>MUI_<wbr>THREAD_<wbr>LANGUAGES</code>.
If you pass this flag when you call
<code>Get&shy;Thread&shy;Preferred&shy;UI&shy;Languages</code>,
it will return a null string if the thread has not customized
its preferred UI languages, indicating that the way to restore
the thread's preferred UI language state is to clear it
rather than setting it.
Fortunately, this lines up nicely with the way you're supposed to
clear the state,
so at the end of the day there is no special case.
</p>
<p>
The fix to the above code, then, is to make the following simple
change:
</p>
<pre>
// error checking elided for simplicity

// Get the current thread preferred UI languages
ULONG cLanguages;
PZZWSTR pszzPrevLanguages;
ULONG cchPrevLanguages = 0;
GetThreadPreferredUILanguages(MUI_LANGUAGE_NAME <font COLOR=red>|
                              MUI_THREAD_LANGUAGES</font>,
                              &amp;cLanguages, NULL,
                              &amp;cchPrevLanguages);
pszzPrevLanguages = new WCHAR[cchPrevLanguages];
GetThreadPreferredUILanguages(MUI_LANGUAGE_NAME <font COLOR=red>|
                              MUI_THREAD_LANGUAGES</font>,
                              &amp;cLanguages,
                              pszzPrevLanguages,
                              &amp;cchPrevLanguages);

... change the thread preferred UI languages ...
... load resources ...

// Restore the original thread preferred UI languages
SetThreadPreferredUILanguages(MUI_LANGUAGE_NAME,
                              pszzPrevLanguages,
                              &amp;cLanguages);
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/03/66660.aspx">delete[]</a> pszzPrevLanguages;
</pre>
<p>
As you might expect,
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2009/12/01/9930855.aspx">
Michael Kaplan has his own thoughts on the
<code>Set&shy;Thread&shy;Preferred&shy;UI&shy;Languages</code> function</a>.
In fact, he has
<a HREF="http://www.bing.com/search?q=site:blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap+SetThreadPreferredUILanguages">

		<p>Are the calls to GetThreadPreferredUILanguages necessary? &nbsp;It seems that the &quot;load resources from a specific language&quot; scenario could be met by two calls to Set, and none to Get:</p>
<p>SetThreadPreferredUILanguages(MUI_LANGUAGE_NAME, &quot;foo-Bar &quot;, NULL);</p>
<p>&#8230; load resources&#8230;</p>
<p>SetThreadPreferredUILanguages(0, NULL, NULL);</p>
<p>If you wanted to add a language to the end of the list, sure, you need GetThreadPreferredUILanguages.</p>
<p>I believe the 10 second timeout is due to the threadpool thread waiting for new work to come along, before getting recycled.</p>

		<p>The answer is probably something along the lines of either that thread runs for 10 seconds after this bit of code or there is a thread pool with a 10 second timeout.</p>

		<p>This is interesting. &nbsp;I just followed the link to your article on scalar versus vector delete in C++ (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/03/66660.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/66660.aspx</a>) on a whim to reread it. &nbsp;One of your comments in response to Johan Ericsson refers to the existence of a followup article the next day. &nbsp;But when I go to the archives page for February 2004 (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/02.aspx</a>) which should correspond to the timestamp on the article, neither the original article nor any obvious followup appear on either of the two pages of the list that I see.</p>
<p>I wonder whether this is another blog software glitch, or whether I&#39;ve just done something stupid while navigating.</p>

		<p>Maurits:</p>
<p>Say, for example, you have the following:</p>
<p>void InnerFunc()</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>&nbsp; var Original = GetThreadPreferredUILanguages();//Simplifying</p>
<p>&nbsp; SetThreadPreferredUILanguages(WantedLanguage);</p>
<p>&nbsp; //Do Stuff</p>
<p>&nbsp; SetThreadPreferredUILanguages(Original);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>void ThreadCallback1()</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>&nbsp; SetThreadPreferredUILanguages(SomeOtherLanguage);</p>
<p>&nbsp; //DoStuff</p>
<p>&nbsp; InnerFunc();</p>
<p>&nbsp; //Do more stuff</p>
<p>&nbsp; SetThreadPreferredUILanguages(null);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>void ThreadCallback2()</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>&nbsp; InnerFunc();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>In the case of ThreadCallback2, you&#39;ll want to &quot;clear&quot; your UI language. But in the case of ThreadCallback1, if you clear the UI language, you&#39;ll end up with &quot;Do more stuff&quot; using the wrong language. So yes, the Get is necessary. It&#39;s always good practice to leave things the way you found them.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
