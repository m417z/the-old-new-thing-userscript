<p>You're running your program, and then it suddenly exits with the message <i>This application has requested the Runtime to terminate it in an unusual way</i>. What happened?</p>
<p> That message is printed <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/k089yyh0.aspx"> by the C runtime function <code>abort</code></a>, the same function that also causes your program to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/05/19/10166093.aspx"> terminate with exit code&nbsp;3</a>. </p>
<p> Your program might call <code>abort</code> explicitly, or it might end up being called implicitly by the runtime library itself. </p>
<ul>
<li>     <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/9sb57dw4.aspx">     The <code>assert</code> macro calls <code>abort</code></a>     when an assertion fails. </li>
<li>     By default,     <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/k0k9c522.aspx">     the <code>terminate</code> function</a>     calls <code>abort</code>. </li>
</ul>
<p> The C++ standard spells out the conditions under which <code>terminate</code> is called, and it's quite a long list, so I won't bother repeating them here. Consult your favorite copy of the C++ standard for details. (The most common reason is throwing an unhandled exception.) </p>

		<p>I&#39;d wager that the most common reason that std::terminate gets called is when an exception is thrown but never caught.</p>
<p>Also note that _set_abort_behavior (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/e631wekh%28v=VS.100%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/e631wekh%28v=VS.100%29.aspx</a>) can be used to modify what calling abort() does, e.g. if you want your program not to display that message box when an assertion fails.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s also pretty common to generate an exception while catching one. &nbsp;This one comes up a lot if you&#39;re not savvy enough to know not to put throwing code in your destrcutors.</p>

		<p>That error message sounds&#8230; &nbsp;creepy somehow. &nbsp;When a program asks another program to do something to it, in an unusual way&#8230; &nbsp;I wonder what those programs have been up to in their spare time? &nbsp; :-)</p>

		<p>Lol &#8211; I hope that &quot;never throw in your dtor&quot; is a lesson somewhere in the early curriculum of C++, but probably not the first intro class ever! &nbsp;Probably in the first class that introduces the concepts of exception handling, however.</p>
<p>But maybe I&#39;m just showing my age in worrying that folks still don&#39;t necessarily know that.</p>

		<p>My opinion on exceptions is that they are indistinguishable from invisible conditional goto&#39;s inserted in every function (or operator) call in your code. That might not be so terribly bad, but they are goto&#39;s targeting locations in your code that are extremely context dependent and difficult to determine.</p>

		<p>Ray, throws are not goto&#39;s. &nbsp;Sure, they both change the instruction pointer, but in this, throws are in common with, say, switch statements or function calls. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All you have spelled out is that error handling is tricky. &nbsp;Yes, and exceptions is one of your tools to deal with it, and a particularly powerful one.</p>

		<p>I can see users getting confused with this message because it doesn&#39;t sound like an error message (it is worded more in the &quot;it&#39;s a feature, not a bug&quot; form.) Better might be the usual &quot;Abnormal termination&quot; that other runtimes use, because it sounds scarier, so users will probably report it more often!</p>
<p>Regarding exceptions, they didn&#39;t exist in C++ when I first learned the language (I started learning with Turbo C++ 1.0.) I seem to recall that my first real exposure to exceptions was with Java 1.1, quite a while later. It&#39;s a different mindset while programming, and I still admit to not using exceptions as they were probably intended; it just feels too weird not to check for error conditions!</p>

		<p>To all the people surprised to hear that throwing from a destructor is a bug: doing that is a clear-cut consequence of a more general principle in programming, that you don&#39;t signal error on a cleanup path. That even goes for a language without exceptions (e.g. C). So you should revise your understanding, not of C, really, but of programming in general.</p>
<p>@Jonathan Wilson: you can &quot;not touch exceptions for the most part&quot; in C++ only if you&#39;re writing exception-unsafe code. That&#39;s because virtually everything in C++ throws. STL throws. MFC throws. ATL throws. boost throws. Even simplest of things like &quot;string s = s1+s2&quot; throw. So I can only hope that your code terminates immediately when any exception is thrown in it (because otherwise, it&#39;s doing more bad than good when that happens).</p>

		<p>@Goran: &quot;So I can only hope that your code terminates immediately when any exception is thrown in it&quot;. Well, yes it does (because &nbsp;that&#39;s what ignored exceptions do), byt only if assuming the program does get compiled with exception support. Many don&#39;t. And guess what, string s= s1+s2 crashes then with an access violation, if OOM.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
