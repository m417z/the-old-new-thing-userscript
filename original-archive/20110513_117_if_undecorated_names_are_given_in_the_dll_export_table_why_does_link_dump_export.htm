If you run the <code>link /dump /exports</code> command on a DLL
which exports only undecorated names,
you may find that in addition to showing those undecorated names,
it also shows the fully-decorated names.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
We're building a DLL and for some functions, we have
chosen to suppress the names from the export
table by using the NONAME keyword.
When we dump the exports, we still see the names.
And the functions which we did want to export by name are showing up
with their decorated names even though we list them in the DEF
file with undecorated names.
Where is the decorated name coming from?
Is it being stored in the DLL after all?
</p>
<pre>
        1        00004F1D [NONAME] _Function1@4
        2        000078EF [NONAME] _Function2@12
        3        00009063 [NONAME] _Function3@8
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
The original decorated names are not stored in the DLL.
The <code>link /dump /exports</code> command is sneaky
and looks for a matching PDB file and, if finds one,
extracts the decorated names from there.
</p>
<p>
(How did I know this?
I didn't, but I traced each file accessed by the
<code>link /dump /exports</code> command and observed that
it went looking for the PDB.)</p>

		<p>Process Monitor is super-useful like that. &nbsp;I once discovered that the index and search panes had completely disappeared from whenever I tried to open a particular .chm help file. &nbsp;The timestamp on the CHM hadn&#39;t changed, and it was identical to a known good copy.</p>
<p>After looking through the file and registry accesses of hh.exe with Process Monitor and comparing it with another .chm file, I discovered that it was looking for but not finding a similarly named .chi file. &nbsp;After restoring the .chi file (I have no idea how it disappeared), the index and search panes were restored.</p>

		<p>It is a (not very) well known fact that lib.exe, editbin.exe and dumpbin.exe are all stubs to link.exe. If you check the file description, all 3 have Microsoft Linker Stub. The hidden switches for all of them are link /edit for editbin, link /lib for lib and link /dump for dumpbin.</p>

		<p>@David:</p>
<p>Undocumented, or does link support truncated options? &nbsp;I&#39;ve found several Microsoft tools that let you shorten options as long as they&#39;re still unambiguous (a la Powershell).</p>

		<p>I&#39;m not sure I like that behavior &#8211; it should be enabled only by a switch. &nbsp;I usually use `dumpbin` (aka link /dump) to try and figure out what&#39;s going on when things are going wrong. &nbsp;I&#39;d really rather it didn&#39;t mislead me about what&#39;s in a file.</p>
<p>But &#8211; thanks for the heads up (please don&#39;t take this post as trying to assign some sort of blame &#8211; I&#39;m not).</p>
<div class="post">[<i>It&#39;s not actually lying. The entry is reported as [NONAME]. It&#39;s just that the linker offers a little &quot;extra info&quot;, but if you don&#39;t know about it, you might confuse the &quot;extra info&quot; with the &quot;main info&quot;. -Raymond</i>]</div>

<p>Yeah &#8211; after thinking about a bit, the real problem is that there&#39;s a *lot* of stuff that dumpbin shows or can show, and I understand maybe 9% of it (if I&#39;m being generous with myself). </p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
