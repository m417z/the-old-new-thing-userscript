<p>If you have a file or directory that does not have a last-modified date, you may find that it causes Explorer to sort very strangely. (How do you get a file or directory with no last-modifiied date? It's hard to do; you need the help of an external file system.) Why is this?</p>
<p> <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/23/55408.aspx"> As we learned earlier, a sort comparison function must impose a total order in order to produce consistent results</a>. The problem is that Explorer's comparison function mis-handles files and directories with no last-modified date. </p>
<p> To get some more of the background behind this, you need to know about so-called "simple pidls". A <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/programmersguide/shell_adv/pidl_ovw.asp"> simple pidl</a> is an item ID list that refers to a file or directory that does not actually exist. </p>
<p> The problem is that a valid file or directory with no last-modified date looks just like one of these simple pidls becauses Explorer uses the last-modified date to distinguish whether it is manipulating a real pidl or a simple one. </p>
<p> The problems with sorting occur when it comes time to decide where in the list these "real pidls that are mistaken for simple pidls" go into the sorted list. Explorer tries to keep all folders together, but if it sees a "simple pidl" it can't tell whether that item is a folder or a file (after all, something that doesn't exist is <strong>neither</strong> a file <strong>nor</strong> a folder) and it ends up producing inconsistent comparison results. </p>
<p> Moral of the story: Be careful with your sort functions. If you produce inconsistent results in your sort function, you will get inconsistent results in your "sorted" output. </p>

		<p>Somewhat on-topic, one thing that bugs me (and I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s strictly a Windows thing or if Unix does this too), but why on Earth can&#8217;t you change the date/times of directories? I know it&#8217;s largely useless, but I seem to recall encountering that limitation even in DOS. =)</p>

		<p>Goes slightly OT, what interfaces you need to add your own sorting to the Explorer for the file/directory column &#8211; like Asc/Desc by name and then something else by me. Does this really require namespace extension etc? No sort of simpler hook ?</p>

		<p>&quot;Don&#8217;t think that will work in 9x&quot;</p>
<p>How many hours of your programming career is it worth to try and get advanced features out of a 10-year-old platform?  Don&#8217;t fool yourself by looking at Windows installed base, look at your potential buyers. If you&#8217;re doing it all for free because your time is valued at $0/hr, then by all means have fun with solving these 9x brain teasers.</p>
<p>I am happy to let software work as well as 9x/Me will let it, but I&#8217;m not going to do a bunch of extra work to recreate 10 years of Windows API progress.</p>
<p>Can we all make a blood pact to ignore 9x now? I have just stuck my finger with a pin and am pressing it to the screen. Please do the same and press Submit.</p>

		<p>Thanks Raymond!  This answers a question I put into your suggestion box, although I didn&#8217;t know enough at the time to explain it properly.  One of our partitions was copied over from an old Novell server, and the directories were all intermingled with files, and were &#8216;alphabetically challenged&#8217;.  Turns out, over half of these folders didn&#8217;t have modified dates.</p>
<p>A quick command line later (for /d %x in (*) do touch &quot;%xfixdate.fix&quot; &amp;&amp; del &quot;%xfixdate.fix&quot;) and now everything is displaying in the correct order :)</p>

		<p>explorer often sorts &quot;shortcut to folders&quot; among files, instead of among folders. Is it related to this behavior?</p>

		<p>Dave:</p>
<p>It&#8217;s less an issue of *wanting* to be compatible with &#8216;9x and more a matter of wanting to know what kind of minimum system requirements my application would require by utilizing feature X. I agree, I&#8217;m happy everything is running off of NT now and I hope &#8216;9x dies a quick death.</p>

		<p>Kind of on topic, but one interesting thing I&#8217;ve noticed in Windows XP explorer is that it will load a folder with one sorting system, and then shortly after (or after a refresh) it will modify it slightly.</p>
<p>For an example, put the following folders somewhere and watch..:</p>
<p>1.0.1<br />
<br />1.0.12<br />
<br />1.0.2</p>
<p>It should modify it to be:</p>
<p>1.0.1<br />
<br />1.0.2<br />
<br />1.0.12</p>
<p>I do like it this way, but it is very annoying that it only changes after a few seconds, or after a refresh (and not on load-up). Much better if it was consistent.</p>

		<p>&quot;put the following folders somewhere and watch&quot;</p>
<p>I assume that newly created or renamed files and folders are put/left in place unsorted because that makes them easier to find. Imagine if you created a new folder and then renamed it, the second you pressed enter it would &quot;disappear&quot; to a new location in the list because of the sort order. That would be confusing and a bit scary (&quot;OMG, where did my folder go? I just renamed it and it&#8217;s GONE!&quot;). You could do some sort of hokey animation showing the file moving from its old position to the new one I guess. (That was NOT a feature suggestion!).<br /></p>

		<p>Actually, that&#8217;s exactly what happens if you have Show in Groups turned on and auto-arrange by name. If you create a new folder, then it starts off under &quot;N&quot; for &quot;New Folder&quot;, then when you type in the name you want and press Enter it gets filed under the new first letter.</p>

		<p>Not entirely related (the more appropriate topic has been and gone, and it involves &quot;directories&quot; and &quot;sort order&quot;, so I&#8217;ll risk it) but I came across some very strange &quot;short filename&quot; versions of directories today, and I can&#8217;t even begin to work out how the short names have been generated:</p>

		<p>IIRC, a checksum of the long filename is used for part of the short filename if there are too many would-be-overlapping-as-short-filenames long filenames in a directory to just do the sequential ~1, ~2, ~3 etc.</p>

		<p>In other words, the ones writing (or even designing) Explorer screwed up so badly you felt the need to publicly humiliate them (hoping they&#8217;d be fired &#8211; I sure do for the ways they destroyed the once perfectly working Explorer of Win95/NT3.51+NewShell/NT4 with the VB-ish crashing Web-ish thing (junk) we are forced to use nowadays)?</p>
<p>Should you ever need support for having them seen in tar and feathers on web-TV, I can likely get ~10k-40k votes from paying customers.</p>

		<p>in response to that old ordering thingy:</p>
<p>The transitivity of equality condition means that you can&#8217;t use floating point with epsilon for sorting &#8211; or (for instance) creating a map/dictionary.  Which&#8230; sucks sometimes.</p>

		<p>A simple pidl is just a normal pidl, but with some information set to 0. The problem is that 0 is a valid value for some of these things (e.g., no last modified time), so just by looking at a pidl you can&#8217;t really tell if it&#8217;s a simple pidl or a normal pidl with a lot of 0&#8217;s.</p>

		<p>Shortcuts to directories aren&#8217;t always files. For example, create a directory shortcut on your Start Menu in either Windows 2000 or Windows XP. I created a shortcut to a directory called &quot;bin&quot; on my Start Menu:<br />
<br />[ben@frazzle C:Documents and SettingsAll UsersStart Menu]$ dir<br />
<br /> Directory of C:Documents and SettingsAll UsersStart Menu</p>
<p>2005-01-31  16:45       &lt;DIR&gt;          .<br />
<br />2005-01-31  16:45       &lt;DIR&gt;          ..<br />
<br />2005-01-31  16:45       &lt;DIR&gt;          bin<br />
<br />2005-01-31  01:14       &lt;DIR&gt;          Programs</p>
<p>[ben@frazzle C:Documents and SettingsAll UsersStart Menu]$ dir bin<br />
<br /> Directory of C:Documents and SettingsAll UsersStart Menubin</p>
<p>2005-01-31  16:45       &lt;DIR&gt;          .<br />
<br />2005-01-31  16:45       &lt;DIR&gt;          ..<br />
<br />2005-01-31  16:45                  471 target.lnk</p>
<p>In this case, it creates a directory with a specially-named shortcut file and a Desktop.ini (which is hidden, of course) inside it. Strangely, this only seems to happen if you make a directory shortcut on the Start menu. Elsewhere, they are created as they were in previous versions of Windows. If you move or copy the created shortcut from the Start Menu to another directory it goes on working. It seems that the shortcut directory must also be read-only for it to work. Wacky stuff.</p>
<p>Fun can be had by putting one of these desktop.ini files in a normal directory along with a target.lnk shortcut and setting the directory read-only. Suddenly the directory becomes inaccessible from Explorer!</p>
<p>Oh, the fun things you can do with Windows Explorer.</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
