		<p>In the Welsh language, there is a word &quot;sannau&quot; which is pronounced almost exactly like the English &quot;Hosanna&quot;. &quot;sannau&quot; however, means socks.</p>
<p>This causes much amusement when an entire choir of young children sings</p>
<p>&quot;sing about socks to the King&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s such a commonplace mistake that a popular welsh language band has even written a comedy christas song parodying it!</p>

		<p>Here in Spain, people from a TV program (previously a radio program) popularized what it&#8217;s called a &quot;momento teniente&quot;. This is a kind of funny hidden message in a song and it&#8217;s somewhat related to misheard lyrics, in the sense of &quot;understanding&quot; some words in your own language while the song is sung in another one. It comes from the colloquial expression &quot;estar alguien teniente&quot; (being someone a bit deaf). The word &quot;teniente&quot; means lieutenant in Spanish, although I don&#8217;t know any relation between deafness and the Army. ;-)</p>
<p>For example, take the following verse of Hold on Tight by the Electric Light Orchestra:</p>
<p>&quot;Quand tu vois ton bateau partir&quot; (&quot;When you see your ship leaving&quot;, in French). If you try to hear the song phonetically in Spanish, you might understand something like the following: &quot;En tu huerto no hay tomates&quot; (There are no tomatoes in your vegetable garden). Another amusing example comes from Money for Nothing, by Dire Straits: &quot;Maybe get a blister on your thumb&quot; becomes &quot;Baby, quiero queso ro&#241;oso&quot; (it means roughly &quot;baby, I want filthy cheese&quot;).</p>
<p>The TV program host often encourages the audience to find new &quot;momentos teniente&quot; and send them by e-mail. This section of the program is short but very successful.</p>

		<p>Joseph Spence&#8217;s rather unique rendition of &#8216;Santa Claus is Coming to Town&#8217; sounds more like &#8216;Sandy Gall is Coming to Town&#8217;. For the non-UKers, Sandy Gall is a retired news reader. Listen and enjoy:</p>

		<p>One of my favorite mis-under-heard lyrics was always &quot;I ain&#8217;t Jeff.&quot; (or possibly Jed).</p>
<p>Attributed to the opening word of the Rolling Stones&#8217;s &quot;Angie.&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
