Today's Little Program prints the current selection
in all open Explorer windows.
(This is an alternative to the
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/07/20/188696.aspx">
C++ version</a> that involves a ridiculous amount of typing.)
</p>
<pre>
var shellWindows = new ActiveXObject("Shell.Application").Windows();
for (var i = 0; i &lt; shellWindows.Count; i++) {
 var w = shellWindows.Item(i);
 WScript.StdOut.WriteLine(w.LocationName);
 var sel = w.Document.SelectedItems();
 for (var j = 0; j &lt; sel.Count; j++) {
  var item = sel.Item(j);
  WScript.StdOut.WriteLine(item.Name);
  WScript.StdOut.WriteLine(item.Path);

}
</pre>
<p>
I have no idea why you would want to do this,
but there you have it.
(If you want the focused item rather than the selection, then get the
<code>Focused&shy;Item</code> property.)
</p>
<p>
Okay, maybe you can use this as a quick-and-dirty way
to

get the parsing name for a shell item</a>:
Open an Explorer window,
select the item you are interested in, then run the script to see
what gets printed out as the <code>Path</code>.</p>

		<p>I can think of one time I&#39;ve seen this used effectively, but I can&#39;t remember what app it was. &nbsp;It was some file management tool, maybe an archiver or a backup program I&#39;m drawing a blank but it was some file management tool. &nbsp;But it&#39;s assumption was that if you had Explorer open on a folder, that you might be wanting to act on that same folder. &nbsp;So it showed the system libraries first, then pinned folders, then folders that were open in explorer, then finally the normal system tree.</p>
<p>Again, I don&#39;t recall what app it was off the top of my head &#8212; just that I saw it and said &quot;oh, that&#39;s a pretty good idea.&quot;</p>

		<p>I did something similar to insert hyperlinks to files in emails. &nbsp;Basically you clicked a button in the Outlook email editor, a window popped up listing each file selected in all the open Explorer windows, you clicked the one you wanted and it inserted the hyperlink. &nbsp;Very useful indeed. &nbsp;And all done in VBA.</p>

		<p>This script doesn&#39;t work very well. new ActiveXObject(&quot;Shell.Application&quot;).Windows() also returns embedded Internet Explorer windows and they don&#39;t have a SelectedItems() property on their Document. It also breaks if you have an Explorer &quot;Computer&quot; window open with a &quot;Class doesn&#39;t support Automation&quot; error.</p>

		<p>Sorry Raymond, I am weak in scripting. I work with VC++ and C#. I assumed since the script uses WScript object, it needs to be run as a file with .vbs extension. And I don&#39;t think its a valid VB6 program.</p>

		<p>Read the post but still could not figure out what extension to use :). Tried wsf but did not help. Seems that the first three lines are js and next few are vbs. Or may be not.</p>

		<p>@Ganesh: Given that every line contains either a semicolon or curly brace, you know that it&#39;s a C-syntax language. &nbsp;The var keyword rules out C++. &nbsp;Looks like it would be valid Javascript or C# (as a snippet of a large program &#8212; C# doesn&#39;t allow executable statements at file scope).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
