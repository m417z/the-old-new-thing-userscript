		<p>To be honest, I don&#39;t think that it would be a huge commercial success. :-)</p>
<p>(incidentally, are bidets actually widespread in North America? I thought they were mostly a southern-european thing&#8230;)</p>

		<p>TIL what a bidet is and am now wondering why they aren&#39;t more common.</p>
<p>However, the first thing that sprung to mind when I read the title was the OpenLaundry API. <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://openlaundryapi.org/" rel="nofollow">http://openlaundryapi.org/</a> I still can&#39;t figure out whether or not this is a joke or not.</p>

		<p>Some authors publish surreal stories that are less amazing than Raymond&#39;s dreams. Maybe a collection of scenes from those dreams would make a good book &#8211; and one that I could recommend to my relatives. It is not that the tales from the days when Windows 95 was called Chicago aren&#39;t interesting enough &#8211; but I guess they wouldn&#39;t be enjoyed by my brother-in-law :-) .</p>

		<p>More reasonable than you might think; see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greywater" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Greywater</a>. &nbsp;The photo of the sink/toilet there is particularly thought provoking.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve been to many parts of the USA and Canada, and I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever seen a bidet in person. I would say that bidets are extremely uncommon in North America.</p>

		<p>@Entegy: I don&#39;t know if that site is real, but I was watching an episode of &quot;Ask This Old House&quot; on PBS (here in USA) and the plumbing/heating/appliance expert Rich was telling about smart appliances that can speak trouble codes via telephone so that the homeowner can save a maintenance call for simple things like a plugged vent hose.</p>

		<p>@Entegy &#8211; that&#39;s neat. I can&#39;t wait until the day when my white goods can join some giant distributed &#39;seti@home&#39; thing in their spare cycles.</p>
<p>Anyways, sounds like Stephanie has a sh*t job&#8230; the only satisfaction I can see her having would be in bidet mode: firing off the garden hose at full blast without warning.</p>

		<p>@Entegy: I&#39;d expect controlling washing/drying machine would be about the same difficulty as controlling a coffee machine.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t know about a washing machine but I can imagine combining a bidet with a urinal would make it more popular.</p>

		<p>Gee, Raymond, it was just a while back that you were writing about the deceptive lines on detergent measuring scoops (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/08/11/695515.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/695515.aspx</a>). I think I&#39;d fill the scoop to the brim and beyond for this device. Poor Stephanie can probably use all the help she can get.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
