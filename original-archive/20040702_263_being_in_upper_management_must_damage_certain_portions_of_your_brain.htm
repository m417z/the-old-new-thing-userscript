		<p>Part of the problem is that no one likes to tell some in power anything that could be remotely considered critisism.</p>
<p>So, he/she had someone read it and they said &quot;yes sir, yes sir, it&#8217;s great, send it out&quot;.</p>
<p>This is the same reason that Steven King&#8217;s later books are so bloated. No editor has the guts to edit the Great One&#8217;s prose.</p>

<p>Or any author who gets famous.  Look at the Harry Potter series; each book is half an inch thicker than the previous.   There&#8217;s more being written but but more being said.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also wondered by computer books (from any publisher on any topic) is almost always 2 inches thick.  Is there some unspoken rule that these books must be at least this thickness or they can&#8217;t possibly be good?<br />

		<p>Actually there is an unwritten rule.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that if a computer book really doesn&#8217;t have enough content it will be printed on thicker paper in bigger type in order to make it fat.</p>
<p>If it&#8217;s thicker it looks like more value for the money in many people&#8217;s eyes.  Sadly this thinking actually works.</p>

		<p>I think it&#8217;s a matter of focus. Upper mngt types often make it up the latter by schmoozing, not biz accomplishments. For instance, one of my friends a few years back was demoted several times from an environment support engineer to company director (huh?) by simply failing to do his job and schmoozing 4-6 hours per day. The execs liked him and everybody else knew him to be deadweight, so he was de(pro)moted out of each position until he became a director.</p>

		<p>Well, he said &quot;relatively brief&quot;. I guess compared to the Encyclopaedia Britannica four pages can be considered brief. If you&#8217;re in upper mngmt out-of-box isn&#8217;t enough anymore, you gotta be willing to think out of domain, so don&#8217;t tell me that was comparing apples and oranges.</p>

		<p>Actually, I think this is called The Peter Principle and the principle is &quot;Everyone will rise one level above their level of competence&quot;. It&#8217;s true mostly in management. You keep getting promoted until you are no longer capable of doing the job and then they put you on &quot;Special Projects&quot; or you leave to &quot;Spend more time with your family&quot;. Not too long after they usually pop up somewhere else to run a Godzilla-like wake of destruction through their comapany.</p>

		<p>Regarding the thickness of computer books &#8211; I never ever buy a thick one if I can help it since they are nearly invariably chatty and bloated with anecdotes you never wanted to read. This also makes it nearly impossible to look something up in such a book.</p>
<p>Less is more.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

  <br />&gt; certain portions of your brain</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the other way around.  You have to have certain portions of your brain already damaged in order to get into upper management.  Birds of a feather promote each other.  It&#8217;s not only in upper management, it&#8217;s also politics, police departments, etc.</p>
<p>&#8216;Course us abnormal people such as developers (and some even more abnormal people such as honest people) obviously have portions of our brains damaged too, but they&#8217;re the wrong portions.

		<p>I used to edit computer books for a living.  Still do sometimes, freelance.  Your average Barnes and Noble has hundreds of computer books on the shelf, most of which arranged spine out.  The conventional wisdom at most computer-book publishers is that a book with a thick spine is easier to see on the shelf than one with a thin spine.  The thick-spined book is therefore more likely to be purchased.</p>
<p>And yes, it is absolutely true that publishers use thicker paper to fatten up books.  If the book is part of a series, however, they won&#8217;t increase the typeface sizes &#8212; those are laid into reusable page templates and it screws up the page flows.  Also, acquisitions editors at the bigger publishers, such as Que and Sams, actually plan a book&#8217;s rough page count even before they have an author and an outline.</p>
<p>There are exceptions to this rule.  I recently copy edited a book for Apress that ran exactly as many pages as the author wrote.  It was kind of refreshing.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
