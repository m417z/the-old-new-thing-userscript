		<p>Isn&#8217;t this a little bit outdated topic? ;-)</p>
<p>Mat Hall: And what game can you stand? Or is chasing a piece of hard rubber better? :-)</p>
<p>On a related theme: during the Ice Hockey World Cup, there were commercials for EA Sports NHL 2005. If the only thing they add each year in these series is the up-to-date realism, shouldn&#8217;t this version contain only a big &quot;strike&quot; message? :-)</p>

		<p>I prefer something like cricket &#8212; the game itself is long enough that you&#8217;re unlikely to miss a crucial play if you get up to go to the toilet, and it means instead of telling the wife I&#8217;m off to drink beer and lounge about in the sun for three days I can use the excuse I&#8217;m off to watch a major sporting event.</p>
<p>On the whole, though, I think sport has become too much of a commercial enterprise, and everyone&#8217;s in it for the money rather than the love of the game.  Call me old fashioned (or just plain stupid) but the good ol&#8217; days when &quot;professional&quot; sportsmen tended to have a day job and got paid a nugatory sum for playing the sport made the whole thing more appealing.</p>
<p>We now return you to your regularly scheduled prgramming&#8230;</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t stand the game*, but that&#8217;s pretty cool none the less.  If they could do it in real time then it&#8217;d be even better.</p>
<p>On a vaguely related note, many years ago I started (but never finished) a real time snooker (like pool, only better) version of this; it would take an image of the table from an overhead camera and recreate it in a virtual environment allowing you to view the table from any angle, make &quot;what if&quot; predictions, etc.  At least that was the theory, but I never quite got it to work before I got bored and moved on to my next brainwave.  Having seen this, I may now revisit it&#8230;</p>
<p>* It&#8217;s not so much the game itself, it&#8217;s more that some players earn the GDP of a small nation in a single week just for running up and down chasing an inflated pig&#8230;</p>

		<p>Mat, I like cricket too, but I must counter your argument about not missing too much if you get up to go to the toilet. I was at Old Trafford several years ago watching England play Australia and twice I went to the toilet and missed Ian Botham taking a wicket. Bah!!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
