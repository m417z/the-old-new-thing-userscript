<p>The metaphoric use of the term <i>radar</i> <a href="http://www.learnersdictionary.com/search/Radar"> is in general use</a>. It refers to the set of things that some entity is paying attention to. (That entity being the owner of the radar.)</p>
<ul>
<li>     To     <a href="http://www.themoviepool.com/movie-stuff/item/1024-wanted-video-game-movies.html">     fall off the radar</a>     is to stop attracting attention or garnering media coverage. </li>
<li>     Something that     <a href="http://bleacherreport.com/articles/19033-college-basketball-5-teams-flying-below-the-radar">     flies below/under the radar</a>     is not being detected.     This could be intentional (you may be trying to elude detection)     or unintentional (you want to be noticed but can't get anybody to     pay attention). </li>
<li>     If you say that something is     <a href="http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/33970359/ns/today-books/t/palin-says-presidency-not-my-radar-screen/#.TtuomtWtR9M">     not on your radar</a>,     it means that it is not something you have been paying attention to. </li>
<li>     To     <a href="http://www.active.com/outdoors/articles/National-Parks-to-Put-on-Your-Radar.htm">     put on someone's radar</a>     is to draw someone's attention to something.     If you put something on your own radar,     it means that you are making an effort to pay attention to it. </li>
</ul>
<p> At Microsoft, the metaphorical radar usually belongs to a specific person or group. You might forward an email exchange to a person or group with the message "Just wanted to make sure XYZ was on your radar." In other words, "Just wanted to make sure you were aware of XYZ." There is no requirement that the recipient take action in response to the message, but you're letting them know about XYZ, just in case they weren't already aware of it. </p>
<p> You can also "put something on X's radar", which means the same as in general use: To make X aware of something. Although there is no requirement that the recipient take action, the phrase is usually used when you expect that X do something. For example, "We're going to be removing support for the beta XYZ interface, and everybody needs to switch over to the RTM interface by next month. Can you put this on the radar of our partner teams?" Translation: "Can you make sure that our partner teams are aware of this? I don't want them to complain that we never warned them." </p>

		<p>In the more traditional sense of the word, this past week France&#39;s BEA released the final report on AF447 crash. <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.bea.aero/en/enquetes/flight.af.447/rapport.final.en.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.bea.aero/&#8230;/rapport.final.en.php</a></p>
<p>It is interesting to note that the flight was missing from radar for over 7 hours before DETRESFA was declared. Search and rescue didn&#39;t commence until over 10 hours post-accident.</p>
<p>It is clear that the protocol for which ARCC is responsible for issuing distress alerts when a plane &quot;falls off the radar&quot; over the Atlantic is very lacking.</p>

		<p>@Brian_EE: Totally off topic, but there is no radar coverage over the Atlantic. Air traffic control is performed based on position reports from the aircraft sent by radio. If an aircraft becomes unreachable via radio, it is assumed that this is a &quot;lost comms&quot; situation (e.g. the radios on the aircraft have become inoperative), which is far more likely than a crash. SAR is initiated if the aircraft should not arrive at its flight planned destination a certain period after the planned time, which is what I&#39;m assuming happened in this instance, though I&#39;m not familiar with the details.</p>

		<p>@Martin: I didn&#39;t mean radar in the strict &quot;bounced radio waves&quot; sense. You are correct that the &quot;radar screen&quot; controllers use include plane-originated position (usually from GPS). &quot;Falling off the radar&quot; still means disappearing from the screen.</p>
<p>And not to stray much farther from Ray&#39;s intended colloquial usage, there are rules in place for the declaration of INCERFA, ALERFA, and DETRESFA that weren&#39;t followed in the AF447 accident. While that was not a survivable water collision, there have been other water landings where a timely raising of alerts could save lives.</p>

		<p>Gabe: it&#39;s not a feature of most English dialects, but historically a flapped allophone was a feature of Received Pronunciation between two vowels (e.g. &quot;married&quot;).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
