The name of the registry key for configuring automatic
debugging of application crashes is
<a HREF="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/Debug/configuring-automatic-debugging">
AeDebug</a>.
Okay, so it's obvious what "Debug" stands for,
but what does "Ae" stand for?
</p>
<p>
I can't prove it, but circumstantial evidence
points to AE standing for "Application Error".
The title of the dialog box was originally "Application Error".
And there's this comment:
</p>
<pre>
// This fixes the AE (application error) in component XYZ
</pre>
<p>
This evidence lines up with 16-bit Windows,
where application
crashes were originally called Unrecoverable Application Errors,
or UAEs.
</p>
<p>
So that's what I'm going to say.
It stands for Application Error.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
The procedure&sup1; in 16-bit Windows that displayed
the Unrecoverable Application Error dialog was named
<code>Display_Box_of_Doom</code>
and it has the understated comment
"Display the Unrecoverable Application Error
box that everyone seems to dislike so much."
Later, the name of the dialog changed
to simply "Application Error":
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150717-00/?p=90881">
We gave you a way to try to recover from it</a>,
so it wasn't "unrecoverable" any more.
</p>
<p>
&sup1;
Note that I called it a "procedure" rather than a "function".
That's because it, like most of the 16-bit kernel,
was written in assembly language.</p>

		<p>Why not?  It&#8217;s the (U.S.) abbreviation of the name of a country.  How is that not politically correct?</p>

		<p>Back in highschool, at the time of Windows 3.0, we replaced the strings &#8216;Unrecoverable Application Errors&#8217; and &#8216;Terminating current application&#8217; with &#8216;Uncontrollable African Elephants&#8217; and &#8216;Chewing segments, run for cover&#8217;. </p>
<p>They string are of same length, so it was very easy to replace the string inside the Windows 3.0 binaries.</p>

		<p>Is that this ugly white borderless window in 3.x with the black text on it? Why did it have to be so ugly, not even having a full window border and all?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
