<p>When <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/01/13/9311703.aspx"> the file association Web service</a> was first being developed, the programmer responsible for implementing the feature just scrounged around and found an old unused computer and set it up as a simple Web server under his desk, so there would be something to test the code against. That server happily churned away serving out file extension information, and when people asked for their program to be added, he would manually add it to the server. The server worked just fine, and like most things which work just fine, it was forgotten.</p>
<p> And then remembered once things no longer worked just fine. </p>
<p> I think it was during one of the beta cycles, or maybe it was RC1, when the quiet neglected computer went offline. I forget why, so let's pretend that the programmer <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc742531.aspx"> unplugged it</a> as part of an office redecoration project. Suddenly, the shell.windows.com service went down. </p>
<p> What? The file association Web service went down? </p>
<p> Everybody had forgotten that shell.windows.com was still running on a computer under that programmer's desk. It had done such a good job up until now that nobody gave it a second though. </p>
<p> He plugged the computer back in and watched the server bang out requests like nobody's business. </p>
<p> Wheels were quickly set into motion to transfer the file association Web service to a machine with a little bit more professional attention and maintenance. </p>

		<p>Fascinating article. I always wondered if anyone ever unplugged their computers at Microsoft. They must be running so many critical services, how do you guys manage when they are down? I now have a fuller understanding of what it means to be in such a powerful position of having important infrastructure underneath my desk. So when I next kick the computer b0xen underneath my desk, I will be reminded of this article.</p>
<p>Also, the way you approached the article is enviable. It was almost.. poetic.</p>

		<p>You would think that if the service recognised .txt and .html, it would recognise other OOB extensions such as .reg</p>

		<p>Sometimes I wonder if the machine running blogs.msdn.com isn&#8217;t a 486 stuffed under some code monkey&#8217;s desk somewhere.</p>
<p>Some days it&#8217;s horribly slow.</p>

		<p>I find this odd that this could actually go unnoticed. I&#8217;d like to hope that this just slipped through an an issue since it was during a beta/rc release. Hopefully, some project plan somewhere had a line item for setting up the &quot;real&quot; public web service before RTM.</p>

		<p>When will shell.windows.com go down for real? &nbsp;I&#8217;ve read all the help and support life-cycle policy documents, but they only talk about support issues (hot-fixes, security updates, incident support, etc); it doesn&#8217;t really mention any kind of tangential services such as shell.windows.com or Windows Update for that matter. &nbsp;On a side note, Windows Update is still functional for Windows 98 (at least the last time I tried a couple months ago). &nbsp;And of course the real concern, product activation servers. &nbsp;Not that WPA actually stops piracy, but that&#8217;s beside the point. &nbsp;Perhaps all of this will be moot when Operating Systems are sold as services instead of a products. &nbsp;Sadly, I think that&#8217;s the way this whole thing is headed&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Mike Dimmick,</p>
<p>Why then it&#8217;s performing so poorly? Nobody is watching it, and it leaks memory badly? What would it take to fix it? A certified petition signed by 500000 readers (not that there&#8217;s that many)?</p>

		<p>OK, so this was a developer&#8217;s machine under a desk, but the developer filled out paperwork to allow access from the public Internet to this under-desk machine.</p>
<p>Then everyone forgot the machine existed, because it&#8217;s working so well.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, who&#8217;s installing security updates etc. on this machine? &nbsp;Nice juicy target. &nbsp;You&#8217;re lucky that it got unplugged (and you noticed) before it got hacked (and you didn&#8217;t notice).</p>

<p>Yuhong Bao: I&#8217;m not sure you realise how demanding you are. &nbsp;Raymond has said he doesn&#8217;t get paid to answer questions on his blog. &nbsp;Your enthusiasm is great, but it would fill a full-time job, and often requires a careful response to avoid controversy. &nbsp;You&#8217;d save everyone&#8217;s time (not to mention goodwill) by being a bit more selective in your questions. &nbsp;Can you try that?</p>
<p>P.S. It&#8217;s unlikely Raymond will know how the computer was updated if he can&#8217;t remember why it was unplugged. &nbsp;Most likely, it was set to perform automatic updates at 3am, and therefore rebooted every few weeks (well, that ruins the story). &nbsp;Or perhaps he deliberately turned updates off, but is this blog the place to discuss that?</p>

		<p>&quot;Turns out it was spyware that interrupted any requests to windowsupdate and redirected them to msn.com. My bad, guys. Sorry&quot;</p>
<p>I once worked out exactly what virus was on a user&#8217;s machine by noticing exactly which web searches it blocked :D (it only blocked ones that had detection/removal instructions for it)</p>
<p>commenter-pre-emptive-anti-snark: this was just so I knew what it was.. the computer got a complete format + reinstall before going back to the user</p>

<p>Change your parents accounts type to &quot;Limited User&quot;. Put a password to the Administrator account. Then you won&#8217;t have to fix your parents&#8217; computer that often.</p>

		<p>I wasn&#8217;t trying to be snarky; it&#8217;s a fun story and I&#8217;m glad it got told. I&#8217;m just honestly surprised that modern Microsoft is that process-light.</p>
<p>This kind of thing probably happens all the time on a much smaller scale, with internal services or services nobody cares about, but I&#8217;d think that pretty much anything MS builds would have the expectation that lots of people are going to be relying on it.</p>

		<p>Speaking of unreasonable demands:</p>
<p>I was convinced that windowsupdate.microsoft.com had gone down over Christmas, and ranted and raved to my parents (of course I was fixing my parents&#8217; computer, it *was* Christmas) about how Microsoft can&#8217;t keep a web server up.</p>

		<p>@matt:</p>
<p>depends on your definition of modern, I suppose&#8230; this was developed for XP, which makes this story around 8 years old. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t know to what extend MS changed their processes after XP, but I <em>know</em> they completely overhauled them after Vista, so it doesn&#8217;t offer that much insight into what they&#8217;re doing these days</p>
<p>I know in general MS has a pretty low bar to jump over in order to get hold of some hardware for testing/prototyping&#8230; it&#8217;s likely someone did this for developing the web service and simply forgot until forcibly reminded that it was no longer a test app</p>

		<p>This webserver was probably well maintained with regards to patches and such (even if you don&#8217;t mention it), but for me it is still a frightening prospect to have a server &quot;that fell into oblivion&quot; servicing inbound web-traffic, sitting under the desk of an developer &#8211; to paraphrase you.</p>
<p>Was there code running on that server written for this project? Was it audited? Was the machine sitting in a DMZ or such? And so on&#8230; Even if you don&#8217;t mention it (and I presume that people at MS took care of these questions), I would feel more than uneasy about this whole situation, given the lax attitude towards this server you portray here.</p>
<p>To nitpick my nitpicking: I assume it was probably a journalistic freedom you took here. Still, I would feel very uneasy about this and I would take it much more serious.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Change your parents accounts type to &quot;Limited User&quot;. Put a password to the Administrator account. Then you won&#8217;t have to fix your parents&#8217; computer that often.&#8217;</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the first time your parents want to install something genuine and you&#8217;re not immediately contactable by telephone (some of us <em>do</em> have a life) this will all go down the pan and they&#8217;ll want this &#8216;restriction&#8217; removing.</p>
<p>Even if you are on the end of the phone, you only really have two options:</p>
<p>1) Drive over to your parents to admin them up (or remote desktop if you are in a position to do so)&#8230;</p>
<p>2) Give them the password so they can do it themselves&#8230;</p>
<p>1) will very rapidly become tiresome (see note about having a life, above)</p>
<p>2) This almost (almost) defeats the whole purpose</p>
<p>From past experience in the two or three times I&#8217;ve tried to set up my dad&#8217;s PC with limited access, I&#8217;ve ended up having to dole out the password.</p>
<p>Obviously that had nothing to do with the original post, but hey-ho</p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>I &#8211; and others, evidently &#8211; enjoy the occasional chucklesome and interesting tale. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a shame that you seem to attract people that can&#8217;t enjoy the story in the spirit it was told, but I hope that doesn&#8217;t stop you doing so in the future.</p>

		<p>&quot;Still, I would feel very uneasy about this and I would take it much more serious.&quot;</p>
<p>You&#8217;d take it much more serious? &nbsp;Really? &nbsp;So several years later you still wouldn&#8217;t be able to tell a light-hearted story about it? &nbsp;When you told the story of the &quot;almost-forgotten&quot; server, would you need a moment of silence afterwards for everyone to reflect on the seriousness? &nbsp;If someone smiled during the story, would you yell at them that it&#8217;s not something to be laughed about? &nbsp;Would you never tell the story because you sit in dread every night about the disaster that could have happened?</p>
<p>Lighten up already.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
