<h2> Ikea selling electric bicycles </h2>
<p> <b>Forget furniture. Ikea is now launching, that's right, an electric bicycle.</b> </p>
<p> <b>It goes under the name People-Friendly and costs around 6000 SEK ($900 USD).</b> </p>
<p> <b>But only in &Auml;lmhult, Sm&aring;land.</b> </p>
<p> People-Friendly has already received three design awards, including the IF Design Award, according to Ikea's press release. </p>
<p> What distinguishes it from other electric bicycles is that the battery is hidden in the frame. That makes it look like a regular bicycle as well as lowering the center of gravity and makes the bicycle more stable. </p>
<p> Performance is for the most part like other electric bicycles: It handles 6&ndash;7 Swedish miles (60&ndash;70 km, 35&ndash;45 US miles) on a charge, which takes 5&ndash;6 hours. The weight is 25 kg (55 pounds). The frame is aluminum and the engine is in front. </p>
<p> <b>Only in Sm&aring;land</b> </p>
<p> The 5995 SEK cost of the bicycle may sound like a lot, but it's inexpensive for an electric bicycle. </p>
<p> The biggest problem with the People-Friendly is that you can't buy it at regular Ikea stores. </p>
<p> So far, the bicycle is sold only <a href="http://www.ikea.com/se/sv/store/almhult/fynd"> at the bargain department of the &Auml;lmhult Ikea</a>. </p>
<p> "Here is where we test new products. And this is a test product. We want to see how much interest there is and be sure that we can take care of the product, even after the purchase," says Daniela Rogosic, press officer for Ikea Sweden. </p>
<p> She cannot say when it will begin being sold at general Ikea stores, but she confirms that interest has been strong for the bicycle during the month it has been available. </p>
<p> <b>Do you have to assemble it yourself like the furniture?</b> </p>
<p> "Yes, you put it together yourself in the classic Ikea way," says Daniela Rogosic. </p>
<p> <b>Fact sheet</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Price: Around 7200 SEK ($1100 USD) in Austria </li>
<li>Material: Aluminum and steel (front fork) </li>
<li>Gears: 3 </li>
<li>Weight: 25 kg </li>
<li>Battery: 36 V </li>
<li>Range: 60&ndash;70 km </li>
<li>Charge time: 5&ndash;6 hours </li>
<li>Top speed: N/A </li>
<li>Engine: 36 V, forward </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p> On the <a href="http://www.ikea.com/se/sv/store/almhult/fynd"> Web site for the &Auml;lmhult bargain department</a>, it describes the bicycle as a three-speed, available in both men's and women's styles. Limit one per customer. </p>

		<p>Before you blanch at the 6k SEK price &#8212; if you walk into any bicycle store you won&#39;t find a standard bicycle for much less than 5k. &nbsp;Even a new bicycle at a discount store will probably set you back 2500 SEK. &nbsp;With than in mind, 6000 SEK for an electric bicycle doesn&#39;t sound so bad.</p>

		<p>@SimonRev That&#39;s insane pricing&#8230; a &quot;discount&quot; bicycle in the US is ~$100 / 600SEK&#8230; a mid-range bike might be ~$300 / 2000SEK</p>

		<p>Hopefully they&#39;ll include all of the required components when packaging this. &nbsp;I wouldn&#39;t want to buy one and end up with two frames or missing handlebars. &nbsp;Though I&#39;m guessing they&#39;re less likely to mistake various pieces for another with a bicycle than they would with, say, a bookcase.</p>

		<p>Yes, I have always thought that bicycles in Sweden were quite expensive. &nbsp;I was going to rent one for the three weeks I was just there &#8212; but I couldn&#39;t quite get over the cost. &nbsp;It was definitely cheaper to buy a cheap one in the US and throw it away (the airfare to ship it was too steep). &nbsp;I did nearly try and buy a used one for about 1200 SEK though. </p>
<p>But the cost is balanced by the fact that there are very nice bicycle paths everywhere and bicycles have the de facto right of way (it may not be legal, but they tend to cut in front of cars and nearly run down pedestrians with equal impunity).</p>

		<p>It&#39;s not really a mile, it&#39;s 10km and called &quot;mil&quot; in Swedish , lacking a better translation it becomes a mile</p>

		<p>@Anon: Things are expensive before they went mass production. Remember this is testing product only, they can&#39;t order large quantity of parts at once because they might want to switch parts to make it strike better balance. The production cost is going to be high.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m shocked that in Sweden they charge so much for bicylces when your bicycles don&#39;t even have any brakes. &nbsp;I learnt this the hard way! ;) I will be buying a bike in Britain and shipping it over :P</p>

		<p>In ancient times, a swedish mil was how far you could travel in a day. After metrication it became 10 km, 10000 meter.</p>

		<p>Every bicycle I have used in Sweden has had brakes. (and I have borrowed about a dozen or so over the past years) &nbsp;Now most of them are the kind like BMX bikes here have where you pedal backwards to lock the rear wheel &#8212; it takes a while to get used to that. &nbsp;Some also have a hand brake on the front wheel.</p>

		<p>The whole &quot;mil&quot; thing confused me when I moved to SE.</p>
<p>People were very kindly speaking English(*) to me, but kept saying &quot;mil&quot; as &quot;mile&quot;. So, someone said &quot;It have a long 6 mile commute&quot;, my initial thought was that &quot;Gosh, they are so spoiled by excellent bus service, that just a few minutes car drive is a disaster&quot;. After a while I worked out what was going on&#8230;</p>
<p>(*) And they still are. The downside of programming software from a home office is that I rarely have to speaking SV. I am at a point where I can have shop- or restaurant-conversations and am not always replied to in English, but definitely not a real chat! Shame on me.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
