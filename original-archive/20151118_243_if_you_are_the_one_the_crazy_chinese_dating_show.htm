My wife watches
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If_You_Are_the_One_(game_show)">
&#38750;&#35488;&#21247;&#25854;</a>,
a Chinese dating game show.
The title literally translates as
"If not sincere, then do not bother",
but that doesn't really convey what the title means.
It follows in the Chinese
tradition of the
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chengyu">
cryptic four-character phrase</a>.
The less cryptic version would be
"If you are not sincere, then don't waste my time."
The English equivalent would be something like
"Serious inquiries only."</p>
<p>
Here are the rules of the show as I understand them:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The bachelor contestant could be handsome,
    or he could be a nerd.
</li>
<li>The bachelor faces a panel of 24 women,
    most of whom are
    conventionally attractive Chinese women,
    although the producers toss in a few wildcards
    like a foreign student or a someone who is a little
    chubby or homely.
</li>
<li>The bachelor secretly reveals to the host
    (and the home audience)
    the woman he has preselected
    based only on her appearance,
    known as the "heartbeat girl".
</li>
<li>Each woman starts out with her podium light lit green.
</li>
<li>If a woman decides that she is not interested in
    dating the bachelor, she turns off her light
    (which actually just turns it red).
</li>
<li>If all the women turn off their lights, then the game is over,
    and the bachelor goes home.
</li>
<li>In the first video, the bachelor introduces himself.
</li>
<li>The host invites the bachelor to do a brief talent demonstration,
    be it dancing, singing, playing a musical instrument, whatever.
</li>
<li>In the second video,
    the bachelor's romantic history is dramatized.
</li>
<li>In the third video,
    the bachelor's friends and relatives describe him.
</li>
<li>Throughout,
    the host and two additional consultants
    banter with the bachelor and the women on the panel.
    This is where most of the bizarre statements come out.
</li>
<li>A woman who is particularly attracted to the bachelor
    can activate the "burst light",
    thereby guaranteeing a position in the final round.
    (I've never seen it activated more than once.
    I don't know if that's a rule, or that's just how it works out.)
</li>
<li>After all the videos and banter are complete,
    if there are more than two women with their lights still green,
    the bachelor eliminates all but two by turning off their lights.
</li>
<li>All of the women with their lights still turned on,
    plus the one who activated the burst light (if any),
    plus the heartbeat girl advance to the final round.
</li>
<li>The bachelor selects a question
    <a href="http://ifyouarethegif.tumblr.com/thetencategories">
    from a menu</a>,
    and prerecorded video responses from each finalist are played.
</li>
<li>The bachelor asks a question of his own choosing,
    and each finalist gives her answer.
</li>
<li>The bachelor selects the woman he wants to date.
    In the special case where the bachelor selects the heartbeat
    girl, but she had turned off her light earlier in the round,
    then she has the opportunity to reject the bachelor.
</li>
<li>The women who did not win a date return for the next round,
    or the next show if this was the final round of the day.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Anyway, my wife enjoys watching the show.
Me less so, seeing as I don't understand Mandarin
beyond being able to count to one hundred and 
maybe a dozen other vocabulary words.
</p>
<p>
And then
<a href="http://www.metafilter.com/154718/If-you-were-with-me-youd-suffer">
I learned</a>
that the show has been subtitled in English by Australian broadcaster SBS Two,
and
<a href="http://www.pri.org/stories/2015-10-09/why-australia-has-fallen-bizarrely-love-chinese-dating-show">
the show has taken the country by storm</a>.
Unfortunately for me, I'm not in Australia,
so in order to understand the show,
I have to ask
my wife to translate what's going on.
(Which she does, if I ask.)
</p>
<p>
If you don't understand Mandarin and you aren't married to a translator,
you can follow
<a href="http://commemorativefashionshoes.tumblr.com/">
the Commemorative Fashion Shoes Tumblr</a>&sup1;
which is devoted to screencaps of the more bizarre things
said on the show.
The Tumblr
<a href="http://ifyouarethegif.tumblr.com">
if you are the gif</a>
does the same thing, but does not appear to be active
any more.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
One should be careful not to assume that what happens
on television dating shows is how dating actually works
in the country of origin.
After all, you wouldn't want people to base their
knowledge of dating in the United States
on what happens on
<a href="http://abc.go.com/shows/the-bachelor">
The Bachelor</a>
or
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1ZOSdFBfpSQ">

Bill Nye</a>.)

		<p>Seems fairly similar to a British show called Take Me Out (which my girlfriend seems to enjoy, for some reason).</p>

		<p>Hah! For a second there I thought Raymond had found an _actual_ alternative dating show on which Bill Nye had appeared. I should&#39;ve known it was just a comedy sketch from </p>
<p>&quot;Almost Live!&quot; It was fun watching it again after all these years; boy, I sure miss &quot;Almost Live!&quot;&#8230;&quot;The 206&quot; wasn&#39;t really making the grade (it had the occasional gem, but wasn&#39;t the non-stop riot that the widely talented ensemble of &quot;Almost Live!&quot; managed).</p>
<p>While I agree we should not assume &quot;Serious Inquiries Only&quot; is representative of the dating scene in China, I fear that too much of the American dating scene _is_ in fact reflective of or (worse) informed by what folks see on a show like &quot;The Bachelor&quot;. Maybe not for all people, but there doesn&#39;t seem to be much distance between the show and the actual &quot;meat market&quot; bar scene that has been with us for decades.</p>

		<p>In a similar vein I rather liked the &quot;Dating in the Dark&quot; concept, which apparently caught on in China as well &#8211; contestants are literally in the dark, in an unlit house, while viewers get the benefit of infra-red cameras to see what&#39;s going on. Rather a neat idea I thought &#8211; though I imagine not understanding the language would leave you at an even bigger disadvantage than with regular TV shows!</p>

		<p>What isn&#39;t readily apparent from most descriptions is that the women who don&#39;t get a match return indefinitely! I thought they just lasted until the end of the episode and each new episode starts with 24 new women.</p>
<p>But really it sounds like the women are an ensemble cast in a reality TV series &#8212; almost to the point where getting matched with a bachelor is like being &quot;eliminated&quot; for some of them.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>I updated the rules to include that interesting fact. (I never knew that, because I never watched more than one episode at a time.) The author of the &quot;undercover story&quot; I linked to was advised by the other contestants, &quot;Don&#39;t forget to turn off the light&quot; so you stay on the show. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>The unmatched women don&#39;t return indefinitely. They are eligible for a maximum number of episodes. Sometimes the host may give unfortunate individuals, men or women, another go, base of popularity or whatnot.</p>

		<p>&gt; The English equivalent would be something like [&#8230;]</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;^^^^^^^^^^</p>
<p>A bit off-topic but my pet-peeve when looking at Chinese movies (and many movies from other Asian countries as well) is that the subtitle translator often fails to capture this. The result is often an English that sounds very strange. An obvious example that comes to mind is the Chinese word &quot;hao&quot; which literally means &quot;good&quot; but it can be used in a much wider context and is often used where an English speaker would say &quot;ok&quot; or &quot;alright&quot; (at least ASFAIU but my Chinese is very limited).</p>
<p>E.g.</p>
<p>&#8211; &quot;Do you accept this offer?&quot;/&quot;Is this offer good for you?&quot;</p>
<p>&#8211; &quot;Good!&quot;</p>
<p>Please note that this is not the same as going to China and make fun of weird English signs, because most translators are English/American (as far as I can tell) so I think it&#39;s just sloppy handiwork..</p>

		<p>It may help to understand that SBS is a public TV network with one of the most interesting business models of any public TV network in the world. It&#39;s diversified a lot now (most recently, they just started a free-to-air version of Food Network), but early on, SBS has acquired the best team of translators in the country, and hired them out to any business that needed it. Because it&#39;s also a TV network, subtitling and closed captioning was (and still is) part of the service.</p>

		<p>Iris: I was basing my &quot;indefinite&quot; notion on the linked &quot;undercover&quot; story where the author states that some women are on for 6 months or a year. And she tells the story of a bachelore who was paid to pick a certain contenstant who had been on for 150 episodes (18 months at two episodes per week) just to get her off the show.</p>

		<p>Well, funny you should mention this show. &nbsp;My son&#39;s ex-girlfriend went to China for 6 months and she was stopped on the street and asked if she wanted to be one of the &quot;foreign girlfriends&quot; on that show. &nbsp;Turns out the show is pretty hokey, they shot some scenes of the Chinese guy and her, romantic scenes with candlelit dinners and rose-petals a-fluttering. &nbsp; All totally bogus, but plausible-looking. &nbsp;At least she got a good dinner and union-scale pay out of it. &nbsp; </p>

		<p>I managed to make it though an episode of the show last night. It was a bit like watching a train wreck in slow motion &#8211; you know it&#39;s not going to end well, but you can&#39;t help but watch it happen.</p>
<p>You never know how successful the guys are going to be, either. One guy was doing well, with most of the 24 women still keen to date him, up until the friend interviews. In the space of a single sentence almost every one of the girls turned their light off. The friend&#39;s comment? &quot;He&#39;s looking for someone pale, skinny and rich.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s something I could watch much of, due to the cringe factor involved. But I can certainly see how it&#39;s got a cult following.</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
