<p>The <i>long pole</i> is the part of the project that is on the critical path due to its length. For example, if you have a project that consists of three independent sub-projects, then the sub-project with the longest completion date is the <i>long pole</i>.</p>
<p> The etymology of this term is simultaneously obvious yet hard to pin down. Intuitively, the long pole is the one that determines the height: If you have a tent supported by three poles, then the long pole decides how tall the tent is. If you have a collection of poles you want to put in the back of a pick-up truck, the long pole is the one that decides how big a bed you need. If you have a set of poles and you hold them in your hand in a sheaf and rest the bottoms on the ground, then the long pole is the one that sticks up the highest. </p>
<p> It is my impression that the tent analogy is the one that provides the source for this bit of Microspeak, but I'm not absolutely sure. If true, it's a nice bit of double-wordplay, because not only is it an analogy, but it's also a pun: The long pole is the one <i>holding everything up</i>. </p>
<p> You don't want to be a long pole in your project, because that just means that everybody will be giving your component extra scrutiny to make sure it's not going to make everything late. </p>

		<p>Seems to me that if you were to use say, Microsoft project to manage your project and display the Gantt chart then each task would be displayed as a horizontal bar looking kind of like a pole. &nbsp;And the longest duration task would look like the longest pole.</p>

		<p>I think its truck beds analogy, because the earliest you can complete a project (or the latest date till you have to fund a project) is the longest running sub projects (long pole) completion date. Which suites the truck scenario.</p>

		<p>I became very familiar with that term a couple years back. The C# compiler was the long pole for the last release of Visual Studio. &nbsp;And my feature (lambda expressions) was the long pole for the C# compiler. &nbsp;It was a rather terrifying position to be in.</p>

		<p>@mvadu:</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t mean to direct an insult or anything. &nbsp;I know this kind of thing can happen to anyone, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve done less flattering things myself (like searching for my glasses when I&#8217;m wearing and looking right through them).</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think the tent analogy works. &nbsp;The allusion to MS Project is the most sensible interpretation. &nbsp;This is also fairly common management-speak all over, although one of the more tolerable terms.</p>

		<p>I hadn&#8217;t heard this phrase until I joined Microsoft. &nbsp;And I hadn&#8217;t seen in written until this post. &nbsp;I assumed it was &quot;long pull&quot; analogous to &quot;long haul&quot;.</p>

		<p>The grammer in the first two examples doesn&#8217;t sound right. &nbsp;The tent analogy would make more sense if you would say:</p>
<p>Design on track, but setup work appears to be *the* long pole. </p>
<p>XYZ work is *the* long pole in the schedule&#8230;</p>
<p>The third one is correct as is:</p>
<p>XYZ is still the long pole&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
