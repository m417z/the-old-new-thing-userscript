Some time ago</a>, I noted that
"Building 109 Conference Room A"
was a code word for
the bar at
<a HREF="https://www.bing.com/maps/?v=2&amp;where1=3040+148th+Ave+NE,+Redmond,+WA&amp;encType=1">
the Azteca restaurant next to building 109</a>.
Alas, that code word is no more,
because
the Azteca restaurant has been demolished
to make way for
<a HREF="https://www.redmond.gov/PlansProjects/OverlakeVillageEmploymentArea/Redmond148">
an apartment complex</a>.
</p>
<p>
But when a door closes, a new door opens.
I've learned that the Chipotle's next to Amazon's
new downtown Bellevue office "Everest" has been nicknamed

Everest Conference Room C</a>.</p>

		<p>Across the street from our building is a bar named &#8220;The Dr.&#8217;s Inn&#8221;. We call it &#8220;going to the doctor&#8217;s office&#8221;.</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a bar located roughly a five minute walk from my old apartment that I nicknamed The Home Office because whenever I received a page at night I&#8217;d walk over, order a drink, and log in to figure out what was going on. The bartenders didn&#8217;t mind because I helped them with their IT stuff.</p>

		<p>I imagine that there are quite a few instances like that. I know that we have a bar named &#8220;The Library&#8221; here. In another city that I used to live in, there was a bar named &#8220;The Bank,&#8221; named because it used to be one a long time ago (and still had the vault to prove it).</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a bar in Santa Monica called &#8220;Father&#8217;s Office&#8221;.  Pretty sure there are some sad tales of childhood trauma behind that one.  (It was opened as a straight-up bar in 1953; since 2000, it&#8217;s been a gastropub.)</p>

		<p>A few weeks ago, I received a Google calendar invitation to a meeting in the [xyz] Room. I was interested to see that the name of the room was a hyperlink, and clicked on it to see whether our Facilities staff had done something slick, perhaps providing photographs or a floor plan. They had not. Google had noticed that there is a bar called The [xyz] Room in a midwestern city, and had provided this link.</p>

		<p>That room is where all the variable names go after they&#8217;re finished being used. It also contains the bit buckets for all your computers, but make sure that qualified maintenance personnel empty those periodically.</p>

		<p>In Spain, several years ago there was a television series called &#8220;Los ladrones van a La Oficina&#8221; (&#8220;Thiefs Go to The Office&#8221;). Note the capitalization: &#8220;La Oficina&#8221; (&#8220;The Office&#8221;) was the name of a café where, among the regular crowd, there was a group of pickpockets and con artists. The pun was that, in Spanish, &#8220;ir a la oficina&#8221; (&#8220;to go to the office&#8221;) means to go to work, specially at a white-collar position &#8211; quite the opposite to what pickpockets do.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
