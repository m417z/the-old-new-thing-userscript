<p> The <code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>CONTROL&shy;PARENT</wbr></wbr></code> extended style means "Hello, I am not really a dialog control. I am a control parent. In other words, I have children, and <i>those children</i> are controls." (Some people erroneously put the <code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>CONTROL&shy;PARENT</wbr></wbr></code> extended style on the main dialog itself. That's wrong, but fortunately it also has no effect.) </p>
<p> Okay, this is all stuff you already know. So why am I bringing up this topic? I sort of gave it away in the subject line: When you use <code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>CONTROL&shy;PARENT</wbr></wbr></code>, you need to be careful that the controls that you are promoting into the parent don't conflict with controls already in the parent, or with controls promoted into the parent by another sibling. </p>
<p> Suppose, in the above scenario, that window&nbsp;C also had the <code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>CONTROL&shy;PARENT</wbr></wbr></code> extended style, and it had children C1&nbsp;and&nbsp;C2. Not only do you have to watch out that B1 and B2 don't conflict with the controls A or D, you also have to watch out that it doesn't conflict with C1 or C2 either. </p>
<p> "But <a href="http://wikiality.wikia.com/Mr._Wizard"> Mister Wizard</a>, the property sheet control hosts multiple child dialogs, and since they can be provided by third parties, it's entirely possible (and likely) that there will be conflicts between B1 and, say, C2. Why doesn't this create a problem?" </p>
<p> Well, Timmy, most of the time, it doesn't, because notifications are fired to the control's parent, and in the case of child dialogs, the child dialog's child controls fire their notifications to the child dialog. So as long as the identifiers are unique within the child dialog, you won't have a problem. This isn't the entire answer, however, but to understand it further, we'll need to look at another consequence of control ID conflicts, which we'll take up next time. </p>

		<p>&gt; The WS_EX_CONTROL&shy;PARENT extended style means &quot;Hello, I am not really a dialog</p>
<p>&gt; control. I am a control parent. In other words, I have children, and those</p>
<p>&gt; children are controls.&quot; (Some people erroneously put the WS_EX_CONTROL&shy;PARENT</p>
<p>&gt; extended style on the main dialog itself. That&#39;s wrong, but fortunately it also</p>
<p>&gt; has no effect.)</p>
<p>Wait, what? &nbsp;My interpretation has always been WS_EX_CONTROLPARENT says &quot;I am the parent of a dialog control&quot;, and DS_CONTROL was for &quot;I am a dialog control&quot;, where &quot;dialog control&quot; is a dialog that is being used as a control. &nbsp;Have I been screwing things up all these years and never even noticed?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>WS_EX_CONTROL&shy;PARENT and DS_CONTROL <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/07/30/201988.aspx" rel="nofollow">are the same thing</a>. By &quot;a dialog being used as a control&quot; you mean a dialog that acts like (say) one enormous pushbutton? (I.e., the inner controls on the dialog should be considered internal details and not be exposed to the parent.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
