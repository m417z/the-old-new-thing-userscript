A customer reported having problems with the
<code>SH&shy;Get&shy;Known&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code> function.
I've left in the red herrings.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
On Windows&nbsp;7, I'm trying to retrieve the Internet folder
with the following code:
</p>
<pre>
if (OpenProcessToken(GetCurrentProcess(), TOKEN_ALL_ACCESS, &amp;hToken))
{
 HRESULT hr = SHGetKnownFolderPath(FOLDERID_InternetFolder,
                              KF_FLAG_DONT_VERIFY, hToken, &amp;pszPath);
 ...
}
</pre>
<p>
The call always fails with <code>E_FAIL</code>.
What am I doing wrong?
I tried passing <code>NULL</code> as the token, but that didn't help.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The reason the call fails has nothing to do with Windows&nbsp;7
or the token.
The call fails because <code>FOLDERID_<wbr>Internet&shy;Folder</wbr></code> is
a virtual folder&mdash;there is no path in the first place!
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=m><p>
The reason is that the folder you are requesting is a virtual
folder (KF_CATEGORY_VIRTUAL).
Virtual folders don't exist in the file system, so they don't have a path.
<code>SH&shy;Get&shy;Known&shy;Folder&shy;Item</code> should work.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The customer appears to have misinterpreted this response
in a way I wasn't expecting
(but which sadly
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/25/79842.aspx">
I've seen before</a>):
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
I added the <code>KF_<wbr>CATEGORY_<wbr>VIRTUAL</wbr></wbr></code> flag, but I still
get the same error back.
</p>
<pre>
if (OpenProcessToken(GetCurrentProcess(), TOKEN_ALL_ACCESS, &amp;hToken))
{
 HRESULT hr = SHGetKnownFolderPath(FOLDERID_InternetFolder,
                              KF_FLAG_DONT_VERIFY | KF_CATEGORY_VIRTUAL,
                              hToken, &amp;pszPath);
 ...
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Um, no, that makes no sense at all.
<code>KF_<wbr>CATEGORY_<wbr>VIRTUAL</wbr></wbr></code>
is a <code>KF_<wbr>CATEGORY</wbr></code>
value, but the second parameter to
<code>SH&shy;GetKnown&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code>
is a <code>KNOWN_<wbr>FOLDER_<wbr>FLAG</wbr></wbr></code>.
You can't just combine unrelated values like that.
It's like
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/06/03/147584.aspx">
adding 3&nbsp;grams to 12&nbsp;meters</a>.
</p>
<p>
And second, the <code>KF_<wbr>CATEGORY_<wbr>VIRTUAL</wbr></wbr></code> enumeration isn't
something that you pass in to "override" anything.
The point is that <code>FOLDERID_<wbr>Internet&shy;Folder</wbr></code> is a virtual
folder: It has no path, so if you try to ask for its path, you'll
just get an error back because the thing you're looking for
simply doesn't exist.
</p>
<p>
I never did figure out what this customer was trying to do.
Maybe they figured, since they can't
<a HREF="http://notalwaysright.com/byte-off-more-than-you-can-chew/2372">
download the Internet</a>,
they could at least try to do a
<code>Find&shy;First&shy;File</code> on it.</p>

		<p>A lot of times when people seem to not have read an answer, in reality it is that the answer went over their head so they grabbed whatever they could hold on to. Assume that the questioner doesn&#39;t know what a virtual folder is and has a mental model where everything has a path. Add to that that the function in the question and the function given in the answer have almost identical names, SHGetKnownFolderPath vs. SHÂ­GetÂ­KnownÂ­FolderÂ­Item.</p>
<p>Reading being sequential, I think that a good practice is to always put the correct answer as the first sentence in the answer. (And, for good measure and security, repeat it as the last sentence of the answer.) So, an answer with a potentially higher rate of success would be:</p>
<p>&quot;You have to call SHÂ­GetÂ­KnownÂ­FolderÂ­Item() for FOLDERID_InternetFolder. Do not call SHGetKnownFolderPath(). The reason is that the folder you are requesting is a virtual folder (KF_CATEGORY_VIRTUAL). Virtual folders don&#39;t exist in the file system, so they don&#39;t have a path. You have to call SHÂ­GetÂ­KnownÂ­FolderÂ­Item() for FOLDERID_InternetFolder.&quot;</p>

		<p>@Joshua Ganes</p>
<p>Well of course we can convert grams into meters! &nbsp;Since e = mc^2, all we need to do is convert the mass into energy to accelerate some other mass. &nbsp;Then, once we know how quickly the mass was converted into energy, then we can determine how far the accelerated mass went and add that value to our 12 meters.</p>
<p>Simple, right?</p>

		<p>Forget energy. The answer is 1.06538394 Newtons.</p>
<p>Assuming the object is 3 meters above sea level, to increase its mass by .003 kg, you must increase its weight by ((6.67300 Ã 10)^(-11))Ã(5.9742 Ã 10^24)(.003)/(12^2) = 1.06538394 Newtons</p>
<p>Correct me if I&#39;m wrong.</p>

		<p>Thanks for the help guys. I tried the following:</p>

<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>This didn&#39;t work and also caused a bunch of compile errors. I think I&#39;ll try asking someone with a little more experience with this sort of issue.</p>

		<p>I&#39;d hazard a guess the FOLDERID_InternetFolder probably wasn&#39;t actually what they were after in the first place. It&#39;s possible they were after FOLDERID_InternetCache, although even more likely they were trying to figure out where Internet Explorer was installed.</p>

		<p>@WndSks: Just call it a sanity check local to the function being called. &nbsp;I did actually make sure that the numeric value of KF_CATEGORY_VIRTUAL was not a valid KNOWN_FOLDER_FLAG :) &nbsp;Who knows, maybe something like this even exists in checked builds of Windows.</p>
<p>Besides, now we&#39;re rolling with 64 bits now baby&#8230; you can have twice as many flags for a parameter!</p>

		<p>Unrelated to this article&#8230; but related to this blog in general, so it might interest others. &nbsp;Firefox 4 is going to auto-pin itself to your Windows 7 taskbar (well, if you set it as default browser).</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blog.mozilla.com/rstrong/2011/02/09/firefox-auto-pinned-to-the-win7-task-bar/" rel="nofollow">blog.mozilla.com/&#8230;/firefox-auto-pinned-to-the-win7-task-bar</a></p>
<p>I immediately thought of Raymond&#39;s series of posts about user preferences vs applications forcing those prefs (Quick Launch shortcuts etc) and linked a few of those articles in the Firefox bug.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s easy to imagine how &quot;SHÂ­GetÂ­KnownÂ­FolderÂ­Item should work&quot; got read as &quot;SHÂ­GetÂ­KnownÂ­FolderÂ­Path should work&quot;, causing the person to believe that you were confirming that they were calling the right function. In this situation it&#39;s better to include some error correction bits so that the sentence doesn&#39;t make sense if they misread it. For example, &quot;SHÂ­GetÂ­KnownÂ­FolderÂ­Item should work instead&quot; or &quot;Use SHÂ­GetÂ­KnownÂ­FolderÂ­Item instead of SHÂ­GetÂ­KnownÂ­FolderÂ­Path for this&quot; or &quot;Change the function to SHÂ­GetÂ­KnownÂ­FolderÂ­Item&quot;.</p>

		<p>@The Mazzter yeah great, one more reason to uninstall firefox. Now when it breaks later on, it will be Microsoft&#39;s fault. But at least now I can point to the creator of it SAYING it&#39;s a bad idea.</p>

		<p>Random thought: Something in (or akin to) the Standard Annotation Language that said &quot;these flags belong in this parameter in these methods&quot; would cause a warning (or worse) if they were used in the wrong way so that &quot;KF_FLAG_DONT_VERIFY | KF_CATEGORY_VIRTUAL&quot; would generate said warning/error (with appropriate compiler work, of course).</p>

		<p>@The MAZZTer: How does it different than adding the shortcut to &quot;quick start&quot;, especially since &quot;quick start&quot; toolbar is not available by default in Win7?</p>
<p>Consider which is more annoying &#8211; 1) create toolbar that did not exist before for me, with just 1 application shortcut being added. 2) pinning it to taskbar if available will relevent feature added to interact with, and can be easily unpinned.</p>
<p>As long as they don&#39;t force it remain pinned on taskbar, I don&#39;t really think it does matter.</p>

		<p>Downloading the internet issue.</p>
<p>This will be very feasible in the next years as new mathematics will be invented (quantum math for example). What we lack currently is a proper compression algorithm, that is all, which is limited to known mathematics. So let&#39;s see how big internet currently is by crouching some numbers making some assumptions roughly &#8211; 8 billions people each having 10 TB system (there are some farm computer business and there are plenty people living at below poverty level, so let&#39;s assume that is the average) &#8211; results the internet size is 8 x 10^9 x 10^12 =&gt; 8 x 10^21 bytes for the internet size. Now invent a compress algorithm with a ratio of 8 x 10^21 / 1.44 x 10^6 =&gt; 1 : 5.56 x 10^15 compression ratio and you can fit the internet on a floppy. For those who will start to laugh may I remind that this is already been done by black holes who hold many more tones then 10^15 in a space smaller then the size of that floppy? Or that the Bing Bang theory is about the entire Universe being compressed to a size smaller then your pin roughly 15 billions years ago? Which makes our mathematics extremely primitive when you see that currently or in the past these compression rates already being implemented.</p>

		<p>There are plenty of ways to compress the internet to fit on a floppy, the hard part is the decompression afterwards, since they&#39;re all extremely lossy compression algorithms.</p>

		<p>@Cheong</p>
<p>It&#39;s relative annoyance is not the issue (to see why, consider this more extreme example &quot;Which is more painful -1) having your arm cut off. 2) Having your toe cut off. At least you can still walk with a missing toe.&quot;). It is taking something that should be a users choice and forcing it upon them. And it is doing it by using an unsupported hack &#8211; there is no supported way to programatically add your program to the taskbar.</p>
<p>If you still think it doesn&#39;t matter, ask yourself one of Raymond&#39;s favorite questions &#8211; what if everyone did this? Would you still be happy if iTunes put itself and Quicktime in the taskbar? What about trial software that inadvertently came along with a flash player update? And what if so many programs did this that there was no longer room for items you pinned to the taskbar yourself? Would you still be happy? What about if the installer crashed under the next service pack of Windows 7, because the implementation detail this hack relies on changes?</p>

		<p>This question is stupid. There&#39;s a much smarter way to retrieve the RIGHT answer:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Write a program which calls the api with EVERY combination of every flag.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Compare the result to what you want the api to return.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>When program gets the result it wants, that&#39;s the flags you should use!</p>
</li>
</ol>

		<p>@Greg</p>
<p>I meant a compression algorithm with no loss of data at decompression, thought that was obvious with my examples especially since the &quot;decompression&quot; of Universe is still happening. Guess I have to be extremely specific cause kinder-garden kids reads the blog.</p>

<p>Poor trolling my friend. I&#39;m afraid you will get no bites for your regrettable posts. Still, I implore you to consider bettering yourself. Stay in school, learn a trade, contribute something positive to society. With each comment like the one above, you make the world a little worse.</p>

		<p>The customer&#39;s point stands. &nbsp;E_FAIL is a terrible return code.</p>
<p>If someone&#39;s passing a flag that doesn&#39;t exist, a more appropriate return code is E_INVALIDARG.</p>
<p>If someone&#39;s looking for something that can&#39;t be found, a more appropriate return code is HRESULT_FROM_WIN32(ERROR_NOT_FOUND). &nbsp;There&#39;s at least one API that #define&#39;s this as E_NOTFOUND.</p>

		<p>This flag confusion is why Qt has its QFlags template type, see <a target="_new" href="http://doc.qt.nokia.com/4.7/qflags.html" rel="nofollow">doc.qt.nokia.com/&#8230;/qflags.html</a> for details.</p>
<p>Of course, this would not help if they were programming in C, but could be used to add a bit more type safety in C++.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
