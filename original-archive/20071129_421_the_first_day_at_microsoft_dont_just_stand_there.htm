<p>
A second installment in a very sporadic series titled
<i>The first day at Microsoft</i>,
relating stories of funny things that happened on people's
first days at Microsoft.
Today, we hear from Employee&nbsp;Y:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=m>
<p>
One of the things you have to do on your first day is get your
photo taken for your identification badge,
and I waited in line with the droves of other new college interns
starting that same day.
As a result, the line for photos extended out of the room
into the parking garage.
(ID badges are distributed from a room
in the basement of one of the parking garages.)
</p>
<pre>
     |-----
     | CAR
-----+-----
  * * * * * 
     +-----* 
ID   |      *
room |----- *
     | CAR  *
-----|----- *
     | CAR  *
     |----- *
     | CAR  *
     |----- *
</pre>
<p>
As we waited in line, a car pulled up and wanted to park in that
empty space near the door that people were blocking.
The entire line of college interns just stood and stared in stunned
amazement when they realized that the person driving the car was Bill Gates.
</p>
<p>
This stalemate lasted a good ten seconds before I spoke up and said,
"Hey, everybody. I think Bill is trying to park in that empty space."
</p>
<p>
That was enough to snap people out of their frozen state.
A hole was made, Bill parked his car, crisis resolved.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I like to amuse myself by thinking that
each of those interns that blocked Bill
from getting to the parking space cost the company
more money in wasted time
than the intern will make all summer.</p>

		<p>Glancing at your post I saw a diagram with several CARs in it and thought you were going to write about LISP data structures.</p>
<p>Back on topic, there are parking meters in London earning considerably more than the workers in the adjacent shops. &nbsp;Which must be depressing.</p>

		<p>Wait a minute. Is Bill Gates really so productive that wasting 30 seconds of his time will cost the company tens of thousands of dollars?</p>
<p>Maybe Microsoft should start closely monitoring the amount of time that he spends in the bathroom.</p>

		<p>From now on, I want confirmation from the man himself on these stories. &nbsp;They reek of urban legend. &nbsp;And why the weird entrancement? &nbsp;I have had the opportunity to meet Bill at conferences on a couple occasions and once when I was still in High School. &nbsp;He was very approachable and personable, not the type of person at all who seems like he wants to be revered in this way. &nbsp;It probably creeps him out a little bit.</p>

		<p>This actually happened to me in 2001. The conversation actually went like</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, I think somebody is trying to get into that space&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Oooh, who is it, Bill Gates?&quot;</p>
<p>And it was. And then corporate security shooed us all out of the parking garage and into a hallway. I bet the incident happened multiple times because the line to get your badge taken is in a very inconvenient place.</p>

		<p>Obviously, this happened before 2001/2, when Bill&#8217;s office was in same building as security office. Today, this situation cannot repeat :)</p>

		<p>I ran into the same thing during my first internship in 2001. &nbsp;Back then, Bill and Steve both had reserved parking spots right outside the main security office in Building 8. &nbsp;Every week, the new interns got their badges right around 1:00 pm and Bill probably ran into them on Mondays coming back from lunch.</p>

		<p>Well, he might lose his ID badge again, and then nobody would know who he was.</p>
<p>If you were to give them all sticky-shoes, they might be able to queue up on the walls of the building, saving space.</p>

		<p>Why the weird entrancement? I dunno, you&#8217;ll have to ask the bright eyed interns yourself.</p>
<p>When I was an intern I went to the intern dinner at Bill&#8217;s house (before he built is new one) After dinner a dozen or so interns were gathered around chatting with Bill. As it was time to go, I walked up to him and shook his hand, and thanked him for dinner. The rest of the group stood around like deer in a headline with their mouths wide open. Looking as if &quot;you can shake his hand?&quot;</p>
<p>This story doesn&#8217;t even come close to reeking of urban legend.</p>

		<p>@ChrisMcB: &#8230;&quot;dear in a headline&#8230;&quot;?</p>
<p>OK, that&#8217;s probably a typo.</p>
<p>I think Mr. Gates should just work 30 seconds later rather than lose the company $1000s.</p>
<p>I used to work for H. Ross Perot in the early 80s (EDS on Forest Lane in Dallas). &nbsp;When he decided to show up in his helicopter, sometimes interns got splattered all over the golf course.</p>

<p>Based on a few runs of my Bill Gates Monte Carlo location profiler, BG spends almost 100% of his time in his car.</p>

		<p>Speaking of weird billg-isms &#8230; Yahoo is currently running a headline &quot;Burgers with Bill&quot;. &nbsp;Billg is being interviewed at a fast food place, sitting at a table by the window. A guy walks up to the window and mouths &quot;can you spare some change?&quot;. &nbsp; :)</p>

		<p>If I was Bill Gates and knew I was probably going to drive through a line of interns that day, I&#8217;d go to work driving an old Citro&#235;n 2CV. Just to confuse them. :)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
