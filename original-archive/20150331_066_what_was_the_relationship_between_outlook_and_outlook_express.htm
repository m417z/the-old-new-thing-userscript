<p>Brian wonders <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/05/07/10522854.aspx#10523092"> whether project Stimpy became Outlook Express</a>.</p>
<p> As noted in the article, projects Ren and Stimpy were merged into a single project, which became Outlook. You could say that Stimpy became Outlook, too. </p>
<p> Outlook Express (code name <i>Athena</i>) was originally known as Internet Mail and News. This was back in the day when the cool, hip thing for Web browsers to do was to incorporate as many Internet client features as possible. In the case of Internet Mail and News, this was POP (mail) and NNTP (news). </p>
<p> After Outlook became a breakout hit, the Internet Mail and News project was renamed to Outlook Express in an attempt to ride Outlook's coattails. It was a blatant grab at Outlook's brand awareness. (See also: SharePoint Workspaces was renamed OneDrive for Business; Lync was renamed Skype for Business.) </p>
<p> The decision to give two unrelated projects the same marketing name created all sorts of false expectations, because it implied that Outlook Express was a "light" version of Outlook. People expected that Outlook Express could be upgraded to Outlook, or that Outlook Express and Outlook data files were compatible with each other. </p>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/05/20/10526823.aspx"> Code name reuse is common at Microsoft</a>, and for a time, the code names <i>Ren</i> and <i>Stimpy</i> were popular, especially for projects that were closely-related. (As I vaguely recall, there was a networking client/server project that called the server <i>Ren</i> and the client <i>Stimpy</i>. But I may be misremembering, and <i>Ren</i> and <i>Stimpy</i> may just have been the names of the two source code servers.) You may have heard the names <i>Ren</i> and/or <i>Stimpy</i> in reference to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/05/07/10522854.aspx#10523096"> some other projects</a>. Doesn't mean that your projects are related to any others with the same name. </p>

		<p>And how does (Vista) Windows Mail fit into the picture? Is it just OE with the COM API finally documented or a different beast? I know it dropped several useful features and integration with SHSetUnreadMailCount etc. And what about the Windows Live stuff that replaced it?</p>

		<p>Thanks for the Information about the underlying difference about Outlook and OE. It is really stupid and I cannot understand, why Outlook does not Support some simple things like file formates of the other program. Will it ever change?</p>
<p>PS: I am also interested in the question of skSdnW</p>

		<p>And I really miss OE when I found Vista mail client drops NNTP connectivity. Although few people join newsgroup these days, at that time that was the only connection between me and a few newsgroup friends.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not happy with the decision for Microsoft to drop NNTP (both client and server) at all. Although I know there are other NNTP server/client&#8230; I&#39;m just unhappy.</p>

		<p>If I recall, Frontpage Express came with IE too. Was that related to Frontpage codebase-wise any more than OE was to Outlook?</p>
<p>Also, I recall Outlook having a &quot;newsgroups&quot; menu item that launched Outlook Express. Did Outlook ever support newsgroups on its own or was this added in response to the name confusion?</p>

		<p>They decided to confuse the hell out of customers and their own employees intentionally once again by rebranding Hotmail to Outlook. Just the other day I contacted their incompetent support for Outlook.com help, they ask me &quot;What version of Outlook are you running?&quot; Not to mention the Outlook.com search was so bad when it transitioned from Hotmail that I was unable to search my emails properly for a long time. Regressions and constant reset of past innovation to make their latest technology sell is Microsoft&#39;s hallmark.</p>

		<p>I always considered Outlook Express to be a better email client to Outlook anyway. &nbsp;I remember it had a better mail filtering system, and Outlook Express&#39; had a much friendlier search interface. &nbsp;Almost 20 years later, and Outlook 2013&#39;s search still doesn&#39;t provide a graphical date picker for selecting date ranges, and instead offers fuzzy things like &quot;This Week&quot;, &quot;Last Week&quot;, &quot;This Month&quot;, &quot;Last Month&quot;.</p>

		<p>They really are different. I&#39;ve used Internet Mail and News as a work setup, way back when. Not to be confused with Internet Mail OR Microsoft Mail. One related and the other, very different.</p>
<p>My take is, if you use Exchange, invest in Outlook. If not, Outlook Express, and nowadays Windows Live Mail, is good for any old SMTP/POP3/IMAP requirements. Using Outlook without an Exchange backend is overkill/underutilized. Of course, YMMV.</p>

		<p>I love Outlook Express. &nbsp;I love it so much that I keep a 10-year old XP system around, just so that I can run Outlook Express on it. &nbsp;I have not found a substitute. &nbsp;I have not had good luck with the Windows Live suite. &nbsp;I have tried several other light-weight (so-called) email clients, but they are just not the same. &nbsp;I hate to pile on with the Microsoft bashers, but it does make one wonder what product management is thinking in abandoning such a crowd-pleaser.</p>

		<p>@Henri Hein: I used Outlook Express at home back in the 1990s, and now I&#39;m using Outlook 2013 at work. I really can&#39;t complain, especially given the advanced editing features which are consistent with those I&#39;m used to from Word 2013. I don&#39;t have an Office 365 subscription at home, but that&#39;s because I&#39;m not working from home, so it doesn&#39;t really matter if my occassional email is sent via iOS Mail, Gmail web interface or whatever. The age of competing email clients is pretty much over.</p>

		<p>There was also the Exchange that shipped with Windows 95 which was a mail client (also fax, Compuserve, and other things), so confusign product names for mail server/client/services go way back. Nowadays I actually use the Mail app for mail (yes, the metro one) on Windows 8.1 at home. </p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
