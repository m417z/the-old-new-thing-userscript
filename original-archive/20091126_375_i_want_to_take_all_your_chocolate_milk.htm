<p>My older niece visited me at work one day, and I got her a carton of chocolate milk, which she very much enjoyed. Some days later, she told me, "I want to go to your work."</p>
<p> "Why?" I asked. </p>
<p> "I want to take all your chocolate milk." </p>
<p> Missing from the story is that upon returning home after that first visit, she told everybody about her awesome visit with her uncle, and that he even got her a chocolate milk from the refrigerator. "And the chocolate milk is free, you can just take it!" </p>
<p> Her uncle (not me, a different uncle) told her, "Then you should go there with a knapsack and take all the chocolate milk." </p>
<p> That uncle is clearly a troublemaker. I'll have to keep an eye on him. </p>

		<p>Well, a free system without rules is begging to be abused :) its actually a consumer life-lesson, so in a roundabout-ways this uncle is passing down good advice.</p>
<p>Unless of course they aren&#8217;t actually free and he is unknowingly encouraging theft.</p>
<p>Did you pay for it without her knowing?</p>

		<p>Someone somewhere is paying for it either way. Abuse of the system is (morally if not legally) theft then. Of course, if she has such cravings for chocolate milk then there could be a temporary insanity plea if it is not provided&#8230; ;-)</p>

		<p>I worked for a company many years ago that worked with Microsoft, so I occasionally had to drive up to the Redmond campus. Every time I did so, my co-workers insisted I take a backpack to get them chocolate milk. Our office had free soda, but no free dairy&#8230;</p>

		<p>Tell your niece to get an Internship then; the Interns pull those kind of antics semi-regularly (although they seem to favor the soda more, and rarely take ALL the soda).</p>

		<p>There are no dishonest people, only dishonest actions. Some people have mental disorders, but I don&#8217;t think dishonesty is the right diagnosis.</p>
<p>Systems lend themselves to certain kinds of use. Well-designed systems self-regulate &#8211; they have feedback mechanisms which push against abuses.</p>

		<p>&quot;There are no dishonest people, only dishonest actions&quot;</p>
<p>And the people who carry out those dishonest actions would commonly be referred to as dishonest. It&#8217;s a strange view to say that any dishonest action is the result of a mental disorder&#8230;</p>
<p>Anywho, that&#8217;s far too serious a topic for such a light-hearted post.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not like he&#8217;s really telling her to steal chocolate milk. He&#8217;s just playing a trick on her &#8212; there&#8217;s no way she could actually take all of the chocolate milk. Even one recently-filled-cooler&#8217;s worth of chocolate milk wouldn&#8217;t fit into her bag. Let alone that each floor has several coolers, each building has several floors, and there are dozens of buildings.</p>

		<p>The trick is as usual to make a high quality product (at home).</p>
<ol>
<li>Use fresh milk</li>
<li>
<p>Make a lot of milk froth</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make a cat shape with chocolate powder at the top.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Bonus: Tell her that the other uncle makes young playing dogs.</p>

		<p>Being a Chinese myself, this almost stinks of those cheapskate employees (sweeping statement: usually mainland Chinese by observation) who&#8217;ll actually wipe out all the drinks / food / alcohol / what-not from the common office pantry (meant to be shared / consumed in office), and bring them home for personal consumption.</p>
<p>These people are just selfish idiots who&#8217;ll exploit anything for personal gain.</p>
<p>And yes, you&#8217;ll definitely have to beware of this uncle and possibly re-educate your niece before things get worse.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
