<p> Every year, <a href="http://www.roadandtrack.com/"> <i>Road and Track</i></a> magazine reviews a strange vehicle in their April edition. Last year, it was <a href="http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?article_id=3386"> the 1949 MG TC</a>. But my favorite is their 2005 review of <a href="http://www.roadandtrack.com/article.asp?article_id=2091"> the Zamboni 500</a>. </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p> [T]he Zamboni leaves the line with alacrity (revved to its 3000-rpm redline), rockets up to 9.7 mph and then stays at exactly that speed for the full 200-ft. length of the rink. Those old myths that you will "black out" or "be unable to breathe" at speeds above 9.5 mph proved to be completely untrue. I was perfectly comfortable, once I got over the excitement, and felt no ill effects then or later. </p>
<p> There's not much luggage space, unless you dump the snow, and $50,000 is a lot of money for any sport ute with a top speed of only 9.7 mph. </p>

		<p>Hard to beat the March 2002 Car and Driver review of the Cadillac Escalade EXT. &nbsp;You can&#8217;t find it online anymore (and it&#8217;s not on Archive.org) but if you can find a copy it&#8217;s a great read.</p>

<p>Too bad it&#8217;s not online anymore &#8211; even Forbe&#8217;s magazine gave kudos to the review.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a copy on sale on eBay for just a buck (oh, plus $20 shipping!).</p>

		<p>&quot;Those old myths that you will &quot;black out&quot; or &quot;be unable to breathe&quot; at speeds above 9.5 mph proved to be completely untrue.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s obviously an egregious lie! No one can survive that kind of speed. Everybody know that when you reach a meager 8.8mph you travel in time.</p>
<p>Unless the Zamboni 500 doesn&#8217;t have a flux capacitor. But with a price tag of 50000$ I sure hope there is one onboard.</p>

		<p>Is to be a Zamboni driver, once all the programming jobs are outsourced to some 3rd world country.</p>

		<p>Driving a Zamboni looks easy (just drive around in circles, right?). It&#8217;s only when you try to play hockey after the new guy cuts the ice that you realize that there is some skill (art?) to operating the Zamboni.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
