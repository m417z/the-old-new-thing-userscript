<p> It so happens that I wrote a sample program ages ago to illustrate how to do this. You can find it in the Platform&nbsp;SDK under <code>winui\fulldrag</code>. The source code is also reproduced in <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/121541"> this Knowledge Base article</a>. </p>
<p> In addition to deferring painting, you may also want to defer layout if layout is expensive for your window. </p>

		<p>Cool. A small advice for anybody willing to try:</p>
<p>To demonstrate the program on current computers the MAXDEPTH should be set to something bigger like 11. Then first modify Hilbert_OnPaint to have</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;if (0 &amp;&amp; g_fDragging) {</p>
<p>recompile and observe how resizing behaves. Then change the line back to</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;if (g_fDragging) {</p>
<p>recompile again and observe the difference.</p>

		<p>@Marquess</p>
<p>I completely understand this. There have been pleanty of times I have read something and the first thing I thought of afterwards was &quot;wrong&quot;.</p>
<p>Hmm, the only issue with this kind of thing is that there would be WM_PAINT messages generated while you are dragging, even if you just not paint. So you will be using up processor time because of the paint messages. Well, it is better than painting every time (since that is a lot more expensive). But I&#8217;m sure there are people out there who would want a way to just switch it off with one call.</p>
<p>(And just in case, I&#8217;m going to put a disclaimer on this. I am a supporter of Windows. The above is not saying I want a way to suspend this behaviour with one call or anything like that. I am happy with the way Windows does things, even if they are frustrating at times)</p>
<p>But I am surprised, usually there are people bashing how the window manager works in cases like these. Where have they all gone today?</p>

		<p>Crescens2k, how many times do you think the mouse cursor can move every second? 10? 100? 1000? My guess is the answer is closer to 10, but I doubt you could get WM_PAINT messages more often than the screen refresh rate (about 100). It would probably have to be a million before you&#8217;d notice the extra WM_PAINT messages.</p>

		<p>WM_PAINT &quot;messages&quot; get coalesced anyway.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fortunate that the customer clarified their question, since that made it much easier to answer. (A literal answer to their question would probably have involved messing around with SystemParametersInfo.)</p>
<p>Things get trickier when you want to perform &quot;near-live&quot; update, that it, you want to be able to interrupt your layout process to handle the next mouse move. You can&#8217;t just post yourself a message to remind you that you haven&#8217;t finished layout, because the windowdrag event loop will simply process the posted message first.</p>

<p>I did (years ago), appears to work. Still dont know what the window manager expects though.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>I think you let the message pass through to DefWindowProc, which handles it by calling BeginPaint/EndPaint and painting just the background.

		<p>@error:</p>
<p>For the first two, just add two casts, they are legitimate because SelectObject returns a generic HGDIOBJ while the code stores the return value in variables of the exact type of the object.</p>
<p>For the last one, it seems that that var has been forgotten from some previous version of that code. I assume you can remove it safely.</p>

		<p>Hi,</p>
<p>If we are talking about the WndProc function and the way how the window manager works, I am curious why the following thing happen:</p>
<p>For example: you open up a window/dialog (e.g. the &#8220;Date and Time Properties&#8221; dialog) which draws something on the client area/update controls of the window let&#8217;s say every second. Now, if you press the &#8220;X&#8221; button and !keep! the mouse button down, the update of the window including its controls will stop, even if you move the mouse cursor from the &#8220;X&#8221; button, but keeping your mouse button down (I am not talking about multithreaded updates now). What is the technical background of this behavior? (the same happens in case of the &#8220;_&#8221;, &#8220;[]&#8221; and &#8220;?&#8221; caption bar buttons as well).</p>
<p>Thanks</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
