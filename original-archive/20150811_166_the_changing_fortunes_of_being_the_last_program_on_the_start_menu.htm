<p>One of the thing I didn't mention during my discussion lo many
years ago on
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/06/11/3215739.aspx">
how Windows XP chooses what goes on the front page
of the Start menu</a>
is that the
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/24/676670.aspx">
the last-place position is actually kind of special</a>.
<span id="more-91131"></span></p>
<p>In Windows Vista, the last-place position was used to
hold the program you ran most recently,
regardless of how often you ran it.
In a sense, the last slot is a one-entry MRU.
(This was the general idea, although it could be overridden
by other principles.
For example, if the program you last ran is pinned,
then it shows up in its natural pinned location rather
than being shoved to the bottom of the Start menu.)</p>
<p>In Windows&nbsp;7, the magical last-place position goes to
the application you just installed, if one exists,
to save you the trouble of hunting for it.
(As we saw
<!-- backref: Marking a shortcut to say that it should not be placed on the Windows 8 Start page upon installation -->
some time ago,
you can set the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd391568(v=vs.85).aspx">
System.<wbr>App&shy;User&shy;Model.<wbr>Exclude&shy;From&shy;Show&shy;In&shy;New&shy;Install</wbr></wbr></a>
property to remove your shortcut from consideration as a newly-installed
program.)</p>

		<p>Does Windows 10 do anything with the last spot on the Start menu, now that pinned apps go elsewhere?</p>

		<p>On a Vista machine I have at hand it seems to be more complicated than what is described. It seems that the last run program gets put somewhere in the middle of the list not in the last place (icons above it are very-frequently used apps, below it, not so much). Also, programs started from pinned taskbar icons do not automagically appear in the front page of the start menu (but if the same program is started from the start menu it does)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
