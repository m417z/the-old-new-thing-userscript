<p> Every few years, the building maintenance people have to perform tests on the elevators to ensure they meet safety regulations. And the real estate department sends out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/02/9682669.aspx"> the usual notice</a> informing the building occupants that the elevators in the building will be taken out of service at various times during the day. They were kind enough to include the following advice: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> If an elevator is non-responsive and/or has out of order signage posted, please use another available elevator. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> One of my colleagues sarcastically remarked, "Wow, thank goodness they sent that email. I'd have no idea what to do had I seen a non-responsive elevator with an 'out of order' sign posted on it." </p>

		<p>Of course, the meaning of the message is in fact &quot;please don&#39;t phone us to tell us that the elevator is non-responsive or &#39;out of order&#39; and don&#39;t take some other action to inform us or complain, we know about it, we planned it, so please just use another one.&quot;</p>

		<p>What &quot;acq&quot; said.</p>
<p>Today&#39;s article just seems like unnecessary snarkiness to me. &nbsp;Granted, having to deal with us all the time and our snarkiness is bound to lead to a bit of it showing up in the blog too.</p>
<p>But I think the email from facilities is about the best, most diplomatic way they could say it. &nbsp;If anything, it&#39;s not the maintenance people who need making fun of, but rather the people who see an &quot;out of order&quot; sign posted by them and still consume customer-support cycles to report it.</p>

		<p>I would have written the message like this:</p>
<p>&nbsp;If an elevator doesn&#39;t work, or has an &quot;Out of Order&quot; sign on it, use another one.</p>
<p>None of these &quot;signage&quot; and &quot;non-responsive&quot; 50-cent words.</p>

		<p>Maybe they can make this even more inclusive so they will have to send out less emails. “If something doesn&#39;t work or has an Out or Order sign and there is another one available use another one”. This could apply to a bathroom, a coffee maker, just about anything really.</p>

		<p>Sometimes it is Facilities who is clueless. One place I worked, Facilities sent out an email telling everyone that the restrooms on each floor were sufficient and not to go to other floors in the building to use the restrooms. This was a 10+ story, multi-tenant building with some retail, so some of the restrooms were actually accessible to the customers of the retail tenants. I worked for the tenant that actually owned the building and on the floor I worked on, there were some retail tenants, including a cafe. A coworker looked up the actual OSHA regulations, did a quick cubical survey, and determined that before you add in the retail usage, the men&#39;s restrooms on the floor were NOT in compliance with the OSHA regs. Me, I just continued to go to another floor when the men&#39;s restroom on my floor was at capacity.</p>

		<p>The real problem, of course, is that they need to keep the failed elevator around long enough for Windows Elevator Reporting to perform full diagnostics before replacing it&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#39;s handy to label them when it&#39;s either deliberately offline for maintenance, or has broken down and the failure has been reported &#8211; and to notify in advance, in case someone needs to move heavy equipment so they can reschedule. (My own floor is split between two slightly different levels, so one elevator can reach each level; both can reach the other 3 floors.) Of course, a more optimistic maintenance department might include the suggestion of using stairs instead when the elevator fails.</p>
<p>My university building has bathrooms on each floor; my own floor has &#39;staff&#39; and &#39;gents&#39;. Being an engineering department, there are in fact no female staff on that particular floor now, but it still stuck in my mind how strange to have &quot;staff&quot; implicitly mean &quot;male staff&quot;. (The recent refit changed this to &#39;male staff&#39; &#8211; shortly after the last female staff member left that floor.)</p>
<p>If &#39;out of order&#39; is a problem, I wonder how they&#39;d cope with the problem in the next building to mine, where dewars of liquid nitrogen have to ride alone. (Get stuck in the car with one due to a power failure or other problem, you might well run out of air before being rescued.)</p>

		<p>@dave Except that the normal definition for &quot;or&quot; in English (and every other language I speak) is more &quot;xor&quot;.

		<p>@above all sarcastic people regarding elevators</p>
<p>Are you all fat programmers who can&#39;t use stairs anymore? Are stairs out of order?</p>
<p>And don&#39;t reply to me with &quot;what if I work at 100th floor?&quot; sarcasm &#8211; I bet none of you is working in Taipei 101, or even Empire State Building &#8211; and the story is about Micro$oft building, not that tall after all.</p>

		<p>@Danny: I don&#39;t know the floor plans at Microsoft, but at one of the companies I worked with, the way to stairs are inside the Office. (The company owns the whole floor, and installed big glass doors to claim space from where used to be part of the corridor. Which means people walking out to lift lobby without staff card will stuck there if all lifts are out of order.)</p>
<p>Btw, I don&#39;t think people will put &quot;Out of order&quot; sign on every floor. So if the lift maintenance starts within the office hour, it makes sense to send such email.</p>

<p>I remember Maurits also commented on that. My search engine of choice seems to be full of fail, or the discussion was removed.</p>

		<p>@Danny</p>
<p>I used to work on the third floor of a 4 story building, and would have used stairs if I could. The doors in the stairwell only opened from in the offices, so they worked in emergencies but forced visitors to use the elevators and walk past the reception desk.</p>

		<p>I would have hoped that the unavailable elevators would have been signed &quot;Closed for maintenance&quot; or some such, assuming it&#39;s not too arduous to attach the necessary signs to the outside on each floor.</p>

		<p>The lift in the building I&#39;m living has &quot;Out of Order&quot; light at the bottom of level indicators. If an engineer come to check the lift, he&#39;d just need to turn on the light with the key, and everyone in the affected floors will know they have to use lift at alternate floor.</p>

		<p>I think people are overestimating the intelligence (or at least perceptivity) of many office workers. There&#39;s been times I&#39;ve come up to my company&#39;s elevator and the door is stuck half open with the car half visible up the shaft with a worker down in the pit, and still people will be standing there waiting. Or walk up and push the button and stand there waiting.</p>

		<p>I can just picture it now&#8230; The elevator plunging down 100 storeys&#8230; My life flashing before my eyes&#8230; Then Clippy turns up with a cheerful message, to wit: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://s13.postimage.org/q1v53uv53/Clippy.jpg" rel="nofollow">s13.postimage.org/&#8230;/Clippy.jpg</a> I hear someone scream (is it me?), as I desperately try to wake up&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
