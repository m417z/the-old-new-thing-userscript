<p>A customer designed a system which uses shared memory. Specifically, for each database file, they create a corresponding shared memory block of, say, 200<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/11/9725386.aspx">MB</a>. Multiple clients which connect to the same database file use the same shared memory block. Naturally, if two processes each access the same database file, each process will map the shared memory block into their respective address space. The question arose regarding what happens if one process connects to the same database file twice. Will the two calls to <code>Map&shy;View&shy;Of&shy;File</code> share the same address space, or will each one allocate a separate chunk of address space?</p>
<p> Win32 makes no guarantees what will happen. All that you can be sure of is that the memory will be mapped into your address space, and you will get a pointer to it, and when you're done, you call <code>Unmap&shy;View&shy;Of&shy;File</code>. Whether the two calls return the same pointer is unspecified. </p>
<p> In fact, Windows&nbsp;95 returned the same pointer, whereas Windows&nbsp;NT returns a different pointer. We saw this earlier when we intentionally <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/07/55194.aspx"> mapped the same shared memory block multiple times</a>, and observed somebody actually taking a dependency on this behavior in order to effect <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/10/26/247918.aspx"> the strangest way of detecting Windows&nbsp;NT</a>. Don't take a dependency on this behavior; who knows, maybe a future version of Windows&nbsp;NT will consolidate multiple mappings in order to conserve address space. </p>
<p> If you want force this consolidation behavior, you'll have to roll it yourself, say with a lookup table of active mappings and a reference count. </p>

		<p>Not to defend them, and also their purpose might have been nefarious.</p>
<p>But probably the multimedia company who wrote that complex NT detection routine (and all the associated bugs) was trying to find a way to detect NT even in case someone used the application compatibility or other tricks to fake the reported version.</p>

		<p>You can force several mappings by specifying different protection options (dwDesiredAccess parameter in MapViewOfFile), and presumably modify these with VirtualProtect. Any changes to the current mapping behavior would therefore be inconsistent.</p>

		<p>@Joshua</p>
<p>On the Windows 98 SE media, in WIN98_38.CAB there is the file ntdll.dll. It is around 20KB in size and it has a few of the functions exported from the NT version of ntdll (probably to help with portability). Of course, this DLL depends on kernel32.dll, not the other way around as is the case in NT.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t have the original Win98 media to check that out, but it is definitely there in SE.</p>

		<p>What&#39;s the real problem here? Is anybody actually running out of bytes in a 64-bit address space? Seems unbelievable to me.</p>
<p>That said, I&#39;d be careful about virtual address aliasing. I may have worked on some processors which might have shipped with performance bugs when using aliased cache lines.</p>

		<p>@Pramod</p>
<p>Maybe not 64bit, but could be the case for 32bit.</p>
<p>You must remember that these posts are queued for quite some time, and can be in response to things that happened even longer before that.</p>
<p>So think about you being stuck back in 2004/2005 and your application is going to run on a 32bit system. So if you were mapping in multiple database files, would you want to let so much address space be used up for the same database?</p>

		<p>Why do so many people assume that everybody can just instantly switch to 64-bit? There are plenty of people with only 32-bit hardware, running 32-bit OSes on 64-bit hardware, using 32-bit only libraries, working with a codebase that isn&#39;t portable to 64-bit, or even on an architecture that doesn&#39;t have a 64-bit version (like ARM).</p>

		<p>I have a program that forks off a second process. &nbsp;The first process creates a pagefile-backed section with CreateFileMapping, then DuplicateHandles it into the child process. &nbsp;Both processes then map the section into their address spaces with MapViewOfFileEx. &nbsp;Can these two programs, using the same underlying section object, rely upon the mapping being shared with memory writes instantly available to the other side?</p>

		<p>@Myria</p>
<p>From the CreateFileMapping documentation found at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa366537(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/aa366537(v=vs.85).aspx</a></p>
<p>&quot;With one important exception, file views derived from any file mapping object that is backed by the same file are coherent or identical at a specific time. Coherency is guaranteed for views within a process and for views that are mapped by different processes.</p>
<p>The exception is related to remote files. Although CreateFileMapping works with remote files, it does not keep them coherent. For example, if two computers both map a file as writable, and both change the same page, each computer only sees its own writes to the page. When the data gets updated on the disk, it is not merged.</p>
<p>A mapped file and a file that is accessed by using the input and output (I/O) functions (ReadFile and WriteFile) are not necessarily coherent.&quot;</p>

		<p>Gabe, people who want to map over 2 GB of data (or people who want to run an application that requires it) can these days be expected to pay the $200 for a PC upgrade to a 64-bit system. Yeah. $100 for a 64-bit CPU, 4 GB RAM *and* a motherboard and $100 for a OEM copy of Win-7.</p>

		<p>Yes. And port third parties DLL &amp; COM components to 64bit. And check&amp;fix all pointer casts. And retest it all. That is &#8211; if you can &#8211; because those libraries may still be 32bit only, or some needed hardware piece might not have 64bit drivers yet, etc. etc. etc.</p>
<p>Stop thinking only about your desktop.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
