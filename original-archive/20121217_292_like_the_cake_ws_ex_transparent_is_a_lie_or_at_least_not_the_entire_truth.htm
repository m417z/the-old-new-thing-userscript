<p>There is an extended window style known as <code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>TRANSPARENT</wbr></wbr></code>. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/20/10040074.aspx#10040814"> Explaining what this style does</a> is kind of difficult, but it's been on the list of future topics <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/15/54925.aspx#78373"> since 2003</a>. Better late than never, I guess.</p>
<p> First of all, there are two unrelated senses of <i>transparent</i> in play. One is visual transparency: Pixels beneath the window can show through. The other is hit-test transparency: Do clicks on this window go to the window, or do they pass through to the window beneath? </p>
<p> And each of those senses of <i>transparent</i> is itself complicated. </p>
<p> Let's look a hit-test transparency first. We saw some time ago that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/12/30/10110077.aspx"> It's Complicated</a>. Different hit-testing functions use different methods of determining whether a click should be given to a window or pass through it. And the <code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>TRANSPARENT</wbr></wbr></code> extended window style plays into some of those rules. I'll let you read the linked article to learn the details. </p>
<p> Okay, now to visual transparency. The <code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>TRANSPARENT</wbr></wbr></code> extended window style alters the painting algorithm as follows: If a <code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>TRANSPARENT</wbr></wbr></code> window needs to be painted, and it has any non-<code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>TRANSPARENT</wbr></wbr></code> windows siblings (which belong to the same process) which also need to be painted, then the window manager will paint the non-<code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>TRANSPARENT</wbr></wbr></code> windows first. </p>
<p> That "lets the other windows paint first" behavior is what gave the style its name, because if you let the other windows paint first, and then you paint on top of it, then the parts you don't actually paint will appear to be transparent because the other windows' pixels will show through. </p>
<p> Calling this painting style <i>transparent</i> is kind of overselling the feature. It's really a very specific behavior which makes transparent rendering <i>sort of possible</i>; it's not a <i>just turn this on and you get transparent rendering</i> feature. </p>
<p> It's like taking a lump of coal and labeling it <i>diamond</i>. Or like those advertisements which say things like "Can create <i>up to</i> five million cups of coffee per day!" </p>
<p> In order to turn the flour into a cake, the window with the <code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>TRANSPARENT</wbr></wbr></code> window style needs to know not to draw opaquely. Because if it draws opaquely, then all the work the window manager did to get the other window to draw first (so you can draw on top of it) is for naught. </p>
<p> And sometimes the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/10/28/10230811.aspx"> <code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>TRANSPARENT</wbr></wbr></code> window style doesn't even work</a>. For example, observe that if the windows are not siblings of each other, then the style has no effect. If the windows belong to different processes, then the style has no effect. If both windows are not invalid simultaneously, then the style has no effect. (I don't know how you could get into that last state, but maybe you're more creative than I am.) </p>
<p> Go ahead and use the <code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>TRANSPARENT</wbr></wbr></code> window style if that's what you want. Just understand that it doesn't get you what the name might promise. (Depending on your situation, a layered window may work better.) </p>

		<p>If I remember correctly, this was used for things like the text labels, which are as transparent as anything got back then. &nbsp;The wording in the SDK (&quot;is to be transparent&quot;) is confusing until you realise it&#39;s an assertion from the developer, not a request (&quot;should be transparent&quot;). &nbsp;It&#39;s like the author had consumer-tinted spectacles on, something that comes and goes in the Win32 documentation.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
