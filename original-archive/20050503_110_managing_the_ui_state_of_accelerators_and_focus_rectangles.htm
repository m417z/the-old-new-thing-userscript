<!-- CONTENT START -->
<p>
Starting with Windows&nbsp;2000,
keyboard indicators such as underlined accelerators and
focus rectangles (collectively known as "keyboard cues")
are hidden by default, and are revealed only when you start
using the keyboard.
You can control this behavior from the Desktop Control Panel,
under Appearance, Effects, "Hide underlined letters for keyboard
navigation until I press the Alt key".
</p>
<p>
Note that this setting actually controls both underlined letters
and focus rectangles, even though the text describes only one
of the effects.  Underlines are hidden until you press the Alt key,
and focus rectangles are hidden until you either press the Alt key
or press the Tab key.
</p>
<p>
Here's how it works.
</p>
<p>
There are three UI state mesages:
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/userinput/keyboardaccelerators/keyboardacceleratorreference/keyboardacceleratormessages/wm_changeuistate.asp">
<code>WM_CHANGEUISTATE</code></a>,
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/userinput/keyboardaccelerators/keyboardacceleratorreference/keyboardacceleratormessages/wm_queryuistate.asp">
<code>WM_QUERYUISTATE</code></a>
and
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/userinput/keyboardaccelerators/keyboardacceleratorreference/keyboardacceleratormessages/wm_updateuistate.asp">
<code>WM_UPDATEUISTATE</code></a>.
The third one is, in my opinion, a misnomer.
It really should be called something like <code>WM_UISTATECHANGED</code>
since it is a notification that something has happened, not
a message that you send to cause something to happen.
</p>
<p>
When a dialog box or menu is displayed via a mouse click,
keyboard cues are hidden; if the dialog box or menu was displayed
via a keypress, then keyboard cues are visible.
This decision is made by sending a
<code>WM_CHANGEUISTATE</code> message to the root window with the
<code>UIS_INITIALIZE</code> flag.
This is done automatically by the dialog manager, but if you're
doing your own custom windows, you'll have to send it yourself.
</p>
<p>
The <code>WM_CHANGEUISTATE</code> message bubbles up to the
top-level window, which changes the window UI state accordingly,
then broadcasts a <code>WM_UPDATEUISTATE</code> message to all its child windows
to notify them that the state has changed.
(Of course, if the <code>WM_CHANGEUISTATE</code> message has no effect&mdash;for
example, hiding something that is already hidden&mdash;then the
<code>WM_UPDATEUISTATE</code> message is optimized out since the entire operation
is a no-op.)
</p>
<p>
When a window that draws keyboard cues
receives a <code>WM_UPDATEUISTATE</code> message, 
it typically invalidates itself so that the cues can be redrawn/erased,
depending on the new state.
</p>
<p>
At drawing time, a window that draws keyboard cues can use the
<code>WM_QUERYUISTATE</code> message to determine which keyboard cues are
visible and which are hidden, and draw its content accordingly.
If focus rectangles are hidden, then the window should skip the call
to the <code>DrawFocusRect</code> function.
If keyboard underlines are hidden, then the window suppresses
underlines in its text drawing.  If the window uses
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/gdi/fontext_0odw.asp">
the <code>DrawText</code> function</a>,
it can pass the <code>DT_HIDEPREFIX</code> flag
to suppress the underlines.
If you are responding to
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/comboboxes/comboboxreference/comboboxmessages/wm_drawitem.asp">
the <code>WM_DRAWITEM</code></a>
message, then you should check for the
<code>ODS_NOACCEL</code> and <code>ODS_NOFOCUSRECT</code> flags
to determine
whether
you should draw an underline accelerator or a focus rectangle.
</p>
<p>
Finally, during execution you may discover that the user has used
the keyboard to perform navigation within your control.
For example, the listview control may have noticed that the user has used
the arrow keys to change the selected item.
When this happens, the control sends itself a <code>WM_CHANGEUISTATE</code> specifying
which keyboard cues should be revealed.
As noted above, the <code>WM_CHANGEUISTATE</code> message eventually causes all the
windows in the window tree to receive a <code>WM_UPDATEUISTATE</code> message
if their states need to change.
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/dialogboxes/dialogboxreference/dialogboxfunctions/isdialogmessage.asp">
The <code>IsDialogMessage</code> function</a>
sends
<code>WM_CHANGEUISTATE</code> messages as appropriate, so dialog boxes
and anybody else who uses <code>IsDialogMessage</code> gets
keyboard-cues tracking for free.</p>

		<p>You should be respecting the user&#8217;s settings, not ignoring them. (If you still want to ignore them, then go ahead and ignore all these cue management messages.)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m testing out the ODS_NOACCEL flag with an owner-drawn menu, but I don&#8217;t seem to be getting the flag in all the right situations (meaning, it doesn&#8217;t match the behavior of a plain menu).<br />
<br />Test case: 0-Make a dialog that has a button that shows a popup menu. 1-set focus to the button with the mouse. 2-hit the spacebar. 3-cancel the menu. 4-click the button with the mouse.<br />
<br />For a plain menu, the mnemonics are shown in only case 2. For owner-drawn, the ODS_NOACCEL flag is sent in case 4 as well (and all subsequent times the menu is shown, in fact).</p>
<p>Also, if you uncheck the &quot;hide keyboard cues&quot; option, I would expect ODS_NOACCEL to never be sent. Instead, I have to also check SystemParametersInfo(SPI_GETKEYBOARDCUES) which seems like unnecessary work.</p>

<p>Er&#8230; the accelerators aren&#8217;t disabled. The UI hints for them are just not displayed. You can make them appear at any time by hitting ALT &#8211; and they all still work just the way they did before &#8211; the UI just looks cleaner.</p>

		<p>Hm&#8230; I never noticed they were gone.  I guess since I spend most my time in applications that ignore the settings I didn&#8217;t miss them.</p>
<p>Cleaner or not, this is one feature I think should default to on.  (To me, a feature is something you can turn off easily.)</p>

		<p>Slightly OT, but is there any specific reason why the ampersand was chosen to signify that the next character is the accelerator (or at least that it should be underlined)?  Although it&#8217;s not a common character it&#8217;s one that does get a reasonable amount of use, and it&#8217;s not uncommon to see underlined spaces in odd locations when something like &quot;Fish &amp; Chips&quot; crops up as a caption.</p>
<p>Why not pick something more obscure?  I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever used the &#172; character for anything, and yet it&#8217;s been on every keyboard I&#8217;ve ever owned!</p>

<p>Use &quot;and&quot; instead of &quot;&amp;&quot; is one of the written English &quot;Good Style Guide&quot; bulletpoints. The only time you should ever see something like &quot;Fish &amp; Chips&quot; on a dialog is in a title &#8211; and that isn&#8217;t something you put a mnemonic accelerator on. You can disable the prefix handling using a style on the static text control too, if you really need to.</p>
<p>Also, you can override it just by typing &quot;Fish &amp;&amp; Chips&quot;.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />

<p>It&#8217;s not on this one I&#8217;m using. Nor has it been on any others that I&#8217;ve ever owned since I left England. Although you might have a point if you suggested the use of the &quot;^&quot; character &#8211; although even then, you might well suggest the &quot;~&quot; character, and all of a sudden that became commonly used in web pages on unix systems.</p>

		<p>&quot;Use &quot;and&quot; instead of &quot;&amp;&quot; is one of the written English &quot;Good Style Guide&quot; bulletpoints. The only time you should ever see something like &quot;Fish &amp; Chips&quot; on a dialog is in a title&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>Unfortunately we have several departments here that have an ampersand in their internal code &#8212; P&amp;S, M&amp;E, H&amp;S, and O&amp;M to name four &#8212; and it causes a few oddities in some of our apps.  In stuff we&#8217;ve developed internally we&#8217;ve tended to filter them when using them as captions, but third party apps get all manner of confused&#8230;</p>
<p>(An example: Earlier today I printed a few hundred documents called &quot;P&amp;S xxx&quot;, and Word quite helpfully told me it was printing &quot;PS xxx&quot; with the S underlined.)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s situations like that, where an ampersand is more than likely going to show up sooner or later, that make me wonder why they picked such a common character.  (Alternatively, use &amp;&amp; to signify an accelerator, and treat a single ampersand as a single ampersand.)</p>
<p>Obviously it&#8217;s waaaay too late to change now, but it&#8217;s still strikes me as an odd decision.</p>

<li>&gt; underlined accelerators and focus<br />
<br />&gt; rectangles (collectively known as &quot;keyboard<br />
<br />&gt; cues&quot;) are hidden by default</p>
<p>Not in the defaults we get from Microsoft.</p>
<p>2. &gt; Note that this setting actually controls<br />
<br />&gt; both underlined letters and focus rectangles</p>
<p>Not that I could tell.  I changed the setting from the default to what you call the default, and the underlines disappeared from the shortcut letters in menu bars and menu entries.  However, focus rectangles continue to be displayed.</p>
<p>3.  I changed the setting back to the actual default.  Underlines reappeared in some but not all cases, which looks like a bug.  Existing windows got their underlines back under the shortcut letters in menu items but not in menu bars.  Newly created windows got their underlines in both menu items and menu bars.</li>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
