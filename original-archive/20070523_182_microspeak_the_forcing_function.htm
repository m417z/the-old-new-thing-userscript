		<p>As opposed to &quot;The impending Y2K threat forced many companies to upgrade their hardware.&quot;</p>
<p>Yeah, &quot;forcing function&quot; is much better.</p>

		<p>You have to remember you&#8217;re dealing with geeks here. Saying that y2k &#8220;forced&#8221; companies to upgrade their hardware would be inaccurate. And it would be inefficient to constantly say &#8220;a situation that tends to apply a strong force in a particular direction&#8221;.</p>
<p>Oddly, though, the very reference that Raymond gives as a counter-example defines &#8220;forcing function&#8221; in a way completely consistent with the MS usage:</p>
<p>&#8230;Forcing functions need not involve device design. For instance, one of the first forcing functions identified in health care is the removal of concentrated potassium from general hospital wards. This action is intended to prevent the inadvertent preparation of intravenous solutions with concentrated potassium, an error that has produced small but consistent numbers of deaths for many years.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>That quotation is another example of &#8220;forcing function&#8221; as &#8220;intentional obstacle to prevent accidental use&#8221;. The MS usage is &#8220;situation that forces a decision to be made&#8221;. I don&#8217;t see how they are the same. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>To Ray:</p>
<p>If &quot;force&quot; is inaccurate, then &quot;impetus&quot; is what you want (instead of the 13 word phrase).</p>
<p>I think the use of &quot;forcing function&quot; in the potassium case is weak.</p>

		<p>I suppose such malapropos technobabble is a forcing function intended to prevent accidental comprehension. Of course, the conventional phrase &quot;forced the issue&quot; needs some form of nounification to be compatible with an object oriented framework.</p>

		<p>On hearing this, I&#8217;ve decided that I&#8217;m going to start using a new phrase. The sliding function.</p>
<p>You guessed it, it that set of circumstances where you just have to let things slide&#8230;&#8230;</p>

		<p>I didn&#8217;t say it was the same thing, just that it was consistent.</p>
<p>I would say that the extension of the metaphor from &quot;intentional obstacle that indirectly forces a correct choice&quot; to &quot;unintentional obstacle that has the same indirect forcing effect as though it were intentional&quot; is a typical generalization that people, especially geeks, often make. This is a common event that causes language to change.</p>
<p>The y2k bug didn&#8217;t directly force (or even tend to cause) people to upgrade their hardware, it was the unknown cost of fixing the potential bug vs. upgrading in order to be able to use new software that was known not to have the bug that caused people to upgrade their hardware. </p>
<p>The user-interface usage of this term is itself almost certainly derived via geek-metaphor-extension from the meaning in diffy-q&#8217;s, and that derivation is *far* more of a stretch than this one.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s poor form to call someone by a name other than they call themselves. You may call me Lawrence or Larry, but I go by Ry.</p>
<p>Likewise, Raymond addresses himself as Raymond. Calling him Ray is impolite.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ll agree that it&#8217;s malapropos techobabble, but is there *anyone* reading this blog that didn&#8217;t understand *exactly* what the example sentence was trying to communicate? Please turn in your geek badge on your way out.</p>
<p>Getting on a geek&#8217;s case for using technobabble, especially when it&#8217;s obviously intended as at least slightly humorous, is about as useful as complaining that doctors say &#8220;idiopathic&#8221; when they mean &#8220;I have no idea what causes that&#8221;. It&#8217;s just in the nature of the beast.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Well, yeah, but that&#8217;s the point of a sample sentence: To make the meaning obvious from context. In real life, you have to deal with stuff like this bullet item from an actual document: &#8220;Forcing function for communication between disciplines.&#8221; -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>This usage makes me think of the concept of &quot;forcing thunks&quot; in languages that support delayed evaluation. A delayed computation sits around until its value is needed, at which point the thunk is &quot;forced&quot; and the computation is actually performed.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an interesting phrase, anyhow.</p>

		<p>For your amusement:</p>
<p>The &quot;forcing function&quot; in german is &quot;Treiber&quot;. &quot;Treiber&quot; is also used as translation for &quot;driver&quot;(software).</p>

		<p>While &quot;forcing function&quot; is certainly microspeak, I find that I like it as it&#8217;s clear to everyone in the organization what the meaning is.</p>
<p>Sure, sometimes I too would love my peers to have reasonable writing skills however I&#8217;ll settle for clear message with lingo than incomprehensible message well written.</p>
<p>That said, this trait might be unique to this expression.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
