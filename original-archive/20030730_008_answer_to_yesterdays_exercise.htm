<p>
        <i>iMin</i> is the lowest-index element which intersects the paint rectangle, so a
        simple truncating division produces the desired index. 
    </p>
<p>
        The formula for <i>iMax</i> can be interpreted two ways. One is that it is the roundup
        of the first invisible line. Recall the rectangles are exclusive of the endpoint,
        so <i>rcPaint.bottom</i> is actually the first row <i>outside</i> the rectangle. Since
        we want the first element that is completely outside the rectangle, we must round
        up. 
    </p>
<p>
        A second interpretation begins with the seemingly equivalent formula. First, the expression 
    </p>
<pre>    (pps-&gt;rcPaint.bottom - 1) / g_cyLine
</pre>
<p>
        computes the index of the last visible item. By adding unity, we get the index of
        the first invisible item. 
    </p>
<p>
        In both cases, we do not allow the computed value to exceed <i>g_cItems</i> so we
        don't try to draw items that don't exist. 
    </p>
<p>
        The answer to the next question is that the seemingly equivalent formula does not
        work correctly when <i>rcPaint.bottom</i> is zero or negative because the result of
        integer division is rounded towards zero, which would result in an erroneous computation
        that the value of <i>iMax</i> should be one instead of zero. If integer divisions
        were rounded towards negative infinity, then the formula would be correct. 
    </p>
<p>
        And the answer to the final question is that the only harm is that we sometimes draw
        one item that we really didn't need to. In our example, this is not that big a deal
        since drawing an item is relatively fast. But in cases where drawing an item is expensive,
        avoiding the drawing of even a single item may prove significant. 
    </p>
<p>
        And we'll see in Part 4 that playing with the origin can cause the paint rectangle
        to end up in odd positions.

		<p>&quot;Recall the rectangles are exclusive of the endpoint, so rcPaint.bottom is actually the first row outside the rectangle.&quot;</p>
<p>MSDN Libraries for both October 2001 and October 2003 have the following characteristics.</p>
<p>For GetClientRect(), the description contradicts itself.  The first paragraph falsely says that the lower-right corner is involved.  A later paragraph correctly says that the width and height are involved.</p>
<p>For GetWindowRect(), the description is false only.  The first paragraph doesn&#8217;t say, but a later paragraph says that the lower-right corner is involved.</p>
<p>The fact is exactly as you say, a point which is adjacent but outside of the lower-right corner is involved.</p>
<p>For one customer, I had to position a bunch of scrollbars and their related frames.  Every time I resized the main window, every scroll bar grew in width.  I fixed it by deliberately coding some off-by-one errors.  Then I remembered your series on scrollbars, and here is your information, you got it right and the MSDN library got it wrong.</p>
<p>Sometimes you hinted that you have contacts at MSDN.  Please see if you can persuade them to fix the descriptions of GetClientRect() and GetWindowRect().</p>

		<p>Done. I also asked for a special remark in the documentation for RECT to indicate that &quot;By convention, the bottom right coordinates of rectangles are normally exclusive. In other words, the pixel whose coordinates are (right, bottom) lies immediately outside the rectangle.&quot;  Hopefully this blanket statement will cover all the other functions that operate on rectangles.</p>

		<p>Thank you for making that request, but may I also ask you to make the English a bit clearer?  Even though I handle English much better than I handle Japanese, I would still get tripped up on &quot;normally exclusive&quot;.  Backing up and reparsing the sentence yields a more meaningful result, &quot;are normally&quot;, but the word &quot;exclusive&quot; isn&#8217;t quite clear.  The second sentence does clear up the confusion, but still there&#8217;s no need for the first sentence to create confusion.</p>
<p>Maybe &quot;By convention, the bottom right coordinates of rectangles are usually the height and width instead of the actual bottom and right.&quot;  The second sentence still helps explain it fully.</p>

		<p>Except that&#8217;s still not correct. If top/left is not (0,0) then bottom and right are not the height and width. I have a blog entry scheduled for February 17th to explain rectangles better &#8211; I hope you can hold out until then.</p>

		<p>You&#8217;re right, my wording isn&#8217;t correct for GetWindowRect().</p>
<p>For GetClientRect() I think my wording is correct and understandable.  If you agree with that, then we can fix the wording for GetWindowRect() next.  Anyway, I think it is possible to be both correct and non-obfuscatory.</p>
<p>Yes I&#8217;ll wait until February 17th.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
