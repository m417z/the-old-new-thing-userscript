Some time ago,
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/04/21/10608779.aspx">
I discussed the fates of the various cat projects that led to Windows 95</a>,
which was in turn a follow-up to
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/05/20/10526823.aspx">
a list of cat-related code names from projects that led to Windows 95</a>.
</p>
<p>
In summary: There were a bunch of projects with cat-related code names.
Only one of the projects survived to Windows 95 in its originally-envisioned
form.
Two of the projects
were morphed into other projects that became part of Windows 95.
One (Panther) was cancelled outright.
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/04/21/10608779.aspx#10608939">
More than</a>
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/04/21/10608779.aspx#10608986">
one person</a>
asked
whether the canceled Panther project is why Windows Setup logs
are in a directory called "Panther".
</p>
<p>
I doubt it.
</p>
<p>
After all, the Panther project was cancelled early in the exploratory
phase of the product that eventually became Windows 95.
No public builds were ever released that contained Panther.
</p>
<p>
You launched Panther by launching Windows 3.1,
then going to Program Manager,
and double-clicking the icon of a Hallowe'en pumpkin.
</p>
<p>
I don't know why the Panther icon was a Hallowe'en pumpkin.
Maybe the project started on Hallowe'en?
</p>
<p>
On the other hand,
the Panther subdirectory that people are asking about
was introduced in Windows Vista,
and it is highly unlikely that Windows Vista cared about
a long-dead experimental project from over 15 years ago.
Windows Vista didn't support upgrading from anything older than Windows 2000;
it certainly didn't care about upgrading from
an experimental operating system from the early 1990s
that never even made it as far as a beta.
</p>
<p>
From looking at the source code history,
it appears that Panther was the code name for what is
now known as Windows Deployment Services.
</p>
<p>
Another case of code name reuse.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been doing that since the start of the blog. It&#8217;s just that the switch from dotText to Teligent made the one-sentence summaries harder to find, but they were still there. (You had to switch to excerpt mode.) The migration from Teligent to WordPress failed to migrate the excerpts, but they are showing up for new posts. I&#8217;ll take it up with the blog admin team.</p>

		<p>&gt;Iâ€™ve been doing that since the start of the blog.<br />
Oh wow I never knew that, I too though it was interesting to see all these one-line summarization haha!</p>
<p>Also Off-topic, any hope of bringing back your old color scheme? I loved it, it was so warm!</p>

		<p>Was Panther abandoned because it was impossible or was it abandoned because doing it properly would take much more work than just writing a new kernel?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been doing quite a bit of unattended install mucking about for setting up a lab of dozens of VMs and was just wondering this exact question. How topical.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
