		<p>Larry Osterman already discussed why the backslash character is the path separator.<br />

		<p>This still doesn&#8217;t really explain why the Yen and Won would end up at 0x5c.  It&#8217;s really what I expected, because it&#8217;s the answer to most of these questions in computing:</p>
<p>Legacy.</p>

		<p>Matthew &#8212; these are National standards in Japan and Korea, and they are still used. When we assign code points in Unicode, we usually do not call that &quot;legacy&quot; so we should probably not do that for JIS or KSC. :-)</p>

		<p>Surely this makes coversion between character sets far harder? How does windows know weather the YEN or WON symbol it encounters is supposed to be a path seperator and converted to 0x5C or an actual currency symbol?<br />
<br />(Supposing we&#8217;re converting from unicode to Latin-1 or something&#8230;)</p>

		<p>This quirk is more annoying than you may think. In the default MS IME (that comes with Windows XP), if you type in the yen sign, it allows you to henkan it to either U+005C (backslash) or U+FFE5 (fullwidth yen). U+00A5 (the &quot;correct&quot; halfwidth yen) is nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>This is no problem when using non-Unicode applications in a Japanese locale (since for them backslash *is* the halfwidth yen), but when you try to enter the correct yen sign to a Unicode application from the keyboard, you only get backslashes. Of course you can get the correct character from Character Map but it&#8217;s a pain&#8230;</p>
<p>(I suppose there is no way to make the MS IME know whether it&#8217;s sending characters to a Unicode or a non-Unicode application and decide whether to send a U+00A5 or a U+005C based on that?)</p>

		<p>It gets weirder.  When is a backslash not a backslash?  When you&#8217;re reading a different part than you&#8217;re going to read a minute later, in the exact same page that was cited in Michael Kaplan&#8217;s blog.</p>
<p>Why does Internet Explorer display one as not a backslash and display another as a backslash in the exact same page?  Conspiracy minded cynics might guess that Internet Explorer read Mr. Kaplan&#8217;s wording calling it a backslash and intentionally rendered that one as not a backslash.  Ordinary cynics think Internet Explorer isn&#8217;t smart enough to do that, and give up at this point.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
