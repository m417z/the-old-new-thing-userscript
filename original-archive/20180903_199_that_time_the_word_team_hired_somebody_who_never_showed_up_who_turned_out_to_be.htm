<p>
During an exchange of stories from the earlier days of Microsoft,
I learned about the time the Word team hired somebody who never showed up.
</p>
<p>
It was the late 1980s or maybe early 1990s.
The
<a HREF="http://www.computerhistory.org/atchm/microsoft-word-for-windows-1-1a-source-code/">
Winword</a>
team (as it was then known)
hired a new employee, let's call him
<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Smithee">
Alan Smithee</a>.
The team prepared an office for him,
complete with nameplate,
but for whatever reason,
Alan backed out and decided not to join Microsoft after all.
</p>
<p>
This vital information never reached the Winword team.
</p>
<p>
So the Winword team had an office ready for a new team member,
but no team member.
</p>
<p>
Eventually, somebody else moved into the office
(who actually showed up for the job, thank you very much).
But what about the nameplate?
</p>
<p>
An unidentified prankster removed the nameplate from
an existing team member's door
and replaced it with Alan's,
making it look like Alan had taken over the office.
Some time later, the prankster returned the team member's nameplate
to its rightful place, but put Alan's nameplate beneath it,
so it looked like the team member had an invisible roommate.
</p>
<p>
The mysterious Alan Smithee became a running joke on the team.
He got blamed for everything.
</p>
<p>
Your water bottle is missing?
Alan stole it.
</p>
<p>
The coffee maker isn't working?
Alan broke it.
</p>
<p>
The power went out during the overnight build?
Alan overloaded the circuit.
Probably when he plugged in the coffee maker.
And then spilled your water on it.
</p>
<p>
Alan was such an integral part of the team
that they even included him in the credits.
One of the team members still has Alan's nameplate as a memento.
</p>
<p>
The story doesn't end there, however.
</p>
<p>
Alan apparently remained on good enough terms with Microsoft
that he was able to apply for and get a job at Microsoft several
years later.
That he showed up for.
</p>
<p>
This was discovered when
one of the former members of the Winword team
walked into a meeting and met a guy named Alan Smithee.
That team member had to work pretty hard through the entire meeting
to avoid laughing out loud,
seeing as poor Alan was the unwitting butt of so many jokes.
</p>
<p>
It is not known whether the former team member had a chance
to tell Alan about his important role in the early history of
Word,
or to find out why he didn't show up for work all those years ago.</p>

		<p>I thought the name was familiar &#8211; according to Wikipedia, Alan Smithee is the &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to be associated with this rubbish&#8217; name from films, where the writer was so disgusted with what was produced (Either because they did a bad job, or it was hacked around by the studio) that they want to disown the project.  This is taken from Wikipedia, so take it with a pinch of salt, but IMDB backs this up with lots of films with a writing credit to the poor guy.</p>

		<p>The Excel team had a similar story, except it was the name of an intern who had shown up and finished his internship.  But whenever the Excel team did something a bit questionable (what, a Super-Soaker battle in the atrium with valuable artwork on the walls is a bad idea?) and someone in authority asked &#8220;what&#8217;s your name?&#8221; the answer was instantly the name of that intern.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of the leak on a bottle loaded on distilled water dispenser took out the power of the whole floor.</p>
<p>The first time the power went out, we tried to switch it on again but failed. So we switch off all the sub-switch of circuit breaker and switch them on one by one to find out what caused it.</p>
<p>We found that the circuit breaks when we switch on the power for pantry. And then someone noticed a paddle of water near the dispenser. Since the circuit breaker switch has turned off already, we cleaned it, and 15 minutes later it popped again.</p>
<p>This time we found there was a leak on the bottle. We removed it, cleaned the floor, and power back on. Problem solved.</p>

		<p>For some reason, that reminds me of the &#8220;Apple Graphing Calculator Story&#8221; (<a href="https://www.pacifict.com/Story/" rel="nofollow">https://www.pacifict.com/Story/</a>).  Some guy working on the graphing calculator got laid off, but just kept showing up until his project was finished.  It&#8217;s this story, but flipped backwards</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
