<p> I dreamed that through a friend, I got to join a handful of other people atop Prince Charles's carriage as it wound its way through London. There was no seating up there, so you just have to hang on for dear life. When we reached Buckingham Palace, the assembled crowd and reporters swarmed the carriage for an opportunity to meet the Prince. This provided a sufficient diversion to allow us to climb down from the roof and sneak into the palace undetected. </p>
<p> We've come to the end of the year, so that's all for Monday dream blogging. For those of you who hated it: You can uncover your eyes now. </p>

		<p>@Raymond Unrelated questions:</p>
<p>1. Will you be at //Build 2014? If so can I find you and get you to sign a copy of your Book?</p>
<p>2. What is your favorite season of the Simpsons? Favorite Episode?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>I don&#39;t know whether I will be at //build 2014, but assume I won&#39;t. (I don&#39;t expect to be selected to attend.) I stopped watching The Simpsons so long ago I don&#39;t even remember what episodes I liked most. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@Raymond</p>
<p>You may have answered this in the past, but how do you remember your dreams with such clarity? Do you have a very regular sleep pattern? Do you plan to catalogue your dreams in this way, keep pen and paper near the bed (or surface pro 2 ;-) )? Have you always remembered dreams or did you make a conscious decision to learn a technique? Any tips for someone who can never remember a dream? Sorry for all the questions, feel free to ignore any and all!</p>
<div class="post">[<em>As soon as you realize that you are awake, start recapping the dream in your head as fast as you can. If you get stuck on a scene, just skip it and go on to the next scene. Dreams fade from memory within seconds, so you need to grab as much information while it&#39;s still there. I didn&#39;t study any particular technique. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Thanks for the response Raymond I&#39;ll still bring along my book on the oft chance you are selected! You are a bit of a personal hero, and I enjoy your blog.</p>
<p>I asked because as I was looking at an older episode capsule I was surprised to see &nbsp;&quot;Raymond Chen&quot; credited, and wondered if it was the same Raymond!</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
