<p><a href="http://stark-effect.com/"> David Dixon</a>, assistant professor of physics at Saddleback College, gave a presentation while he was at California Polytechnic State University titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HXSgp755DSA"> <i>Tales from "The Box"</i></a>, in which he presents selected contents of <i>The Box</i>, an archive of what is charitably describe as "unsolicited materials", but which is in more plain language "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/05/29/610090.aspx">stuff sent to us by crackpots</a>." (Warning: Sound quality is terrible.) He describes the various types of crackpots, common themes, behaviors that set off red flags in professional scientists, and how crackpot theories can be used in instruction.</p>
<p> In the talk, he excerpts <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/293/A-Little-Bit-of-Knowledge"> <i>A Little Bit of Knowledge</i></a>, an episode of <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/"> <i>This American Life</i></a>. He also wonders why crackpots are frequently retired engineers. </p>
<p> (For some reason, the video is doubled, so ignore the second half, unless you like watching it a second time, but with the sound off.) </p>
<p> Things I learned: </p>
<ul>
<li>A subgenre of physics crackpottery is     <i>deriving physical constants from other physical constants     in dubious ways</i>. (Time code 29:00.) </li>
<li>You need read only the first few pages of any manuscript.     That's where the theory is laid out and where you can find the     error, assuming     <a href="http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Not_even_wrong">     the manuscript is comprehensible to begin with</a>.     (The rest of the manuscript is just a series of examples of how     the theory can be applied to everything under the sun.)     One example given was a manuscript that showed that the     generally-accepted formula for centripetal acceleration is     incorrect by a factor of     <i>2/<font face="Times New Roman, serif">&pi;</font></i>.     (Time code 37:00.)     You would think that an error of this magnitude     could be confirmed <i>by experiment</i>,     but that never occurs to them. </li>
<li>There are crackpot conferences.     (Time code 44:00.)     Crackpots tend not to criticize each other's work.     And there is a pecking order of crackpot specialties. </li>
</ul>
<p> During the Q&amp;A, a person from the audience remarked that he worked for a government agency which was required to respond to all communications, even the ones from crackpots. That must really suck. </p>

		<p>Apparently engineers are somewhat over-represented not just in &quot;the box&quot;, but also among conspiracy theorists, religious nutjobs, and even terrorists.</p>
<p>Has anybody put forth a theory as to why engineers are so likely to be cranks?</p>

		<p>Gabe, my theory is that engineers tend to see themselves as smarter than most other folks. I think this then leads to (a) giving way to much credit to one&#39;s own musings and (b) the suspicion that if the hoi polloi thinks a thing, it&#39;s very likely wrong.</p>

		<p>@Daniel: Not to mention they always work with systems that were designed. So naturally, some of them start to assume everything was rationally designed&#8230; and they are not told much of the physics anyway, but since they get the job done with it, some of them, again, start to assume that that&#39;s the actual contents of the physics, and all the extra stuff is just to be pretentious.</p>
<p>Something like this, I suppose.</p>

		<p>As long as we&#39;re using Fox News style anecdotal hearsay, I&#39;ve heard talk that more cranks falsely claim to be Engineers/Doctors/Lone Geniuses/etc than the average number of non-cranks. I hypothesize that it is because they think doing so will bolster their first impressions and claims. I&#39;ve also heard a lot of people generically slag others with university degrees. I hypothesise that in many cases it&#39;s simply because&#8230; uhh&#8230; they entered a competitive job market without one and had some hunter-gatherer competitive thing going on in their head over it. I intend to invent a machine that will prove these hypotheses AND THEN I WILL SHOW YOU ALL!!!!</p>

		<p>@Daniel @Gabe</p>
<p>I think it is related to the old adage that there is a fine line between genius and madness. Many engineers (and scientists for that matter) are highly creative, and a little bit mad. If we take the example of Tesla, he seemed to be truly brilliant and also a crank. Michael Shermer has a very good talk on this topic (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.ted.com/talks/michael_shermer_the_pattern_behind_self_deception.html">http://www.ted.com/&#8230;/michael_shermer_the_pattern_behind_self_deception.html</a>), and relates it to the wonder brain drug dopamine. Dopamine is what makes as creative, but too much and your crazy. There is no hard line here though, so a lot of creative intelligent people are also a little bit crazy. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Yeah, um, have fun in your closed little worlds. &nbsp;The crackpots are more fun to hang out with. &nbsp;Long live the stupid! &nbsp;Down with disease!</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
