<p>
A customer reported that sometimes the
<code>Get&shy;GUI&shy;Thread&shy;Info</code>
function returned a valid window handle,
but sometimes it returned all <code>NULL</code>s.
</p>
<pre>
  DWORD dwThreadId = GetWindowThreadProcessId(hwnd, NULL);
  GUITHREADINFO guiThreadInfo;
  guiThreadInfo.cbSize = sizeof(GUITHREADINFO);
  if (GetGUIThreadInfo(dwThreadId, &amp;guiThreadInfo)) {
   HWND hwndActive = guiThreadInfo.hwndActive;
   ...
  }
</pre>
<p>
Most of the time, the call to
<code>Get&shy;GUI&shy;Thread&shy;Info</code>
succeeds and obtains
<code>hwndActive</code> successfully.
But sometimes,
<code>Get&shy;GUI&shy;Thread&shy;Info</code>
succeeds,
but
<code>guiThreadInfo.<wbr>hwndActive</code> is <code>NULL</code>.
In fact,
aside from the <code>cbSize</code>,
all the
members of the
<code>guiThreadInfo</code> are <code>NULL</code> or zero.
"Under what circumstances will
<code>Get&shy;GUI&shy;Thread&shy;Info</code>
succeed but return no data?"
</p>
<p>
I suggested that they start with the obvious:
Is it possible that the function is correct
and the thread has no active window?
</p>
<p>
The customer confessed that they were too quick to
assume that there was a problem with the
<code>Get&shy;GUI&shy;Thread&shy;Info</code> function
just because it reported no data.
It turns out that, in fact,
there was no data to report.
</p>
<p>
The root cause was that another thread in their
program called
<code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Pos</code> and didn't
pass the
<code>SWP_<wbr>NO&shy;ACTIVATE</code> flag.
As a result, that thread stole activation from
the first thread,
so when they got around to asking the first thread,
"Tell me about your active window, your focus window,
your caret window, and your caret location,"
it replied,
"I don't have any of those things!"</p>

		<p>Is this similar to when my wife gets home and asks me how many chores I have completed on a particular Saturday? &nbsp;At times, my response is &quot;Absolutely nuttin&#39;.&quot; &nbsp;I consider that to be a perfectly valid answer while she clearly does not.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll send her a link to this article and see if that helps.</p>

		<p>@12BitSlab: I fell into that trap while chatting with my dentist, he asked me what I was going to do for the rest of the day and I said &quot;nothing&quot;, meaning &quot;catch up on tech support mail, run backups and rotate media, check access logs, clean out temp files, update software packages, and in my copious extra time, do the end-of-months taxes&quot;, i.e. nothing useful or interesting. &nbsp;I then compounded the sin by replying &quot;yes&quot; when he asked &quot;absolutely nothing?&quot;. </p>

		<p>@Mark: That particular example you linked is very peculiar one because I never managed to get it fully working either, abd I can easily live with NULL handles, even NULL as a placeholder that means &quot;that one you asked for just before&quot; and being returned for all monitors (in my case).</p>

<p>You&#39;re assuming the search is returning valid information. Maybe people have left out their names for anonymity, or the search has an error. :-)</p>

		<p>It gets funny, though, when NULL &#8211; or any value &#8211; is both a valid answer and an indicator that an error occurred. I once had this problem with GetWindowText, which returns 0 both for windows with no text and to report errors. In the error case, you can ask GetLastError for more information, but not in the &quot;no text&quot; case. Now, how do you know which case you got? <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13026945/how-do-i-differentiate-between-an-empty-window-text-and-an-error-with-the-getwin">stackoverflow.com/&#8230;/how-do-i-differentiate-between-an-empty-window-text-and-an-error-with-the-getwin</a></p>

		<p>@Fabian, GetAncestor has the same problem: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms633502(v=vs.85).aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/ms633502(v=vs.85).aspx</a></p>
<p>It is not even documented that it can fail at all, but obviously it fails if you supply an invalid handle, or information in blocked due to UIPI. The rules for the latter has been changed several times by windows update patches, without any documentation whatsoever.</p>
<p>GetWindowThreadProcessId has the same problem with lack of documentation that it can even fail at all: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms633522(v=vs.85).aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/ms633522(v=vs.85).aspx</a></p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
