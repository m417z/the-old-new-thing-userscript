There's this software services
company that retweets content from various
technology sites,
and they end every one with "Want to learn more?
Call us at...".
What, so they know more about the subject matter than the
person whose content they are retweeting?
Why would I call them to learn more about myself?

Note that a casual glance at the format of the given phone number
may make you think it's a
United States/Canadian number, but it's not,
so readers in the United States should be careful:
It likely won't be covered by your "free national long distance" plan.

Maybe I should record a One Dev Minute video
about a problem that stumped me,
and then I can send them an email and ask for
the solution!</p>

		<p>Maybe the queue is down to ten weeks now. Or maybe not. What we know for sure is that the retweet is of a video posted on June 20th. But the tweet itself could be more recent. And Raymond is known to insert posts in the queue sometimes. Maybe Raymond found about this recently, thought it was amusing, and decided to talk about it when it was still hot.</p>

		<p>On May 29, Raymond answered a question I asked on February 15. That&#8217;s a 14ish-week queue, if one assumes that a question about Win16 raster operation codes isn&#8217;t interesting enough to jump the queue for.</p>

		<p>So now we are gathering enough information to make a graph about Raymond&#8217;s posts queue, similar to the one somebody made about Windows 95 release date estimations. And, applying the same heuristics, maybe we can predict when Raymond will re-open the suggestion box!</p>

		<p>Too bad you masked the area code. If it was a US area code and they forwarded the number to a toll number, I&#8217;d be asking the phone company if they want to try that fraudulent charge before a jury or not.</p>
<p>The phone company is perfectly capable of not paying a disputed charge to a foreign phone company.</p>

		<p>Joshua, it&#8217;s (un)surprisingly easy to find the original tweet in question. The area code is for Trinidad and Tobago.</p>

		<p>Btw, skimmed through some length of their tweet, and found the video channels they selected almost (at least apparently) always talking about technologies and not specific about certain people. So this &#8220;One Dev Question&#8221; chapter caught them off-guard.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
