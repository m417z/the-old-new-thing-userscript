<p> Even when they were separate projects, the first three teams worked closely together, so the names followed a pattern of ferocious cats. My guess is that when the user interface team chose their code name, they heard that the other guys were naming themselves after cats, so they picked a cat, too. </p>
<p> I don't know whether they did that on purpose or by accident, but the cat they picked was not ferocious at all. Instead, they picked <a href="http://nicktoons.nick.com/shows/the-ren-and-stimpy-show/"> a cartoon cat</a>. </p>

		<p>so does this mean Mac OSX 10.2 was the 16 bit DOS kernel and 10.3 was the win32 kernel? I don&#39;t think they got to Stimpy before giving up on cat names</p>

		<p>There may not be any relation between the various projects codenamed Stimpy, but one can infer that there are/were a number of R&amp;S fans at Microsoft, just due to the number of references that have come to light recently.</p>
<p>Raymond, thanks for another wonderful post. &nbsp;I love these behind-the-scenes looks at the history of Windows.</p>

		<p>So the &quot;32-bit DOS kernel&quot; was the layer where all the VxDs ran and was equivalent to Win386 in Win3.x? And the &quot;Win32 kernel&quot; referred to Kernel32, VWIN32, etc&#8230;</p>

		<p>@smf: I&#39;m inclined to think not.</p>
<p>&quot;If, for example, option A were using a CreateThread() call, then option B would be alternative code, which would handle the task using a single- thread solution.&quot;</p>
<p>No, it&#39;s not proof but it sure suggests it. I&#39;m vaguely disappointed CreateThread() wasn&#39;t there but it must not have been a problem in the tiny amount of Win32s programming I did.</p>

		<p>@SomeGuyOnTheInternet: Semicolon has never indicated a comment in a batch file, so far as I am aware. </p>
<p>The &quot;Command Shell Overview&quot; page at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490954.aspx">technet.microsoft.com/&#8230;/bb490954.aspx</a> says that ; and , are used for separating command parameters. This appears to work only with shell built-ins like &#39;copy&#39; rather than as parameters to a program such as xcopy.exe. I recall Raymond mentioning the copy-with-two-commas to touch a file a while back: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/07/10/10432879.aspx">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/10432879.aspx</a></p>

		<p>Well, that solves some mysteries. The Comes vs Microsoft docs basically let me and others guess at what was jaguar/cougar/panther, however I didn&#39;t know that cabinet/cab32 (and probably more too, as UI is more than just shell I&#39;m guessing) was codenamed &quot;Stimpy&quot;.</p>
<p>Now, if only pre-PDK1 chicago was widely available on the internet.. but of course hell would have to freeze over before that happens. At least we have that video from the b8 blog.</p>

		<p>NTAuthority, that&#39;d be 58s (PDK1) and 73g (PDK2).. And it was a leftover startup bitmap from earlier in development when it used the *logo.rle. It&#39;s shown in that video from &quot;George Wolfowitz&quot; on youtube, but it is not known if the build depicted in said video is real or fake: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rbVRWziUHdY">http://www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>

		<p>By the way, Raymond, I once heard that before suwin, chicago used Jastro (the DOS/Windows combined setup). Was this true?</p>
<p>And, on that note, was &quot;Janus&quot; the codename for Windows 3.1? It&#39;s listed as such all over the internet, but I haven&#39;t seen any proof relating to such.</p>

		<p>Speaking of classic versions of Windows, why doesn&#39;t Windows 7 have the classic Start menu that was included in versions Windows 95 up to Windows Vista?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
