		<p>Pretty sad. The fear of lawsuits and a bunch of consumer protection laws has lead to so many disclaimers being posted that most of us tend to ignore them.</p>

		<p>So, no sign would be better? (No sign would be even easier to ignore!)</p>
<p>Somewhat amusing but not broken. People who smoke should be aware of the &quot;costs&quot; and smoke by choice (ignoring the addiction stuff).</p>
<p>Washing your hands reduces the risk.</p>

		<p>Even more trivia: Lead also causes brain damage, and has been blamed for the fall of the Roman Empire, where they used it in the plumbing pipes. This is why the Latin name for lead is plumbum, and the chemical symbol is Pb.</p>

		<p>The Romans used lead in makeup, wine, and as food seasoning. I somehow find it hard to believe that smoking after clipping little lead weights onto wheels will measurably impact one&#8217;s health.</p>

		<p>Actually, smoking does make a huge difference in terms of toxicity. This isn&#8217;t about lawsuits, it&#8217;s about public health; it&#8217;s like the &quot;employees must wash hands before handling food&quot; placards in restaurant restrooms&#8230;</p>
<p>If the employer utilizes a carcinogen, they&#8217;re obligated to spell out the risks to their employees.</p>

		<p>I think the humor here is that you should wash your hands before <em>smoking</em> because this will reduce your exposure to carcinogens. &nbsp;The health impact of smoking however&#8230;</p>

		<p>Aren&#8217;t there cases where smoking can dramatically increase (that is, it&#8217;s not just linear) the effects of other toxins?</p>

		<p>The point is, is someone&#8217;s health is harmed by lead ingestion/compond inhalation, the company is to be blame.</p>
<p>While if someone&#8217;s health is damaged by smoking, the company won&#8217;t be responsible for that.</p>
<p>The notice is for the company&#8217;s sake, not for the people actually&#8230; :P</p>

		<p>To ArC: There&#8217;ll be some problem if your hand touch the lead then touch the part of cigarette that you put in your mouth.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also come up with the thought that lead filings(small particles fall of because of friction that are light enough to float in air) in the air will burn with the cigarette and produce organic lead compounds, but then the lead filing inhalation itself seems to be more harmful, so I found it hard to convince me as the reason.</p>

		<p>While I understand the humor of this warning it does serve a purpose. &nbsp;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if people working in garages tend to enjoy the occasional cigarette, and it might not have occurred to them that smoking right after handling bits of lead might be more dangerous than just smoking. &nbsp;Everybody knows that smoking is bad for you, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that someone who choses to smoke also has to be exposed unnecessarily to additional dangers. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t see what&#8217;s wrong with informing people when they are doing something that increases their risk, even if the thing they are doing is already risky to begin with.<br /></p>

		<p>Let&#8217;s go for three carcinogens! Use your lead covered hands to smoke your Kent Micronite asbestos filtered cigarettes. Now THAT&#8217;S how to get some cancer baby!

		<p>Gene: &quot;&#8230;the Roman Empire, where they used it in the plumbing pipes. This is why the Latin name for lead is plumbum&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>Other way round, surely? The English word &quot;plumbing&quot; is from the Latin for lead.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
