<p>Some friends gave me a bottle of spearmint <a href="http://www.metromint.com/">Metromint</a> as a gift. And as it turns out, it was a mean-spirited gift.</p>
<p> Let's look at that bottle. It calls itself "pure, simple mintwater&reg;". What the heck is pure mintwater? Do you go to the local mintwater stream and collect it? Oh, wait, sorry. That should be mintwater&reg;. </p>
<p> With some trepidation, I took a sip. Yuck-o. It's like drinking chewing gum. Why would anybody want this? </p>
<p> But wait, there's more. On the side of the bottle, there's a picture of a thermometer, and the mercury reads &minus;6&deg;, or "extra cool." Whatever that means. The bottle never explains. </p>
<p> On their <a href="http://www.metromint.com/products/benefits.html">benefits</a> page, if you click through to "rehydrate", it says that "the good stuff in <b>Metromint</b> gets where it's going quicker, and goes to work faster." Huh? What's the scientific basis for this claim? Quicker than what? And the biggest mystery of them all: What part of Metromint is the "good stuff"? I haven't found it yet. </p>
<p> Whatever. My point is that this stuff is awful. And  <a href="http://lanceandeskimo.com/chefelf/bev_metromint.shtml"> I'm not the only person who thinks so</a>. </p>

		<p>I&#8217;m sure the marketdroids would say the &quot;good stuff&quot; part is the part where they make money off of (to quote Six-String) &quot;nasty-&#8230; toilet water&quot;.</p>

		<p>Maybe with the additives, it freezes at -6&#176; C? It&#8217;s half a kilogram of water, so that would be 1.6 moles of &quot;good stuff&quot; dissolved in the water. Which is quite a bit &#8211; call it at minimum 50 grams; 10% by weight.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve actually had the displeasure of buying this and drinking it. &nbsp;You&#8217;ve been to kind on it, calling it drinking gum isn&#8217;t strong enough.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d equate it to drinking a mint mouthwash, it darn near burns. &nbsp;Or like drinking liquid Altoids(tm).</p>
<p>Either way, perhaps they&#8217;ve never heard the phrase &quot;hint o mint&quot;. &nbsp;The amount of mint they put in 1 bottle would be enough to do 100 bottles.</p>

		<p>Based on my reading, Metromint doesn&#8217;t contain anything special to rehydrate you. It just implies that since it tastes so good, you&#8217;ll drink more, and thus rehydrate faster. The &quot;good stuff&quot; appears to just be water.</p>

		<p>Hey, maybe the &quot;âˆ’6&#176;&quot; is analogous to wind-chill factor: The mintwater&#174; tastes six degrees cooler than regular water at the same actual temperature.</p>
<p>(Six degrees on what scale, though? Kevin Bacon?)</p>

		<p>Advertisers long ago realized that people like to hear multi-valued predicates with most of the values missing. People just subconsciously fill them in.</p>
<p>My personal favourite is &quot;Diet Dr. Pepper tastes more like regular Dr. Pepper&quot;. &nbsp;&quot;takes more like&quot; is a four valued predicate, but there are only two values! It should be &quot;Diet Dr. Pepper tastes more like regular Dr. Pepper than milk tastes like gasoline&quot;, or whatever. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Without the additional values the predicate becomes untestable and therefore not really a claim.</p>

		<p>If you watch most television ads (especially beauty/hygiene/health-related products) with the same critical eye it seems they all make these weird empty claims. &quot;x% better&quot;, &quot;x% more&quot; better than what, more than what?</p>

		<p>My favourite remains the good old orphan asterisk.</p>
<p>You know &#8211; the package has something like &quot;Lower Glycemic Index!*&quot; on it. But, search as you might, you will never find anywhere on, in or under the package the second asterisk. So the question of what this particular product&#8217;s glycemic index is lower than will, forever, remain unanswered.</p>

		<p>Ever been to Per&#250;? Has anybody drunk Inka-Cola? It tastes like bubble gum (not mint, mind you) and is bright yellow; by bright yellow I mean non-natural-yellow, more like corn than like lemonade.</p>

		<p>And I had some friends complaining when I presented them Aloe Vera juice. Obviously they never saw a real Aloe Vera plant and only knew the smell from hygienic products, which is why they didn&#8217;t like it. So long&#8230;</p>

		<p>I saw this in our fridge the other day and couldn&#8217;t help but take a sip. &nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;Bah! &nbsp;What is this [expletive deleted]!?&quot; &nbsp;I asked my wife.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, that&#8217;s the stuff I use to rinse off my yoga mat. &nbsp;Wait, &nbsp;you actually *drank* some?&quot; she laughed.</p>
<p>She assured me that it was a new bottle and I was not in fact drinking reclaimed yoga-mat water. &nbsp; However, in retrospect I wonder if that would make it taste any worse. &nbsp;Foul stuff indeed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And no, I have no idea why my wife&#8217;s yoga-mat water needs to be refrigerated. </p>

		<p>Maybe your friends were telling you something subtle in an herbal language where the properties of mint, &nbsp;which they gave you, are:</p>
<p>carminative, stimulative, stomachic, diaphoretic and antispasmodic</p>

<p>&quot;gets where it&#8217;s going quicker, and goes to work faster.&quot; this kind of phrasing has been noticed on laxatives in the UK. &nbsp;What are your friends alluding to?</p>

<p>HA! That&#8217;s hilarious! I can see how it would make sense for a laxative, but not for &quot;pure mintwater&quot;&#8230;</p>

		<p>Putting the &#8216;metro&#8217; prefix on any brand name instantly renders it only cool enough for extremely hip, urban trendsetters (there are a few &nbsp;example photos on the website) &#8211; The sort of people who don&#8217;t drink &#8211; they make an oral statement, brandwise.</p>
<p>We work in IT (or we know someone who does). Metromint(tm)(r) just isn&#8217;t aimed at us. That&#8217;s why we think it tastes like crap. We are not worthy.</p>

		<p>&#8212;&quot;My personal favourite is &quot;Diet Dr. Pepper tastes more like regular Dr. Pepper&quot;. &nbsp;&quot;takes more like&quot; is a four valued predicate, but there are only two values! It should be &quot;Diet Dr. Pepper tastes more like regular Dr. Pepper than milk tastes like gasoline&quot;, or whatever. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Without the additional values the predicate becomes untestable and therefore not really a claim.&quot;&#8212;-</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no more illogical than &quot;I&#8217;m feeling better&quot; is. Nobody asks who you&#8217;re feeling better than. &quot;Diet Dr. Pepper tastes more like the real Dr. Pepper&quot; than it did before, just as you are feeling better now than you were before.</p>
<p>Or you can parse it, &quot;Diet Doctor Pepper tastes more (like the real Dr. Pepper does))&quot; where &#8216;more&#8217; is used as a general intensifier (the equivalent of &#8216;has more taste&#8217;).</p>
<p>The first of these two interpretations is testable, though why tasting like the real Dr. Pepper should be considered something you&#8217;d want to let on about I don&#8217;t know.</p>

<p>As it happens, I enjoy both.</p>

		<p>I believe that the statement &quot;Diet Dr. Pepper tastes more like regular Dr. Pepper&quot; implies the ending &quot;than other diet sodas taste like their regular version&quot; since a common complaint about diet soda is that it doesn&#8217;t taste like the regular version.</p>

		<p>Here&#8217;s a link for the Cooking for Engineers blob:</p>

<p>Apparently, you&#8217;re lucky you didn&#8217;t get the Peppermint flavor &#8211; that&#8217;s even stronger! The Orangemint flavor is the best, according to the article.</p>

		<p>Err, -6&#176;C could be the proper serving temperature :)</p>
<p>When we are at it, I have Diet and Light derivatives of all products. Have you noticed how they are never cheaper than the real thing? Hint, try decaffeinated coffee (yuck), it is actually more expensive and it doesn&#8217;t have the most important ingredient.</p>
<p>Anyway, all diet and light junk stuff has Aspartame which is bad for health, it is 180 times stronger than regular sugar so it is much cheaper to transport, store in a warehouse and put in a drink.</p>
<p>Btw, decaffeinated coffee shouldn&#8217;t be called coffee at all &#8212; it doesn&#8217;t have coffeine. Same way you can&#8217;t label a product as chocolate if it doesn&#8217;t have at least 30% of cocoa.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
