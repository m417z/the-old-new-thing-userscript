<p>If you're going to use text from another language, it behooves you to get somebody who knows the language to be your proofreader. Those who fail to heed this advice with respect to Chinese characters may end up featured on <a href="http://www.hanzismatter.com/"> Hanzi Smatter <span lang="zh">&#19968;&#30693;&#21322;&#35299;</span></a>, which starts with a book titled <a href="http://www.hanzismatter.com/2004/09/upside-down-dictionary-by-w-eberhard.html"> A Dictionary of Chinese Symbols</a> whose cover depicts the character "book" (<span lang="zh">&#26360;</span>) upside-down. (Psst, they're called "characters", not "symbols".)</p>
<p> David Beckham could have done with a good proofreader when he got his wife's name tattooed onto his arm in Hindi, but <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/Archive/Article/0,4273,4097437,00.html"> misspelled it</a>. I get a real chuckle out of the response from Mr.&nbsp;Beckham's poor publicist: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  "You have to understand that there is a difference between Hindi and Hindu. The tattoo has been checked by a Hindu expert." </p>
<p> When told that Hindi is a language and Hindu a religion, the spokeswoman insisted: "We know the tattoo is spelt correctly." </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The BBC helpfully suggests <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1042872.stm#map"> a way the tattoo can be salvaged</a>. </p>
<p> My final example of consulting with someone who understands the language you're using comes from <a href="http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=koran10m&amp;date=20010210"> a dance rave which used passages from the Koran to decorate its advertising brochure</a>. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> "We had no idea what any of it meant. It looked good on there. It is a beautiful language. And we had desert and a camel in there." </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The kicker is that one of the people involved apologized for the sacrilege with a particularly poor choice of words: "It was an honest-to-God mistake." </p>

		<p>Is Hindi a language or a cipher?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure how anyone can say the Beckham tattoo translates to &quot;vihctoria&quot; is English, since that isn&#8217;t a word, and therefore could not possibly has a Hindi translation. &nbsp;It sounds like they&#8217;re saying one just substitues a Hindi letter for an English letter and get a &quot;translation&quot;.</p>
<p>For that matter, &quot;Victoria&quot; is a name, which wouldn&#8217;t really have a Hindi translation either. &nbsp;(Perhaps he should have gone for &quot;Victory&quot;, which would have acknowledged his wife, his career, and gotten a real translation.)</p>
<p>This would be similar to how a Chinese vendor create a chop for me. &nbsp;It has three Chinese characters which are meaningless together, but when pronounced form roughly &quot;Ja-Mu-Us&quot; &nbsp;(&quot;James&quot;). &nbsp;Now, how can one say that is &quot;spelled wrong&quot;?</p>

		<p>JamesCurran, note that in the Guardian article they explain that due to Queen Victoria, it is a name they are used to writing in Hindi. &nbsp;I take that to mean that there is an established, &quot;correct&quot; transliteration for that proper name. &nbsp;Similarly, we can say that in English, &quot;Beijing&quot; is correct and &quot;Bayzheeng&quot; isn&#8217;t, because the former is the spelling we&#8217;ve settled on.</p>

		<p>The same applies for resumes.We once got a resume from someone who was &quot;Impatient with impotence.&quot; One of my coworkers called the guy and found out that it should have been &quot;Impatient with incompetence.&quot; He didn&#8217;t get the job.</p>

		<p>Thing is, the BBC haven&#8217;t even done it right. Obviously, they were playing for laughs, but in a story that complains about correct transliteration, they really ought to have done a better job. AFAICT, the &quot;misspelling&quot; vihctoria would be विहक्तोरिय (vihktoriya) but on the BBC&#8217;s &quot;how to fix it&quot; image, it looks more like विठक्तोरिय (viṭhktoriya).</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s quite possible that it was done by someone who spoke Marathi and not Hindi. The script is almost identical(one extra character), but they like to sprinkle &#8216;h&#8217; sounds where Hindi doesn&#8217;t have them.</p>

		<p>Technically, the tattoo is in Devanagari (the script), not Hindi which is a language that uses this script. There are many languages that use the same script &#8211; see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari</a></p>
<p>One of the features of the Devanagari script is that pronunciations are defined within the script itself. There are a few exceptions based on which language is using the script, but generally speaking one can pronounce a word written in Devanagari without ambiguity.</p>
<p>The spelling of the tattoo actually looks like &quot;vhictoriya&quot; (by the way, Devanagari does have have upper case letters), not &quot;vihctoria&quot; as reported in the articles.<br /></p>

		<p>Since &quot;Allah&quot; means &quot;God&quot; as you surely must know, I don&#8217;t see the particular poor choice of words. Or should I (were I a believer) ask you to call It &quot;Dios&quot; just because I&#8217;m Spanish?</p>

		<p>This reminds me of an episode of Frasier where two characters spoke giberish in place of actual mandarin. &nbsp;Not very classy for a major show on a major network that was billed as the smartest comedy on TV. &nbsp;I mean, the show was probably made in SoCal anyway, so how hard would it have been to find a Chinese speaker? &nbsp;Laziness like that makes me appreciate shows and movies that take the trouble to get it right (such as the West Wing) a lot more.</p>

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
