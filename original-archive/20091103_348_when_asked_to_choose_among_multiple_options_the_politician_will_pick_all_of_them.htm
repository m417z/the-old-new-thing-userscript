<p>During the run-up to a local election some time ago, the newspaper posed the same set of questions to each of the candidates and published the responses in a grid format so the readers could easily compare them.</p>
<p> The candidates agreed on some issues, had opposing positions on others, but the question whose answers struck me was one of the form "If budget cuts forced you to eliminate one of the following four programs, which would you cut?" </p>
<ul>
<li>Candidate 1: "I have no intention of letting our budget get into     a situation in which this would become an issue.     All of these programs are very important to our community,     and under my leadership, they will continue to be funded." </li>
<li>Candidate 2: "I don't believe we need to eliminate any of these     popular programs. If we review our financial situation,     we will find that we can continue to provide for all of them." </li>
<li>Candidate 3: "Much as I personally enjoy Program&nbsp;X,     it ranks as a lower priority to me than the other options.     Program&nbsp;X was originally a community-run program,     and I would encourage residents and     the business community to step forward and keep alive this     program which has greatly benefited our community     over the years." </li>
</ul>
<p> Notice that the first two candidates, when asked to make a tough decision, opted to make no decision at all. (Compare another election in which <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/09/03/4712713.aspx"> the mainstream candidates rated everything as high priority</a>.) The first candidate said, "This would never happen." The second candidate said, "It's not happening." The third candidate is the only one who sat down and made the call to cut one of the programs. The first two were playing politics, afraid to make a decision for fear that it would alienate some portion of the electorate. The third understood the situation and made the hard decision. </p>
<p> I voted for the third candidate. </p>
<p> Today is Election Day in the United States. Don't forget to vote. (Void where prohibited.) </p>

		<p>This is why plebiscitary democracy tends to go wrong. The electors are asked various questions (e.g.</p>
<ol>
<li>Increase pensions.</li>
<li>
<p>Cut Taxes</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Stop the government from borrowing.)</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Since each sounds like a nice policy on its own, the electors say yes to each question notwithstanding that the result is contradictory.</p>
<p>Parliamentary democracy on the other hand involves choosing a (minimally coherent) program, which has good and bad points (e.g. higher taxes but higher pensions and less borrowing.)</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know about anyone else, but I&#8217;m extremely wary of voting for any candidate that promises to cut taxes, particular at the state level, as my state is currently in a budget crisis.</p>

		<p>The leader of the Conservative Party in the UK, David Cameron, was once being interviewed on radio about his view on marriage and civil partnerships. What with him being unwilling to alienate anyone in particular, I recall the interview went something like this:</p>
<p>Interviewer: &quot;So what are your feelings on marriage?&quot;</p>
<p>DC: &quot;Marriage is absolutely vital to a healthy family and should be encouraged with tax credits and other incentives&quot;</p>
<p>I: &quot;But same-sex couples are excluded which suggests that they are valued less than marriage&quot;</p>
<p>DC: &quot;Same sex couples and civil partnerships are highly valued in today&#8217;s modern society and form an important bond between couples that should be recognised equally as important&quot;</p>
<p>I: &quot;But they&#8217;re not married, which suggests that marriage in itself isn&#8217;t important&quot;</p>
<p>DC: &quot;Our core values reflect that marriage is the cornerstone of a stable family&quot;</p>
<p>I: &quot;So gay couples are less likely to have stable families&quot;</p>
<p>DC: &quot;Civil partnerships allow the bond of love blah blah blah blah&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>I: &quot;So what you&#8217;re saying is, everyone&#8217;s the best?&quot;</p>

		<p>Looking at some of the parliamentary democracies around the world, it seems like they are falling into most of the same traps&#8230; you have to get reelected again, after all.</p>
<p>It is quite true that different systems encourage different outcomes, but in general letting people vote just means they&#8217;ll vote to give themselves more things.</p>
<p>Does this mean I hate democracy? &nbsp;No&#8230; it&#8217;s just plainly the worst form of government every invented, except for all the others (with humblest apologies for the poor paraphrasing to the original speaker).</p>

		<p>This plays into the general rule that it&#8217;s hard to make a good impression, but very easy to make a bad one. People latch onto things which sound scary, offensive or otherwise objectionable.</p>
<p>The keener politicians find out which groups will never vote for them. They can then take strong stances on issues where the only people who will object will belong to one of those groups.</p>

		<p>I think the newspaper would have been more responsible if they had printed ‘Couldn&#8217;t come to a decision.’ for the first two candidates. This is essentially what they said, but a lot of readers will not get that.</p>

		<p>The question is flawed from the get-go, though, as it only allows for cutting. Why can&#8217;t each budget take a hit, or maybe *gasp* raise taxes?</p>

		<p>Didn&#8217;t the same thing happen during the Obama/McCain debate? When asked about cutting programs due to a bad economy, Obama started talking about how important his programs were while McCain went into &quot;save money by ending wasteful government spending&quot; mode.</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m also wary about are those propositions that seem to have no negative side effects whatsoever. If they&#8217;re that universally awesome, why do we need to make a decision about it?</p>

		<p>Reminds me a joke about a fictional driving school test in which the student is faces with a nightmare scenario of seeing a school bus and an ambulance stranded in the middle of the road in front of his car and asked a question: &quot;what will you hit?&quot; Despite perceived moral difficulty of this decision the correct answer (at least in the joke) is to &quot;hit the brakes&quot;.</p>
<p>The point of the story is that the right answer is not always in the multiple choices.</p>
<p>Aside from this, why does everyone here seem to miss the point that raising taxes excessively actually reduces government revenue and vice versa?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
