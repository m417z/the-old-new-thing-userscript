<p>I didn't believe it until I saw it myself: My friend asked me to bring <a href="http://www.keysan.com/big/picyjrv0015.html">red and blue plastic cups</a> to Sweden because the U.S. students really miss them. It's true. Here's why. (This needed to be explained to me because this was a part of U.S. college life I missed out on.)</p>
<p>These cups are valuable because they are opaque. This allows you to walk down the street with a beer without anybody (anybody = police) being able to tell that you have a beer in your hand, which would otherwise be a violation of open-container laws or&nbsp;evidence of underage drinking. As a result, the plastic cups have been&nbsp;synonymous with college drinking.&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's why the U.S. students miss them so.</p>
<p>In other news: Stockholm basically closes at 4pm on Saturdays.</p>

		<p>I was talking to a friend in Denmark one time on a Sunday, and I said I had to run out to the grocery store&#8230; it shocked him that stores were open on Sunday. Here in LA, the only thing closed on Sunday is the post office, and I&#8217;ve been here so long that I forget that isn&#8217;t the norm for other cities/countries.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m getting images of a bunch of exchange students loitering around outside with blue and red disposable cups until 4pm while their parents back home think they&#8217;re studying all day.</p>

		<p>I can understand the cups in the US, but needing them in scandanavia? When discreet drinking in, say, Copenhagen means walking round with a viking helmet on carrying a crate of beer, heading in to bars when you feel like it, before going to the hippy quarter to by 15g of the best ganja that Dutch agrochemical science can come up with? You are not going to be arrested for having an open beer can, except in those &quot;no public drinking&quot; areas that spring up in some places. If exchange students are pining for the plastic beer cups, they have not embraced the European lifestyle.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think the plastic cups would be any success in Norway since it&#8217;s illegal with public drinking of alchohol. So it is not about how your bottle/cup looks like, but what it contains. And it&#8217;s quite expensive to get caught by the cups too (and the beer is normally very expensive in the first place).</p>
<p>To put the alchohol in Norway into a better perspective. Recently there was quite a bit discussion if it should be allowed to have a beer tent <em>outside</em> of a skisport event in Oslo.</p>
<p>I assume Steve is talking about Christiania in Copenhagen above. It <em>is</em> illegal to buy &amp; use ganja there too. The last years there&#8217;s been lot&#8217;s of razzias by the police there. AFAIK the politicians of Denmark/Copenhagen doesn&#8217;t like Christiania anymore so they want to shut it down. Check out <a target="_new" href="http://www.christiania.org/" rel="nofollow">http://www.christiania.org/</a> for more information about it. It&#8217;s written in Danish, so FYI: &quot;Bevar Christiania&quot; means &quot;Keep Christiania&quot;.</p>

		<p>Jojjo: For the police to look into the cup without &quot;probable cause&quot; would risk running afoul of U.S. constitutional protections against unreasonable searches. But more practically, if they came towards you, you would just quickly pour out the cup so when they finally reached you, they saw just an empty cup.</p>
<p>Steve: It&#8217;s not that these cups are needed in Sweden. Rather, these cups have a very strong association with &quot;college party&quot;, so having one merely completes the experience. Think of it as a tradition.</p>

		<p>Same deal in Spain, as far as I could tell.  The line between bar and street was pretty much non-existent.  This may have just been lax policing though.  Regardless, the locals weren&#8217;t concerned so neither were we.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
