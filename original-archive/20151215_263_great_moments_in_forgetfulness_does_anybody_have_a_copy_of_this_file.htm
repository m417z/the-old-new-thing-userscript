<p>
A colleague of mine (let's call him Bob)
sent out a question to the rest of the team:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
Does anybody have a copy of xyz.exe?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I replied,
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="m"><p>
Hi, Bob.
I found a copy on
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/07/10171801.aspx">
\\scratch</a>\temp\bob\xyz.exe
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(A few years earlier,
Bob had sent mail out to the team saying "Hey, I found this
cool program xyz.exe. I copied it to
\\scratch</a>\temp\bob\xyz.exe."
So he answered his own question two years in advance of asking it.
All I did was act as a forwarding service.)
</p>
<p>
I was reminded of this story when a different colleague found himself
in need of a little script to accomplish some task,
so he fired up Notepad and gave it the name of the script he was
planning on writing.
But instead of being asked "Cannot find the file. Do you want to
create a new file?",
he got a Notepad window with
the contents of exactly the script he wanted to write.
</p>
<p>
Turns out he had already written that script and given it exactly
the same name.
</p>
<p>
Eerie.
</p>
<p>
At least he realized that he had already written the script
before he started writing it the second time!</p>

		<p>You could say he chose the name, and the script got written by itself. That&#8217;s how good naming works.<br />
In programming, as soon as you can give a function an appropriate name, you&#8217;ve almost finished writing it. (In your mind)</p>

		<p>Naming things is hard.  Naming things in a consistent and predictable way can be surprisingly valuable, which is one of the reasons I&#8217;m sad that (apps) Hungarian notation has fallen out of favor.  Being able to predict what a member variable or parameter is called is a huge boost to productivity.</p>

		<p>I needed new shoes this past summer, and since I am hard to fit, I bought two pair. I decided the best place to store the second pair was on the top shelf of a spare closet, where I wouldn&#8217;t forget them. When I got there, I found a shoebox containing a pair of shoes in my size that had never been worn.</p>

		<p>A few years ago I ran across a little command line utility that looked useful, so I installed it, but it kept telling me that the options were invalid. Could NOT figure this out. Eventually I tried &#8216;foobar /?&#8217; to see if maybe it would elucidate what options it really wanted. Turned out that what was running wasn&#8217;t the utility I&#8217;d just installed; it was a different utility with the same name, higher up in the system path.</p>
<p>Why is this relevant to this story? Because the usage text also showed a copyright. Mine. </p>
<p>Apparently I wrote a utility with the same name, years ago. I wonder what it&#8217;s for.</p>

		<p>My problem is in reverse, but IMO more common one: There are times that I remember I&#8217;ve written something before, but forgotten where I did place it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where the search function in Explorer comes handy &#8211; who doesn&#8217;t index their source folders for their mini test projects?</p>

		<p>If one runs notepad from the command line with an argument, then that argument is treated as the name of a file to be opened. If the file can’t be found,  then Notepad asks “Cannot find the xxx.x file. Do you want to create a new file?</p>

		<p>I always start Notepad by double-clicking on the handy shortcut that I have installed in my Quick-Launch-style folder next to the Start button, or else by double-clicking on a &#8220;txt&#8221; file that I am looking at.   So I don&#8217;t have a chance to give a new file a name before I save it.</p>
<p>(You can make something exactly like XP&#8217;s QuickLaunch in Windows 7 if you choose the right options.  Not sure about Win10 yet.)</p>

		<p>A year or so ago, I was getting a error message which I didn&#8217;t understand, and I naturally googled it, and found a StackOverflow question by someone who was getting the same error message,  And it had an accepted answer &#8212; which I had written three years earlier.    (The OP&#8217;s situation made the origin of the problem a bit clearer, so I was able to devise an answer for him, without ever seeing the problem.    Reading that answer made me realize I was looking in the wrong spot for my own problem)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
