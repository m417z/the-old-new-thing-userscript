<p>Some time ago, a senior executive sent email to the All Employees distribution list at Microsoft announcing that a particular product was now available for <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/08/02/10191834.aspx"> dogfood</a>. The message included a brief introduction to the product and instructions on how to install it.</p>
<p> A few hours later, a second message appeared in reply to the announcement. The second message came from a different senior executive, and it went </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I got your note and tried it out. Looks good so far. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Oopsie. The second senior executive intended to reply just to the first senior executive, but hit the <i>Reply All</i> button by mistake. This would normally have been caught by the <i>You do not have permission to send mail to <u>All Employees</u></i> rule, but since the mistake was made by a senior executive, that rule did not apply, and the message went out to the entire company. </p>
<p> People got a good chuckle out of this. At least he didn't say anything embarrassing. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: I'd have thought that these extra-large distribution lists would be marked <i>Nobody can send to this distribution list</i>, and then when somebody needed to send a message to the entire company, the email admins would create a one-day-only rule which allowed a specific individual to send one message. </p>

		<p>Would be neat if you could add a &quot;BCC Only&quot; rule for these extra-large distribution lists. &nbsp;(Still limited to the appropriate personnel.) &nbsp;This would seem to solve many of the reply all issues.</p>

		<p>@Karellen: I couldn&#39;t help but to think of <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://dilbert.com/fast/2014-05-19/">dilbert.com/&#8230;/2014-05-19</a></p>
<p>@carbon twelve: Exchange IRM supports &quot;can&#39;t reply-all&quot;. However, any IRM-marked mail incurs a price: Several-second delay while Outlook communicates with the IRM server to validate your rights, plus difficulties in OWA clients. I never understood why a simple mistake-preventing feature would need such a heavy-handed implementation, with server-side validation.</p>

		<p>Everyone that commented so far seems to have assumed that this happened in a Microsoft Exchange environment. But Raymond doesn&#39;t define what &quot;some time ago&#8230;&quot; means, so maybe this happened back in the old days of Microsoft Mail on Win 95 and NT 4.0. Your comments then would be moot.</p>

<p>Yeah, because senior executives just *love* to jump through hoops like that, and never simply demand the ability to do whatever their whims desire &#8211; safety, security, procedures be damned. Because they&#39;re *executives*, and wouldn&#39;t ever make a mistake, or fall for phishing spam/viruses, or anything like that. No, don&#39;t try and explain reasons to me, I don&#39;t have time for that. Just stop trying to subvert my well-earned power, you pathetic little IT monkey, do as I say, and make it possible for me to send emails to the All Employees list. Or else.</p>
<p>Yeah. Be careful what you wish for&#8230;</p>

		<p>Even if you lock the all_company addresses down inventive idiots will still find ways. &nbsp;About once a year I get an email from a senior/long serving cow-orker or one of his/her friends where they apparently opened the outlook company wide address book and selected several hundred to a &gt;thousand people (everyone in the building, location, or company) and jammed them all into the To field to inform me that someone I&#39;ve never worked with (and often have no clue who is) is retiring and inviting us to have cake over lunch or join them for drinks after hours. &nbsp;I&#39;ve never actually gone for a free slice of cake (I have my pride afterall); but the venues being picked for the after hours sessions are generally small enough it&#39;s clear that the email abuser knows that all but a few dozen of the people who receive it will just mash the delete key while muttering rude words under their breathe.</p>

		<p>There was a certain product rival to Outlook/Exchange popular in the Australian Public Service, which among many bugs ignored and excused by representatives of the product provider, was the tendency to Reply To All when the Reply button was clicked. It caught people out all the time, yet blame was attributed to the employee not the software.</p>

		<p>You got to have the new hawtness! Like some execs from MS that where boasting that they where using Win8 before the launch and it was awesome on their tablet! They can&#39;t have been doing much with it, since at the time of the developer preview, it was mildly speaking not in the most usable state.</p>

		<p>The normal course would be to set up a moderated list. You need a password or your mail gets quarantined until an admin releases it. Or you set the reply-to to the sender and not the list which would even be easier for management. So, it&#39;s either the fault of the mailing list managers or the software used to reply, likely the former.</p>

		<p>@ Eric Pi, you misunderstood mailing list/distribution list. That&#39;s not a list of recipients in cc or bcc, it&#39;s a software that got a list and sends mail to everyone on the list, no distribution of recipients occurs.</p>

		<p>@Daniel Neely: Pride vs. Free Cake! Time to get your priorities straight! I always show up for free food. In fact, I&#39;d show up &quot;on behalf&quot; of everybody in my office, and be sure to collect a slice of cake for everybody.

		<p>@Daniel Neely, @Jerome Viveiros: Around my office, sending out a mass email with a &quot;free cake/pizza/sodas/cookies/etc&quot; is a surefire way to boost attendance at your meeting or party. &nbsp;Over the years &nbsp;I&#39;ve managed to hone a skill whereby I show up shortly after the meeting and can gobble up the leftover goodies. &nbsp;That food would otherwise be trashed by our catering service at the end of the day.</p>
<p>@kog999: to me this looks more like a common reply-to-all vs. reply-to-sender mistake vs. whatever nefarious scheme you&#39;re talking about. &nbsp;Senior execs make mistakes like that, too, albeit from within a nicer office and with a bigger paycheck.</p>

		<p>@Kai Schätzl: doesn&#39;t matter. What matters is the Reply-To: header, which is automatically added by every email client when you click the Reply button or its variants (Reply All/Reply to List). Email clients use that header (and the related References: header) to group the emails in a thread.</p>
<p>So, what @Ross really wants is: if it&#39;s an &quot;announcement-only&quot; list, reject (please no silent dropping, it&#39;s hard to distinguish from a delay) any email with an In-Reply-To: header. Should not be hard to program in the MTA.</p>

		<p>Anyone at work can use our group DLs. &nbsp;I&#39;m actually kind of impressed I&#39;ve only seen one issue with people replying to it in the four years I&#39;ve been there. &nbsp;It did go down the ironic path of people replying to DL to tell people to stop replying to DL though.</p>

		<p>What if the mailing list ignores any reply-to-all order if the reply does not include a ticket number in the subject that is provided in the message body? OR what if mailing list gives a slightly wrong mailing address for reply-to-all field that has to be manually corrected for reply-to-all order to have an effect?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
