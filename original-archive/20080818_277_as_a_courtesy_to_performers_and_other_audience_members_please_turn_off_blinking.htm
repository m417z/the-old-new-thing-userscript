		<p>I&#8217;m really annoyed by those cell phones with bright back-lit displays that people pull out during movies and such. Just because I can&#8217;t hear it doesn&#8217;t mean it isn&#8217;t annoying. Since it&#8217;s the brightest thing in the room, one can&#8217;t help but be distracted by it.</p>

		<p>I actually did that once. &nbsp;I forget that it blinks. &nbsp;Fortunately, before the movie started, someone said something to me, so I turned it off. &nbsp;Since then, I take the headset off when I go to movies. &nbsp;I also put the phone on vibrate. &nbsp;On the off chance I get a call that&#8217;s actually an emergency, I don&#8217;t turn the phone off. &nbsp;If I get a call that requires me to answer it, I&#8217;ll leave the theater.</p>

		<p>He probably just didn&#8217;t realize&#8230; &nbsp;I don&#8217;t wear a headset, but if I did I&#8217;m not sure I would be aware of the blinking LED.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s too bad that the people in the row right behind him didn&#8217;t let him know. &nbsp;I think that too many people in the Seattle area think it would be &#8216;rude&#8217; to lean over and say, &quot;Excuse me, would you mind turning off your headset? &nbsp;The LED is quite distracting&quot;.</p>

		<p>I agree with the devil&#8217;s advocate, Bob King. When I did my compulsory military service I got so used to carrying a gun at my side, since it was part of my uniform. There was a supermarket a little outside the camp (located close to a residential area, btw) where we went to shop snacks for the night guard/watch. Well, long story short I once forgot that I was wearing the gun and walked in there to shop. The shop manager wasn&#8217;t too pleased with that since it scared him &amp; his customers (and potentially bad guys could try to steal it from me and then use it to threat other people).</p>

		<p>I have to also agree with someone :)</p>
<p>I agree with mikeb: too many people are too shy to actually tell others that they are annoying. Chances are, they don&#8217;t even realise they are annoying others.</p>
<p>They may also be assholes but you have nothing to lose at trying.</p>

		<p>It may be that the people directly behind the headset wearer aren&#8217;t bothered by the blinkin&#8217; light because the stage occupies a bigger field of view vs. the headset. But it&#8217;s more noticable to people furthur away.</p>
<p>&#8220;pssst, tell the guy over there [pointing] to take off his headset. Pass it down.&#8221;</p>
<div class=post>[<i>The people distracted by the headset are not in a position to tap the person on the shoulder: You have to be a few seats to the side (because the headset is ear-mounted) and a few rows back (otherwise it&#8217;s not in your field of view). -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>While it&#8217;s not really an excuse to wearing a headset during a performance, I know my headset has the option to turn the blink off if I hold down the Volume Up and Volume Down buttons for a couple seconds.</p>

		<p>I just took my kid to a movie and they had added a notice about texting during the movie. &nbsp;I was quite pleased. &nbsp;It&#8217;s too bad in our society that movie theaters have to spend ten minutes telling us something we should do without the reminder. &nbsp;I&#8217;d rather they do it, but still&#8230; &nbsp;I&#8217;ve noticed that the warnings seem to get longer and longer for each movie I see. &nbsp;That&#8217;s probably a good thing. &nbsp;At least some of them are pretty funny.</p>

		<p>I think this is an insidious marketing gimick. What is the point of a flashing indicator that the user **cannot see when they are wearing the headeset?**</p>
<p>A little flash to confirm the headset has been turned on/off, or when one of its buttons is pressed, is useful. The only purpose that I can see for an idle indicator is to broadcast, &quot;hey, look at the way-cool headset this hip, trendy Important Person is wearing&quot;</p>
<p>One particular Motorola headset blinks when a call is active. The manual says that is a feature to let others know you are on a call. Most people do not know the blink codes of their own gadgets &#8211; how in h?ll are other people supposed to know what *your* headset is blinking for?!</p>

		<p>Amen&#8230;what happened to common courtesy??? &nbsp;It&#8217;s not just the stupid ring tones anymore, it *is* the bright screens while people text message during the movie. &nbsp;Once upon a time folks went to movies to see the movies, not to test their per-adolescent friends about how far they are getting with their new boyfriend(s). &nbsp;I bring a bag of Reeses Pieces with me and just wing candies at people who do this. &nbsp;If they get pissed enough to stand up and protest, I tell them to keep their f&#8217;ing phone closed.</p>
<p>Of course, not that I condone any of this, or the following, because such devices are not legal in the US&#8230;but a cell phone jammer is a beautiful thing to have. &nbsp;&lt;vbeg&gt;</p>

		<p>Oh, don&#8217;t spoil the fun! Bluetooth devices are fun things to hack &#8211; especially when you hijack an existing connection to blast people with&#8230;</p>

<p>(It says evesdropping, but it&#8217;s bi-directional. You can play audio to the headset, as well as receive it&#8230;)</p>
<p>Might be fun to do in a theatre before the lights dim.</p>

		<p>it begs the question &#8211; why do all bluetooth things need to &#8216;flash&#8217; at all? can&#8217;t they do what they do &#8216;silently&#8217; ? &nbsp;&#8230; me thinks the flashing blue is nothing but a stupid marketing gimmick&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
