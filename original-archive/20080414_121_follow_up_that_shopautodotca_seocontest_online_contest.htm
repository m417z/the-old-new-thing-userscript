<p>So I didn't win the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/06/08/3150724.aspx"> shopautodotca seocontest</a> search engine optimization contest, so I decided to check on how the actual winners were faring. After all, one of the winners was supposed to become the company's SEO manager.</p>
<p> The top prize winners <a href="http://shopautodotcaseocontest.org/"> in the Google category</a> and <a href="http://shopautodotcaseo.blogspot.com/"> in the MSN category</a> have both complained that they haven't received their prizes yet and have threatened to file a fraud claim. (<a href="http://seocontest.net/forum/viewtopic.php?t=6544">Dead link to forum</a>.) The <a href="http://www.bloglines.com/blog/shopautodotca"> top prize winner in the Yahoo category</a> hasn't said anything one way or the other. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, <a rel="nofollow" href="http://shopauto.ca/forum/"> the forum hosted by the contest organizers</a> was emptied of all messages, rendering it a breeding ground for message board spam. (It was subsequently taken down late last year.) </p>
<p> I suspect that's the last I'll hear of this contest; I don't anticipate any resolution to emerge. </p>

		<p>I have a friend who has a rather clever way of raising his PageRank. &nbsp;He has a CGI script at hissite.com/bar that, if your User Agent is not one of (GoogleBot, YahooBot, MSNBot, or AOLBot), then it redirects you to his home page. &nbsp;Otherwise, it generates a random page containing mostly gibberish, with an occasional link with his name linking to his home page, as well as links to more random pages under the /bar pseudo-directory. &nbsp;It&#8217;s proven to be rather effective in raising his Google PageRank, although it does not seem to be so effective with the other major search engines.</p>

		<p>Meanwhile, your post on it is #3 in the Google rankings for the &quot;magic phrase&quot;.</p>
<p>Which says something, I think, about things that last and things that don&#8217;t.</p>

<p>No, that&#8217;s not clever. That&#8217;s cheating.</p>

<p>Feeding Googlebot a completely different view of the page than a normal browser is a violation of Google&#8217;s guidelines (and the guidelines of pretty much every search engine). If he gets caught, he&#8217;ll probably be delisted.</p>

<p>The founders and architects of the Internet had absolutely no knowedge of basic human nature. Any operation taken without taking into account human nature is bound to fail. Not much more to it than that.</p>

		<p>@James Schend:</p>
<p>Actually, they did take it into account; they expected that people who had antisocial behaviour would be kicked by their ISP, and if their ISP didn&#8217;t care, their ISP&#8217;s ISP would kick their ISP out. If it went all the way to the backbone, the upstream ISP would be depeered or blackholed.</p>
<p>What they didn&#8217;t expect is that there are so many ISPs which don&#8217;t care that depeering or blackholing isn&#8217;t a valid solution anymore (it would cause too much collateral damage).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
