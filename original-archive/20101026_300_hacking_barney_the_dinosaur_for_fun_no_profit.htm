<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/12/15/9936830.aspx#9938578"> Many years ago</a>, Microsoft produced a collection of interactive toys called ActiMates, and one of the features was that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/press/1997/sept97/mspbspr.mspx"> television programs could broadcast an encoded signal which would enable the toy to interact with the program</a>. The idea would be that the Barney doll would do something that was coordinated with what was happening on <i>Barney &amp; Friends</i>.</p>
<p> When this came out, a bunch of us wondered what it would take to hack into the device and get Barney to say and do, um, very un-Barneyish things. One of us managed to get a schematic for the device, but since none of us was an electrical engineer, that pretty much dead-ended the project. </p>
<p> Over ten years later, I learned that we weren't the only people to get that idea. I met someone who told me that he managed to get his hands on the internal devkit for the ActiMates series and control a Barney doll from his PC. Not satisfied with being limited to the built-in Barney phrases, he was able to "take additional creative steps with the devkit" to stream his own replacement audio to the device (although he was never able to get the sound quality of his streamed audio to sound as good as the built-in phrases). As a result, he could make Barney say whatever he wanted, and if he really felt like it, he could wake up all the Barney toys in his apartment complex at midnight and give orders to his robot army of purple dinosaurs. </p>
<p> The catch was that his robot army most likely would have consisted of just one robot. </p>

		<p>I love the visual of an army of small, purple dinosaurs under the command of an evil dictator. I think this could be the beginning of a new Hollywood blockbuster. Are there any movie producers reading this? I think I have something.</p>

		<p>In response to the above comment, I think the big fluffy pink toy being evil and leading other toys has been covered by a recent blockbuster.</p>

		<p>When I grew up there was a movie abouts &quot;toys&quot; with Robin Williams. His father dies and leaves him a factory that produces &quot;toys&quot;. Nefarious board members turn the &quot;toys&quot; into military weapons. Just can&#39;t remember the name.</p>

		<p>BTW robot army, some years ago I was in charge of a gift for a friend&#39;s boy (several people putting money together for something bigger).</p>
<p>And the result was a kit of the first generation of Lego Mindstorms. Several people were unhappy because of &quot;wasted money&quot;, but it proved the right thing. The boy had a blast, and played with it for several years.</p>
<p>Now the connection with the article: one of his project was a tank that would navigate to the (opened) door of his sister, shot a (sponge) rocket, then retreat.</p>
<p>He is now at Berkeley :-)</p>

		<p>The funny thing about the wikipedia link is that it redirects to &quot;Speed&quot; but neither the title not the Simpsons are even mentioned in the article. Talk about being an unhelpful redirection.</p>
<p>I liked the joke, though.</p>

		<p>In college we &quot;enhanced&quot; a Teddy Ruxpin animatronic doll. &nbsp;It&#39;s a stuffed animal with a cassette player in its back, and special tapes with one of the stereo tracks encoding movement commands (primarily for Teddy&#39;s jaw).</p>
<p>In Teddy&#39;s cassette deck we put a cassette adapter like you&#39;d use to hook an MP3 player up in your car. &nbsp;We then built a simple circuit board to feed appropriate signals to Teddy. &nbsp;The next step would have been to write software for the PC to do this, but the people involved were more EE types, so it stayed at the hardware proof-of-concept stage. &nbsp;We were not far away from having Teddy animatedly say anything we wished (by synthesizing a voice on one channel and the movement commands on the other).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, modern Teddy Ruxpins use some sort of (analog, later digital) cartridges&#8230;the most hackable ones are about 20 years old now.</p>

		<p>Yup, just wanted to prove your previous post that people don&#39;t read of your post completely. ;^)</p>
<p>That is what happens after a long day and trying to read something when it is hard to even keep your eyes open.</p>
<p>This is what I was going to link to but I had a bit of mindless web wandering and did not finish reading your post to the end and ended up where you did. (excuse #1)</p>
<p>This is some background on the paper.</p>

		<p>Third-hand info, but I vaguely remember back in the late 90s a friend having inquired about the devkit for this and been given by Microsoft a hefty legal contract that basically said &quot;Thou shalt not make Barney swear, on pain of death&quot; as a precondition of getting the devkit&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
