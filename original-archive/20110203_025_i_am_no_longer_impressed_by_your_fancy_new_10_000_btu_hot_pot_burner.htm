<p>Two years ago, we had a gathering at my house for some friends for hot pot, the traditional way of ringing in the lunar new year (which takes place today). It was actually a bit of a cross-cultural event, since the attendees came from different regions of Asia, where <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hot_pot#Regional_variations"> different traditions reign</a>. (And the American guests just had to choose sides!)</p>
<p> My house has but one portable stove for hot pot, so one of the guests brought her own unit, a unit as it turns out which was purchased specifically for the occasion, which gleamed in the light and proudly proclaimed 10,000 BTU of raw heating power. This was cause for much boasting, particularly since I didn't know the heating power of my own puny old unit, but I accepted my second-place position with grace. </p>
<p> Some time later, we had a quiet family hot pot, and my old and horrifically unfashionable burner was brought out to do its tired but important job, and it was then that I found the sticker that specified its heating power. </p>
<p> 9,925 BTU. </p>
<p> Now <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/03/03/9455562.aspx"> I am no longer impressed by my friend's 10,000 BTU burner</a>. </p>

		<p>I think the British Thermal Unit (BTU) is a unit of energy, not power, but anyway&#8230; I guess the label means 10,000 BTU/hour or something?</p>
<p>Reply to self: Yes, it does.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_thermal_unit" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/British_thermal_unit</a></p>
<p>As a Briton myself, it&#39;s weird how BTUs are used in America given that we don&#39;t use them any more, at least in that context (my gas bill is paid per BTU, I believe).</p>

		<p>@Chris Long</p>
<p>The reason you still pay in BTU for your gas is that you still have a pre-metric meter (some people have pre-metric electricity meters.)</p>
<p>Newer residences and replaced meters are in metric.</p>

		<p>Brits also use the &quot;,&quot; symbol as a decimal separator which would make &quot;10,000 BTU&quot; significantly less impressive.</p>

<p>No, we don&#39;t, we use &#39;.&#39; as the decimal separator and &#39;,&#39; as the thousands separator. &nbsp;Many/most mainland European countries do it the other way round, though.</p>

		<p>When I bought my condo, it needed a new HVAC on move in. &nbsp;The heater in the HVAC was rated 50,000 BTU. &nbsp;About a year later, my mother redid her kitchen with a trendy Viking cooktop. &nbsp;That cooktop with all burners at full was 60,000 BTU. &nbsp;Hmm. &nbsp;At least my gas bill is less than my mom&#39;s.</p>

		<p>10000 BTU/Hour is about 3000 watts. &nbsp;Is this a gas burner you&#39;re talking about ? &nbsp;Otherwise it would have to draw 25A at 120V, and it would trip a 15A circuit breaker pretty quickly.</p>

		<p>Nik: Only burning devices are rated in BTUs. Electrical devices are always rated in W, unless they&#39;re motors, in which case they may be rated in hp.</p>

		<p>@Gabe: I&#39;m pretty sure the correct statement would be &quot;He is no longer impressed by his friend&#39;s fancy new 2.93 kW burner now that he discovered that his own burner is 2.91 kW.&quot;</p>
<p>Although, he did not ask for SI units, but for &quot;ISO standard units&quot;. I&#39;m pretty sure that in ISO 80000-5:2007 &quot;Thermodynamics&quot; the only units are Kelvin, Celsius and reciprocal Kelvin. That would imply there is no ISO standard way to measure a heater. :)</p>

<p>I had the same problem, I had to go and look up the definition of these archaic units. &nbsp;Turns out a BTU is defined as the amount of energy needed to be emitted by a 1 foot-candle source to raise the temperature of a half-furlong length of copper wire by one degree Rankine, measured in horsepower-hours. &nbsp;Simple, once you look it up.</p>

<p>Why should he? &nbsp;If it was good enough for use by medieval monks, it should be good enough for use in the US. &nbsp;Everyone knows those new-fangled SI units are just a plot by foreign terrorists to take money from true US companies.</p>

		<p>@Sunil Joshi, what unit did pre-metric electricity meters use?</p>
<p>Anyway, the BTU is defined in essentially the same way as the calorie, only based on the pound instead of the gram/kilogram, and fahrenheit instead of celsius.</p>

		<p>Hot pots are tasty!!!</p>
<p>For a note more related to technical blog, heat generated by computer systems is also measured in BTUs (to measure how much cooling is needed). And on a related thought, is there anyone still use your heated server/workstations to warm your lunchboxes?</p>

<p>Whether you are billed in BTU or whatever is not a factor of your meter. &nbsp;British domestic gas meters measure the *volume* of gas delivered, not the amount of energy.</p>
<p>Pre-metric meters measure cubic feet of gas delivered, modern meters measure cubic metres. &nbsp;If you have a pre-metric meter, you will find on your gas bill a conversion factor which converts that into a cubic metre value (although most gas bills are sufficiently obtuse that it may not be immediately obvious&#8230;)</p>
<p>Your gas company bill will then apply a conversion based on a standard calorific value for a cubic metre of gas, and will then calculate your bill based on this. &nbsp;I&#39;m pretty sure all UK domestic suppliers bill based on kilowatt-hours (i.e. their rates are specified in price-per-kWh.)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
