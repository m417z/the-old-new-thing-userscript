<p>In the early days of Windows, there was a separate version of Windows for each language, and once you decided to install, say, the French version of Windows, you were locked into using French. You couldn't change your mind and, say, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/04/24/582153.aspx"> switch to German</a>. The reason for this is that there were bits and pieces of language-dependent information stored all over the system.</p>
<p> One obvious place is in file names. For example, a shortcut to the calculator program was kept at <tt>%USERPROFILE%\<wbr><u>Start Menu\<wbr>Programs\<wbr>Accessories\<wbr>Calculator.lnk</wbr></wbr></wbr></u></wbr></tt> on US-English systems, but <tt>%USERPROFILE%\<wbr><u>Startmen&uuml;\<wbr>Programme\<wbr>Zubeh&ouml;r\<wbr>Rechner.lnk</wbr></wbr></wbr></u></wbr></tt> on German systems. The name of the physical file system directory or file was displayed to the user as the name of the menu item. This means that if you started with an English system and simply replaced all the user interface resources with the corresponding German ones, you would still see a folder named <i>Accessories</i> on your Start menu, containing a shortcut named <i>Calculator</i>, even though they should now be displayed as <i>Zubeh&ouml;r</i> and <i>Rechner</i>. </p>
<p> The registry was another place where language-dependent strings were stored. For example, file type descriptions were stored in plain text, which meant that if you installed an English system, then <code>HKEY_<wbr>CLASSES_<wbr>ROOT\<wbr>txtfile</wbr></wbr></wbr></code> had the value <tt>Text Document</tt>, and that's the value shown to the user under the <i>Typ</i> column even though the user had switched the user interface resources to German. </p>
<p> For Windows&nbsp;2000, an effort was made to move all language-dependent content into resources so that they could be changed dynamically. If you need to store a language-dependent string anywhere, you can't store the string in plain text, because that would not survive a change in language. You have to store an <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/bb759919.aspx"> indirect string</a> and convert the indirect string to a real string at runtime, so that it mapped through the user's current user interface language. It was quite an effort identifying all the places that needed to be changed to conform to the new rules while still ensuring that the new rules were backward compatible with old code that followed the old rules. </p>
<p> For example, you couldn't just say "To register a language-aware file type friendly name, write an indirect string to <code>HKEY_<wbr>CLASSES_<wbr>ROOT\<wbr>progid</wbr></wbr></wbr></code>. For example, set <code>HKEY_<wbr>CLASSES_<wbr>ROOT\<wbr>txtfile</wbr></wbr></wbr></code> to <code>REG_SZ:<wbr>@C:\<wbr>Windows\<wbr>system32\<wbr>notepad.exe,-469</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></code>." If you did that, then applications which retrieved file type friendly names by reading directly from <code>HKEY_<wbr>CLASSES_<wbr>ROOT\<wbr>progid</wbr></wbr></wbr></code> (instead of using functions like <code>SHGet&shy;File&shy;Info</code>) would end up showing this to the user: </p>

<p> Designing and implementing all this was a major undertaking (that's what happens when you have to retrofit something as opposed to designing it in from the beginning), and to keep the test matrix from growing quadratically in the number of supported languages, a decision was made early on to support dynamic language changes only if the starting language is English. So yes, you could have both English and Dutch resources installed, but you have to start with English and add Dutch and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/04/24/582153.aspx#582808"> not the other way around</a>. </p>
<p> Mind you, the implementation in Windows&nbsp;2000 was not perfect. There were still places where English strings appeared even after you switched the user interface language to Dutch or German, but things got better at each new version of Windows. Unfortunately, pretty much nobody knew about this feature, since it was marketed to large multinational corporations and not to your random everyday users who simply want to change the user interface to a language they are more comfortable with. </p>
<p> For Windows&nbsp;2000 and Windows&nbsp;XP, you still had two ways of installing Windows with a German user interface: You could either install the English version and then add the German language pack (the fancy Windows&nbsp;2000 multilingual way), or you could install the fully-localized German version of Windows, just as you always did. In Windows&nbsp;Vista, fully-localized versions of Windows were dropped. From Windows&nbsp;Vista onwards, all versions of Windows consist of a base language-neutral version <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2007/12/17/6784443.aspx"> with a language pack installed on top</a>. </p>
<p> While it's true that <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/181144/windows_finally_speaks_expats_language.html"> access to the feature has improved in more recent versions of Windows</a>, the feature has existed for over a decade. But of course, that doesn't stop people from claiming that it's a "new" feature. Don't let the facts get in the way of a good story. </p>

		<p>And who claims it&#39;s a new feature? :) The Windows geeks always knew about this. Maybe you should stop saying &quot;nobody&quot; and start saying &quot;Joe Average&quot;. And this feature is still out of reach because MS keeps it exclusive to Enterprise and Ultimate editions. MUI should be there in Home Premium and above.</p>

		<p>I would have loved them marketing it to end users right away. Well actually, I couldn&#39;t have cared less about marketing it properly. But just having the option of installing the English version only, without the German localization (or even better, remove the lanugage pack later, as the OS is mostly preloaded anyway) would have been great. One thing I always did in Linux was to never install German localization files. In Windows I never had this option, until I switched from XP to Windows 7 and found that even my pre-installed Windows 7 on my new laptop allowed me to choose English as my interface language. Finally! Bad to know I could have had this 10 years ago &#8230;</p>

		<p>Raymond described the right behavior for the Window XP, but not for window 7. In Window 7, when I installed the English and try to bring the other language, like Chinese. I found a great difficulty to display the characters for the OS interface, do not know why. Maybe window 7 was changed for the language support procudure?</p>

		<p>Well, if you had to have the English version installed in order to be able to change the language, the feature did not exist for all the people who had any non-English version installed, did it? So the ability to change the OS language is &quot;new&quot; for all of them.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Now you&#39;re just rationalizing via nitpicking. The article was written in English. English-language users have had this feature since 2000.

It&#39;d be like when PayPal expanded to Japan, writing an article *in English* saying &quot;There&#39;s a new service called PayPal!&quot; and never mentioning the fact that it had been available in the United States all along.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Yes, I did read it; however I believe the conclusion was that the US market would consider our British spellings wrong, and the UK market is more tolerant to US spellings. It is sad that our UK differences are going to be lost and I believe MS is helping to pave the road to oblivion. I should certainly be prepared to pay more for a British English version. I raise the point again because the post suggests that it is now relatively easy to add new languages thanks to the MUI.</p>

		<p>#trevor: evolution hurts. The British (and the rest of the world that avoided Webster&#39;s bastardisations) have nothing on the Portugese, though. They&#39;re now 3rd cousins to Brazil who drove most of the recent Portugese-language spelling reform.</p>

<p>Yep, I think michkap&#39;s blog have a few articles talking about it.</p>
<p>&quot;And this feature is still out of reach because MS keeps it exclusive to Enterprise and Ultimate editions. MUI should be there in Home Premium and above.&quot;</p>
<p>One reason it isn&#39;t in Home editions is so that MS can price Windows differently in different locales, in an attempt to solve one of the biggest reasons of piracy. Often they even restrict activation to certain locales.</p>

		<p>@Myria &#8211; removing the ANSI API wouldn&#39;t force app developers to &quot;support Unicode&quot; &#8211; it would force them to work in Unicode whether they know how to support it or not. &nbsp;Which isn&#39;t the same thing. &nbsp;Proper &quot;Unicode Support&quot; isn&#39;t just about using UTF16 everywhere.</p>

		<p>Trevor: one of the great things about English is its lack of standardisation. &nbsp;Kids learn that the spellings they see aren&#39;t authoritative or universal, and therefore are less worried about using a &quot;received&quot; orthography. &nbsp;Would you also want a MUI for the tens of dialects in the UK?</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Windows may have <em>supported</em> MUI for a long time, but it wasn&#39;t until Vista that regular users could get their hands on it
</p></blockquote>
<p>OEM versions of Windows XP usually came with either language packs preinstalled (and you could choose them in the Language applet in Control Panel), or included CDs with language packs (this makes me wonder: I have several of such CDs &#8211; some let you install a single language only, which once installed is automatically applied for all users, and you can&#39;t switched back to English, while other CDs allow installing multiple languages, which each user can then pick individually in Control Panel).</p>
<p>Also, I wish Windows localization would support proper plural forms &#8211; right now it seems to only support one/many distinction, which is not enough for languages such as Slovenian.</p>

		<p>Yeah, all my WinCE days of building just made me use wide strings, and the use of mbstowcs and wcstombs.</p>
<p>The fun part was when using different API sets &#8211; you got a skinny string but had to pass in a fat one, then you got a fat one and had to make it skinny again. Some calls had this happen several times as they traversed from application down to the kernel&#8230;</p>
<p>So, how did Microsoft solve the file hierarchy thing? If you started out with en_US, then n stalled French, what happens to Program Files and other directories?</p>

		<p>&quot;From Windows Vista onwards, all versions of Windows consist of a base language-neutral version with a language pack installed on top.&quot;</p>
<p>&#8230;with the usual definition of</p>
<p>&quot;language-neutral&quot; == &quot;US American English&quot;</p>

<p>Very confusingly. From Vista onwards, the file and directory names are always in English, but Explorer shows localized names. Maybe it looks pretty, but just about everybody I know (me included) was confused by this at one time or another (especially since the file list shows localized name, but the input boxes only accept on-disk names, and there&#39;s no indication why typing what you see doesn&#39;t work).</p>

		<p>Oh and Office allows you to install language packs too. However, they cost money. I can&#39;t normally get an English version of office here in Germany. The English language pack costs an extra 27EUR. Are you crazy? English is the language the software is created in. I should not pay anything extra for downloading <em>the_source_language</em>, should I?</p>

		<p>@Alex: buy the German version of Office, then download the English trial version and activate it with the CD-key that you bought.</p>

		<p>Do realise that after changing the language pack, you can not install service packs or new Internet Explorers like you are used too. I succeeded in changing a dutch Windows 7 to the english version, than SP1 came out and the boot would hang on a language related error. This seemed to be common knowledge, just like the multiple UI thing?</p>

		<p>@Rick: you can only change the language on Enerprise and Ultimate SKUs (on Ultimate you can install them through Windows Update, then switch them per-user in the Control Panel, and this will not cause any problems).</p>
<p>On any other version of Windows, you&#39;re stuck with the language you installed with (and various hacks to change the language later are exactly that &#8211; hacks). If you want a different language version of Windows on non-Ultimate, get an install DVD in that language and do a clean install (though according to Microsoft this is not legal &#8211; you&#39;re supposed to install and use only the language you bought, unless you have Ultimate).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
