		<p>Maybe for the experimentalist who has everything. Give that to a theorist and they&#39;ll probably build something that measures a value that&#39;s off by 120 orders of magnitude. <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDOnBv0gCKg">http://www.youtube.com/watch</a></p>

		<p>I favor distributing the gift-giving workload evenly among the 365.2425 days of a year, peforming the action on a need-to-gift basis as opposed to following any of these artificial, socially-predetermined occassions.</p>

		<p>@ Boris</p>
<p>Birthdays then&#8230; How artificial / socially predetermined are those occasions?</p>

		<p>@John &#8211; I&#39;d say they&#39;re pretty close. Instead of specifying the deadline by value, e.g. &quot;December 25 of every year&quot;, you just specify it by reference as &quot;the day and month of birth&quot;.</p>
<p>My gifts to friends and close family tend to consist of movie tickets which I buy for everyone, restaurant bills which I pay for everyone, previous iterations of iPhones and iPads which I give away instead of selling on eBay (too much hassle, and it&#39;s easier if the people I may need to family-tech-support are all on a similar page). I usually get the same in return. However, I don&#39;t expect any birthday or holiday gifts, so I don&#39;t bother with all that figure-out-what-the-person-may-need-then-hope-for-the-best.</p>

		<p>@Boris: I feel the same way. &nbsp;I hope our movement gains momentum and then eventually overtakes the convention of using socially-predetermined occasions. &nbsp;Though, I haven&#39;t figured out how to handle little kids. &nbsp;If I apply this philosophy to my (future) kids, I think the other kids at school won&#39;t understand gifts 365 days a year versus big events like Christmas and birthdays. &nbsp;Plus, if there&#39;s a kid birthday party, I can&#39;t see sending my kid to it without a gift knowing all the other kids are bringing them.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
