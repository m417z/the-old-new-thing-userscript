<p>In the Customer Service and Support part of Microsoft, you will often see the term <i>funnel</i>. Here are some citations:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Effectively and efficiently solve issues by driving levers across the entire funnel. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Putting the Fun in Funnel. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Strengthening the front of the funnel. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The <i>funnel</i> is a way of viewing customer support engagements. For some reason, the funnel diagram is always drawn on its side with the mouth (the fat part) on the left and the stem (the narrow part) on the right. The width of the funnel represents the volume of customers at that stage of the support process, and the progress through the funnel represents how much time the customer has spent working on a solution. </p>
<p> At the mouth of the funnel are the customers who turn to built-in product help, online help, forums, Knowledge Base articles, blog entries, training materials, and similar resources. A significant percentage of customers get the help they need via self-help, where the solution to their problem existed even before they asked the question; they just had to find it. </p>
<p> The funnel narrows, and the customer picks up the phone or otherwise initiates a support incident. A support technician helps the customer via email, live chat, phone call, whatever. Another percentage of customers get their problem solved at this stage. It took longer, but the problem did get solved. </p>
<p> At the stem of the funnel are the customers whose problems remain unresolved, and now things get bad. The problem takes days to resolve, multiple engineers get involved, and maybe even a site visit is called for. </p>
<p> There is a concerted effort to improve the support resources at the <i>front of the funnel</i>. Of course, there are efforts to improve the support process at all of the stages, but the <i>front of the funnel</i> is a particular area of focus, since that's where everybody starts out, and that's where most users get their solutions. The term <i>front of the funnel</i> is in such heavy use it even gets its own acronym: FoF. Is it pronounced <i>foff</i>? Beats me. </p>

		<p>Putting the Fun in Funnel&#8230; Do you pour it in ? Does it stick ?</p>
<p>I wish I were a Microsoft support engineer. They have all the fun!</p>
<p>&lt;/jest&gt;</p>
<p>BTW, a quick image search on funnel shows that a wide use on the web is for &#8230; sales and marketing!</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Is it pronounced foff?
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes &#8211; that&#39;s exactly how we pronounce it here. While we tend to make fun of it ourselves, it does provide a good metaphor for how cases get handled, and how our resources should be allocated. The FoF model is what justifies the time I get to spend blogging and developing support tools.</p>

		<p>&quot;Driving levers across the entire funnel&quot;? &nbsp;That&#39;s one of the strangest phrases I have heard in a while. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The Act contact management system (called ACT! by its creators) uses a &quot;sales funnel&quot; model, with large numbers of prospects at varying levels of committment at the top, and the smaller number of closed sales presumably fall through the narrow end. &nbsp;It&#39;s kind of like an inverted pyramid, I suppose. &nbsp;I have never encountered a funnel on its side for any kind of metaphor&#8230;</p>

		<p>The term &quot;sales funnel&quot; is also in common use outside Microsoft.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve always thought it was funny that the Microsoft support funnel is drawn sideways. Wouldn&#39;t the support incidents just spill back out? And why is it &quot;front of the funnel&quot; instead of the more intuitive &quot;top of the funnel?&quot;</p>
<p>But, I guess thinking like this explains why I&#39;m a support engineer instead of a manager.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s sideways because time is the independent variable, whereas the number of customers remaining at that time is the dependent variable, and the independent variable is customarily on the x-axis.</p>
<p>Then, just for effect or to show off that the support engineers also took first year calculus, we decide to rotate the line about the x axis so it looks like a funnel rather than a waterslide.</p>

		<p>The word funnel (and that identical diagram) is also widely used in web design to describe a multiple-step process. As users progress through each step, a certain percentage give up and leave the site.</p>

<p>I know. This is used to represent customers that got a problem, cannot find self help, but too lazy / think it doesn&#39;t worth the time to ask.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
