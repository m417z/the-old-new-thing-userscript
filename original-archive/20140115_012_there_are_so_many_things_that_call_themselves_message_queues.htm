<p>There are a whole bunch of things in Windows that call themselves message queues, and none of them have anything to do with each other.</p>
<p> There is the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms632590(v=vs.85).aspx"> window manager message queue</a>, which holds window messages. </p>
<p> And there is the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms711472(v=vs.85).aspx"> Microsoft Message Queue (MSMQ)</a> which is a networking technology for allowing multiple computers to communicate with each other by sending and reading messages. </p>
<p> The Windows Mobile folks didn't want to feel left out, so they created their own  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa909023"> Message Queue Point-to-Point</a> message queue system. </p>
<p> These are all unrelated technologies. Trying to, say, read window messages from a MSMQ message queue will get you nowhere. </p>

		<p>So the fix is to rename Microsoft Message Queuing to Multiserver Message Queuing (in order to keep the acronym)?</p>

		<p>&quot;networking technology for allowing multiple computers to communicate with each other by sending and reading messages.&quot;</p>
<p>Man, I love such descriptions. Apparently, it&#39;s something more than just UDP or IRC or mail-lists or pretty much any other network protocol reinvented, but what is it exactly? Apart from it&#39;s new and exciting and allows me to manage my data easily and connect with other people and boost my productivity?</p>
<p>Anyway, using MSMQ to send window messages may be an interesting way to, say, try and reinvent RDP.</p>

		<p>Maybe if you clicked the MSMQ link you&#39;d learn something about its feature set.</p>

		<p>Windows Mobile is dead, baby. Windows Mobile is dead.</p>
<p>But the documentation on MSDN lives on and creeps up sometimes when I hit F1 coding &quot;desktop apps&quot; in Visual Studio. </p>
<p>&#8230; It&#39;s more like a Zombie.</p>

		<p>Even if Windows Mobile is dead, there are definitely a few areas where Windows CE (and its successor Windows Embedded Compact) live on. &nbsp;I have written quite a bit of code using the 3rd type of message queue for the past few years.</p>

		<p>&quot;Windows Azure Service Bus Queues&quot;</p>
<p>Would this be a queue where you wait ages for a message, then three come all at once?</p>
<p>I&#39;ll let myself out.</p>

		<p>Just three? Well, I wouldn&#39;t call it a whole bunch.</p>

		<p>There are worse offenders: &quot;handle&quot;, &quot;handler&quot;, &quot;filter&quot;, &quot;message&quot;, &quot;event&quot;, &quot;lock&quot;, to name a few. And other than &quot;handle&quot;, they&#39;re just as overloaded outside Microsoft&#39;s stuff.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
