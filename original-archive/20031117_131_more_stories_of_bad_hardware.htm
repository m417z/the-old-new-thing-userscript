<p>My favorite bad CD-ROM drive from Windows 95 was one where the manufacturer cut a corner to save probably twenty-five cents.</p>
<p> The specification for CD-ROM controllers indicates that each can host up   to four CD-ROM drives. When you talk to the card, you specify which drive you wish to communicate with. </p>
<p> The manufacturer of a certain brand of controller card decided that listening for the "Which drive?" was too much work, so they ignore the drive select and always return the status of drive 1. So when Windows 95 Plug and Play goes off to detect your CD-ROM drives, it finds four of them. </p>
<p> Apparently this was a popular card because the question came up about once a week. </p>

		<p>Note that it was 25 cents per card, which if they were as popular as you say, would have been a whole lot of cents. Besides who&#8217;s gonna blame the card manufacturer? Because &quot;it&#8217;s that darn Windows thing that finds so many CD-ROMs,&quot; so they got away with it&#8230;<br />
Honestly after starting to read your blog I&#8217;m much more understanding of the MS Windows team and any hmm&#8230;strange behaviour that sometimes occurs (hmm, maybe this is all just a marketing scam to make people less anti-MS).</p>

		<p>I thought it would be simpler to communicate with machines, instead of humans. Well, it is quite difficult to understand and react according to other party, because there are billions of different characters and some have 2 or more characters but they appear they are the same person.</p>
<p>However, Raymond Chen barely and obviously proves that even though we engineers communicate with computers, we come up with the same result; people does not understand, never ever. Should an engineer have to consider another engineer&#8217;s mistake? Or should Microsoft say &quot;Hey! That was your cheap card&#8217;s problem, not mine!&quot;?</p>
<p>&quot;Geopolitics is a sensitive subject&quot;, as Raymond Chen said. That was another story impressed me. I think universities must teach &quot;Human Factor&quot; course to engineers as well. Plus, &quot;Let&#8217;s obey standards&quot; course can be very efficient.</p>

		<p>Microsoft does say &quot;that&#8217;s your cheap card&#8217;s problem!&quot;.  That&#8217;s what happens when you get a blue screen in NT and it says &quot;nv4_disp&quot; or &quot;emu10k1.drv&quot; in big white letters along the top.  Substandard hardware and software is annoying, but it pushes the adoption of more robust technologies in response.  Now we have fully protected memory per-process to protect against userspace faults bringing down the machine, and if I get a kernel fault I can pull public symbols from Microsoft to backtrace the faulty driver.  Another nice benefit of the increased paranoia in modern OSes is that hardware failures are detected more often, such as bad memory.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
