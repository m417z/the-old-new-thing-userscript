I was playing with my niece (three years old at the time of this story),
and she taught me a lot about farm animals.</p>
<ul>
<li>You get eggs from cows and pigs.
</li>
<li>Cow eggs are black and taste like bananas.
</li>
<li>Pig eggs are blue and pink and taste like ice cream.
</li>
<li>Blue pig eggs taste like vanilla.
</li>
<li>Pink pig eggs taste like strawberry.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
According to the
<a href="https://www.internationalegg.com/">
International Egg Commission</a>,
today is
<a href="http://thinkegg.com/index.php/world-egg-day/">World Egg Day</a>.

		<p>To be fair, Minecraft has cow and pig eggs. I don&#39;t think they taste like anything.</p>

		<p>Raymond, I am a grandfather and I absolutely love talking with my granddaughters. &nbsp;I tell all of the guys my age that being a grandfather is the best gig on the planet. &nbsp;They always keep my laughing and help to keep me somewhat young.</p>
<p>Glad to hear that you spend time with the youngers members of your family.</p>

		<p>No, eggs don&#39;t come from cows and pigs! &nbsp;Eggs, especially the chocolate ones, come from bunny rabbits.</p>

		<p>I suppose the next step is to visit an actual farm (or a chocolate factory) in order to test the above series of hypotheses.</p>

		<p>My niece is only 9 months, so not discussing eggs yet; while babysitting two weeks ago, I introduced her to a new toy, the shape sorter (which happened to be shaped like a bus, with six shaped holes in the roof). She immediately discarded the shapes and started dismantling the sorter/bus itself. A future hacker in the making!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
