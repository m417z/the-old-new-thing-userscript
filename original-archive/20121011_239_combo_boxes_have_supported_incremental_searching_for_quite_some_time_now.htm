<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/27/4580767.aspx#4593428">
I promised to post a program the following day</a>
but it appears that I never did.
Oops.
I discovered this as I went through my "things to blog about" pile
and figured better late than never.
Though five years late is pretty bad.
</p>
<p>
Here's a program which fills a combo box with some strings.
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;windowsx.h&gt;

static LPCTSTR rgpszList[] = {
    TEXT("Austria"),

    TEXT("Romania"),
    TEXT("Slovakia"),
    TEXT("Slovenia"),
    TEXT("Spain"),
    TEXT("Sweden"),
    TEXT("United Kingdom"),
};

INT_PTR CALLBACK DlgProc(HWND hdlg, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
    switch (uMsg) {
    case WM_INITDIALOG:
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; ARRAYSIZE(rgpszList); i++) {
            SendDlgItemMessage(hdlg, 100, CB_ADDSTRING, 0,
                               (LPARAM)rgpszList[i]);
        }
        return TRUE;
    case WM_COMMAND:
        if (GET_WM_COMMAND_ID(wParam, lParam) == IDCANCEL) {
            EndDialog(hdlg, 0);
        }
        break;
    }
    return FALSE;
}

int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hinst, HINSTANCE hinstPrev,
                   LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nShowCmd)
{
    DialogBox(hinst, MAKEINTRESOURCE(1), NULL, DlgProc);
    return 0;
}

// scratch.rc
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

1 DIALOG 50, 50, 185, 98
STYLE DS_MODALFRAME | WS_POPUP | WS_CAPTION | WS_DLGFRAME | WS_SYSMENU
BEGIN
    COMBOBOX 100,7,40,150,300,CBS_DROPDOWNLIST | CBS_SORT | WS_VSCROLL
END
</pre>
<p>
Run this program and start typing:
"S"-"L"-"O"-"V"-"E"...
Hey, look, the combo box is performing incremental search and once
you hit the "E", it selected Slovenia, the first item in the list
which begins with the letters S-L-O-V-E.
</p>
<p>
Wait a few seconds, and try it again.
This time, type "S"-"P", and hey look, it selected Spain.
You didn't have to go through all those other "S" countries to get to it.
</p>
<p>
If you hit F4 to open the combo box and then type
"S"-"L"-"O"-"V"-"E",
observe that there is a tiny vertical line that tells you where
you are in the incremental search string.
</p>
<p>
As I noted some time ago,
the incremental search resets after
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/23/8417521.aspx">
four times the double-click time</a>,
or two seconds by default.
</p>
<p>
<b>Note</b>:
The "things to blog about" pile has over 2000 items in it,
so there really isn't much need for a Suggestion Box,
but I open it up once every few years just for show.</p>

		<p>Interesting. For some reason the .NET combo box, which seems to be a simple wrapper around the Win32 combo box didn&#39;t have the behavior, and I went way out of may way to add it.</p>
<p>As it happened, my behavior was better than this behavior anyway, so I&#39;m not interested in trying to hunt it down.</p>
<p>[The &quot;things to blog about&quot; pile has over 2000 items in it&#8230;] Wow long queue.</p>
<p>[I open it up once every few years just for show.] Sure helps your popularity. Personally I wouldn&#39;t have minded seeing a stack of quick/short answers to a bunch of items in the suggestion box again either (you did that once).</p>

		<p>A Reddit AMA for Raymond Chen would be pointless because, as has been demonstrated on this blog, he would not be willing to answer certain questions. &nbsp;Can&#39;t say I blame him, really. &nbsp;Nobody wants to get a chair thrown at them. &nbsp;Perhaps after Mr. Chen retires.</p>

		<p>Reddit has a massive anti-corporate and anti-Microsoft bias. Having a Microsoft employee like Raymond do an AMA would, to use one of Reddit&#39;s favorite memes, effectively be saying &quot;You&#39;re gonna have a bad time.&quot;</p>

		<p>Now that you&#39;ve mentioned the size of your backlog, I&#39;m going to be completely inappropriate and post a question in this comment thread that has bugged me for years:</p>
<p>After opening up the window menu (Alt+Space, or clicking the icon at top-left) and selecting Move, you can not use the mouse to move the window. &nbsp;Moving the mouse moves the cursor around, but not the window. &nbsp;However, if you hit an arrow key, the mouse snaps to the window, and moving the mouse moves the window around.</p>
<p>Why doesn&#39;t the mouse start moving the window around as soon as you go into &quot;move mode&quot;? &nbsp;Why do you have to hit an arrow key first?</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been really curious about the details/history of this behavior for as long as I can remember observing it in Windows, which if memory serves, has been at least a decade and a half.</p>

		<p>@TehShrike: I&#39;m absolutely sure that the move on the context menu exists for the sole purpose of keyboard accessibility. Evey Raymond wasn&#39;t there when the decision was made so long ago but he might be able to confirm.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve tried to set the CBS_SORT style dynamically, according to the need for auto-completion. However, I found out the hard way that setting the CBS_SORT style after the combo box is created doesn&#39;t actually tell the control to start doing auto-completion, even after clearing the contents and adding new strings.</p>
<p>I wish there was a list of what styles are meaningful only at creation time.</p>

		<p>@TehShrike</p>
<p>Probably because the taskbar defaults to the bottom of the screen. So two scenarios:</p>
<p>1) You want to move using the mouse &#8211; so therefore the default position of a window when initiating a move is hanging off the bottom of the screen. Doesn&#39;t sound good.</p>
<p>1) You want to move using the keyboard &#8211; &quot;Aaaargh! Where did my window move to? Oh great it&#39;s all the way over there. I&#39;m using my keyboard to move it, why did it snap across 3 screens to where my mouse is?&quot;</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
