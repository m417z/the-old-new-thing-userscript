		<p>&quot;Gladly, the cross-eyed bear&quot; is what I used to hear too whenever I listened to the hymn &quot;Keep Thou My Way&quot;. I didn&#39;t even know there was a word for this till I went searching for the phrase and came across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mondegreen#In_songs" rel="nofollow" target="_new">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Mondegreen</a> :D</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>Off-topic continuation of my post yesterday ( <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/12/16/10482308.aspx#10484202" rel="nofollow" target="_new">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/10482308.aspx</a> ), couldn&#39;t post there any more, last time Raymond, I promise: Turns out you were absolutely right, the bottom edge of the maximized Firefox window was overlapping the top of the taskbar, and hence Alt+PrtSc captured the latter too. _However_, I have confirmed on 3 other Windows 7 32 and 64-bit PCs with both integrated and external graphics that this seems to be a quirk of Aero Basic. With full Aero enabled the bottom border of the maximized browser window is still as fat and should result in a similar effect, but pressing Alt+PrtSc somehow excludes that top sliver of the taskbar. Looks like Aero Basic is just not as intelligent when it comes to excluding the taskbar from the screenshot, and Intel is not to blame here after all.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>That&#39;s because Aero Basic uses the classical model of painting. Pixels not on screen do not exist. The only pixels on the screen are the ones for the occluding taskbar. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Perhaps the graphics subsystem could have been &quot;intelligent&quot; enough to detect and exclude (or blank out) the overlapped portion of the active window from the screenshot, or maybe there was a technical barrier to this. Anyway thanks a lot Raymond, I really appreciate you taking the time to respond and explain. Now, back to the regular scheduled programming&#8230; :)</p>

		<p>South Frisian?</p>
<p>There&#39;s a North Frisia, but the remainder of Frisia is not commonly called South Frisia (Friesland)&#8230;.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
