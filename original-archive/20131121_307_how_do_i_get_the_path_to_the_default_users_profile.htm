<p>A customer wanted to know how to get the path to the default user's profile. On older versions of Windows, the default location of the default user's profile was <code>C:\<wbr>WINNT\<wbr>Profiles\<wbr>Default</wbr></wbr></wbr></code>. Then it moved to <code>C:\<wbr>Documents and Settings\<wbr>Default User</wbr></wbr></code>. Now it's in <code>C:\<wbr>Users\<wbr>Default</wbr></wbr></code>. And the location may have been <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/12/10/9188555.aspx"> customized</a>, so in principle it could be anywhere.</p>
<p> The function to get the default user profile's directory is is the deviously-named <code>Get&shy;Default&shy;User&shy;Profile&shy;Directory</code>. </p>
<p> But the reason I'm writing this article is not to call your attention to the <code>Get&shy;Default&shy;User&shy;Profile&shy;Directory</code> function, but rather to something in the function documentation. </p>
<p> The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb762277(v=vs.85).aspx"> documentation for the <code>Get&shy;Default&shy;User&shy;Profile&shy;Directory</code> function</a> includes the strings <code>C:\<wbr>Documents and Settings\<wbr>Default User</wbr></wbr></code> and <code>C:\<wbr>Users\<wbr>Default</wbr></wbr></code>, so all somebody had to do was type either of those paths into a search engine scoped to MSDN, and it would have found the function to use. </p>
<p> This sort of counts as a counterexample to the suggestion that in order to help people find the correct function to use (instead of whacking an undocumented registry key), MSDN should include the path to the registry key so that a search for the undocumented registry key will kick up a page that says, "Do not use this registry key. Call this other function instead." That experiment was attempted (inadvertently) with the <code>Get&shy;Default&shy;User&shy;Profile&shy;Directory</code> function, and it didn't work. </p>

		<p>You can&#39;t write (or make) anything idiot-proof. Idiots don&#39;t use to read (or think), and if the user doesn&#39;t read your copy, you have lost before starting. There is no point trying to keep those people. Instead, make messages short, concise and actionable, and documentation clear, and many users will take the time to read it. Alerts (message boxes, task dialogs and the like) are critical.</p>

		<p>Why store the skel^Wdefault user profile in the same place as the actual user profiles? Surely that&#39;s asking for trouble. What if you has a user whose username according to your normal username-assignment policies would be &quot;Default&quot;?</p>
<p>(You might think that&#39;s never going to happen, but I&#39;m sure the company who ended up employing someone with the surname &quot;null&quot;[0] thought something very similar&#8230;)</p>
<p>It would be better to put the default profile in the Windows directory, or somewhere like that, wouldn&#39;t it?</p>

		<p>@Karellen: As others said, Windows copes gracefully with that and always has. Early versions of OS X on the other hand used to blow up spectacularly if you attempted to name your first account the same as a one of the system accounts (such as root). It was &quot;fixed&quot; around 10.2, IIRC, by simply prohibiting those names.</p>

		<p>@Karellen:</p>
<p>As Joshua points out, the system doesn&#39;t just explode if there&#39;s a folder already in the Profiles directory with the name it would normally use. &nbsp;You see this all the time on domains &quot;Administrator&quot; and &quot;Administrator.DOMAIN&quot;. &nbsp;You can even get &quot;Administrator.DOMAIN.001&quot; and so on (corrupted profiles&#8230; :/).</p>
<p>The SO question about Mr. Null is funny (and insightful) though. &nbsp;When I worked at a large university I remember we tried to name our primary backup server &quot;null&quot; since we thought it would be very funny to &quot;backup to (/dev/) null). &nbsp;Unfortunately while the VitalQIP DNS system the university used would accept DNS registration for &quot;null.school.edu&quot;, any attempts to resolve the name would time out (actually, as I later learned from the OIT group, it would actually *crash* the process doing the name lookup on the server!). &nbsp;So I can empathize somewhat with Mr. Null :)</p>

		<p>Hang on &#8211; I&#39;m a bit confused by people making the analogy to the &quot;Administrator&quot; and &quot;root&quot; accounts. Obviously those account names can&#39;t be used for a new user, because there is already an account called &quot;Administrator&quot; or &quot;root&quot; on the system, and you can&#39;t have two accounts with the same name. Same as if there&#39;s already a &quot;jsmith&quot; account, and you get a second &quot;jsmith&quot;. You have to do something else.</p>
<p>But the difference here &#8211; surely &#8211; is that there isn&#39;t a user called &quot;Default&quot; on the system. I thought that the &quot;Default&quot; profile was just a directory to be used as a template for new users, and wasn&#39;t an acutal user. But am I wrong here? Is &quot;Default&quot; an actual user account? Can the user &quot;Default&quot; log in (assuming the account is given a password)? Can the Administrator change the ownership of a file to user &quot;Default&quot;?</p>
<p>(The obvious implication being, that if &quot;Default&quot; is not already an actual account, then you *should* be able to create one.)</p>

<p>Funny, you both interpret same fact completely differently.</p>
<p>Directory name != user name and thus he is right and Windows cope with it gracefully. They let you to use name, while ensuring no conflict. </p>

		<p>To be fair, finding that function by the paths you mention is still non-trivial. These paths are listed on tons of websites, many of which rank better than MSDN (at least on Google). When I searched &quot;C:Documents and SettingsDefault User&quot; the first MSDN result I got was on page 5 &#8211; and it was this very blog post. Searching for &#39;&quot;C:Documents and SettingsDefault User&quot; msdn&#39; is slightly better, that way you at least get this blog post as the first result &#8211; but the official documentation is still not in sight. I have to search for &#39;&quot;C:Documents and SettingsDefault User&quot; msdn api&#39; to get function documentation as the second result in the search. In other words: only now that this blog post is online people have a realistic chance to find function documentation if they search by the paths.</p>

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
