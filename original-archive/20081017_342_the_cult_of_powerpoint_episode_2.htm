<p>PowerPoint is a fine presentation tool, but <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/22/45301.aspx"> some people have elevated it to the level of a cult</a>. The most recent member of the PowerPoint cult was a customer who decided to use PowerPoint in an email message.</p>
<p> No, I don't mean that the customer attached a bad PowerPoint presentation to the email. I mean that the customer's email was itself a three-slide PowerPoint presentation. </p>
<p> Well, not quite. </p>
<p> What they actually did was create a three-slide presentation, then take screenshots of each slide and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/19/8877486.aspx"> embed them in the email</a>. </p>
<p> Well, not quite. </p>
<p> The screenshots were shrunk to save size. Each page from the PowerPoint presentation contained about 50 words of text. Which were very hard to read because the screenshots were shrunk. </p>
<p> The PowerPoint presentation itself was a shortened form of your typical boring PowerPoint slide presentation. The first slide was an introduction to the program they were using. The second slide was a statement of the problem they were having. The third slide was a call to action for Microsoft to assist in determining why the program was having the problem. </p>
<p> Thank goodness it didn't have a concluding "Any questions?" slide. </p>

		<p>PowerPoint was good for its days in the 90s and should long have been rewritten in WPF or native code WPF or Direct3D. Remember it&#8217;s Windows PRESENTATION foundation? StandOut from ERain Inc. gets presentations right.</p>

		<p>This is kind of off-topic, but there&#8217;s a new book on creating good PowerPoint slide shows, written by the designer of Al Gore&#8217;s &quot;An Inconvenient Truth&quot; slide show.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
