An application vendor opened a bug with the product team saying that
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb773712(v=vs.85).aspx">
the
<code>Path&shy;Is&shy;UNC</code>
function</a>
was returning incorrect values in Windows Vista.
Specifically, the
<code>Path&shy;Is&shy;UNC</code>
function was returning <code>FALSE</code>
for strings that begin with <code>\\?\</code>,
whereas Windows XP returned <code>TRUE</code>.
</p>
<p>
The answer is,
"Yes, the <code>Path&shy;Is&shy;UNC</code> function returns
<code>FALSE</code>
for strings that begin with <code>\\?\</code>.
Because they aren't UNCs."
</p>
<p>
There was a bug in the Windows XP version of the
<code>Path&shy;Is&shy;UNC</code> function where it reported that anything
that began with two backslashes was a UNC,
even if it wasn't.
In particular, paths that begin with <code>\\?\</code> are not
UNCs,
unless they happen to begin with <code>\\?\UNC\</code>.
The bug was fixed in Windows Vista so it returned <code>TRUE</code>
only if the <code>\\?\</code> is followed by <code>UNC\</code>.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, the application compatibility team had a ready answer
for this:
The
<a HREF="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc722305(v=ws.10).aspx">
Emulate&shy;Old&shy;Path&shy;Is&shy;UNC</code></a>
compatibility shim returns the <code>Path&shy;Is&shy;UNC</code> function
to its old behavior that is bug-for-bug compatible with Windows XP.</p>

		<p>The compiler should give a warning somehow saying. Look this only for compatibility issues and IT IS A BUG. Use PathIsUNC instead and treat UNCs correctly.</p>

		<p>There is no way for the compiler to know if you are relying on the buggy behavior or not.</p>
<p>But it doesn&#8217;t matter, since the buggy behavior will only be exposed to OLD apps. Windows XP is no longer supported so this is no longer an issue, as any supported new app will be using the fixed function.</p>

		<p>I wish I was as confident. Almost any old CodeProject page is littered with comments asking why it doesn&#8217;t work on a new OS and asking for fixes or even blaming Microsoft for breaking it. People telling each other to turn on compatibility flags (in the installer!) is par for course, or just breaking it in such a way that the OS automatically applies them. In fact, it&#8217;s not just old samples, quite a few new ones rely on old and broken things that the compat team has made work.</p>

		<p>Does the shell ever look at the `supportedOS` entries of an application&#8217;s assembly manifest in order to decide what behavior to emulate? The supportedOS guids were added starting with Windows Vista. The downside of depending on a developer adding those entries to their assembly manifest is that no applications (±1%) do it. So the vast majority of applications would not get the fix for free.</p>
<p>Are there rules about who is, and is not, allowed to alter behavior based on the assembly manifest&#8217;s declared supported operating systems?</p>

		<p>SupportedOS GUIDs are 7+(*1), the Vista GUID let&#8217;s 7 treat it as a Vista app (knows about UAC and DWM etc) although I don&#8217;t think I have seen any documentation about the difference between the Vista GUID and no GUID.</p>

		<p>You already answered yourself when you said only 1% of binaries include a supportedOS entry. The loader (not the shell) may look at it, but with such low usage, it would be really dangerous to use its presence (or, in this case, its absence) to apply a compatibility shim on the fly. On the other hand, if it had been defined in the times of NT 3.1 and its use enforced, it would be safer. When will that time machine be ready, I wonder?</p>

		<p>The shell looks at the exe type in some instances to help out with short paths etc. but those are Win95 era workarounds. In Vista the ImageVersion field in the PE header is compared to 6.0 in some places and will skip compatibility behavior if it is 6.0.</p>

		<p>While I understand the need for compatibility&#8230; I would argue that &#8220;PathIsUNC&#8221; is named for exactly what it does&#8230; if you don&#8217;t want to trust the OS to determine UNC paths, write your own logic instead of asking the OS.</p>
<p>Really, if anything, I would hope (and assume) that the XP bug was fixed in a hotfix, not ignored until the next major OS release.</p>

		<p>I doubt XP was fixed because it didn&#8217;t include the shim framework and would therefore be difficult to provide both the old and busted and new hotness functionality. Line of business app compatibility is the no. 1 priority at Microsoft, if Linux ever becomes popular then they&#8217;ll have to eat a tonne of humble pie.</p>

		<p>Isn&#8217;t this the same sort of bugfix as making `IsBadReadPtr` etc use `VirtualQuery` (instead of trying to access the address, and catching access violations)?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s a case of different teams having different boundaries between &#8220;acceptable bug fixes&#8221; and &#8220;bug fixes that would break compatibility&#8221;.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
