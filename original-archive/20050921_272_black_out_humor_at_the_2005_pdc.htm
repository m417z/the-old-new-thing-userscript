<p> Trying to make light (get it? light?) of the situation, there were quite a few jokes about the power outage at the PDC. The Hands-On Lab was being set up at the time the building went dark. A bunch of us speculated what the technicians must have been thinking when the power went out just as they plugged in a rack of computers... Perhaps in reaction to this, the "Frequently-Used Tasks" section of the Hands-On Labs software included a new task: Cause Power Outage. I of course couldn't resist and clicked on it. "Shame on you!" it roared back at me.</p>

		<p>Gives an entire new meaning to &quot;hands-on&quot;, doesn&#8217;t it? Can you type blind?</p>

		<p>Many years back I worked in the QA dept. of Seagate Software.  We were nearing the end of a developement cycle when we lost power one day.  When the power came back on more than an hour later I jokingly submitted a defect (a 1A &#8211; the highest priority and severity) into the defect tracking system saying the program unexpectedly crashed on me.  For additional details I attached a screen shot, basically an all black bitmap 800&#215;600.</p>
<p>The nerdy things we do to pass the time during power outages. :)<br /></p>

		<p>Funny, I hadn&#8217;t read your other post when I made my &quot;Itanium&quot; comment.  I guess that&#8217;s why the MS  people were making the Itanium joke in the first place.</p>

		<p>Yeah, those power outages are rough.  My Boss&#8217;s friend works a med school as an eye surgury tech.  He has to edit and render the video for the most recent surguries for review.  (I don&#8217;t ask why.)  We had a recent virus scare, and our head IT person freaked out and ordered every computer shut off and not restarted until the new patch installers were in place. (Odd domain system we got here).  The IT crew came late at night, using Security master keys to get into offices (like a plague of locusts the friend said) Shutting off computers without even thinking.  They killed his which was in the middle of a LONG render.  He lost 3 days of work.  Needless to say he was&#8230;erg&#8230;angry.  What&#8217;s worse is the virus only affected Win2k machines, but the order went out to shut them off indescriminately, even though well over half of our machines are XP (or transitioning to XP).  Gotta love a IT team that really doesn&#8217;t understand stuff in hole.  I&#8217;m told that the &quot;shut everything off&quot; order (along with the team of IT locusts) actually caused more problems than the virus did, go figure.</p>
<p>(All names refering this this school have hopefully been removed.)</p>

		<p>I guess an adult blog can specify what you should get your hands on during a blackout ^u^</p>
<p>And now you know what happens when you configure too many power users.</p>

		<p>I was sitting in a training session years ago when some guys were showing how to use Win95.<br />
<br />They showed the new &quot;X&quot; at the top-right and explained it would shut the app down.<br />
<br />They pressed it at which point we had a power outage.<br />
<br />In the dark I heard someone remark : &quot;That&#8217;s some powerful X.  I think I&#8217;ll stick to Alt-F4&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
