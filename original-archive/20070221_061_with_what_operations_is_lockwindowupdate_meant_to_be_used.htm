<!-- backref: what is lockwindowupdate meant to be used? --> As I noted earlier, the intended purpose of <code>LockWindowUpdate</code> can be captured in one word: dragging.</p>
<p> The simplest case of <code>LockWindowUpdate</code> is used by the window manager when you move or resize a window and "Show window contents while dragging" is disabled. When you start the move/size operation, the window manager locks the entire desktop so it can draw the dotted-rectangle feedback without risking interference from another window that happens to intersect the dotted-rectangle. When the move/size operation is complete, the desktop is unlocked, and the world returns to normal. </p>
<p> A common case where an application uses <code>LockWindowUpdate</code> is if it wants to draw a custom image when offering drag feedback. In this case, the application locks <strong>its own window</strong> in order to draw the drag feedback. It then uses the <code>DCX_LOCKWINDOWUPDATE</code> flag to get a DC that it can use to draw the desired feedback, and it doesn't have to worry about the window procedure or any other code in the application accidentally drawing to the feedback window and messing up the drag image. For example, if the application is displaying drag feedback on a list view, and some asynchronous event caused the list view contents to change (say, an item got added), and the drag image just happens to be where the new item is about to appear, you wouldn't want the normal redraw behavior of the listview to overpaint (or worse, merge with) the drag image. </p>
<p> A case where you would want to lock another application's window is if you are dragging an object across the screen. You might do this if you are a program like Spy that has an option to let the user select a window by dragging a "selection gadget" over it. Not only do you have to lock the window the use is selecting so that its own painting won't conflict with your "selection gadget", but also so that it doesn't conflict with the highlight effect you place around that window. </p>
<p> By now, you've probably noticed a common thread to all of these <code>LockWindowUpdate</code> scenarios: They all involve dragging of some sort. Dragging a window caption to move it, dragging the edge of a window to resize it, dragging an item into a window, or dragging an item out of a window. This is not a coincidence. The <code>LockWindowUpdate</code> function was designed with these drag scenarios in mind. Since dragging an item uses the mouse button, and there's only one mouse, you can't have multiple drag operations in progress at once, and therefore, there's no need to lock more than one window for update at a time. The function should perhaps more accurately have been named <code>LockDragWindow</code>. </p>

		<p>We use LockWindowUpdate for avoiding extensive redraw operations when reorganizing child windows/controls in an window. Without it you can see the windows changing position, with it you don&#8217;t and you just go from one layout to the new one without flickering.</p>

		<p>DeferWindowPos is a little bit complicated to use when you have a lot of existing code based on the traditional way of positioning windows.</p>
<p>When building a window you can easily put everything at the right place to begin with and it does not have any visible or slow down effect.</p>
<p>It is more troublesome when you have to handle resizing and you have implemented very specific resizing policies based on WM_SIZE message.</p>
<p>Using LockWindowUpdate is much simpler for these cases without having to rewrite a lot of code.</p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>Could you include a small code example that shows how LockWindowUpdate might be used in conjuctions with ImageList_DragShowNolock, ImageList_DragMove with the added complication of handing scrolling when dragging near the target window border. I&#8217;m sure the ordering is crucial (as it often is) but I just can&#8217;t seem to get it right without flicker and redraw artifacts. :(</p>

		<p>Hi Raymond,</p>
<p>Your first poster queried the assumption about only one mouse, and you added that that assumption is in the win32 programming model. I don&#8217;t believe you have to preface everything you say with &#8220;In the win32 programming model&#8221; at all.</p>
<p>This does however raise an interesting discussion point. There _are_ more than one mouse present on some systems. Some games (kung-fu hustle, for example) encourages more than one mouse. Other applications might do the same.</p>
<p>How does win32 then cope with this? What other assumptions (aside from this one scenario) fails with more than one mouse present in the system? Maybe even more general than that, how does the win32 team go about keeping up with changing assumptions?</p>
<p>Regards,</p>
<p>Pieter</p>

		<p>First off, thank you for taking on LockWindowUpdate(). Learning about DeferWindowPos() was a very nice bonus!</p>
<p>That said, my first thought was &quot;so this is why two mice aren&#8217;t supported&quot;. (meaning they both control the same cursor IIRC)</p>
<p>A couple of years ago, I had two computers on my desk. I operated my main computer with my left hand (I&#8217;m right handed btw) and the other with my right hand. The brain halves won&#8217;t allow this to work asynchronously (atleast mine won&#8217;t), but you can sort of fake it, and on larger monitors you should be able to shave off some time (move the closest mouse cursor).</p>
<p>I.e. it&#8217;s not entirely a bad idea&#8230; Specially not on three+ monitor systems&#8230; (granted, you never argued it was a bad idea, I&#8217;m just offering some input for future topics)</p>

		<p>In case you don&#8217;t have a spare mouse on hand&#8230; there&#8217;s still only one cursor, and both mice would control it.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s an interesting program called GlovePIE somewhere out there which allows you to map keys, mouse buttons and movements, joystick axis and buttons, etc etc etc to each other. &nbsp;One of the interesting features is it can create additional fake mouse pointers which you can map to things. &nbsp;Of course the fake pointers don&#8217;t work 100% (I believe they only send fake window messages) but it&#8217;s still interesting to experiment with.</p>

		<p>LockWindowUpdate就是专门设计用于这些拖拽场景的。由于拖拽对象要用到鼠标按键，而只会有一个鼠标，故而同一时间不会有多个拖拽操作进行。因此，没有必要同时锁定多个窗口的更新。也许这个函数应当更准确的命名为LockDragWindow。</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
