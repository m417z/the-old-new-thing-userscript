<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/14/466532.aspx"> Typo patrol</a> got off to a very quick start. One of the flyers in the attendee goodie bag is from a company which offers two free months of service to PDC attendees. The first step in obtaining the service is "Just signup and mention the PDC by January 31, 2008."</p>
<p> Okay, just hang on while I fire up my time machine. </p>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/09/12/750575.aspx">Bonus grammar typo</a>: <i>signup</i> is a noun; <i>sign up</i> is a verb. </p>
<p> The second typo is kind of important. In all the PDC documents (including the voucher to pick up your attendee goodie bag), it says to go to Kentia Hall. This is incorrect. If you try, you'll find a locked door. The goodie bags (and all other Kentia-related services) are actually in Parking&nbsp;B, which is next to the south entrance to Kentia Hall. </p>
<p> Other PDC 2008 notes: </p>
<ul>
<li>The badge colors are     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/30/475690.aspx">     the same as they were in 2005</a>. </li>
<li>My talk is scheduled for Wednesday at 3:00pm in room 406A.     I will be available in the Windows&nbsp;7 lounge after the talk,     where I will remain untl Ask the Experts begins,     at which point I will move to the Windows&nbsp;7 Ask the Experts table.     I will also be in the lounge on Thursday morning until noon.     And if you see me wandering around the PDC or just sitting at a table     pretendng to do work, feel free to come up and introduce yourself.     You're not interrupting anything.     (If I didn't want to be interrupted, I wouldn't be out on the floor!) </li>
<li>I stopped by the     <a href="http://www.geekswithblogs.net">Geeks with Blogs</a> booth     since I subscribe to their master feed just to see what everybody     is chattering about. </li>
<li>In the Speaker Prep room, there's a monitor showing real-time     speaker feedback statistics as the results are counted,     complete with trend lines (ooh, everybody loves Anders)     and attendee comments (uh-oh, technical problems with Bob's talk     really hurt him).     It's oddly fascinating for about 30 seconds. </li>
<li>It may be due to language problems, it may be due to poor     training, or it could just be laziness,     but Microsoft's attempt to reduce the environmental impact     of the conference has not been a rousing success when it comes     to waste diversion:     The compost bins are littered with glass and plastic waste.     Glass bottles, plastic bottles, and milk cartons go     into the container recycling bin;     plastic waste goes into the trash.     We've been doing this in Redmond for quite some time,     so it's frustrating seeing people get it wrong and spoiling     the entire batch. </li>
<li>I learned of a new species of animal:     The <i>Overflow Room Vulture</i>.     These are people who don't decide ahead of time what talks     they will attend,     but rather hang around near the overflow rooms     and attend whatever talk shows up there.     The theory is that if a talk overflows,     it must be pretty good!     (Of course, this assumption is not always correct.     Talks which the organizers know are going to be popular     are assigned larger rooms.     An overflow indicates that demand was higher than expected;     it's a relative measure, not an absolute one.) </li>

		<p>&quot;signup&quot; irks me as much as it irks you, and yet &#8230; I think it&#8217;s a losing battle. &nbsp;Languages change, and I am pretty sure in 50 years &quot;signup&quot; (and many other single words that you and I think should be two words) will be standard; and you and I, if we insist on keeping them separate, will simply be anachronisms.</p>

		<p>The overflow room vulture strategy is exactly the same as used by peahens selecting a mate. &nbsp;The peacocks all parade with a good condition tail indicating they are disease free and sufficiently good specimens to keep the tail in shape.</p>
<p>A few peahens start selecting who they think is the best specimen. &nbsp;The remaining peahens then use the simple strategy of picking the same peacock some other peahen has chosen. &nbsp;(And then the remaining peacocks go home empty handed.)</p>
<p>Picking the same partner as someone else has chosen is a very effective strategy. &nbsp; It is somewhat analogous to voting.</p>
<p>In the computer world we see the same thing. &nbsp;People borrow code from examples that are popular with others often not even looking at anything else. &nbsp;(Why yes all my programs did start out as Petzold&#8217;s :-)</p>

		<p>Ah yes, the compost bins. Meeting at Microsoft in one of the new conference rooms with all the Windows Embedded and Windows Mobile gadgets, and we were served lunch. When I went to put the plate away, there were 4 bins &#8211; garbage, recyclables, compost and something else. </p>
<p>The compost bin said &#8220;compost&#8221; and had pictures of the utensils, which confused me, since they seemed like&#8230; normal plastic utensils. Eventually I just went down the line, glass here, cans there, fork/knife/spoon in the compost bin, and the napkin in the garbage (I think the plate was compostable, too).</p>
<p>I later learned the forks and spoons, as long as they were Microsoft Fork, Microsoft Spoon, etc, were corn based.</p>
<p>But it was confusing for a bit, and while I had time to figure out the system, I&#8217;m guessing the others don&#8217;t, or are just plain confused. Maybe some text rather than illustrations, and maybe some prior warning &#8211; either in the attendee materials (printed/electronic/whatever), or a short presentation on how Microsoft is going green. Not quite PDC related, but useful and sometimes the oddball presentations stick around and may encourage others to do the same.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
