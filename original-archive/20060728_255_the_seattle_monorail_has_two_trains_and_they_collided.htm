<p> Murphy's Law vindicated again. The Seattle Monorail has two trains, and last year they managed to collide. To get this to happen was particularly tricky, since the trains run on separate tracks, and there is only one spot on the entire line where a collision could occur&mdash;and they found it. You can read about it in <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=1349104"> this Associated Press article that describes the monorail as a "mile-high, 43-year-old elevated line"</a>. Wow, a mile high. Those must've been really long ladders to get people down. </p>
<p> It was supposed to resume operation a few weeks ago, but <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003135205_webmono18.html"> the reopening was delayed due to a glitch in the emergency-braking system</a>. We can't get anything right around here. </p>

		<p>Reminds me of the first automobile collision&#8211;where there was only a handful of cars in the world&#8211;and two cars collided in, of all places, St. Louis.</p>
<p>Or, at least that&#8217;s how the myth goes; I&#8217;ve never bothered to confirm.</p>

		<p>You can just imagine after driving the monorail 43 years without incident does breed a certain amount of nonchalance. I wonder if they had a contingency in place for two monorail trains on independant tracks ever colliding? </p>
<p>Although I just can&#8217;t stop thinking about Lyle Lanley in his straw boater! &quot;Well sir, there&#8217;s nothing on earth like a genuine, bona fide, electrified, six-car, Monorail!&quot;</p>

		<p>What I could not easily find was an actual height for the Monorail tracks. &nbsp;Based on a picture I saw on Wikipedia I&#8217;d guess their only about 30 feet high. &nbsp;(There was a person standing next to a pole and guessed that it was 5X his roughly 6 foot height.) &nbsp;But that&#8217;s just a guess. &nbsp;that doesn&#8217;t seem high enough though especially going over roads.</p>

		<p>It looks like a typo in the article, it&#8217;s actually 1 mile long not 1 mile high.<br />

		<p>Wow &#8211; &nbsp;I don&#8217;t exactly know why, but the intersection between this and the sites normal content somehow feels &#8216;just right&#8217;</p>
<p>That said, there&#8217;s one glaring error in the article that can be resolved using an approximation of that hypothetical web site you mention. Specificall, given that Seattle is (roughly) at sea level and the tallest structure we&#8217;ve ever managed to make is 629m (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World</a>&#8216;s_tallest_structures#Tallest_structures), it&#8217;s unlikely that anywhere on those tracks is 1 mile high, either above ground, or just from sea level</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s an old &quot;Far Side&quot; cartoon titled &quot;Dinosaur cranial capacity&quot;. &nbsp;It depicts a vast emptiness, but for one lone tree in the foreground. &nbsp;A stegosaurus begins wandering aimlessly in the background, veering here and there, and when it arrives in the foreground it bonks its head on the lone tree.</p>

		<p>Actually, that Far Side comment reminded me of the Tree of Tenere (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_Tenere" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_of_Tenere</a>). </p>
<p>There was once an acacia forest in the Tenere region of the Sahara, but desertification had wiped killed all of them except for this one tree &#8211; the only tree within 400km. In &#8217;73 a drunken truck driver managed to plow into it and knock it over.</p>

		<p>I can one-up this particular bizarre monorail accident. :)</p>
<p>The Schwebebahn in Wuppertal, Germany is a sort of up-side-down monorail (the cars hang from the rail instead of ride above it). In 1950 a baby elephant named Tuffi was brought on the train as a publicity stunt. It didn&#8217;t like it and jumped from the train into the river Wupper below.</p>
<p>I know this because I have relatives living in Wuppertal. :)</p>

		<p>You should try London. This morning I was deplayed on my journey to work because of a defective *heater* on a train. In what is probably the hottest summer here for 30 years. It&#8217;s actually fine by me if the heaters aren&#8217;t working at the moment.</p>

		<p>I just saw a picture of the accident thanks to Wendy&#8217;s flikr link, and the only thing I can say is&#8230;. WTF??!? What were the engineers smoking when they put the tracks *that* close together? It&#8217;s not like there isn&#8217;t an abundance of room right at that location&#8230;. they could have, you know, placed the tracks a few feet further apart. </p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>If only there were a way to search the Internet for information about the accident.

		<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be surprising if you think about it. First of all, clearly, a one-car monorail system cannot have a collision with another car. And a collision would necessarily occur at that point which it occured, because there isn&#8217;t any other place for the monorails to collide. In fact, one could say that with less places to collide, the probability of a collision in general is greater due to lack of practice, and complacency.</p>
<p>Really, it&#8217;s as surprising that they hit each other than, say, the doors going nuts and decapitating somebody (which would have to occur at one of the two stations).</p>

		<p>Maurits,</p>
<p>Sure, just happened Friday. &nbsp;Going over a hill one of the couplings gave way and the engine and one car kept going while the other two picked up speed and crashed in to the back of the first. &nbsp;Of course, these are model trains but they show how it could occur.</p>

		<p>Monorails, they&#8217;re so faux future. Here in Sydney walking by the monorail at night in the rain is just like being in Bladerunner &#8212; pretty cool if you&#8217;re into the sci-fi thing.</p>
<p>[The Sydney monorail runs in one direction (lucky, cause it&#8217;s a small loop) and I think they have about 5 trains going at once. To take the trains on and off they have around 6 parallel tracks at one spot &#8212; the main track can slide out of the circuit to let trains park on the parallels. It&#8217;s pretty nifty.]</p>

		<p>Hm. &nbsp;One accident in 43 years, huh? &nbsp;Talk about &quot;unsafe at any speed.&quot; &nbsp;I mean, I guess I&#8217;ll just have to buy tickets for the projected next accident in&#8230; 2049?</p>
<p>steveg: Perhaps monorails are &quot;faux future.&quot; I wouldn&#8217;t know, they seem much more tangible than storytelling about the future (any medium). From a transportation standpoint, there are pretty much only two ways to get a railbed out of suface traffic &#8212; dig, or elevate. &nbsp;Isn&#8217;t it *amazing* the market has, to date, preferred the one that makes more money for big-ticket construction companies, rather than the one that returns the most bang for the buck for the customer (ie, the passengers)?</p>

<p>Hm &#8211; *surface* rail is probably cheaper, but not out of the way of other ground traffic; as soon as you start digging tunnels, I suspect the price tag is far greater.</p>

		<p>Is there something about the Seattle area that causes unusual engineering mishaps? &nbsp;You already have the Tacoma Narrows bridge and that stadium that collapsed during construction, now this? &nbsp;</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t understand why the city of Seattle don&#8217;t expand the Monorail system to cover the citys mass transit problems. The Monorail has been doing a good job with the short line they aready run.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
