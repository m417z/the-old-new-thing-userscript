<p> I dreamed that I was asked to develop a hill-avoiding bike route from my childhood home. Along the way, I rode through a daycare playroom (twice, due to a spiral path), met Madonna, the ghost of Alec Baldwin's wife, a team from <i>The Amazing Race</i> trying to figure out which PATH train goes to Grand Central (trick question!) and waited for the next train with a supervillain who demonstrated his powers by using his stretchy arms to punch one of my colleagues who was standing ten feet away and who electrocuted another colleague's pacemaker by force of will. </p>
<p> Yes, I know that Alec Baldwin is not a widower, and my colleague does not have a pacemaker, but I guess my subconscious doesn't care. </p>

		<p>If the path spirals so as to pass through the playroom twice, but has no hills, then that means it has to cross itself, and then there&#39;s a possibility that two riders would collide. &nbsp;I&#39;m afraid we&#39;re going to have to dock points for this design flaw.</p>

		<p>Technically Raymond, the PATH goes *near* Penn Station, not directly into it. &nbsp;You have to get up the street level and walk over a block.</p>

		<p>@Joe: Not neccessarily :) It could pass through the playroom, soiral inwards, missing the playroom entirely, then twist around into an outward spiral going &#39;parallel&#39; to the first spiral and pass through the playroom a second time.</p>
<p>Might be &nbsp;a bit far fetched but it&#39;s early in the morning because of &#39;summertime&#39; and I&#39;m not entirely sure I am awake.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
