And then round about question 5 it would dawn on them  that this was the interview.  I could hear the quick catch in their speech as it hit them,  and the sick pause as they thought back over how they'd been behaving  for the past several minutes.  It was the attempts at damage control that I really found hilarious.  Suddenly, we were best pals.  They almost always thought that using my first name  as much as possible might somehow make up for their earlier suggestion  that I make it snappy.  Too late, Mr. Jenkins.

		<p>Hm, I guess plain old manners &amp; being polite to strangers has disappeared.</p>
<p>Also, when I was starting out, it was a fact that the administrative secretary held all the power and the VP she worked for was just a rubber stamp. You were ALWAYS nice to the secretary, and in return she remembered the time you helped her with the computer or ran a package to someone on your way back to your desk.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you were short or snobby with her, she could make sure your application for a raise or permission for a project stayed right in her in-basket, or that Mr. VP was always Very Busy Right Now.</p>
<p>Besides you never know who you&#8217;re going to end up talking to on the phone. I&#8217;ve discovered to my shock that I&#8217;ve been talking to the company president, department head, executive VP, etc that just happened to be standing by a ringing phone, and been thankful my parents taught me manners.</p>

		<p>I used to work summer jobs town a beach kiosk in a local town, selling things from cups of tea to sandwiches, sweets, burgers and ice creams.  It&#8217;s amazing how rude and annoying some customers can be.  It can be very demoralising, too.  It really does give you some perspective being on the other side of the counter.  So please, remember your pleases and thank yous, it really does make that much of a difference.</p>

		<p>Everybody should be polite and remember their manners. Of course. We&#8217;d all be much happier.</p>
<p>But for heaven&#8217;s sake.</p>
<p>Why is it necessary to subject job applicants to humiliation and trickery like this? In most cases, looking for a job sucks enough without the employer going out of its way to make it worse.</p>
<p>Ali Davis sounds like an awesome woman. Assuming she wrote that article herself, she ought to be making a living writing. It was darn good! And I can understand using a screening service like that in cases where you&#8217;re likely to get mass applications and a lot of the qualifications are as straightforward as whether you have the proper drivers&#8217; license.</p>
<p>But not for technical, managerial, or professional positions. You&#8217;d think the real employer would find it to their advantage to take every opportunity for firsthand evaluation. Even if it&#8217;s just reading resumes. Subjective impressions matter, and it&#8217;s stupid to put that in the hands of a disinterested third party.</p>
<p>I do understand the paradigm of the influential secretary. However, the secretarial profession ain&#8217;t what it used to be. If your prospective boss is high enough in the company to rate an executive secretary, then he REALLY shouldn&#8217;t be outsourcing his hiring decisions!</p>
<p>Otherwise, well, we live in a ridiculously automated, call-centered, telemarketed world where we are frequently misled and manipulated by people on the telephone. Rudeness is never good, but neither is trickery, and it&#8217;s not entirely unreasonable to get exasperated with telephone inquisitions. I have had it, for example, with calling companies who, as soon as they answer, want your phone number and address so they can open a contact screen on you, when maybe all I want to know is how late they&#8217;re open tonight. </p>
<p>To be eliminated from consideration for a professional job for something like that makes my stomach churn.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
