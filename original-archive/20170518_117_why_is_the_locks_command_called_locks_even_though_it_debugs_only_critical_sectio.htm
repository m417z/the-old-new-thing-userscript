Commenter DWalker07 notes that the <code>!locks</code>
command is called
<code>!locks</code>
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170301-00/?p=95615#comment-1286845">
even though it doesn't actually debug
all types of locks</a>,
only critical sections.
Why the bad name?
</p>
<p>
Because at the time it was written,
critical sections were the only types of user-mode locks.
</p>
<p>
In the original incarnation of Win32,
there were semaphores and mutexes and other kernel-mode
synchronization objects,
but the only user-mode synchronization objects
were critical sections.
Seeing as they were the only type of synchronization
objects available in user mode,
they were informally referred to as "locks" because
when you have only one kind of thing,
you don't really worry too much about being specific.
</p>
<p>
If there's only kind of wristwatch,
then you don't really bother being specific
about the fact that it's a spring-wound analog-readout time-only watch.
You just call it a watch.
Of course, later,
when battery-powered digital-readout smart watches
become commonplace,
your old documents that talk about "watches" may seem confusing.
"Why do these instructions for troubleshooting watches
not work for my battery-powered digital-readout smart watch?"
</p>
<p>
Indeed, for a very long time, critical sections were the only
user-mode synchronization objects that came with Win32.
It wasn't until Windows Vista that a whole bunch of new
user-mode synchronization objects became available,
things like
slim reader-writer locks,
condition variables,
and one-time initialization.
Until then, the word "lock" 
was sufficient.</p>

		<p>What additional information were you looking for? The subject of the post is &#8220;why is the !locks command called !locks even though it only does critical sections?&#8221; and the answer is &#8220;they were the only type of user-mode locks around when it was named.&#8221; There&#8217;s a bit of discussion to flesh it out, and some supplemental information; there doesn&#8217;t seem to be anything more to add.</p>

		<p>When I first read the article, it stopped with <i>Until then, the word &#8220;lock&#8221;</i>. More words appeared later.</p>

		<p>Which reminds me, do &#8220;fat&#8221; reader-writer locks exist? Stuff that can have one writer at a time, but uses regular kernel object handles that can be waited on with WaitForMultipleObjects? I searched a bit, but haven&#8217;t found any&#8230;</p>

		<p>LockFileEx? But you need to use LockFileEx again to wait, not WaitForMultipleObjects, and also no timeout, and who knows if CancelIoEx will work.</p>

		<p>Even if there were, WaitForSingleObject() won&#8217;t cut it since there is no exclusive/shared semantics.</p>
<p>Consider creating a bunch of mutexes. Reader acquires one mutex according to some hash of current cpu, tid, whatever. Writer acquires all in some well-defined order.</p>

		<p>You could carry out the sequence to construct Reader-Writer from semaphore, use the kernel Semaphore, then unwrap the logic so you can use WaitForMultipleObjects.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
