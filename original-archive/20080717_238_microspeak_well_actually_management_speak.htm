<p> Wow, let's look at the first stated purpose. It goes on for so long and uses blatant management-speak such as "facilitate" and "leverage" that by the time it's over, I forget how the sentence started. Going back and reading it again, it appears that the first item is identical to the second! It's just that the first item says it in a more confusing way. </p>
<p> The second item shows evidence of management wordsmithing as well. "Utilize" instead of "use". An action verb like "establish" rather than a state verb like "to be". And those changes actually render the sentence incorrect. The purpose of the site isn't to "establish" a library; the purpose of the site is to <u>be</u> that library. Establishing the library is what you did when you created the site in the first place! That purpose has already been completed. </p>
<p> I think the people who built this Web site just copied their annual review goals into the Web site text, forgetting that the review goal describes what <i>you</i> are supposed to do, not what the thing you created is supposed to do. </p>
<p> Here's how I would have written it: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> This Web site is a library of X materials. </p>

		<p>What is your carrier goal Ray&#8230; With out these wording you will not reach next levels.. I am not sure of Microsoft though, if a senior manager without any of these fancy sentences, survives with only his technical knowledge.</p>
<p>Reminds me of a Senior Manager of Microsoft (Vista SP1 team) whom I contacted for an issue I faced after installing Vista after MS Support closed the case as unresolved. I was expecting some sort of technical suggestions or at least a will to ask for my system details where the issue occurred, instead he spent time to search tigerdirect.com suggesting how I can use 20$ USB HDD enclosure to backup my HDD in different machine and going for entire 160GB wipeout. Ofcourse he used similar wordings.. very fancy..</p>

		<p>The two purposes might be different: #1 could mean that they&#8217;re going to have some documents with text that say things like &quot;write code clearly&quot;, and #2 could be a code repository.</p>
<p>That said, it&#8217;d be a lot easier to tell whether they&#8217;re different if they had decided not to obfuscate.</p>

		<p>In their defense, there are 2 separate goals:</p>
<p>1) Be a library of X materials.</p>
<p>2) That people actually use said library. &nbsp;Otherwise, how can it promote best practices, re-use of material, consistent look and feel, yada yada yada</p>

		<p>My manager asked me &quot;Have you thought about project X?&quot;</p>
<p>I replied &quot;Yes, I&#8217;ve written down the things I think we need to do, here they are.&quot;</p>
<p>In a later meeting he said regarding project X &quot;We&#8217;ve come up with a seven point action plan.&quot;</p>

		<p>To quote more accurate Microspeak, you must also include the extraordinary number of internal acronyms to which we are subjected, i.e &nbsp;&quot;Create a reference source (best practices) where TSPs,SSPs,PAMs or PSAs who are engaged with our EPG or SMS&amp;P teams can learn how to plan/facilitate and leverage their X activities around the WSSMM vision documents most effectively.&quot;</p>

		<p>@ScottB: &quot;obfuscate&quot; is a geek-speak word that is &quot;utilized&quot; way too often. Whatever happened to good old &quot;obscure&quot;? The latter is only ever used to explain what former means. Of course, it&#8217;s not quite as bad as the adjective form: &quot;obfuscatory&quot;. Sorry for being obtuse.</p>

		<p>I interviewed for a somewhat interesting team in Microsoft. What turned me off was the obvious waste of money going into management. I was offered two positions, but chose neither.</p>
<p>Microsoft needs to get back to being developer focused. All these frickin managers are going to drive you into the ground.</p>

		<p>mvadu, your comment disturbs me, though I think it&#8217;s correct.</p>
<p>Why should we need to obfuscate language to be promoted based on technical merit? The world would be a much better place if it were a true meritocracy.</p>

		<p>MadQ, &quot;obfuscate&quot; and &quot;obscure&quot; have different connotations for me. To &quot;obfuscate&quot; to something is to make something complex while leaving it in plain sight. To &quot;obscure&quot; something is to disguise it, to make it blend into the background.</p>
<p>Or, obfuscate is to obscure as encryption is stenography.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d like to cast my vote for:</p>
<p>&nbsp; X</p>
<p>Succinct, complete. Everyone understands what it is about &#8211; if it is seeded with papers/articles etc. about X, people will understand it is a library. If it has a blog, people will understand that the blog is about news about X. If it has a forum, people will understand they can discuss X there.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
