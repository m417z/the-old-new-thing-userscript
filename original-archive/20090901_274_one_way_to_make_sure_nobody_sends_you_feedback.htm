<p>Last year, somebody sent out a message to very large group of people describing a change to, well, what it described isn't important to the story. What's important is that the message ended with the following sentence:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> If you have questions, please send them to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.commailto:abcdf">abcdef</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> If you don't see why this was a brilliant move, go back and check what that "abcdef" link really does. </p>
<p> One of my cynical colleagues noted, "Maybe this was intentional. That way, when they get no feedback, they can say, 'See, this was an awesome decision. Nobody complained!'" </p>

		<p>Maybe they thought it work automagically with the combination of Outlook and Active Directory. &nbsp;It seems Outlook just treats that as an email address and doesn&#8217;t do anything special with it.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s unfortunately fairly common for web sites to not have any real means of contacting them except via a web form. It&#8217;s also unfortunately fairly common for feedback web forms to be broken. Combining the two leaves no way to contact the owner of the site.</p>

		<p>John, depending on the enviroment, it might. In my envirmoment, an internal link that says mailto:Mark would indeed email me.</p>
<p>Except&#8230; it&#8217;s mispelled. The link should be for abcdEf, the mailto is to abcdf.</p>
<p>Or, in may case, while mailto:Mark works, mailto:Mrk does not.</p>

		<p>I suspect this may have been the e-mail editor&#8217;s fault. &nbsp;Imagine they typed in <a href="mailto:abcdf@example.com">abcdf@example.com</a> and it was automatically turned into a link. &nbsp;They realized their mistake and edited it to read <a href="mailto:abcdef@example.com">abcdef@example.com</a>. &nbsp;This may not have updated the underlying hyperlink, however.</p>
<p>If it was done manually with a mailto:abcdf hyperlink, that&#8217;s another story.</p>

		<p>@AndyL: there are a few ways to contact Raymond.</p>
<p>1) Know him personally</p>
<p>2) Know him professionally</p>
<p>Or, my favorite,</p>
<p>3) Get your friend at Microsoft to contact him on your behalf.</p>
<p>(Microsoft&#8217;s big enough that you should know someone there &#8211; at the very worst, through a few degrees of separation).</p>

		<p>Several of my colleagues have manually copied their Outlook signatures from each other, which means that they have mailto links pointing to &quot;firstname.lastname@company.nl&quot;.</p>
<p>But then I can&#8217;t see the point in putting your email address at the bottom of an, uh, email message.</p>

		<p>The oft stated reason for including your e-mail address in your signature is for when your e-mail is forwarded.</p>
<p>For example, when my e-mail is fowarded, the new person sees my address as &quot;Mark, TheOther&quot;. The address in my signature, however, is intact.</p>
<p>However, Corporate Policy also dictates that I only add my signature to &quot;New&quot; e-mails, so that only works if I started the e-mail chain that got forwarded&#8230;</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  The oft stated reason for including your e-mail address in your signature is for when your e-mail is forwarded.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words, fixing a feature with a feature.</p>
<p>In days of old, email UIs used to show actual email addresses (possibly alongside a comment that gave a real-world name).</p>
<p>But that was obviously too useful, so it had to be done away with.</p>
<p>So now that the email software pretends it doesn&#8217;t know email addresses, the users of the email software have to make up the deficiency.</p>

		<p>I once sent a mail to whole the team and it ended with the phrase</p>
<p>&quot;If you have any questions, please do hesitate to ask&quot;</p>
<p>So a colleague wrote back and said</p>
<p>&quot;You mean do NOT hesitate to ask! :)&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
