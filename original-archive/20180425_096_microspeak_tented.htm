Here's a citation for the Microspeak term <i>tented</i>
from
<a HREF="https://careers.microsoft.com/jobdetails.aspx?jid=325644">
an old Microsoft job listing</a> that is no longer available,
maybe because the
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150317-00/?p=44453">
req</a> has been filled.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
You and your team will decide
how the Office clients and services
measure their success in performance sensitive areas like latency,
memory/disk footprint, and battery life
not only for the devices of today but also on the
evolving ecosystem of hardware including new,
<i>tented</i> devices that Microsoft is building. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What is a "tented device"?
</p>
<p>
No it's not
<a HREF="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2012/11/a-good-ultrabook-a-bad-tablet-the-lenovo-ideapad-yoga-13-review/">
a two-in-one laptop in the tent configuration</a>.
</p>
<p>
It's also not
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/the_power_of_software/2008/09/19/intense-computing-or-in-tents-computing/">
a data center in a tent</a>.
</p>
<p>
The term started in Windows 8.
The hardware team was developing some new hardware devices.
One was a tablet that would run Windows on an ARM processor.
(That device would eventually be marketed under the name
<a HREF="https://www.engadget.com/2012/10/16/microsoft-surface-behind-the-scenes/">
<i>Surface RT</i></a>.)
Another was a tablet that would run Windows on a desktop-class processor.
(That device was marketed
under the name <i>Surface Pro</i>.)
</p>
<p>
These were top secret projects, with access very tightly controlled.
They were so top secret that
you weren't even allowed to say the product code names
in the presence of people who weren't cleared for access,
because the mere act of saying a code name discloses the fact
that the project <i>exists at all</i>.
The code phrase for saying that somebody has been cleared
for access to the top secret projects was <i>in the tent</i>.
If you wanted to know whether it was okay to discuss
the top secret projects with Alice,
you would ask whether Alice was <i>in the tent</i>.
</p>
<p>
This phrase <i>in the tent</i> had some catchiness to it,
so people started applying it to any case where there was a
top secret project.
And since all cool words get verbed eventually,
the term <i>in the tent</i> led to the verb <i>tented</i>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>"Is Alice tented for project X?" =
    "Has Alice been granted access to information about project X?"
    which basically boils down to
    "Is it okay to discuss project X with Alice?"</li>
<li>"This relates to a tented project." =
    "This related to a project for which access to any information
    is tightly restricted."</li>
<li>"This is a feature for a tented device." =
    "This is a feature for a device for which access to any information
    is tightly restricted."</li>
</ul>
<p>
Few projects rise to this level of secrecy,
but in case you have one,
there's a Microspeak term to describe it.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
Some years later,
I learned that the concept of being "in the tent" is recursive:
There are
<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtles_all_the_way_down">
tents inside tents</a>!
Even though you are tented for some project X,
there may be a part of that project that is double-top-secret,
and you need to be tented for that part of the project to know
about it.</p>

		<p>You likely wouldn&#8217;t bring the whole public into the tent &#8212; it would have to be a VERY big tent!  You could just dismantle (or drop) the tent itself, and then everyone can see what the tent used to cover.</p>

		<p>So how do you ask if someone is in the tent now? I mean, just saying &#8220;Are you in the tent?&#8221; should result in them saying &#8220;which tent? I&#8217;m in *a* tent, but are you in that tent? Or are you in a different tent that I shouldn&#8217;t hear about?&#8221; Obviously you can&#8217;t use the code name to specify which tent you&#8217;re asking about. Gotta love when making something general makes it useless.</p>

		<p>There are internal tools that show you who is in the tent(s) with you and you can only see the tents that you know about.  (You can&#8217;t go spelunking around to find stuff.)</p>
<p>For example, I can see who else is in the &#8220;No Homer&#8217;s&#8221; tent and I know that guy in sector 7g isn&#8217;t in it.</p>

		<p>I had this exact thought. Once you have more than one tent, you can no longer ask someone directly about their tent status, and you can not ask about a third party&#8217;s tent status with anyone you don&#8217;t already know is in the tent you are interested in.</p>

		<p>You clearly cannot ask someone, &#8220;Are <b>you</b> in the tent?&#8221;, because that person will just say &#8220;Sure!&#8221; In the old days, the only way to know was to ask the tent membership administrator, &#8220;Is Alice in the tent?&#8221; As ᵂᴬᴿᴿᴲᴺ noted, there are now internal tools that let you see who are in the tents you&#8217;re already in.</p>

		<p>When the concept was introduced, you weren&#8217;t even supposed to reveal the existence of a tent. It seems that that rule has been relaxed, seeing as we talk about it in public job listings now!</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s clever for those Surface type devices because Windows 8 and 10 also run in touch mode on things like the Yoga. Which when it is folded back makes a little tent.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
