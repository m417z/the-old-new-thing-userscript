<p>I am watching the continuing battle between Facebook and Facebook spammers with detached amusement. When I see a spam link posted to a friend's Facebook wall, I like to go and figure out how they got fooled. Internet Explorer's InPrivate Browsing comes in handy here, because I can switch to InPrivate mode before visiting the site, so that the site can't actually cause any harm to my Facebook account since I'm not logged in and it doesn't know how to log me in.</p>
<p> The early versions were simply Web pages that hosted an embedded YouTube video, but they placed an invisible "Like" button over the playback controls, so that any attempt to play the video resulted in a Like being posted to your wall. </p>
<p> Another early version of Facebook spam pages sent you to a page with an embedded YouTube video, but they also ran script that monitored your mouse position and positioned a 1&times;1 pixel Like button under it. That way, no matter where you clicked, you clicked on the Like button. </p>
<p> A more recent variant is one that displayed a simple math problem and asked you to enter the answer. The excuse for this is that it is to "slow down robots", but really, that answer box is a disguised Facebook comment box. You can see the people who fell for this because their Facebook wall consists of a link to the page with the comment "7". </p>
<p> My favorite one is a spam page that said, "In order to see the video, copy this text and paste it into your Address bar." The text was, of course, some script that injected code into the page so it could run around sending messages to all your Facebook friends. The kicker was that the script being injected was called <code>owned.js</code>. (The spam was so unsophisticated, it made you copy the text yourself! Not like <a href="http://research.zscaler.com/2011/05/yet-another-facebook-scam-you-look-so.html"> this one</a> which puts the attack string on your clipboard automatically.) </p>
<p> I started to think, "Who could possibly fall for this?" And then I realized that the answer is "There will always be people who will fall for this." These are the people who would fall for the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/09/20/5002739.aspx#5023190"> honor system virus</a>. </p>
<p> <b>Update</b>: On May 20, I saw a new variant. This one puts up a fake Youtube [sic] "security" dialog that says, "To comply with our Anti-SPAM&trade; regulations for a safe internet experience we are required to <b>verify your identity</b>" by solving a CAPTCHA. (This makes no sense.) The words in the CAPTCHA by an <i>amazing coincidence</i> happen to be a comment somebody might make on a hot video. Because the alleged CAPTCHA dialog is a disguised Facebook comment box. The result is that the victim posts a comment like "so awesome" to their own wall, thereby propagating the spam. </p>

		<p>I have been a computer programmer for a long time&#8230; but I never used Facebook, or MySpace. &nbsp;I don&#39;t have, or want, a cell phone, Blackberry, or iPhone. &nbsp;I read books on paper, not on an e-book reader. &nbsp;I do, however, buy most of my books online (and some of them in a local store).</p>
<p>Facebook used to look interesting, but alongside the battle between users and spammers, there&#39;s a battle between privacy advocates and Facebook itself, regarding how much of your personal information to make public, with users seemingly caught in the middle. &nbsp;I avoid all of it.</p>

		<p>Why bother with the &quot;1&#215;1&quot; pixel under mouse cursor trick? Couldn&#39;t the spam-code just directly execute the &quot;like&quot; action itself instead if it can do such things?</p>

		<p>I particularly liked the guy who couldn&#39;t be bothered expending the effort to find a computer-based exploit and instead just placed the following text at the bottom of the spam mail: &quot;Please forward this email to everyone in your address book&quot;. Classic! Although, given the intelligence of some people I&#39;ve met, this may well have worked :-)</p>

		<p>@NB: Image buttons click event returns coordinate if invoked by real user click. On javascript invoked click, the returned coordinate would be (-1, -1). I think the Facebook server would easily ignore that.</p>

		<p>@David Walker/PlexMan: you&#39;re the next generation of dinosaur. Just like my dad swore it was better when you wrote your code on sheets and handed that to the typists (&quot;programming isn&#39;t typing&quot;).</p>

		<p>Thank god for NoScript in firefox. Anyhow, IE on Vista/7 tends to be safer because it runs as low integrity, and drive-by downloads are harder to actuate as the downloaded file can either run as low integrity, or get passed in as a higher integrity process but out of reach of low integrity processes. So they can either run it with limited priviledges, or save it.</p>
<p>The way most people do it is by violating integrity &#8211; plugins that manage to spawn higher integrity processes. E.g., bugs in a rather common PDF viewer plugin and their &quot;98% of the web uses it&quot; web enrichment plugin. (That a particlar fruity company refuses to allow on the mobile devices, and many mobiles running a robotic OS can, crappily).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
