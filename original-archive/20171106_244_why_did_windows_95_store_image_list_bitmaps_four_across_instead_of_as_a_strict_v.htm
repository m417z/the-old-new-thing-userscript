We learned some time ago that
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050805-18/?p=34693">
bitmap strips should be stored vertically</a>
in order to improve data locality.
</p>
<p>
If you dig back into your dusty archives,
you might discover that Windows 95
sort-of-but-not-quite
followed this advice.
It kept image lists in a mostly-vertical format,
rather than a strictly-vertical format.
In particular,
It stored four images across.
</p>
<p>
In other words, instead of
</p>
<table BORDER=1 CLASS="cp3" CELLPADDING=3 STYLE="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<td>A</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>B</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>C</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>D</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>E</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>F</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>G</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>H</td>

<tr>
<td>I</td>

<tr>
<td>J</td>

<p>
Windows 95 stored images like this:
</p>
<table BORDER=1 CLASS="cp3" CELLPADDING=3 STYLE="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<td>A</td>
<td>B</td>
<td>C</td>
<td>D</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>E</td>
<td>F</td>
<td>G</td>
<td>H</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>I</td>
<td>J</td>
<td>K</td>
<td>L</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>
Why didn't Windows 95 use fully vertical bitmaps?
</p>
<p>
Because Windows 95 still had a 16-bit coordinate space.
</p>
<p>
The system image list could contain hundreds of icons,
and the user could set their screen DPI as high as 120 (whoa!),
which meant that large icons were 48 pixels tall.
If the icons were kept in a single vertical strip,
you could have up to
&lfloor;32767&divide;48&rfloor; = 682 icons
before overflowing a 16-bit signed integer.
</p>
<p>
This was an uncomfortably low number,
so the shell team decided to trade off a little bit of locality
for increased range
and arranged icons four across instead of single-file.
This bumped the limit to over 2000,
which was a significant amount of breathing room.</p>

		<p>It also means that with 16-color, 48-pixel icons, a group of four icons would be 4608 bytes, so they would span two 4096-byte pages. Of course, greater color depths would worsen the problem (at 16 bit color, a row of 32-pizel icons would take exactly two pages, if correctly aligned). Anyway, I guess loading or swapping two contiguous pages is a lot faster than taking care of two separate ones.</p>

		<p>I take it that the shell team didn&#8217;t want the complexity of switching to more files only when running at high DPI settings.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
