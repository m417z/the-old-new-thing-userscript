		<p>_spawnl and friends are obviously broken in Windows. Here we have a nasty case. The function exists for portability from Unix;</p>
<p>however the existing Windows implementation is dangerously broken, but probably won&#39;t be fixed for backwards compatability reasons.</p>
<p>The first comment to the blog says you need to quote them yourself. NO. NO. NO. That&#39;s the point of _spawnl: it knows how to</p>
<p>pass the arguments so they are unchanged coming back into main(). This guy now has a working library function. A viable solution is to publish a small library containing his _spawnl. Anybody wanting a working one can include that library on their link list. (Explicit libraries always override the implicit msvcrt*).</p>
<p><!-- p>Link to compiler writing is broken (but probably works for Raymond). Should use hostname not IP address.

<p>Actually these are CRT functions. &nbsp;The CRT on Windows has a version number in its DLL name, new versons ship with Visual Studio, and they occasionally do intentionally break stuff from version to version.</p>

<p>The point is that each step of resolution on the DAC in that example is already as small as it makes sense to be. You could turn down the gain, but it wouldn&#39;t gain you any better sound quality because you wouldn&#39;t be able to perceive the difference.</p>

		<p>I&#39;d love to hear Raymond&#39;s TechEd 2010 talk, but can&#39;t seem to find it. The TechEd site on msdn (<a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd#fbid=cxpDNF02UBR" target="_new" rel="nofollow">channel9.msdn.com/&#8230;/TechEd</a>) doesn&#39;t list it at all and the TechEd China site (<a href="http://channel9.msdn.com/Events/TechEd/China" target="_new" rel="nofollow">channel9.msdn.com/&#8230;/China</a>) is even worse. Googling doesn&#39;t find anything either..</p>
<p>Anybody (maybe Raymond himself? I&#39;d accept snarky &quot;You&#39;re incompetent at searching&quot; answers too ;) ) want to help me out?</p>

<p>Pity, sounds like it would be an extremely interesting talk. I assume the MS internal conference talks are not available to the public at large?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
