Every so often, somebody reports that whenever they open a
command prompt, they get a weird error message between the
version banner and the prompt.
</p>
<div STYLE="background-color: black;color: white;font-family: Consolas, Lucida Console, Courier New, monospace;padding: 1ex;width: 80ex">
Microsoft Windows [Version 10.0.14393]<br />
(c) 2016 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.<br />
The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect.</p>
<p>C:\&gt;
</p>
</div>
<p>
Where is that message
"The filename, directory name, or volume label syntax is incorrect"
coming from?
</p>
<p>
My psychic powers tell me that it's coming from
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20071121-00/?p=24433/">
AutoRun</a>.
</p>
<p>
AutoRun is a hidden gotcha of the command processor
which lets you set a registry key to inject a command
into every command prompt as soon as it starts up.
And I'm guessing that there's a rogue AutoRun entry
that is doing something which is generating that message.
</p>
<p>
For example, I was able to reproduce the message by doing
this:
</p>
<pre>
reg add "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun /d \"C:|
</pre>
<p>
After running this command, open a command prompt,
and you'll get that same error message.
</p>
<p>
And before you forget,
run this command to get rid of the bogus AutoRun:
</p>
<pre>
reg delete "HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor" /v AutoRun /f
</pre>

		<p>You can do some pretty neat things with your own autorun script. I have one that hooks the drive letter changes and cd/chdir/pushd/popd commands with doskey. Whenever I change directory, I update the title of the window to reflect it.</p>
<p>Of course, such scripts need to be created carefully. Any app that tries to funnel commands through cmd.exe will end up invoking this script, so it could break things if it changes something like the working directory.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d suggest to not use AutoRun at all, as the file is more often executed than you can think. See e.g., the following <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35991722/how-to-specify-d-in-for-command" rel="nofollow">https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35991722/how-to-specify-d-in-for-command</a> &#8211; you cannot really specify /D in FOR loops, which runs the AutoRun very often if you do a FOR /F %%i IN (&#8216;mycmd&#8217;) DO &#8230;</p>

		<p>I actually had to stop using doskey to create aliases because doskey in AutoRuns sometimes crashes when cmd.exe is started by some 3rd-party apps. Probably because stdin was not hooked up or a strange stdout pipe? This was back in the XP/Vista days so it might be fixed by now. I must have reported it hundreds of times over the years with Dr. Watson before I gave up and wrote my own alias.exe helper.</p>

		<p>I remember one time years ago when I was madly troubleshooting a database update script, running through the command line, that failed only on my machine.  The culprit was an AutoRuns key that I had set years earlier and had long since faded from my memory.  Boy, was I embarrassed when I had to recall that bug report&#8230;</p>

		<p>Sounds to me like a security issue !<br />
A non-admin program can quietly set HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor\Autorun to run malware<br />
And next time you open a cmd.exe with admin rights, the malware command gets executed</p>

		<p>Note that the HKCU is a different one for the Administrator account, so this isn&#8217;t a problem.</p>

		<p>It doesn&#8217;t look like it.<br />
For example, from a normal command prompt I tested: reg add &#8220;HKCU\Software\Microsoft\Command Processor&#8221; /v AutoRun /d &#8220;regedit&#8221;<br />
When I open a new normal cmd.exe, it starts and I get also prompted to run regedit with admin rights (that&#8217;s expected)<br />
When I open an admin cmd.exe (From start menu &#8220;cmd&#8221; + Ctrl-Shift-Enter), I get prompted to run cmd with admin rights (that&#8217;s expected), and then regedit is launched without further prompting.<br />
That means the same HKCU Autorun was used for normal &amp; admin cmd.exe and a malware can setup a sneak attack through this, waiting for the user to open a cmd with admin rights.<br />
IMO, cmd.exe (signed by MS authenticode) should be entrusted to be run safely as admin at any time and not execute commands from HKCU.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
