<p>In case those coming into town for the <a href="http://mvp.support.microsoft.com/gp/MVPSMT2005"> 2005 MVP Global Summit</a> were interesting in chatting with me, here's my event diary for this week. (Non-native-English-speaking MVPs can hover over the highlighted words for a translation from slang into "standard American-English".)</p>
<ul>
<li>Even though it's not affiliated with the MVP Global Summit,     I'll mention it anyway since it happens the same week:     I'll be at CodeSlam on Tuesday night.     The name is a play on     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poetry_Slam">     Poetry Slam</a>, but     instead of reciting poetry, you share your code.     If you're an MVP with a cool app you want to contribute     to <a href="http://www.gotdotnet.com/codegallery/">CodeGallery</a>,     and you want to be part of the biggest geek     slumber party in Redmond, let me know.     I can bring one guest.     (However, since I am old and decrepit and have a job to go to the     following morning, I probably won't last the whole night.) </li>
<li>I am trying to     <a title="obtain by devious means" style="background: highlight; color: highlighttext">     finagle</a>     a ticket to the Windows Shell/User MVP dinner     on Thursday evening. </li>
<li>If I can't get a ticket to the MVP dinner, I'll definitely     <a title="attend uninvited" style="background: highlight; color: highlighttext">     crash</a>     the Windows Shell/User MVP lunch on Friday. </li>
<li>I'll     <a title="pay a brief visit" style="background: highlight; color: highlighttext">     pop by</a>     the MVP Barbecue on Saturday to     <a title="establish contact" style="background: highlight; color: highlighttext">     touch base</a>     with the MVPs in disciplines other than Windows Shell/User. </li>
</ul>
<p> If you want to be sure to catch me, <a title="write me a note" style="background: highlight; color: highlighttext" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/contact.aspx"> drop me a line</a> and I'll try to make time to see you. Note, however, that I'm doing this outside of my "regular job", so please be a bit understanding if a work emergency forces me to do some last-minute rescheduling. </p>
<p> [Colors fixed 8:30am; sorry I was half-asleep when I wrote this entry.] </p>

		<p>Er, yeah, black text on a dark blue background is pretty much totally unreadable.  But it looks that way in IE, too; it&#8217;s not just a Firefox thing.</p>
<p>The problem is the inline style on those anchor tags.  You can&#8217;t do &quot;text: color: windowtext;&quot;, for one, as that&#8217;s not valid CSS syntax.  You also shouldn&#8217;t be using &quot;color: windowtext;&quot; at all, because the &quot;window text&quot; color is black, not white.  You probably meant &quot;color: highlighttext;&quot; instead.</p>
<p>(Also, if it&#8217;s not a hyperlink, an anchor tag is probably not the best one to use.  span is probably better.  But that&#8217;s fairly minor.)</p>

		<p>The WTF is in using highlight colors where a simple, unobtrusive &quot;border-bottom: 1px dotted&quot; will do.</p>
<p>By the way, hiding footnotes in “title” attributes is not very Accessible; I am not only speaking about lynx and links browsers, but Pocket Internet Explorer too. There’s just no mouse to hover with, and the de-facto standard equivalent of hovering, tap-and-hold, opens the context menu.</p>

		<p>Sorry about the colors. I wrote this entry in a hurry, and I considered the dotted border but decided against it because um I forget, I think because I wanted to reserve the possibility of changing my link style to dotted someday.</p>
<p>That &quot;testing&quot; guy scares me. What&#8217;s he testing? And why is he testing it here?</p>

		<p>since when is &quot;drop me a line&quot; slang, or even American English? It&#8217;s standard English, and I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ve heard &quot;pop by&quot; used in the UK too.</p>

<p>Are the timestamps on comments specified on Pacific Daylight Time?</p>
<p>Would it be possible to include a UTC time?</p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s really cool that you put the explanation of these slang words in the text! As a non-native English speaker I appreciate it very much. I wish everybody else did the same&#8230;</p>

		<p>Rather than putting anchor tags in and covering them with all sorts of strange CSS, had you thought of using the standard ABBR (abbreviation) tag, to mark up your slang terms?</p>
<p>This is close enough to its designed purpose (indicating abbreviated words or terms, and offering an expansion) that I&#8217;m sure no one could quibble with your usage.</p>
<p>And as an added bonus if specify a TITLE property on an ABBR tag, then most modern web browsers will automatically give the enclosed text a dotted underline and will show the contents of the TITLE when hovered over, you can then apply any further highlighting through the page&#8217;s stylesheet, safe in the knowledge that it will only affect the words you want it to (rather than using an anchor tag, which is presumably why you&#8217;ve supplied the styling inline in each tag).</p>
<p>(I know Internet Explorer 6 has a funny quirk where it only supports one of the ABBR and ACRONYM tags, but I can&#8217;t remember which one off the top of my head, so this could be why you didn&#8217;t use it, I suppose, however every other modern browser supports both, and you could just use the one that works in IE).</p>

		<p>You actually didn&#8217;t need a ticket for Thursday (although you seem to have found that out just fine, or got one anyway).  We went to pick up our badges, and as it turned out, they said they weren&#8217;t required for the events in the cafeterias.</p>
<p>But, we wanted them anyway because we really didn&#8217;t want people to think we were just party crashing for food (because we both have interaction with the MVPs on the newsgroups and chats, we were supposed to be there!).  :)  We found a couple of Shell/User guys who we had a great conversation with.  It was very cool.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
