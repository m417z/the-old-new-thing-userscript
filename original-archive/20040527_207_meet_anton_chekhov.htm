<p>(Not to be confused with Star Trek's  <a href="http://www.scifi.com/startrek/cast/chekov.html">  Pavel Chekov</a>, who spells his name with a plain "k" instead of a "kh".  Of course, since this is all  <a href="http://infoshare1.princeton.edu/katmandu/sgman/trrus.html">  transliteration from Cyrillic</a>,  of which there are  <a href="http://kodeks.uni-bamberg.de/AKSL/Schrift/Transliteration.htm">multiple  systems</a>,  arguing about spelling is rather dubious anyway.)</p>
<p>  The guerilla performance group  <a href="http://improveverywhere.csbl.net/">Improv Everywhere</a>  stages events in public places and carefully records the reaction of  their unwitting "audience".  Perhaps one of their best-known stunts  is the  <a href="http://improveverywhere.csbl.net/chekov/">  appearance of author Anton Chekhov at a New York City Barnes and Noble</a>.  </p>
<p>  After the reading, they set up a table in Union Square Park across the street  and sold autographed copies of <i>The Cherry Orchard</i> from a table.  </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  The young man in the jean jacket above insisted that  Chekov only sign his autograph,  rather than making it out to anyone in particular.  He proudly announced,  "When you die, this is going to be worth lots of money!"    </p>
</blockquote>
<p>  Though I think their best performance from an artistic performance  point of view was  <a href="http://improveverywhere.csbl.net/deja">The Moebius</a>.  </p>

		<p>When I was a kid, I said the same thing during a comic book autograph signing after the artist wrote a little sentence made out to me instead of just his signature thereby making the comic worthless. Fortunately the one he messed up was a magazine with the comic on the cover instead of the couple of actual comics I had him sign.</p>

		<p>Hmmm&#8230; I can&#8217;t see why writing a message would make it worthless. I&#8217;d have thought that it&#8217;d be worth more &#8211; at least if it&#8217;s not just a generic &quot;to Lucy, from Anton&quot;.</p>

		<p>If you were someone famous, like Sigmund Freud, and you had a personal message from Chekhov on your signed first edition of /Cherry Orchard/, that would be valuable to your heirs because it would document an encounter between two famous people. It would also get bids at an auction from both Chekhov *and* Freud fans. Otherwise it&#8217;s not clear why a Chekhov fan would want something with a message on it when he could possibly get one without. [I am not a collector but I did have a good night&#8217;s sleep :) ]<br /></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
