<p>Every year, Microsoft invites its employees to fill out a poll which asks questions regarding all sorts of things. One of the things Microsoft employees are asked to evaluate is whether they think that their vice president is acting <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/04/789820.aspx"> <i>planfully</i></a>.</p>
<p> The tricky part about that question is that nobody knows exactly what the word <i>planfully</i> means. </p>
<p> Merriam-Webster defines <i>planful</i> as "<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/planful">full of plans&nbsp;: RESOURCEFUL, SCHEMING</a>." Is that what they're asking us? Whether our vice president is resourceful and scheming? Is that a good thing or a bad thing? </p>
<p> The OED, on the other hand, defines it as "Full or rich in plans; characterized by planning; organized, systematic." It's not clear whether this means that the person goes into a situation with a plan ahead of time, or that once they get into a situation, they develop a plan for getting out. (Maybe both?) </p>
<p> I caught a vice president using the word <i>planful</i> during a meeting, so I raised my hand and asked, "What does <i>planful</i> mean?" (Most people don't have the nerve to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/01/26/10120297.aspx#10120605"> raise their hand during a meeting</a> and ask, "Um, what does that word mean?") </p>
<p> The vice president replied, "Actually, I don't think it's a real word. I think [name of a senior manager] made it up." </p>
<p> I followed up: "Well, in that case, why are we asked to evaluate you every year on whether your actions are planful? How can we answer a question that uses a made-up word nobody knows the definition of?" </p>
<p> <b>Obligatory xpclient example</b>: "Was it a planful decision to introduce the auto-sorting problem?" </p>
<p> <b>Reminder</b>: Microspeak is not merely terms unique to Microsoft, but also terms used at Microsoft more often than in general. </p>

		<p>Companies get their own language for no reason. I work at yet another white bread hospital and we have on our evaluation &quot;Give A Damn!&quot; yes they actually have a mild curse on their staff evaluation forms. The funny thing is give a damn is the same thing you are expected to do anywhere: &nbsp;help your client, but nice, do what you said you would, try to do continually improve etc. So why do they have to make up a phase that they immediately have to define afterwards (or is patently obvious and doesn&#39;t require profanity to express)?</p>

		<p>&quot;Well, in that case, why are we asked to evaluate you every year on whether your actions are planful? How can we answer a question that uses a made-up word nobody knows the definition of?&quot;</p>
<p>So that if we don&#39;t like the answer we can (with some credibility) claim that the respondents didn&#39;t understand the question and if we do like the answer we can (with rather less credibility) crow about it to anyone unfortunate to be within listening distance.</p>
<p>Think of it as an insurance policy for surveys.</p>

		<p>&quot;Well, in that case, why are we asked to evaluate you every year on whether your actions are planful?&quot;</p>
<p>because [name of a senior manager] made it up so we unquestionably follow his instructions to put it on the evaluation form. If you want the real answer you have to follow-up with [name of a senior manager]</p>

		<p>The question is a Turing test. It&#39;s designed to make sure that only humans are answering the test. A computer will most likely give a nonsensical answer based on the literal definition, while a human will try to read the context and formulate an answer (planful in that context probably meaning, the VP has plans and goals vice being capricious and without clearly defined goals). Sorry Raymond, your own company seems intent to discriminate against robots, such as yourself.</p>

		<p>Just because a word is made up doesn&#39;t mean people won&#39;t know what it means.</p>

		<p>Actually, I&#39;m a &quot;foreigner&quot;, english is my second language, but as soon as I saw the word, I had a very clear picture about its meaning. I would &quot;make up&quot; this word, if I wanted to convey &quot;acting in mid and long-term in a way that seems to be consistent and smart, &#39;according to a plan&#39; (whether it&#39;s his own, or someone else&#39;s)&quot;. The opposite would be &quot;acting randomly, without thinking about any (/other than short-term) consequences.</p>

		<p>I would just assume it means &quot;strategically&quot; and move on.</p>
<p>There&#39;s little point in interrupting the meeting for defination of a word, as long as the focus of topic isn&#39;t about the word. Maybe you should try to ask that after the meeting or in an email so he can have more time to think, as have higher possibility to give you a better response.</p>

		<p>A made-up word I often found useful at MS was complify or it&#39;s alternate form, complificate. Another useful made-up word while I was at MS was &quot;magify&quot;, which means making relatively simple command options impossible to control thru any usable UI, or hiding useful/actionable operational feedback, thus turning the operation into magic. WHS kind of perfected both of these concepts.</p>

		<p>&quot;planful&quot; sounds to me like a direct-pseudo-translation of the German word &quot;planvoll&quot; (semantics are rougly &quot;with well thought-out intent&quot;).</p>

		<p>@hagenp Yep, although the sensible translation for that would be &quot;tactical&quot; imo. But then since &quot;tactical&quot; pretty much seems to be the closest word that matches the presumed intent of planful, that may really have something to do with its origin ;)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
