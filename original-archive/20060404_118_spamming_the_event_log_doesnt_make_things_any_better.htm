<p>A common suggestion is that if a problem is detected which the system automatically recovered from but which an administrator might be interested in knowing about, then an event log entry should be created. Be careful, however, not to abuse the event log in the process.</p>
<p> If the problem is not security-related and it can occur, say, more than a few times a day, then generating an event log entry may do more harm than good. The event log has a maximum log size (default 512KB on Windows&nbsp;XP), and when the log fills, older log entries are discarded to make room. If you generate a lot of events, you can end up filling the event log with your events, pushing out all the other events that the administrator might have been more interested in. Even worse, the administrator may have disabled automatically discarding old event log entries, in which case the system will generate error messages once the event log fills. </p>
<p> Network administrators make it a habit to go through the event logs of the machines on their network looking for unusual activity. If you fill the event log with chatter, this makes it harder for them to spot the real problems. </p>

		<p>Do you happen to know why the default event log size so small?</p>
<p>And would there be any mileage in being smart about what to discard, so that you discard younger &quot;information&quot; log items in favour of older &quot;error&quot; items?</p>
<p>(On some other systems, old copies of the &quot;critical&quot; log are kept longer than old copies of the &quot;debug&quot; log. If the &quot;debug&quot; log is kept at all)<br /></p>

		<p>Logging services on other operating systems notice when a particular message is getting logged repeatedly. &nbsp;Depending on the problem, applications may attempt to log messages thousands of times a second. &nbsp;In these situations, the logging service would, when the flood stops (or a different message is received), record how many times the previous message was repeated. &nbsp;This seems to be a good balance between recording the events accurately and preserving space.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve seen several scenarios where the eventlog gets spammed with dozens of identical messages. </p>
<p>One thing that I like about syslog implementations is the way multiple identical messages in succession can be &#8220;collapsed&#8221; into &#8220;previous message repeated N times&#8221;. </p>
<p>That would seem to be a good solution.</p>

		<p>If you use the MSFTP service at a busy site, you have probably seen hundreds of log-clogging &quot;connection closed because of inactivity&quot; messages every day. No way to keep the service from barfing those out, as far as I can tell.</p>

		<p>Better yet (at least IMO): Let the admin configure what gets logged in the first place. &nbsp;(This would be per program, though, not a setting in the event log system itself.)</p>
<p>If everyone followed this, then I wouldn&#8217;t have to deal with Dell&#8217;s once-per-half-hour &quot;OMG your chassis has been opened!!!1!1&quot; messages, because I could disable them. &nbsp;(Yes, I can disable chassis intrusion in the BIOS, but not remotely, and I have to take the machine down to do it. &nbsp;These particular machines run our barcode labeling program, and usually can&#8217;t be taken down except in an emergency.)</p>
<p>I also wouldn&#8217;t have to deal with Microsoft&#8217;s &quot;service X has been sent a start control&quot; &#8230; &quot;service X has successfully started&quot; &#8230; &quot;service X has been shut down&quot; trio of events in the system log for *every service* at *every reboot* in XP. &nbsp;(Sigh.)</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t read event logs. They are filled with irrelevent stuff. It&#8217;s also a mistake I made once, writing all status of a program to the app log so I could diagnose by phone. It made the app log useless for any other, say its normal, purpose. But then I only added to the useless clutter.</p>
<p>The errors I chased down in the log have all been irrelevent. I&#8217;ve learnt not to waste my time. Error notification is a flawed design.</p>
<p>If admin logged on errors should be reported (system notification area &#8211; I&#8217;m a pro tooltip and similar person &#8211; there are too few tooltips with too little extra info that take too long to popup). If not they should be either sent to the DC console or shown on next admin loggon (depending if wks or domain).</p>
<p>news:\msnews.microsoft.come0u97h$hjk$1@news1.completel.net</p>
<p>Above is a message from a thread today with someone&#8217;s bewilderment of getting info from XP.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is a chance for MS to develop a massively over-engineered solution with 5000 critical points of total system failure. The System Restore guys may be free.</p>

		<p>Linux syslog doesn&#8217;t actually store collapsed messages, instead when you view the log (using logwatch perhaps?) a perl script kicks in to parse them and display them in the &#8216;blah blah blah &#8211; x times&#8217; format.</p>
<p>I think that would make sense for the Eventlog, even if it is a &#8216;collapsed&#8217; view where all multiple messages are collated under a collapsed treeview item. The disadvantage is that you couldn&#8217;t see the timeline of events, but it would make initial viewing of the log much easier.</p>

		<p>Linux syslog actually DOES filter duplicate entries</p>
<p># grep repeated /var/log/syslog<br />
<br />Apr &nbsp;5 09:13:43 xxxx last message repeated 3 times<br />
<br />Apr &nbsp;5 09:14:37 xxxx last message repeated 5 times<br />
<br />Apr &nbsp;5 09:15:50 xxxx last message repeated 7 times</p>
<p>But if there are two programms spamming at the same time or the log line changes even one letter, you&#8217;re out of luck.</p>

		<p>Writing a logging system worth a damn would make things better.</p>
<p>* Provide a generic message DLL, or make message DLLs optional. The requirement for message DLLs makes remote access to event logs nigh-on useless.<br />
<br />* Allow logs to grow larger and implement configurable log rotation.<br />
<br />* Allow exporting entire log files as plain text.<br />
<br />* Use the log consistently. Currently I often see message boxes for service failures, directing me to the event log, which doesn&#8217;t actually show me the messages.<br /></p>

		<p>The default value on install is delete items older than 7 days. This is a pain as the event logs fail if 512k is reached. It&#8217;s on my checklist of changes for &quot;things that are really irritating&quot; on a fresh install.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
