<p>
The <code>Cancel&shy;Io&shy;Ex</code> function
can be used to cancel synchronous I/O.
</p>
<p>
This is handy if you have a program that processes a file in
large chunks and you want to give it a Cancel button.
Without <code>Cancel&shy;Io&shy;Ex</code>,
you would either have to accept that the program won't respond
to the Cancel button until the large I/O is complete,
or you would have to change your program so it processed
the file in small chunks, which is less efficient.
</p>
<p>
But with <code>Cancel&shy;Io&shy;Ex</code>,
you can do your large chunk processing and still let the
user cancel it immediately.
</p>

#define STRICT
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

#define FILESIZE (200*1024*1024)

DWORD CALLBACK ThreadProc(void* h)
{
 void* buffer = VirtualAlloc(0, FILESIZE, MEM_COMMIT, PAGE_READWRITE);
 DWORD actual;
 auto result = ReadFile(h, buffer, FILESIZE, &amp;actual, 0);
 auto lastError = GetLastError();
 printf("ReadFile -> %d, GetLastError = %d\n", result, lastError);
 return 0;
}

int __cdecl main(int, char**)
{
 auto h = CreateFile("D:\\setup.exe", GENERIC_READ, 0, 0,
                    OPEN_EXISTING, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL |
                    FILE_FLAG_NO_BUFFERING, 0);

  auto thread = CreateThread(0, 0, ThreadProc, h, 0, &amp;id);

This program reads
200<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20090611-00/?p=17933">MB</a>
of data from a file that I hard-coded,
which on my machine happens to be on a CD-ROM.
One thread reads the beginning portion of the file into memory,
and the other thread calls <code>Cancel&shy;Io&shy;Ex</code>
to cancel the large I/O operation.
</p>
<pre>
ReadFile -> 0, GetLastError = 995
</pre>
<p>
Error 995 is
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; <a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170919-00/?p=97046">NET HELPMSG</a> 995

The I/O operation has been aborted because of either
a thread exit or an application request.
</pre>
<p>
which corresponds to
<code>ERROR_</code><code>OPERATION_</code><code>ABORTED</code>,
just like the documentation says.

		<p>When I first read the title, I though &#8220;doesn&#8217;t CancelSynchronousIo already exist?&#8221;<br />
I then looked at the function documentation and then thought that this was handy.</p>

		<p>I can see some solid use cases for an IO function that&#8217;s essentially, &#8220;I don&#8217;t care how or why you got called, but the party&#8217;s over. You need to go home now.&#8221;</p>

		<p>When I first read the title in Feedly in a sans serif font I thought to myself: &#8220;Is CancelloEx some sort of extended Italian or Spanish operation?&#8221; :-)</p>

		<p>Same here. In fact, even when zooming in, the letters I and l seem to be pixel by pixel identical in the font that feedly chooses, at least on my system&#8230;</p>

		<p>Not just in Feedly. In the font used in the comments, here in my Chrome browser when browsing the actual blog page, it&#8217;s also impossible to tell them apart! Even in the tab title. (Luckily, the heading has a different font.)</p>

		<p>Be aware, though, that Nathaniel&#8217;s comment actually writes out &#8220;Cancello&#8221; with two lower L. On my system, &#8220;I&#8221; looks different in comments, having actual Serifs (though I&#8217;m on macOS with Safari).</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s just try it out: Cancello, CancelIo</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
