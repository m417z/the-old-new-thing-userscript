		<p>If can you believe what you read in the papers, it&#8217;s been recently disclosed that airlines frequently lie about reasons for delays.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.elliott.org/blog/forensic-meteorologist-i-believe-bad-weather-is-being-used-as-an-excuse/" rel="nofollow">http://www.elliott.org/blog/forensic-meteorologist-i-believe-bad-weather-is-being-used-as-an-excuse/</a></p>
<p>Fog in San Francisco sounds like a catch-all default excuse to me.</p>

		<p>Similar to the flight delays in Chicago because of wind.</p>

		<p>Hey Raymond,</p>
<p>The reason it really matters at SFO is because when there is fog they can only use one of the two parallel runways. I believe the runways are quite close &#8212; only about 750 feet &#8212; and therefore can both only be used when visibility is sufficient. The FAA requires that runways be more than 4,300 feet apart for instrument landings using the technology that SFO has.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the primary reason why Southwest stopped flying into SFO and opted instead to go to Oakland &#8212; too hard to turn planes when the fog rolls in and capacity goes down 50%.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a lot of research going into it both from a prediction side &#8212; when will the fog lift &#8212; and radar/ILS. It&#8217;s just a hard problem, and certainly no surprise!</p>

		<p>@Robertd</p>
<p>Chicago is called the Windy City not because it suffers from disproportionate amounts of wind, but because Chicagoans were thought to be blowhards &#8211; &quot;windy&quot; &#8211; at some old world&#8217;s fair or another. &nbsp;Another possible explanation (one that seems to be less prevalent) is that all the skyscrapers and tall buildings caused wind to be channeled down the narrow streets.</p>
<p>Neither of which would be reasons to delay an aircraft at ORD or MDW which are miles outside the Loop.</p>
<p>In fact, I&#8217;ve never heard &quot;Wind in Chicago&quot; used as an excuse for a delay before. &nbsp;Weather in Chicago, certainly, but never wind per se.</p>

		<p>Actually, it was much more foggy than normal the other night. &nbsp;My wife and I were commenting on how crazy it was that evening.</p>
<p>What time were you flying, Raymond?</p>

		<p>Sheesh. &nbsp;You know, fog is a problem, regardless of whether you expect it or not.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not defending the airlines. &nbsp;My experience has been they will tell you anything but the truth when it comes to delays.</p>

		<p>I was in San Francisco from August 17th to 21st and on Thursday morning (21st) there was what looked like a lot of fog to me &#8212; the top halves of skyscrapers were disappearing in it. I guess it settled over the night because Wednesday was sunny and clear for the whole day. The fog eased up in the late afternoon so my flight to Munich at 9:30pm wasn&#8217;t delayed.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
