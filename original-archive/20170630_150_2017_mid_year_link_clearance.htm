		<p>I wish the PDF said more about the people caught up in it (eg the underlings feeding the cat, say).  The typical response is they get fired, any security clearance they have is revoked, they are branded whistleblowers and pretty much become un-employable in their area.</p>

		<p>A man I know slightly once wrote of his younger days, when he believed in setting aside letters until he had time to give them the careful reading they deserved. One of those letters bore Greetings from the president of the United States, though. Eventually, MPs showed up on his mother&#8217;s stoop to explain that her son would be arrested if he didn&#8217;t show up for induction. Given that the mother was deaf&#8211;the MPs had to write the message out for her&#8211;I&#8217;m not sure how she conveyed the information to him in a timely manner, unless they were under the same roof. Perhaps letters from Mom jumped the queue.</p>

		<p>The attempted corrected link to the download of the &#8220;Encyclopedia of Ethical Failure&#8221; has an href with a quote at the end but not the beginning. This seems to make browsers think that the end-quote is part of the URL in the browsers I&#8217;ve tried.</p>

		<p>I attempted to post a comment pointing people to the Internet Archive copy of the document, but my comment was (summarily :-) rejected. While trying to figure out why I realised that the entire site (<a href="http://ogc.osd.mil" rel="nofollow">http://ogc.osd.mil</a>) is actually unavailable &#8230; at least from here in Portugal (and I suspect many/most other non-US sites).</p>

		<p>[Fifteen seconds per player. No time increment. Go.]</p>
<p>I think the standard &#8220;quick game&#8221; in Chinese chess is limited to 5 seconds per move. If any player cannot decide the next move within 5 seconds in his/her turn, the player lose.</p>
<p>And then there is an even chaotic version of the game. Each term has 5 players. The players taken turn to make their move. When you&#8217;re not active player, you&#8217;re not allowed to look at the game board. So at most you have 10 seconds (the 5 seconds of your opponent team + 5 seconds of your own) to get the idea of what&#8217;s happening on the board and decide your move. Sometimes deadly obvious &#8220;checkmate and take your car&#8221; goes unnoticed and the opponent team get a close escape.</p>

		<p>Huh. Had I just listened to that rendition of <i>Star Wars</i> music, I would totally have said it was some of the early-1990s LucasArts games. Sounds very similar to the SoundBlaster days of yore&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
