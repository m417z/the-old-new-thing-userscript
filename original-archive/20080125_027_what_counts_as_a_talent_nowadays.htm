<p>The annual <a href="http://www.missamerica.org/"> <i>Miss America</i> Pageant</a> <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/entertainment/2004143672_apmissamerica24.html"> struggles for survival tomorrow</a>. And what makes it different from Donald Trump's <i>Miss USA</i> and <i>Miss Universe</i> is the talent competition. (Yes, <i>Miss World</i> also has a talent competition, but nobody in the United States pays any attention to Miss World, probably because of the aforementioned Donald Trump.)</p>
<p> It's not that I go out of my way to watch these pageants, but if it's convenient, a bunch of us will get together to enjoy the festivities. During the opening parade of the <i>Miss Universe</i> pageant, we scream in horror at the hideous national costumes or the unflattering evening gowns. During the <strike>swimsuit</strike> Lifestyle and Fitness competition (Whom do they think they're kidding?) the women play the game "<a href="http://www.tv.com/seinfeld/the-implant/episode/2299/summary.html">Real</a> or <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3533680.stm"> Fake</a>?" (I recuse myself from that game citing lack of expertise.) But my favorite part is always the talent competition. </p>
<p> The talents are mostly musical, primarily singing, with a decent amount of instrumental performance&mdash;I enjoy these, particularly the instrumental ones, since I actually know something about the subject. The ones that aren't musical are dancing&mdash;I'm not particularly knowledgeable about dance and usually don't know what to make of the performance. Extremely rarely you'll encounter a dramatic reading (which to me feels like a cheat). As accomplished as the contestants are, these talents all feel kind of "squishy". (Indeed, back in the Regency era, the term <a href="http://www.pemberley.com/janeinfo/pptopic2.html#accomplishrev"> <i>accomplished</i></a> was used to refer to proficiency at these sorts of talents, and it was an open secret that the reason for developing these skills was simply to secure a husband.) But where are the <i>real</i> talents? </p>
<p> If only we had contestants demonstrating other talents like consensus building, project management, electronics repair, chicken plucking, or suitcase packing. </p>
<p> Then again, maybe those things are really skills rather than talents. </p>

		<p>I won&#8217;t be watching the Miss America contest, but I did enjoy the Miss America Reality Check show on TLC &#8211; it&#8217;s far more fun and interesting. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Even after watching that clip 20 times, it&#8217;s still hard to ignore how attractive she is. &nbsp;I guess that&#8217;s talent enough for me :)</p>

<p>Some of those talents are put to the test in Donald Trump&#8217;s Apprentice series.</p>

		<p>John: I don&#8217;t find her particularly attractive.</p>
<p>Ray: I think you misunderstand the &quot;talent&quot; aspect. The talents aren&#8217;t &quot;musical&quot; in nature, they&#8217;re &quot;entertainment&quot; in nature. That&#8217;s all these pageants are: entertainment. Watching someone manage projects, while interesting to those of us technically minded, is not entertaining to the vast majority of people that want to look at a barbie clone. They&#8217;d far rather watch a barbie clone dance or sing.</p>

		<p>So, how about a real talent competition? Freestyle bike trickery, juggling poodles, or (god forbid!) play something on a violin!</p>

		<p>Ahh, the Apprentice&#8230; that show had potential until Donald started steering it from following the players at work toward showing glimpses of them experiencing him, his pals, and their lifestyles.</p>
<p>Since season one I&#8217;ve known what I want to see in &quot;The Apprentice.&quot; &nbsp;I want the two teams to facing a third. &nbsp;In each task I want a team of current Trump executives, employees, or business associates &#8211; all hand picked by Donald himself &#8211; to go up against the contenders. &nbsp;Donald&#8217;s always bragging that he hires the best, that he and his could do these tasks so easy, so I&#8217;d like to see him prove it. &nbsp;Show the viewers how the people that do these tasks every day do it..</p>
<p>If Donald&#8217;s team wins then both teams lose a player. &nbsp;If both teams win then neither does. &nbsp;If one wins and one is at bottom then one gets rewarded and one loses a player.</p>

		<p>Oh, I&#8217;d pay money to see trumps chumps get thumped &#8211; we could expand the idea by allowing other execs to put a group of champions forward. It&#8217;ll be modern day jousting!</p>

		<p>Thom, that is a great show idea&#8211;but I don&#8217;t see Trump risking the loss of face, when he can instead outsource it to a stable of D-list celebrities.</p>

		<p>Erzengel: Aside from Raymond I&#8217;ve never known a single person, male or female, to express any interest whatsoever in watching the barbie clones sing or dance so I&#8217;d have to disagee with your &quot;far rather&quot; statement.</p>
<p>Also, the talents aren&#8217;t entertainment in nature they are justification in nature. &nbsp;&quot;These girls are a tad more than pretty faces on hot bods and that&#8217;s our justification *wink* for parading them around on stage and presenting them as role models for our little girls.&quot;</p>

		<p>Suddenly I&#8217;m reminded of the number &quot;A Little Brains, a Little Talent&quot; from &quot;Damn Yankees&quot;.</p>
<p>Donald Trump! Where would the USFL be without him?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
