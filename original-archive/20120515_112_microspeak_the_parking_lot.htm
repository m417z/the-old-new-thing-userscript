<p>Mike Dunn wonders <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/20/10040074.aspx#10040753"> what the Microspeak term <i>parking lot</i> means</a>.</p>
<p> I'm not familiar with this term either, and the first document I turned up during my search was a PowerPoint presentation that said "Avoid using Microsoft jargon terms, such as <i>parking lot</i> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/08/02/10191834.aspx"> <i>dogfood</i></a>." </p>
<p> Yeah, that wasn't much help. </p>
<p> From what I can gather, the term <i>parking lot</i> started out as a term used during brainstorming sessions. You've got a bunch of people in a conference room tossing out all sorts of ideas. The traditional way of organizing the ideas is to write each one on a Post-It&reg; note and stick it on the whiteboard. As more and more notes appear, you start to organize them by grouping together similar ideas. </p>
<p> Every so often, you'll run into an idea that, while good, isn't really relevant to the problem you're trying to solve. You don't want to throw it away, so instead, you designate a corner of the whiteboard to be the place to "park" those ideas for later consideration. That corner of the whiteboard is nicknamed the <i>parking lot</i>. </p>
<p> The term <i>parking lot</i> then began to be applied to the document that collected all of these "parked" ideas, so they could be circulated to a more appropriate audience. </p>
<p> The term then expanded to refer to any document which served as the official repository of assorted suggestions for future work or discussion. (Known to some people simply as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/31/10017567.aspx"> <i>The List</i></a>.) For example, there is a SharePoint List titled <i>Active Issues</i> and the subtitle <i>parking lot for discussion topics in weekly XYZ meeting</i>. Each item on the list is assigned to a particular person and assigned a priority. </p>
<p> I can't find any citations for <i>parking lot</i> being used as a way to say something like "we'll talk about this after the meeting is over," but I can see how it could be related to the sense of <i>parking lot</i> I was able to turn up: The parking lot is the list of things that aren't really relevant to the topic at hand but which are still worth discussing. We just won't discuss them here. </p>

		<p>My experience with parking lot is similar, but slightly different. &nbsp;It is a period set aside at the end of a meeting to discuss any topics that arose, but were not on the agenda. &nbsp;See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.manager-tools.com/docs/Effective_Meetings_Starter_Model_Shownotes.pdf" rel="nofollow">http://www.manager-tools.com/&#8230;/Effective_Meetings_Starter_Model_Shownotes.pdf</a></p>

		<p>Because of auto sorting in Explorer, files and folders no longer have a parking lot at the end of the list, and get all mixed up.</p>
<p>OR</p>
<p>Giving an option to not auto sort in Explorer isn&#39;t yet an idea in the shell team&#39;s parking lot.</p>

		<p>The American Red Cross uses &quot;parking lots&quot; in their disaster classes that function similarly to those in the original post. &nbsp;Questions that pop up in participants&#39; heads during class can be written on post-in notes and placed in a designated area. &nbsp;This allows the instructor to continue the class uninterrupted while allowing for questions to be handled at an appropriate time. &nbsp;I prefer a more interactive setting and so generally don&#39;t use the parking lot in my classes, but I have used the technique when questions start getting out of hand and we&#39;re running the rest of running out of time.</p>

		<p>@Carl D: The Microspeak articles aren&#39;t about terminology used /only/ at Microsoft, it&#39;s about terminology used at Microsoft in ways that might not be the norm everywhere else. &nbsp;So there is, inevitably, overlap.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve seen the term used (and used it myself) in a classroom situation similar to Bill C. &nbsp;In my experience it was a place on the blackboard (ya, I&#39;m old) where you could park your name during lab time and the instructor would assist work through the list providing help to each person in turn. &nbsp;We always called it a parking lot but it was more of a queue really.</p>

		<p>We use it at work as a verb now: &quot;Hey Jim, that&#39;s a great idea, but let&#39;s parking lot it for now and get back to the main discussion.&quot; Ugh. Effing idiots.

		<p>We&#39;ve encountered it as part of Agile development. &nbsp;Since you&#39;re supposed to work on specific fragments/tasks chosen, sometimes you come up with ideas that might be useful but cannot be done within the current iteration. &nbsp;So you &#39;park&#39; them in a documented way to be peeked at later, hopefully to properly flesh out as either an enhancement, a new project, or perhaps a process.</p>
<p>The Parking Lot. &nbsp;Where good ideas *don&#39;t* go to die.</p>

		<p>I suppose this is the opposite of parking good ideas, but I first encountered the term as a verb while being coached for a skydiving competition, although it could apply for any timed sport. When you make a mistake during a dive, the best thing is to &#39;park it&#39; and keep going. Dwelling on it can only negatively affect performance.</p>

		<p>definition: a pile to put the managers crappy ideas so he thinks you heard him and will get around to it but really your just going to wait until he is not looking and remove it in hopes he&#39;ll forget it.</p>
<p>Agile calls this the backlog which makes sense. If something is going to eventually ship it should go into the real &quot;todo&quot; list for the product. Everything doesn&#39;t have to be planned other than figuring out what because of dependencies has to go first. Otherwise your just grabbing things that will fit into the current cycle and have some combination of critical feature/nice feature for demoing as part of early preview/fun to work on working for them. Having a real spot where things disappear for a future release implies that you think you can plan all the features that you need to ship with before hand and anything else doesn&#39;t make the cut regardless of changing market, experience gained working on the project etc. Boo.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve even heard this outside the corporate world &#8212; I encountered it at church district meetings seven or eight years ago. The meetings had an agenda, and a certain amount of time was allotted to each topic (because otherwise people would talk forever). If somebody brought up an idea that wasn&#39;t directly related to the current agenda topic, that idea was added to the &quot;parking lot&quot; page on the flip chart &#8212; so it was only a few seconds&#39; distraction instead of a fifteen-minute sidebar. Time was dedicated at the end of the meeting to revisit the topics in the parking lot.</p>
<p>I think it was pretty effective. Oddly enough, when we set aside time to talk about something, we spend less time talking about it than we do when we know it&#39;s not related to the topic at hand!</p>

		<p>@xpclient</p>
<p>Have you tried Windows 8? I have been trying to figure out what you are talking about with the auto sort for a while, but it doesn&#39;t happen with network drives on win7 all the time (which is main time I view files at work), and it doesn&#39;t always happen with Windows 8 CP when I&#39;m at home.</p>

		<p>@Rangoric, it never happens with network drives all the time. Sometimes happens. And it doesn&#39;t happen with removable drives or the root of a drive either. But inside local folders, it happens all the time on any OS post Vista. It&#39;s design to make users&#39; life more difficult by shuffling all the files around the moment you paste, rename or create them. Just kidding, may be not intentionally designed but after half a decade there should have been an option provided because hundreds of users are screaming in their forums. Read it about it: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsdeveloperpreviewgeneral/thread/27314d0a-9c70-4b79-93e7-23fe60e7e374" rel="nofollow">social.msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/27314d0a-9c70-4b79-93e7-23fe60e7e374</a> I must have started a hundred different petitions ever since Longhorn was in beta.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
