<p>I didn't participate in the reading of the seventh grade essays, but I did get some of the more entertaining sentences from that batch. As you may recall, the topic was to describe the qualities you consider to be those which make someone an adult. Students were given 90 minutes, plus one additional hour upon request, equipped only with paper and pencil.</p>
<p> Remember, these are just the funny sentences/excerpts. Do not assume that all students write like this. </p>
<p> <b>Better get your butt in gear</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Grown ups should have accomplished     something great in order to be considered an adult. </li>
<li>Also, all adults in some small way contribute to the global economy. </li>
<li>One of the creepy qualities of adults     is that they have an answer for everything. </li>
<li>There should be a test or classified training facility     or something to prove you're adult. </li>
<li>They could make a segment that tests your     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="adultness?">adultivity</span>     on the SATs. </li>
<li>Adults should not get drunk or drink juice or pop. </li>
<li>You can't get all fat, you have to be     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="responsible">resposible</span>     and exercise enough so you stay fit and     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="in shape">inshape</span>. </li>
<li>An adult never     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="whines">wines</span>     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="cries">crys</span>     cheats and always is kind. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Let me tell you about my parents</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>My dad is so responsible,     I think because he has so much responsibility he has to be responsible. </li>
<li>I almost feel as if my heart and my dad's heart beat as one. </li>
<li>If we're doing something dangerous and "stupid,"     he will try and I repeat try to stop us. </li>
<li>A way he is healthy is that I know he brushes his teeth     and does not smell like a pig. </li>
<li>My mom is an adult. She's tall, a bit old, and fully grown. </li>
<li>Parents probably seem the most like adults     because they have been around longer than you,     but not long enough to make them senior citizens. </li>
<li>My mom is so responsible she will fix mistakes someone else did. NOW. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>How'd they get that way?</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Adults, What Are They? </li>
<li>Another way to tell that someone is an adult is that someone     could be very old like if they sleep too much     or if their hair was white and if they barely have any. </li>
<li>Adults are not only smarter but they are very boring too.     They are always acting so adult-like in a way that is so boring to me,     but apparently amusing to other adults like them. </li>
<li>College is where they learn to swear and smoke and drink.     As adults I hope you will all outgrow all that trash. </li>
<li>It somehow occurred to me that once you hit a certain age     you just stop getting     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="embarrassed">embarrased</span>. </li>
<li>An adult is mysterious or maybe even secret.     You can't tell what they are thinking     in that developed brain of knowledge and thought. </li>
<li>Some adults are just so boring that you wonder if they can actually laugh. </li>
<li>Soon they are throwing their thoughts into the world like cerebral dynamite. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Assorted commentary</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>When I think of an adult, I think of really tall people who are married. </li>
<li>It's not my fault we age so quickly. </li>
<li>If you are not an adult at 43 then I don't know what you are. </li>
<li>Being an adult can be a very stressful way of living. </li>
<li>The person I see as being adult is M.C. Hammer. </li>
<li>My cousin respects me until his friends come over. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Misspelling corner.</b> I've included more context; that may make the game a bit easier. </p>
<ul>
<li>Adults have excellent     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="manners (a manor is a type of house)">manors</span>. </li>
<li>If you aren't     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="responsible">responcable</span>,     then     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="certain">certin</span>     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="scenarios">scenrios</span>     might happen. </li>

<li>That makes you look     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="irresponsible?">irrespunkabl</span>. </li>
</ul>
<p> And just to show that seventh graders are also capable of good writing: </p>
<ul>
<li>Most people think that right when you turn 18     you are an adult but truly it's one small step in a long hard journey. </li>

		<p>That was funny and refreshing to read for sure. These quotes go to show how kids are really still innocent and how they shouldn&#8217;t be taken so seriously all the time.</p>

		<p>Hi,</p>
<p>My comment it&#8217;s totally off topic but couldn&#8217;t find another way to contact Raymond.</p>
<p>In the post &quot;psychic prediction for 2006&quot; you made a &quot;hashed prediction&quot; and promised to reveal it by the end of that year. I couldn&#8217;t find any post with an answer.</p>
<p>I read the post when it was first published and I&#8217;m still curious to see how your psychic powers worked :P</p>

		<p>&quot;There should be a test or classified training facility or something to prove you&#8217;re adult.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m so for it. At least 37% of the self-proclaimed adults are going to fail according to my estimations.</p>
<p>&quot;My mom is so responsible she will fix mistakes someone else did. NOW.&quot;</p>
<p>Ah, she&#8217;s clearly a programmer. She mush have inherited some bad code recently and the deadline is looming.</p>
<p>&quot;Adults have excellent manors.&quot;</p>
<p>Lucky ones indeed do.</p>
<p>&quot;Adults are often considered excepted members of society.&quot;</p>
<p>I refuse to join any society that would except me as member.</p>
<p>&quot;College is where they learn to swear and smoke and drink.&quot;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s some deep real life knowledge in here. I failed Smoking 101 miserably though.</p>

		<p>&#8220;pioused&#8221; might well be meant to be &#8216;biased&#8217; instead of &#8216;poised&#8217;. Phonetically that seems to make more sense to me. Of course I have no idea what the kid was thinking he was saying with that sentence either way :)</p>

		<p>Pearls of wisdom:</p>
<h1>An adult is mysterious or maybe even secret. You can&#8217;t tell what they are thinking in that developed brain of knowledge and thought.</h1>
<p>If has oft been noticed that children speak what is on their mind. In many cases, the expressed opinion of a child is worth much that that expressed by an adult.</p>
<p>This kid has wisdom beyond his years.</p>
<p>&#8230;or he has been held back for many, many years.</p>
<h1>Some adults are just so boring that you wonder if they can actually laugh.</h1>
<p>I agree with that sentiment.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
