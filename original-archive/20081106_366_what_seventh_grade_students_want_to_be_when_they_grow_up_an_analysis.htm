<p>A few years ago, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/04/03/567321.aspx"> I listed some of the careers seventh grade students chose for themselves</a>. But my friend the seventh grade teacher pointed out to me that the list hides the correlation between the jobs and the students.</p>
<p> The lower-performing students chose the high-glamour jobs: Professional athlete, model, rock star, actor. Some of these students may be exhibiting boundless optimism; others may simply not have thought through the question very much and just picked the first thing that popped into their head. By comparison, the higher-performing students tended toward low-glamour but highly-skilled jobs: Contract attorney, civil engineer, brain surgeon, traffic planner. </p>
<p> It's interesting that both groups are setting themselves up for disappointment in different ways. The big dreamers are likely to be disappointed when they find that becoming an actor involves lots of waiting tables and tiny roles trying to get your big break, or that becoming a professional athlete means you're competing against thousands of other hopefuls for only a few dozen openings. On the other hand, the harsh realists may be selling themselves short, missing out on a chance to exercise their creativity. </p>
<p> Or maybe it's just too soon for twelve-year-olds to be worrying about this sort of thing. Let them have their dreams for a few years longer. </p>

		<p>This point of view is very interesting &#8212; I guess most of people stop dreaming and hoping when they become adults. I&#8217;ve recently read an article which said &quot;[French] people are happier at the age of 65 than 40&quot; .. Funny too :)</p>

		<p>I think this can be seen from an evolutionary psychology perspective: if someone is low-performing, they will naturally want to play the lottery, hoping for their big break. If the best income you can hope for is 50k, you&#8217;re better off waiting tables and hoping to become an actor. But if you&#8217;re expecting to make 150k, then waiting tables would dramatically reduce your lifetime earnings. You&#8217;re better off going with the guaranteed 150k than hoping to make it &lt;i&gt;really&lt;/i&gt; big. I read that somewhere (perhaps in a Gladwell article?).</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m very creative and enjoy art, but I also find math and physics very easy because it&#8217;s common-sense. I took the latter bet. You can always make decent money as an engineer, as an artist you&#8217;re gambling.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t have any idea what I wanted to be at that age. &nbsp;It&#8217;s quite possible that I didn&#8217;t have any &quot;real career&quot; dreams.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not original to me, but this paraphrase-of-a-quote sums it up quite nicely: &nbsp;&quot;I just kind of imagined playing with Lego for my entire life. &nbsp;Since I&#8217;m now a computer programmer, I guess you could say that that&#8217;s what happened.&quot;</p>

		<p>Asking such a question also enforces the idea that they will work the same jobs that their parents did, with the same social structures, instead of creating their own opportunities. &nbsp;</p>
<p>A different question is: &nbsp;When you grow up, what will you change about the world? &nbsp;That makes a different set of assumptions, but assumptions I prefer.</p>

		<p>John, he&#8217;s not kidding. &nbsp;In my decade of teaching I&#8217;ve heard more than one kid talk about wanting to be a traffic planner. &nbsp;Some kids see a problem, and they are fascinated by the idea of fixing it.</p>

		<p>Why not a contract attorney?</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s my theory. &nbsp;A majority of the high performers come from upper-middle class backgrounds. &nbsp;Their parents keep an eye on the homework and care about good grades and dammit, you ARE going to college. &nbsp;But the kids are younger. &nbsp;So they probably still just want to do what daddy or mommy does. &nbsp;Hence the interest in traffic planning or contract law.</p>
<p>The lower performers are generally not from upper-middle class backgrounds. &nbsp;Since daddy works (for example) assembling widgets in a factory, they know they don&#8217;t want to follow in daddy&#8217;s/mommy&#8217;s footsteps. &nbsp;So they&#8217;re more imaginative.</p>

		<p>Ask the same child the same question six months later, or even six weeks, and you should get a different answer, if the school is achieving the goal &quot;broadening horizons&quot;.</p>
<p>Quantum mechanics tells us that the answers will be all over the map to fill every possible quantum position. &nbsp;Which position an individual claims to want, and which they end up filling is largely a matter of chance, due to the influences of their peers and society at large.</p>

		<p>I wonder how much of this involves people playing to their (perceived) strengths? E.g. &quot;I&#8217;m bad at maths, but good at football, so I&#8217;ll be a footballer&quot; vs &quot;I&#8217;m bad at sports, but good at maths, so I&#8217;ll be an accountant&quot;.</p>

<p>When I was in fifth grade I knew I would be using computers heavily wherever I went.</p>

		<p>When I was a kid, I always wanted to be an astronaut. I knew everything there was to know about the planets, stars and moons, and I had tons of LEGO with spaceships and stuff. Yay!</p>
<p>In retrospect, that would have been an amazingly poor career choice, since I very easily get motion sickness and have vowed never to set foot on a boat again. (Or a two-seat airplane. Nasty story.)</p>
<p>Luckily enough, in fifth grade, my dad started bringing me to his office every Tuesday evening, so I could play with their computers. I&#8217;ve never left the keyboard since.</p>

		<p>When I was asked that question at school I was eight. I had no idea what I wanted to be so I just chose the &quot;best job&quot; &#8211; being an astronaut.</p>
<p>Somehow this question never came back but at the age of twelve I already discovered my passion for programming and knew who I would become. Did I sell myself short in life? :)</p>

		<p>I was quite traditional when I was young&#8230;.I wanted to be a pilot.</p>
<p>However, my parents bought me a clunky CP/M machine when I was twelve, and that was that.</p>
<p>Initially I wanted to be a games programmer, but started out in tech support/web/etc.</p>
<p>Getting close though, now doing programming on CAD and PLM systems, which is where I will probably stay for the foreseeably future.</p>
<p>Games programming doesn&#8217;t pay as well :)</p>

		<p>From the age of about eight I always told people I wanted to be a dustman (aka refuse collector) because I disliked the question and enjoyed the discomfiture I caused.</p>

		<p>I wanted to be an astronaut early on.</p>
<p>Then came the Challenger explosion, after which my parents tell me I stopped wanting to be an astronaut, literally overnight.</p>
<p>Funny how those things affect a six-year-old.</p>

		<p>Grant: That&#8217;s a really great theory and all, but in reality there&#8217;s very little correlation between academic performance and economic background, especially in primary/secondary education and especially in public schools.</p>
<p>Even in university, the rich kids are often the worst performers because students with lower incomes have to depend on scholarships and bursaries and work hard to keep them, whereas rich kids often have very little motivation and are only there because they were essentially forced to go.</p>
<p>So throw that theory out the window, because this is just another case of the low-skilled being blissfully unaware of their lack of talent. &nbsp;The evolutionary psychology angle is interesting though, might explain why Hollywood has the collective IQ of an eggplant.</p>

		<p>When I was very young, I wanted to be a research scientist. This eventually turned into a desire to work in genetics. Then I went to college, where I found science to be Hard Work, and discovered that it also didn&#8217;t pay so well.</p>
<p>In the midst of a subsequent aspiration to become a pastry chef, my restaurant manager watched with fascination as I resolved his computer problems&#8230; before asking what in God&#8217;s name I was doing trying to be a pastry chef.</p>
<p>After all, he explained, I was NEVER going to be a great pastry chef &#8211; no matter how long and hard I worked &#8211; but it looked to him like I had a decent shot at being a great computer programmer.</p>
<p>The idea had honestly never occurred to me. I don&#8217;t think I have much of a shot at being great, really&#8230; but just being competent pays pretty well.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t really remember what I wanted to be in 7th Grade, though that was about the point that I found that my eyesight was no longer 20/20, ergo that I wouldn&#8217;t be flying a plane. I am pretty sure that I had no aspirations to be a computer programmer, on the grounds that I wouldn&#8217;t have heard of that vocation. I probably didn&#8217;t see a computer till sometime in high school.</p>

		<p>So the analysis is that the harsh realists wind up wanting to be brain surgeons?</p>

		<p>I think it&#8217;s simpler than all that&#8230; in truth all we have to assume is that low-performing people don&#8217;t understand the concept of &quot;expected value&quot; and/or have a poor ability to judge probability.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s so much evidence for this theory that it seems safe to apply it to this particular phenomenon.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
