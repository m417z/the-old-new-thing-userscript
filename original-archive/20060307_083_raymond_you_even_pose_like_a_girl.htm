		<p>I have a theory. You were so bored from the lackluster food served at the restaurant you were eating, you spent too much time thinking about what pose you would make when someone took the picture. Now, if you were eating at Malkay Satay Hut, you wouldn&#8217;t have had this problem since you&#8217;d be too involved with the food&#8230;</p>

		<p>I suspect, as gaijin, Raymond need not concern himself about the masculinity of his pose overmuch. &nbsp;I recall some incident where my choice of food apparently got some snickers from some Japanese folks (back when I lived in Japan) since only women ordered that particular food item (whatever it was). &nbsp;However, as gaijin, nobody really held it against me as anything more than a bit of amusement.</p>
<p>Actually, as gaijin, you can get away with a lot of peculiar behavior in Japan, since by default, you&#8217;re already too weird for Japan. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t think you can easily commit too deep a social faux-pas in Japan, if you&#8217;re an outlander.<br /></p>

		<p>Oh my Gosh&#8230; that is SO true&#8230; you kinda look like a (Japanese) girl&#8230; (not much, just a bit).<br />
<br />That oughta be the most ironic thing one could expect from a experienced, seasoned, hard-core Microsoft engineer. Not that there is something wrong with that (and please, don&#8217;t get me started with the macho/feminist topic: I&#8217;m sure there are very good (female) Microsoft engineers, it&#8217;s just that the (traditional) stereotype of a hard-core software engineer is, by default, male.<br />
<br />Besides, I alse have ended up looking not very masculine in a bunch of photos (or just plain awful, as I&#8217;m everything but fotogenic) &nbsp;:(</p>

		<p>What does a superhero pose look like(Martha Stewart)? &nbsp;Does the term Hero subsume the term heroine. &nbsp;Is heroine a drug or a female hero. &nbsp;Gosh, &nbsp;I get so confused so easily. &nbsp;I&#8217;d rather just avoid the references to gender&#8230; and use concrete examples, &nbsp;rather than super hero cite a specific one etc. &nbsp;It makes the point without perpetuating stereotypes that in all likelihood do contain prejudices. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll go and put my pink fluffy slippers on now (note I didnt say &#8216;girly&#8217; slippers, &nbsp;I cited a specific).<br /></p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve seen peace symbols displayed by men and women in photos in lots of Asian countries. &nbsp;And by Asian men and women in photos taken outside of Asia too.</p>
<p>Oh no, now it&#8217;s starting to sound like peace is racist. &nbsp;I&#8217;d better go read a newspaper (today&#8217;s will probably do) and be reminded that it isn&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>It may stun all of you but I *AM* a Japanese girl (what kind of name do you think Aoki is, anyway?)</p>
<p>And what am I doing? the flat-palmed wave of British royalty. Just goes to show you. That&#8217;s QUEEN Betsy to you, thanks!</p>

<p>What kind of name is Betsy? &nbsp;By itself it might be a foreign-sounding nickname, but in combination with the country where your office is located, it tends to look like you have Japanese ancestry but not Japanese citizenship yourself.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s a family name. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t quite see the connection to knights but families often include both males and females.</p>
<p>Also, although 青木 is two Chinese characters just as Aoki is four Italian characters, the language is Japanese. &nbsp;If you speak English you&#8217;ll say &quot;blue tree&quot;. &nbsp;If you speak Italian then you&#8217;ll say two Italian words instead of &quot;blue tree&quot;. &nbsp;If you speak Chinese then you&#8217;ll say two Chinese words instead of &quot;blue tree&quot;.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
