<p>Here's a message I received some years ago, paraphrased:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  <b>From</b>: X<br> <b>Subject</b>: FW: Bug 161803: Program&nbsp;Q uses undocumented resource which we changed in Vista<br> </p>
<p> Raymond, can you take a look? </p>
<p> ------- Original message -------<br> <b>From</b>: Y<br> <b>Subject</b>: Bug 161803: Program&nbsp;Q uses undocumented resource which we changed in Vista<br> </p>
<p> It appears that Program&nbsp;Q is loading <code>shell32</code> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/10/26/485133.aspx"> looking for a resource that we changed in Vista</a>. It used to be an ordinal resource number 123, but it has since moved to location ABC. The program goes looking for it at the old location and can't find it, so it barfs. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> So what is it exactly that I'm supposed to be looking <i>for</i>? It looks like Y&nbsp;pretty much figured it out. Maybe you want me to move the resource back. Or perhaps you want me to write a compatibility shim. Or verify Y's analysis? </p>
<p> Turns out that in the case, I was being asked to look for other resources in the shell that moved from one location to another and therefore might be the source of compatibility bugs similar to this. </p>

		<p>I think it is a cunning ploy by management to run surreptitious psychological exams on you without you getting wise.</p>

		<p>Oops&#8230; Looks like one of my old programs blindly loads a numbered resource from shell32.dll too, except it doesn&#8217;t barf when it fails.</p>
<p>(error checking removed for brevity)</p>
<p>hResID = FindResourceEx(hLib, RT_ICON, (LPCTSTR) 143, MAKELANGID(LANG_NEUTRAL, SUBLANG_NEUTRAL));</p>
<p>hResData = LoadResource(hLib, hResID);</p>
<p>dwSize = SizeofResource(hLib, hResID);</p>
<p>hLibIcon = CreateIconFromResourceEx(hResData, dwSize, TRUE, 0x00030000, 32, 32, LR_DEFAULTCOLOR);</p>
<p>hIcon = CopyIcon(hLibIcon);</p>
<p>DestroyIcon(hLibIcon);</p>
<p>If any of this fails, it falls back to LoadIcon((HINSTANCE)NULL,IDI_INFORMATION) and even that&#8217;s allowed to fail (it won&#8217;t try to send STM_SETICON in that case). This is for a dialog that waits for a network connection and then performs a certain action, so it also has a progress bar. If someone runs it on Vista and #143 is the shred icon instead of a network icon, the user might panic and bail out even though nothing is actually deleted.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Vista adds the SHGetStockIconInfo function. This solves the problem nice and swift for new software. Another method would be to dig into the shell namespace, but that&#8217;s a lot of work for just 1 icon.</p>

		<p>Or you could just reply that depending on the undocumented internals of application results in previously documented behavour, and as such is not a bug but rather &quot;by design&quot; &#8211; on both sides.</p>

		<p>Ok, the boring part of the post:</p>
<p>1. Some folks are using &#8220;undocumented features&#8221; and it blows now</p>
<p>2. You got asked whether u can take a look at it, whatever that means.</p>
<p>Now for the interesting part:</p>
<p>&gt;Here&#8217;s a message I received some years ago</p>
<p>SOME YEARS AGO?</p>
<p>Well..it took quite some time until you were able to share this one with us. Some more years and you will come to the conclusion that it&#8217;s not even worth to post about it.</p>

<p>Great. I came to the conclusions that:</p>
<p>a) It&#8217;s worth is up to the individual reader.</p>
<p>b) It&#8217;s not worth it for us to read your opinion.</p>
<p>c) No one forced you to read it.</p>
<p>d) You didn&#8217;t pay for access here; it&#8217;s free.</p>
<p>e) No one forces you to visit Raymond&#8217;s blog.</p>
<p>f) You wasted more time posting your drivel than Raymond probably did writing the post.</p>

		<p>Must have been less than five years ago, because before that there wouldn&#8217;t be Windows Vista. Or the Microsoft told us that they worked 5 years on Vista when in reality they worked longer?</p>

		<p>Raymond, your brutal honesty must have pissed off a lot of people.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
