<p>
The <code>Draw&shy;Text</code> function
will recognize tab characters if you ask for
<code>DT_</code><code>EXPAND&shy;TABS</code>.
</p>
<p>
And then things get weird.
</p>
<p>
If you ask for
<code>DT_</code><code>EXPAND&shy;TABS</code>,
then you cannot ask for
any of the
<code>DT_</code><code>*_</code><code>ELLIPSIS</code> features.
The ellipsis code doesn't support tabs.
</p>
<p>
Tab stops default to every eight average character widths.
If you want to change the default, you can specify
<code>DT_</code><code>TAB&shy;STOP</code>
and put the desired number of average characters per tab
in bits 8 through 15.
For example, if you want tabs every four average characters,
you would use
<code>DT_</code><code>TAB&shy;STOP | 0x0400</code>.
</p>
<p>
The
<code>DT_</code><code>TAB&shy;STOP</code>
flag precludes you from using any of the flags
that normally occupy bits 8 through 15,
since it takes over those bits for its own purposes.
Specifically, these flags cannot be combined
with <code>DT_</code><code>TAB&shy;STOP</code>:
</p>
<pre>
#define DT_NOCLIP                   0x00000100
#define DT_EXTERNALLEADING          0x00000200
#define DT_CALCRECT                 0x00000400
#define DT_NOPREFIX                 0x00000800
#define DT_INTERNAL                 0x00001000
#define DT_EDITCONTROL              0x00002000
#define DT_PATH_ELLIPSIS            0x00004000
#define DT_END_ELLIPSIS             0x00008000
</pre>
<p>
You can avoid this problem with
<code>DT_</code><code>TAB&shy;STOP</code> by
using <code>Draw&shy;Text&shy;Ex</code>:
When you use
using <code>Draw&shy;Text&shy;Ex</code>,
the tab stop interval is specified by the
<code>iTabLength</code> member of the
<code>DRAW&shy;TEXT&shy;PARAMS</code> structure
instead of being smuggled inside bits 8 through 15
of the flags.
</p>
<p>
If you do not specify
<code>DT_</code><code>TAB&shy;STOP</code>,
then the value of <code>iTabLength</code> is ignored.
</p>
<p>
The tab stop positions are relative to the left edge
of the formatting rectangle you provided plus any
left margin.
</p>
<p>
If you specify
<code>DT_</code><code>TAB&shy;STOP</code>
but forgot to say
<code>DT_</code><code>EXPAND&shy;TABS</code>,
then you don't get tab expansion.
You went to the effort of configuring something
you didn't enable.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
