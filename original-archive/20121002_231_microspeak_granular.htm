<p>Today's Microspeak word is <i>granular</i>. Here are some citations.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Please bring your cost estimates at the granularity of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/05/12/9605143.aspx"> 3, 5 or 10 days</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The <i>archive</i> function archives all data older than the date specified. Is there a way to get the archive to be more granular than just a date? Our database covers multiple accounts, and we'd like to choose a different date for each account. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> There are about 2000 warnings to be investigated. I've assigned them at component granularity. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> <i>Granularity</i> is roughly equivalent to <i>level of detail</i> or <i>unit of separation</i>. </p>
<p> In the first example, the cost estimates should be broken down into units that are 3, 5, or 10 days. In the second example, the request is for the <i>archive</i> function to determine which data to archive based on more than just the item date. In in the third example, the 2000 warnings were group by component and all warnings in a particular component were assigned to a single person. </p>
<p> The term <i>granular</i> is used plenty outside Microsoft, too, especially in the phrase <a href="http://www.bing.com/search?q=%22granular+control%22"> <i>granular control</i></a>, which you will be relieved to know is also wildly popular at Microsoft. (Remember, Microspeak is not only about words and phrases unique to Microsoft. It also covers words and phrases used inside Microsoft at a rate significantly higher than their usage outside Microsoft.) </p>
<p> There is also a more jargony use of <i>granular</i> when used in conjunction with the verb <i>to get</i>. To <i>get granular</i> means <i>to study in greater detail</i>. And in a peculiar mix of metaphor, the way to <i>get granular</i> is to <i>drill down</i>. </p>

		<p>Database and data warehouse-speak also uses the term &quot;grain&quot; to mean (more or less) the lowest level of aggregation, as in &quot;the grain of this summary table is customer purchases by day&quot;.</p>
<p>To &quot;get granular&quot; just sounds silly!</p>

		<p>To &quot;get granular&quot; sounds like something you can get in serious trouble for:</p>
<p>I asked the new receptionist if she wanted to get granular with me.</p>
<p>The new intern got in trouble for getting granular with the boss&#39;daughter.</p>

		<p>Out here in non-MS-land, they say &quot;more granular&quot; when they seem to intend &quot;more finely-grained&quot;.</p>
<p>This seems entirely backwards to me, since that results in a fine powder being considered &quot;more&quot; granular than a bucket of rocks. &nbsp;And I wouldn&#39;t call a powder &quot;granular&quot; at all.</p>
<p>More to the point, why use a stupidly ambiguous phrase when you can say &quot;more finely-grained&quot;? Or even (gasp) &quot;more detailed&quot;, since that&#39;s often the actual meaning.</p>

		<p>Very apropos. &nbsp;I work for a large tech company (market cap roughly .EQ. Microsoft, but a bit older) and I don&#39;t hear this term. &nbsp;However, last night I was in a parent meeting discussing an upcoming visit by foreign students and a biologist said that the discussion was getting &quot;too granular&quot;. &nbsp;It was immediately understandable, but I had been wondering how wide-spread the usage was.</p>

		<p>Isn&#39;t this pretty much the dictionary definition of Granular? &nbsp;I&#39;ve always understood it to mean &quot;smaller pieces of the whole&quot;.</p>
<p>gran·u·lar   [gran-yuh-ler]</p>
<p>adjective</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>of the nature of granules; grainy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>composed of or bearing granules or grains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>showing a granulated structure.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<p>You can say that again! I set GridGranularity = 16 in WIN.INI and Windows 95 blithely ignores me. What&#39;s the world coming to?</p>

		<p>I remember about 70 years ago a note in a university library&#39;s comment book saying that graduate needed to do more granular study than the undergraduates did. Being undergraduate louts, we made up a motto, &quot;When the going gets granular, the granular get going.&quot;</p>

		<p>@Clovus</p>
<p>Granular would appear to be an adjective, with granularity the relevant noun.</p>
<p>You need to verb the adjective!</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m going to granulate this&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>or</p>
<p>&quot;I&#39;m going to granularise this&#8230;&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
