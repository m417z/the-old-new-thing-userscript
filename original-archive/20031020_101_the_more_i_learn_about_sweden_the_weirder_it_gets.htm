<p>         Military service in Sweden is compulsory for all males. When your country has not         participated in any wars for two hundred years, you have to pass the time somehow.         Apparently one of the exercises is to assess how Sweden would fare against its nearest         neighbors. The general consensus (at least in Sweden) is that they could take on Finland         and Norway, but if the Danes were to invade, Sweden would eventually succumb, but         not before doing the Danish army serious damage.      </p>
<p> Pass the herring. </body></p>

		<p>Hehe, I&#8217;m Swedish and I&#8217;ve been around the world and eaten things most people are disgusted by, but the most disgusting thing I&#8217;ve ever eaten is the rancid herring. Still I even gave it a second chance&#8230;but no, it&#8217;s not for me.<br />
And what do you mean we would succumb under the Danes? We haven&#8217;t lost a war against the Danes since 1613. ;)</p>

		<p>The swedish military service is not compulsory, but the draft tests (m&#246;nstring) are. Some are not accepted due to their physical or mental health, others get a placement but no training (such as me, my reason to skip it was the university), others get a training ranging from 230 days and upwards depending on rank and type of service.</p>
<p>Just to bring up the part about the Danes, large part of southern Sweden used to belong to Denmark, so we won the last time&#8230; :o)</p>

		<p>Well, that was the consensus military assessment of Sweden vs. Denmark when I talked to some students who had just completed their military service. They did neglect to offer me any herring, so maybe they were just Danes in disguise.</p>

		<p>Hey! Denmark could kick Sweden&#8217;s a** anyday! Darn herring-eating freaks.. ;-)</p>
<p>The closest thing Denmark and Sweden has been to a war in the last 400 years or so is the soccer-matches we used to have every year or so.</p>
<p>The Swedes may think they won the last one.. The truth is we let them win so we wouldn&#8217;t have to pay maintenance for our vacation-resort.. ;-)</p>

		<p>One of my Swedish collegues (let&#8217;s call him Jonas) told me a funny story about his military service days. Here&#8217;s how the story goes:</p>
<p>The Swedish military decided to have a &quot;War game&quot; in, of all places, Djurgarden in Stockholm. Jonas was in charge of a light unit consisting of one or two armored vehicles. The outcome of the war game was already pre-decided but Jonas and the other soldiers decided that it would be fun to not play by the rules. They proceeded to &quot;capture&quot; the Gamla Stan and refused to play by the rules. Evidently the brass was not amused.</p>
<p>I think I remember Jonas mentioning a comment from one of his commanders who said that Sweden wouldn&#8217;t last 5 minutes if an invasion occurred.</p>

		<p>Slightly less than 200, actually.  That&#8217;s how Norway became Swedish (more or less) for about a 100 years.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
