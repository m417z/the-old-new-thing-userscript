<p>When <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/kclemson/">KC</a> told me about <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/kclemson/archive/2004/07/14/183334.aspx"> a trick she learned to get an area expert to respond to her email</a>, I cautioned her that the trick might backfire:</p>
<p> A friend of mine (let's call him Bob) happens also to work in the technology industry, and the manager for the part of the project he worked on was, to put it nicely, "in the wrong line of work." No matter how many times Bob would explain how the system worked on the whiteboard, his manager never really understood it. And the misunderstandings weren't just of the "oh I missed a little detail" variety; rather, they tended to elicit a "What planet are you from?" sort of reaction. Bob spent many impromptu meetings patiently trying to clear up various degrees of confusion or explaining why some clever new idea won't work because it <a href="http://www-users.cs.york.ac.uk/susan/joke/essay.htm"> violates the laws of physics as we currently understand them</a>. </p>
<p> Add to the tenuous grasp on technical concepts the uncanny ability to take all the credit when making presentations to senior management. You know the type of people I'm talking about: They're the sort who manage to skate through school by using their good looks, charming personality, and/or social status to get other people to do their homework for them. </p>
<p> One day, the manager sent out a plan to a large group of people, including some senior managers, and included in the email one of those "Huh?" questions, something akin to "... and it'll connect to the server wirelessly through the parallel port, and&mdash;hey Bob, inkjet printers can run off the parallel port, right?" </p>
<p> Bob decided that he'd had enough. He replied to the mail thread with a simple, "Yes, inkjet printers can run off the parallel port." </p>
<p> Somebody else in the group gave Bob a phone call. "Um, Bob, what do inkjet printers have to do with anything?" </p>
<p> Bob answered, "Just making sure there's enough rope." </p>
<p> Bob's colleague replied, "Gotcha." </p>
<p> The manager's tenure ended a few months later. </p>

		<p>Pi, there is an American? phrase, &quot;Enough rope to hang yourself.&quot;</p>
<p>This extends the cattle/horse related phrase, giving someone rope, which means to give them room to do what they want, because the horse would be tied to a fence but the horse could use more rope to eat in a wider area.</p>

		<p>Actually the common saying, at least here in Texas, is: &quot;If you give someone enough rope they will eventually hang themselves.&quot;</p>

		<p>Raymond mixed the metaphor into a form that isn&#8217;t the normal form &#8211; which is fine, but it requires two explanations in order to make sense of it.</p>
<p>The saying &quot;if you give someone enough rope they will eventually hang themselves&quot; suggests that if you give someone a lot of freedom to move and/or to act, they will eventually harm themselves. &nbsp;This is the sense in which &quot;rope&quot; is used in the story about Bob.</p>
<p>The phrase &quot;climb the corporate ladder&quot; usually refers to getting promoted to higher levels in a firm. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t normally hear &quot;rope&quot; associated with this ladder.</p>
<p>Combining the two metaphors makes for a clever blog title, assuming that the readers had been familiar with both metaphors separately.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not really sure about this approach. With most of the psychos (oops, I mean managers) I&#8217;ve worked with, it would end up being Bob&#8217;s fault when it didn&#8217;t work and Bob would be the one hung.</p>
<p>Obviously in this case it worked though :).</p>

		<p>I think KC&#8217;s observation is Aahz&#8217;s Law. If so, I think this reply is another example. There&#8217;s really nothing new under the sun. I expect there are old-timers out there thinking &quot;Aahz&#8217;s Law? It was *&amp;^%&#8217;s law long before that sonny!&quot;</p>
<p>On the original subject, Eric Raymond has a whole article on his site about how to ask a question.</p>

		<p>The book &quot;Snakes in Suits: When Psychopaths Go to Work&quot; by Paul Babiak and Robert D. Hare describes people similar to this manager. This one seems to be less dangerous, but it&#8217;s hard to know from this short story. The authors also warn several times to not judge someone a psychopath without proper assessment by a qualified psychologist. Anyway, I highly recommend the book. It is estimated that about 1 in 100 people has a psychopathic personality. If you belong to the rest of the population, it&#8217;s better to know something about them.</p>

		<p>Actually, when I see this on another forum, I&#8217;d just spend time telling them why &quot;foo&quot; won&#8217;t work, without specify the correct solution.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s too many questions be asked in the forum and merely make sure wrong answers don&#8217;t excape without correction is time-consuming enough.</p>
<p>So no, it won&#8217;t work. And this trick will actually decrease the time be spent on answering questions.</p>

		<p>Actually, there is *one* interpretation of that question that&#8217;s not utterly absurd.</p>
<p>If &quot;connect to the server wirelessly through the parallel port&quot; means that some dongle is attached to the parallel port, and does the actual wireless communication with the server (the client software just talks to the dongle), then the followup question could be interpreted as &quot;hang on, does that mean that you can&#8217;t connect a printer to that computer when the dongle is attached?&quot;</p>
<p>(Which is a reasonable question, and only half-true, since you could still connect a USB or network printer, or even a parallel printer with the addition of an extra port.)</p>

		<p>David is right. The manager in the story is an amateur. Make sure there&#8217;s enough rope and your job is done.</p>
<p>Those truly capable managers are Houdinis who could unhung themselves and teleport your body to the rope. You&#8217;ll be the one getting hang.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
