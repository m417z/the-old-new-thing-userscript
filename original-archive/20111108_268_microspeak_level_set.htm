<p>In mathematics, a <i>level set</i> is the set of points at which a function takes a particular value. This has nothing to do with the way the term is used at Microsoft.</p>
<p> In fact, the way the term is used at Microsoft, I have no idea what it means. But here are citations. The first is from an upper-level executive: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Before we start the meeting, let me <i>level-set</i>. Here's what we plan to accomplish today. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The next is from a presentation to a large group on some investigative work a team undertook. After the presenter spent a few minutes discussing the background of the problem: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> That's some <i>level-setting</i> on the hardware we had available for investigation. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Here are some citations from presentation slide decks: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  <b>Agenda</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>... </li>
<li>Pre-work check and Level Set </li>
<li>... </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>Initial Data gathering and Level Setting</b> </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Teams share solution overviews, roadmaps and architecture views with each other to level set. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> (Notice that <i>level-set</i> is as a verb.) </p>
<p> From what I can gather, level-setting is some sort of blend of expectation-setting and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/03/27/1956484.aspx"> calibration</a>. </p>

		<p>From those citations, to me it sounds like tried to say &quot;set the scene&quot; but missed. I.e. to give some background about something, or to put something into context.</p>

		<p>(Notice that level-set is as a verb.)</p>
<p>No, notice that &quot;set&quot; is a verb, and &quot;level&quot; here is the thing that is being set. &nbsp;Like &quot;scene setting&quot;, being the act of setting a scene, as &quot;goal setting&quot; is the act of setting goals, &quot;level setting&quot; is the act of setting a level.</p>
<p>The level of what? Well, that depends on context &#8211; for the hardware it&#39;ll probably be a level of voltage or the value of some hardware register. For the meeting, its the level of planning/achievement one hopes to achieve at the meating.</p>

		<p>We use it as establishing a baseline of expectations- In fact, the phrase is almost always &quot;Level set expectations&quot;. To level set expectations, you explain what you will do for a project, what you can asist with but someone else needs to do, and what you cannot do. It probably means &quot;set the level of expectations&quot;, but some middle mananger heard &quot;Level-set&quot; from a Math guy once, though &quot;That sounds cool, I&#39;ll (mis)-use it elsewhere!&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not really sure what &quot;Level setting hardware&quot; would be, unless the presenter was trying to explain what hardware was available so people understood what steps were taken/not taken? For example, we didn&#39;t realize the problem with Ramadigifrat Coprocessors because none of the test equipment has one.</p>

		<p>I haven&#39;t worked at Microsoft in 15 years but I assume the &quot;level&quot; is referring to job levels ie pay scales. &nbsp;When I was there we used to refer to engineers as &quot;Level X&quot; (I can&#39;t remember the actual scale) and that generally gave you a sense of what you could expect from them. &nbsp;By analogy then, setting the level of a meeting or hardware would give you a sense what you would expect from it.</p>

		<p>I think Maurits is bang on. &nbsp;As a musician &quot;setting levels&quot; (where the level to be set is the gain adjustment on each channel) is a very familiar phrase for me and the context of your examples above matches perfectly.</p>

		<p>A &quot;Level Set&quot; is done to assure that all participants share a common base of knowledge, generally about status or history or capability. &nbsp;&quot;Lets do a level set so that everyone knows how much progress we&#39;ve made&quot;. &nbsp;&quot;Lets do a level set on the new hardware to make sure everyone knows its status&quot;.</p>
<p>We were using &quot;Level Set&quot; 30 years ago in the aerospace industry. &nbsp;&quot;Set&quot; means to &quot;make and adjustment&quot; or &quot;bring to a specified value&quot;. &nbsp;&quot;Level&quot; generally meant &quot;shared knowledge&quot;.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m with HiTechHiTouch there. It has been used where I&#39;ve worked to basically bring everybody up to the same level of knowledge / background on something before digging deeper or announcing progress etc.</p>
<p>For the same reasons it&#39;s also commonly tied to the concept of expectations to ensure that all parties gave the same understanding of a project&#39;s goals.</p>
<p>YMMV.</p>

		<p>I assumed it came from the audio world; the actor says his line (or &quot;test: one, two three&quot;) and the sound engineer *sets* the gain on the actor&#39;s mike so that, when done, all of the audio is at around the same *level*.</p>

		<p>Allright, the truth is that this feature is a bug-farm. So lets level-set here. We should be dogfooding the beta releases more and making sure that PMs report through to their seniors in the event of an planned unplanned outage. Teams should also look at recycling bits and leveraging hipos such that we achieve shorter release cadences.</p>

		<p>If I may be so bold, I&#39;m suggesting that it comes from audio: &nbsp; when an audio engineer sets the levels in a multitrack recording setting, he&#39;s setting the gain on all the different sources so they share the same reference level.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
