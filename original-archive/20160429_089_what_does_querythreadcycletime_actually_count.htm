<p>
A customer wanted some clarification on the
<code>Query&shy;Thread&shy;Cycle&shy;Time</code> function.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
Based on the name, it suggests that it counts CPU cycles,
but they observed that when the power profile is set to
Balanced (which lets the CPU run at low frequencies when
there is low demand),
the thread cycle time increases twice as fast as when the
power profile is set to
High Performance (which sets the CPU to run at full speed all the time),
even though the same code is executing in both scenarios.
If it's the same code, shouldn't the cycle times be comparable?
The function appears to be measuring elapsed time, not cycle time.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms684943(v=vs.85).aspx">
The documentation for the
<code>Query&shy;Thread&shy;Cycle&shy;Time</code> function
function</a>
contains this caveat:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
Do not attempt to convert the CPU clock cycles returned by
<b>Query&shy;Thread&shy;Cycle&shy;Time</b>
to elapsed time.
This function uses timer services provided by the CPU,
which can vary in implementation.
For example,
some CPUs will vary the frequency of the timer
when changing the frequency at which the CPU runs
and others will leave it at a fixed rate.
The behavior of each CPU is described
in the documentation provided by the CPU vendor.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This function uses the CPU's cycle counter instruction.
For x86 and x64 processors, this means <code>RDTSC</code>.
And
<a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Stamp_Counter">
according to Wikipedia</a>,
recent Intel processors fall into the second category,
where the time stamp counter runs at a fixed rate regardless
of CPU speed.
This means that when the CPU is running at reduced speed,
it can execute fewer instructions per counter.
From the point of view of the program, it looks like the
time stamp counter is running at a higher rate.
</p>
<p>
So what does
<code>Query&shy;Thread&shy;Cycle&shy;Time</code> actually count?
</p>
<p>
The answer is "Whatever the CPU wants."</p>

		<p>Well, that&#8217;s easy enough, just do it the way Raymond did. Do a CPUID, and programatically download the referenced Wikipedia page. Use an appropriate English knowledge-parsing AI to read it and determine what your CPU does.</p>

		<p>I wondered the same thing. </p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t try to interpret this information.  You do not need to know what type of timer implementation the CPU has.&#8221;</p>
<p>The CPU timer implementation could change from one minute to the next.</p>

		<p>RDTSC is what every Task Manager since 2000 has displayed in the CPU Time column. NT4 might&#8217;ve use RDTSC or the system clock, I&#8217;m not sure, but it also had CPU Time. The OS itself does the tracking, by keeping track of RDTSC (originally via regular QueryPerformanceCounter/QueryPerformanceFrequency calls, now inserted into all context switches) per-application and dealing with all of the necessary calculations to figure out what it means, except in Vista/2008, where it was changed to use the chipset HPET or ACPI timers, which are high-latency but always constant. 7/2008R2 and up will now use _either_ RDTSC or the chipset timer, after determining whether RDTSC is now constant or not on startup. (Or maybe it has a giant list of hardware, I don&#8217;t know.) 8 and 10 haven&#8217;t changed this.</p>

		<p>If performance &gt; accuracy, then QueryThreadCycleTime should be &#8220;good enough&#8221; as long as you understand the gotchas.  If accuracy &gt; performance, then the performance counters make more sense.</p>

		<p>IMHO the name of this function contains 2 errors since its not about thread and its not about CPU cycles. So Instead of Query­Thread­Cycle­Time it should be called QueryCPUTimeStamp</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s still not quite right, because QueryThreadCPUTimeStamp sounds like it gets the absolute timestamp for the CPU the thread is currently on. But really, it gets the cumulative timestamp for all of the CPUs the thread has run on, for the time the thread was running on that CPU. (Also, naming the function after the rdtsc instruction works only for CPUs that have a rdtsc instruction in the first place, and only for machines where rdtsc is in fact the source of the cycle counter.) The existing name is wrong but it&#8217;s least wrong.</p>

<p>The existing name cannot be removed in any case, so it&#8217;s a moot point. Einstein proved that time is not constant, so it&#8217;s fine :-)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
