<p> All of these special values have one thing in common: If you see them, it's probably a bug. Typically they will arise when somebody <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/08/27/54710.aspx"> fails to do proper error checking and ends up treating an error code as if it were a valid return value</a>.

		<p>Why do FILETIMEs start in 1601?  Leap years follow a 400 year cycle, with 1600, 2000, etc. being the &quot;most significant&quot; special case.  If you base your dates on one of these dates plus one (i.e. 1601, 2001, etc.) then the calculation to convert the numeric value to a year is very slightly simplified (you save yourself a single subtraction.)  And 1601 was the most recent such date when Windows NT was developed.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t actually know if this is the real reason 1601 was chosen, but it seems plausible.<br /></p>

		<p>I believe that the 1601 is related to the gregorian calendar, or something like that.</p>
<p>And the world ending on Jan 19, 2038 only happens on Unix systems.  NT&#8217;s good until 30,000 or so.</p>
<p>Yet another reason to switch &#8211; dates don&#8217;t run out as quickly :)<br /></p>

		<p>Seeing a zero in a CLR DateTime is not that unusual, as that value is often used in place of null. It&#8217;s the value returned by DateTime.MinValue. In my opinion it was a design mistake to make DateTime a value type instead of a ref type.</p>

		<p>Er&#8230;  Why does 0x80000000 as a time_t mean 1901, while 0xFFFFFFFF as a time_t mean 2106?  Shouldn&#8217;t they both be either signed or unsigned?  It looks like 0xFFFFFFFF was interpreted as unsigned, while 0x80000000 was interpreted as signed.</p>
<p>(Both dates should be before midnight, Jan. 1, 1970, since they&#8217;re both negative.  0xFFFFFFFF should be one second before it, while 0x80000000 should probably be exactly what was posted.  Alternately, interpreting them both as unsigned would mean that 0x80000000 would be just after Jan. 19, 2038, and 0xFFFFFFFF would probably be what was posted.)</p>
<p>Not that I think many Unix-like systems would actually allow you to use negative time_t&#8217;s (see Serge&#8217;s comment above), but any given Unix-like system should treat them either as unsigned (and allow them), or signed (and possibly return errors).  Not both.</p>

		<p>Er, time_t isn&#8217;t a Unix thing &#8212; its a C thing.</p>
<p>I am sure most Unixes/Linux doesn&#8217;t use time_t internally &#8230; just like Windows doesn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Only signed 32-bit time_t runs out in 2038.</p>
<p>Many C environments have a time64_t (which is of course 64 bits) &#8211; eg:<br />

		<p>Bryan: Yes, sometimes the value is signed and sometimes it&#8217;s unsigned. The interpretation should be clear from context. </p>
<p>&quot;Any given unix-like system should treat them either as unsigned or signed, not both.&quot;</p>
<p>Right, but you the end user might have to deal multiple machines, some which use the signed interpretation and some which use the unsigned interpretation. So I included both, because the goal of the table was to show everything you might encounter. Writing &quot;The value 0x80000000 as a time_t when interpreted on a system for which time_t is a signed type&quot; would have been more precise but would have cluttered the table with information that really isn&#8217;t relevant to the main point: Recognizing sentinel values.</p>

		<p>Ah, many thanks.  I ran into a &quot;30 Dec 1899&quot; and the *only* guess I had come up with was that it was a Saturday.  Which might make certain day-of-the-week computations easier.</p>

		<p>time_t is a signed integer for historical reasons:<br />
<br />&#8211; dates all the way back to when C didn&#8217;t have unsigned integers<br />
<br />&#8211; unix&#8217;s time_t is signed and the year 2038 is plenty enough of time to switch over to 64 bits. Today&#8217;s programmers will be either dead or retired in that year, so it&#8217;s somebody else&#8217;s problem<br />
<br />&#8211; lots of crappy programmers assume it&#8217;s signed and do subtraction on it instead of using difftime and expect it to be a negative value if the dates are backwards (even though this doesn&#8217;t handle large distances correctly)<br />
<br />&#8211; functions return (clock_t)-1 on error and due to C&#8217;s (IMHO stupid) way of doing arithmetic conversions on the comparison operators, this can result in the wrong result on some platforms under certain conditions</p>
<p>C trivia: time_t/clock_t are allowed to be any arithmetic type including an unsigned integer or floating point type.<br /></p>

  All of these special values have one thing<br />

<p>All except one.  If you see the special value December 31, 1969, it&#8217;s probably intentional.  Still unwanted but usually intentional.</p>

  <br />&gt; 1600, 2000, etc. being the &quot;most significant&quot;<br />
  <br />&gt; special case.</p>
<p>Actually only 2000 is, so far.  1600 is useful for computational purposes by pretending that it was part of the same cycle, but when Christians were counting 1600 years Pope Gregory hadn&#8217;t been invented yet.

		<p>Yay, so in another 33 years we&#8217;ll have another possible Y2K! Ok guys, this time we make it right! We need to scare the crap out of everyday users about the EOW so that they pay us a lot of money for fixing it!<br />
<br />We must henceforth use signed time_t for all times and dates in our software, especially any software going into nuclear reactors!</p>

		<p>In VC8 (Whidbey) which just RTMed (WooHoo!), we widened time_t to 64 bits by default. It is still signed. </p>
<p>You can use a #define to switch back to 32 bit time. </p>
<p>We also provide specifically named time functions for the 32 bit and 64 bit versions of the type.</p>

<p>Yikes.  I was 100 years off.  I&#8217;d better stop relying on memory before talking about non-computer stuff that way.</p>
<p>I even have enough discipline to look up which argument is which in functions like memcpy almost every time I use them (because memcpy and bcopy had them in opposite orders and if I try to remember which is which then I&#8217;ll remember wrong).  So I really was out of line by not looking up centuries.  I am duly chastised.</p>
<p>Geez, a century.  That might even be enough time for Windows Vista beta 1 checked build to finish installing itself.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
