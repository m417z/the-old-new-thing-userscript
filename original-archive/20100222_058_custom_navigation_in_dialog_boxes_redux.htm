<p>SuperBK asks, "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#771057">What's the proper way to add keyboard support to a dialog box?</a>"</p>
<p> There are many options available to you. The most traditional way is to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/07/406012.aspx"> pick them off in the dialog loop</a>, either hard-coding the keys in code or putting them into resources by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/08/406509.aspx"> moving them to an accelerator resource</a>. Moving them to an accelerator resource is a good idea if the keys are subject to translation (for example, if they are mnemonic). On the other hand, picking them off in code is your only choice if the action you want to take cannot be mapped to a <code>WM_COMMAND</code> message (or if you simply don't feel like creating such a mapping). </p>
<p> SuperBK appears to be using MFC, a framework I have only cursory familiarity with, so I'll accept that the MFC way of customizing the dialog loop is to use <code>PreTranslateMessage</code>. </p>
<p> One issue that was raised was the case where a keyboard accelerator is active only when a certain window has keyboard focus. But if that's your design, then you don't need to mess with the dialog loop at all. For example, the space bar pushes a button, but only if focus is on the button. There is no special code in the dialog loop to accomplish this; it's just part of the button control's <code>WM_KEYDOWN</code> message handler. </p>
<p> This is one of those cases where you discovered a hammer and start seeing everything as a nail. When the user presses a key, the keyboard message is posted to the window that has keyboard focus. You don't have to do any special work to pick it off, because it'll get to that window anyway if you just leave it alone. </p>
<p> In SuperBK's specific example, the list box should behave a certain way if it has focus and the user hits VK_RETURN. Okay, well, <code>VK_RETURN</code> is a special keyboard navigation key for dialog boxes, so you need to tell the dialog manager, "No, I want this key to go to me." Just have the control return <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/11/26/55872.aspx"> <code>DLGC_WANTMESSAGE</code></a> in response to <code>WM_GETDLGCODE</code> if the message is a press of the <code>VK_RETURN</code> key. The dialog manager will let the message go through to the window, and then the window can perform its custom <code>VK_RETURN</code> action. </p>

		<p>As one of those people who only have a hammer :-( &#8230; It looks like MFC just told us off with this?</p>
<p>WM_GETDLGCODE has meaningfull wParam and lParam, but CWnd::OnGetDlgCode has none of that.</p>
<p>Anyone used OnGetDlgCode? Help?</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Perhaps CWnd::GetCurrentMessage will help? (I don&#8217;t know; I don&#8217;t use MFC. I just browsed the methods and that one looked promising.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>@Goran: &nbsp;I&#8217;ve wondered how to do this for so long and never even thought about GetCurrentMessage, but I just updated some code to use this and it does indeed work.</p>
<p>@Raymond: &nbsp;Thank you.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
