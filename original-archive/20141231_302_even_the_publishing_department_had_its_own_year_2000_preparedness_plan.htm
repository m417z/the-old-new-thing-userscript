<p> I'm told that Microsoft Press also had its own Year 2000 plan. They staffed their helpline continuously from Friday evening December 31, 1999 all the way through Sunday, January 2, 2000. They did this even though Microsoft Press did not normally staff its helpline ouside normal business hours, and even though all sample code in all publications come with a disclaimer that they are provided "as is" with no warranty. </p>
<p> I do not know if they took any calls, but I suspect not. </p>

		<p>Where I worked did end up having a y2k issue. &nbsp;Certificate checking for SSL connections went wonky in a 16 bit Windows client. &nbsp;32 bit Windows code plus a whole bunch of Unix code was fine.</p>

		<p>It seems they thought ahead and used only Y2K-complient paper.</p>

		<p>@David H: 2000-ply?</p>
<p>I wonder if they tried having any dry-runs of their Y2K helpline, and if so, what possible support issues they thought up. &quot;Help! My MS Press book on Office 95 is suddenly ambiguous and might be from 95 years in the future, ship me corrective stickers ASAP!&quot;</p>

		<p>The company I was working for was really pushy about making all of the products y2k-compliant, even when the &quot;problems&quot; had no real effect on the program or data. The funny thing was that on our web site, you either saw Jan 1, 19200 or Jan 1, 192000 for a few days, depending on your browser. There wasn&#39;t even much of a reason to display the date on the web page.</p>

		<p>@jas88: I think Microsoft Press&#39;s online store could potentially be affected (like shipment enquiry, etc.)</p>

		<p>If only they had planned better for the 2014-&gt;2015 transition&#8230; at the stroke of midnight, SmartGlass crashed and as of this moment, still will not launch on Windows PCs or Phones.</p>

		<p>Did some of the MS Press books also included CDs with installable software?</p>
<p>Then having a help line manned during the Y2K transition period makes perfect sense.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
