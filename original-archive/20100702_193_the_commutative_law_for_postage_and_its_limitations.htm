<p>The college professor who carried on a letter exchange with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/05/29/610090.aspx"> a kind pensioner who proved that the speed of light could be exceeded</a> told me of another letter exchange, this time with another professional mathematician.</p>
<p> The letter came from England, and it accompanied some sort of document or artifact that the correspondent wanted the college professor to look over and return. The mathematician took the effort of including a <a href="http://www.royalmail.com/gear/shop/html/shopProductPopUp.jsp?product=prod78610010"> stamped</a> return envelope with the remark, "By the commutative law for postage, I have placed the same amount of postage on the return envelope as I have on the outgoing envelope." </p>
<p> The professor, however, could not use the return envelope the correspondent provided. He explained, "Unfortunately, the commutative law for postage does not apply to correspondence between the United States and the United Kingdom due to events of <a href="http://www.ushistory.org/declaration/document/image.htm"> slightly more than 200 years ago</a>." </p>

		<p>I hate it when they just spring new laws on people without an adequate grace period. It boils the blood.</p>

		<p>There actually is a way to do this called an &quot;international reply coupon&quot; ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_reply_coupon" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/International_reply_coupon</a> ).</p>
<p>It just does not let you apply the postage beforehand.</p>

		<p>Breaking the speed of light:</p>
<p>I once gathered data with traceroute and ping. traceroute said the machine was in Africa and ping said 20ms ping time.</p>
<p>I had the good sense to know something was afoot.</p>

		<p>Indeed that only meant that your connection was better than the conection of the computer currently viewing google, 1 of the 9 or so. Had that not been the case you would not have been able to use tracer T to identify the the ip of the other google connections.</p>

		<p>Well, I can&#39;t reply to to post you linked from 2006, but on the general topic of mental illness&#8230;</p>
<p>I have a friend who alternatly sufferers/enjoys bi-polar disorder, and a common theme in paranoid rants is large numbers. In a book he has about angels it says things like there are 374,487,140,228 angels, including 12,873,402 serafim, 45,092,839 cherubs&#8230;</p>
<p>Precision without Accuracy sums it up.</p>

<p>Raymond was kind enough to point us to other OS tools to do the same thing, too.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
