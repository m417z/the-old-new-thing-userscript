<p>         During Windows 95, when we were building the Plug and Play infrastructure, we got         an angry letter from a hardware vendor (who shall remain nameless) complaining that         we intentionally misspelled their company name in our INF files in a manner that made         their company name similar to an insulting word.      </p>
<p>         This is of course a very serious accusation, and we set to work to see what happened.         It didn't take long to find the misspelling. The question now was why we spelled it         wrong.      </p>
<p>         Further investigation revealed that the reason the company name was misspelled is         that they misspelled their own name in their hardware devices' firmware. When Plug         and Play asked the device for its manufacturer name, it replied with the misspelled         name. So of course our INF file had to have an entry with the misspelled name so that         we could identify the device when the user connected it. (The name displayed to the         user did not contain the misspelling.)      </p>
<p>         We sent a very polite letter to the company explaining the reason for the misspelling.         As far as I am aware, they never brought up the subject again.      </p>

<p>I have an OSR 2 CD lying around at home somewhere. Not sure if I have 950 though. I&#8217;ll skim thru the INF files and see what I can find :)</p>

		<p>OK, I have nearly gone blind. I have scanned 147 .inf files in the original Win95 distro.</p>
<p>I found one misspelled company name. It&#8217;s a Japanese company. I suspect the unintended word is another Japanese word, and I&#8217;ll venture a further guess, thanks to some translation sites on the web, that the unintended word is slang for a body part. Or something like that. Or maybe it means doo-doo. I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>Raymond, please put me out of my misery. I can&#8217;t see anymore.</p>

		<p>Mike, you must post your guess before Raymond reveals the answer. Otherwise, how do we know you truly deserve our awe? :-)</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t speak Japanese, but I heard on NPR once that in Japan, they&#8217;re nick-named &quot;manashita&quot;, which means &quot;they copied&quot;.  I guess they&#8217;re more known for iteration than innovation.</p>

		<p>I guess it&#8217;s interesting to know that this (if it really *is* Matsushita) is that it continues even now.</p>
<p>For example, my laptop&#8217;s DVD/CD-RW drive appears in WinXP Device Manager as a &quot;MATSHITA &#8230;..&quot;</p>

		<p>MATSHITA may not be that misspelling, just the SCSI device vendor name should be in eight or less characters, I believe.</p>

		<p>When a name is abbreviated to 8 Italian characters in order to work with an 8-character limitation, the act of abbreviation is not necessarily a misspelling.  Surely every customer of Micros~1 already knows this.</p>
<p>I do wonder why Matsushita didn&#8217;t choose Matusita as its vendor name, since this would have avoided the need to abbreviate.</p>
<p>As for sounding rude, of course any Japanese name that contains the word meaning &quot;under&quot;, and the past tense of any Japanese verb that includes the word meaning &quot;to do&quot;, would sound rude in English.  The English name &quot;Debbie&quot; is laughable in Japan, though not necessarily rude (&quot;Hi, my name is Fatso&quot;).  Try presenting a German with a gift and just say the word &quot;gift&quot; without any hint that you&#8217;re an English speaker.  Things like this just happen.</p>
<p>So what was actually the misspelling?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
