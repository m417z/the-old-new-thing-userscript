<p> Manufacturer of commercial and home blenders Blendtec has produced a marketing web site <a href="http://www.willitblend.com/"> Will It Blend?</a> which features short videos of the company's CEO and new <a href="http://www.deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,650206639,00.html"> Internet blending icon</a> Tom Dickson throwing all sorts of unusual objects into one of their blenders, to see what happens. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/profile_videos?user=Blendtec">The videos are also on YouTube</a>, and of course they have a blog, cleverly titled <a href="http://www.willitblend.com/blog/"> Will it Blog?</a>) </p>
<p> There's <a href="http://www.utahbusiness.com/parser.php?nav=article&amp;article_id=2346"> a miniature profile of Tom Dickson</a> in <i>Utah Business Magazine</i>. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> When Jamba Juice told Dickson the $14,000 blender package was too expensive, he cut them a deal, asking simply for a nickel of every sale. Now, with 50 million smoothies sold each year, Dickson says it was one of the best deals he ever made. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> "Will It Blend?" is sort of a blender-themed entry in the style of David Letterman's crowd-pleasing stunts such as "Throwing things off the roof," "Crushing things in a pneumatic press," and <a href="http://www.ddy.com/dl21.html"> "Will it Float?</a>" (I suspect that only guys find this stuff fascinating.) </p>

		<p>&quot;Will it Float?&quot; is the pinnacle of this business.</p>
<p>&quot;Will it Blend?&quot; is nothing, and will be nothing until they bring in a grinder girl and a hula girl</p>

		<p>My wife loves &quot;Will it Float?&quot;, and she&#8217;s pretty girly, so I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s entirely a guy thing.</p>
<p>I, of course, am just in love with grinder girl.</p>

		<p>My Mom still teases me about how I was &quot;too literal-minded&quot; when I was four years old. &nbsp;She tells a story of making a birthday cake for my brother. &nbsp;At one point we were mixing ingredients and the recipe called for shaved orange rind. &nbsp;My mom said smilingly &quot;time to put in the orange.&quot; &nbsp;Naturally I picked up the orange on the counter and plopped it into the running mixer. &nbsp;It didn&#8217;t mix. &nbsp;Maybe if we had had one of these fancy blenders&#8230;</p>

		<p>It should be noted that the &quot;Will It Blend&quot; Web site was originally inspired by the venerable British educational programme &quot;Is It Emulsifiable?&quot;</p>

		<p>I *heart* the Grinder Girl too.</p>
<p>Those blenders at Jamba aren&#8217;t all that. They work fine for a month or two, but inevitably they stop blending well. You can tell this has happened when the blender jockeys have to bang the pitcher on the table and stop/restart/switch blenders five times before the stuff gets blended enough to be drinkable.</p>

		<p>Hi,</p>
<p>what I find most interesting about these (ingenious) video clips is that this must be the cheapest way possible to advertise for a product while still being highly effective.</p>
<p>Think of it: The blenders wasted are probably engineering samples or defective, rebuilt devices. Spreading them over YouTube doesn&#8217;t cost them a penny neither for placing them there nor for the bandwith.</p>
<p>And finally the videos are so unique that they get picked up by the press which leads to free PR.</p>
<p>Still: The blenders are good and the videos the greatest thing ever, so I&#8217;m happy for them.</p>
<p>Philip</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
