<p> If you haven't figured it out by now, it's a humor book, but it's the sort of madcap insane geek humor that has enough truth in it to make you laugh more. </p>
<p> My favorite is the first exercise from the first chapter: Connect the dots.  (Warning: It's harder than it looks!) </p>

		<p>&quot;In his new book Carlton Egremont III brings the complex topic of ActiveX to a new audience &#8211; a target group with the combined intelligence of a sack of creme caramels&quot;</p>
<p>I thought VB programmers were the original target audience for ActiveX.<br /></p>

		<p>Hmm COM.<br />
<br />  I have to say that while COM may be very well implemented for what it was designed to do, I&#8217;ve seen it misused so much that nowadays I just assume that any usage of COM will be just as bad.</p>
<p>  Most of the misuse orients around using COM to do things that the language the application is written in can already do, thus resulting in an ugly great big interface between the application and the code in the COM object.</p>
<p>  I can only think of two good reasons why one would want to use COM:<br />
<br />  &#8211; If you want to allow future third party code into your program at some point using some well known working model. ie. the job that OLE was orignially designed for<br />
<br />  &#8211; If you want to do object handling across a network (because hey, you will prolly have to use an external library of some kind to do this any way and DCOM is prolly as good as any other )</p>
<p>  Rant over.</p>

&lt;br&gt;application and the code in the COM object. &amp;quot;<br />
&lt;br&gt;</code></p>
<p>I beg to differ. From a c++ perspective, COM was the next best thing to sliced bread. It gave most c++ grunts a view of the bright and shiny world of design patterns, and reintroduced most to contract based programming.</p>
<p>I dont do COM any more. I&#8217;ve switched over to .Net for most dev work. But lately I&#8217;ve had to write some stuff in c++, lisp and python. And I needed to get all my stuff talking to each other. And guess what? I didnt do COM exactly, but something pretty much close to it. In fact you might say I&#8217;ve been &quot;inspired&quot; by it :)</p>
<p>And its nice that someone has brought out a fun book on COM, I think I&#8217;ll gift it to my Mom :))</p>

<p>Agree. A while back, I&#8217;ve seen some code written by a third-party software company which started by defining its own COM classes for things like BOOL, INT, LONG, String types, and so on and so forth. That was the weirdest COM abuse ever&#8230;<br />

		<p>I never again use COM if there is an option, after I found out that even Microsoft themselves have released (production software) COM interfaces with the same ID&#8217;s but with changed interfaces (see the Kodak component, and compare between Win9x and NT4).</p>
<p>Once I realized MS themselves abused their own rules to such an extent (we were bitten by it, and *not* happy I might add), I got validation of my strong suspicion that COM was really nothing more than the VB &quot;programmers&quot; playground. Having seen the incredible slowdown of even OS-components due to COM usage, when a plain DLL and a C interface would have been a way better match, I have given up.</p>
<p>Another reason to dislike it, is that it&#8217;s the major source of installing NT4+ takes such an extrordinary amount of time (while often idling CPU for long periods!).</p>
<p>ActiveX was cool, when it was presented as the alternative to the VB controls (CBX, or something like that), but it really sucks donkey when you actually need to use it and realize how badly it really is designed and integrated into the rest of the Windows UI.</p>

		<p>Personally, I think COM is awesome &#8211; its one of the few ways you can use native code in an ASP page, for example.</p>
<p>Most of its problems come from (some teams in) MS&#8217;s own abuse it in overcomplicated APIs (ActiveX,DirectShow).</p>
<p>Its hilarious to walk through the MS docs coming across something like &quot;Although technically in violation of COM rules&quot;, lol.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directshow/htm/iasyncreaderrequest.asp" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directshow/htm/iasyncreaderrequest.asp</a></p>
<p>Not only that, but as an example, there are numerous interfaces to get an embedded ActiveX WMP.  You&#8217;ve got IActiveMovie/2/3, IMediaPlayer/2 and the ALLNEW 10 SDK which has a ton of relatively useless interfaces.  The 3rd activemovie only contains get_MediaPlayer, which you could have used QueryInterface for..</p>
<p>Making an ActiveX container is relatively (compared to an actual control) easy though, which is kind of nice I guess.  Making an actual ActiveX control though is pretty much a waste of (a lot of) time&#8230;</p>

		<p>WikiServer Guy:  Actually I&#8217;m not 100% certain, but I suspect that the MediaPlayer property on the IActiveMovie3 is because the IActiveMovie3 object isn&#8217;t a IMediaPlayer.  Instead, the IActiveMovie3 is associated with an IMediaPlayer, in which the MediaPlayer property is appropriate.<br /></p>

		<p>Hi Larry,</p>
<p>&gt; WikiServer Guy: Actually I&#8217;m not 100%<br />
<br />&gt; certain, but I suspect that the MediaPlayer<br />
<br />&gt; property on the IActiveMovie3 is because the<br />
<br />&gt; IActiveMovie3 object isn&#8217;t a IMediaPlayer.<br />
<br />&gt; Instead, the IActiveMovie3 is associated<br />
<br />&gt; with an IMediaPlayer, in which the<br />
<br />&gt; MediaPlayer property is appropriate. </p>
<p>Except not only is QueryInterface easier, but the interface you get with get_ActiveMovie isn&#8217;t really a IActiveMovie &#8211; apparently (and this is a guess because I just stuck with QueryInterface) you can only make idispatch calls (I assume the nasty DISPATCH_PROPERTY stuff that gives COM its bad name) through the freakish thing &#8211; even querying the interface for an IActiveMovie returns E_NOINTERFACE! (And of course this means calling an IActiveMovie method on it crashes your application &#8211; I know the hard way!  I googled for like an hour just to find out that you could just query the mediaplayer).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure its some kind of fundamental misunderstanding of COM on my part though, who knows, LOL :).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
