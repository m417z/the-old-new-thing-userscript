<p>Back in 2002, I noted with some fascination the opening of <a href="http://www.jerryspringertheopera.com/"> <i>Jerry Springer: The Opera</i></a> in London. (Here's <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/17/magazine/17SPRINGER.html"> coverage in the <i>New York Times</i></a>. If you're going to skim the article, at least skim all the way to the end, wherein the real Jerry Springer is asked for his opinion.)</p>
<p> Opening with the onstage studio audience chanting "Jer-ry! Jer-ry!", a parade of guests sing about being jilted by a lesbian dwarf or having a diaper fetish or wanting to start a career as a lap dancer as Jerry Springer himself presides over the mayhem.  Amid the chaos, the host is shot and killed. </p>
<p> And that's just Act One. </p>
<p> Jesus doesn't appear until Act Two. </p>
<p> I am not making this up. </p>
<p> And now it's made it across the Atlantic for <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=16874849"> a special two-night engagement at Carnegie Hall</a>. </p>
<p> <b>Pre-emptive snarky comment</b>: "<a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0001011/2005/09/10.html#a11100">Steve Ballmer should go on the Jerry Springer show</a>." </p>

		<p>I am convinced that everybody who appears as a guest on Jerry Springer is a paid actor. &nbsp;Maybe it was genuine at first, but after a while people must have caught on. &nbsp;Think about it; nobody appearing on Jerry Springer ever gets good news. &nbsp;It&#8217;s always a slutty housewife cheating on her husband with a drunk midget transvestite or a slutty teenage daughter introducing her ashamed parents to the train of 8 burly men she rides every night.</p>
<p>The type of people who watch Jerry Springer know two things: if Publishers Clearing House is knocking on your door, it&#8217;s good news; if Jerry Springer is knocking on your door, it&#8217;s bad news. &nbsp;I cannot imagine anyone would willingly appear on Jerry Springer.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if these people are not actors I have a suggestion. &nbsp;Presumably Jerry Springer has a list of everyone who has ever appeared on his show. &nbsp;By sending these people (and all their offspring, just to be safe) directly into the sun the human condition should improve tremendously.</p>

		<p>Can I just chip in my tuppence and say I&#8217;m a huge fan of Jerry Springer: The Opera. I saw it during it&#8217;s UK tour and have rarely laughed so hard. I heartily recommend that anyone who&#8217;s able to go to see this does.</p>
<p>You might also not be aware of the controversy surrounding the broadcast of a live recording on BBC2 (see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://snipurl.com/1xk41" rel="nofollow">http://snipurl.com/1xk41</a>) and the protests over it&#8217;s national tour of the UK (see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://snipurl.com/1xk49" rel="nofollow">http://snipurl.com/1xk49</a>).</p>

		<p>THIS is one of the reasons I read your wonderful quips EVERY workday RIGHT when I come in in the morning. &nbsp;I need something to wake me up.</p>
<p>This entry most certainly has.</p>
<p>Not since when you wrote about &quot;that guy who drove his truck on the roof&quot; have I splattered my monitor with sooo much tea.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s face it. &nbsp;We come here for win32. &nbsp;</p>
<p>But we keep coming here for stuff like THIS :)</p>
<p>Thank you, SIR!</p>

		<p>Weird! I live in the UK and always assumed JS:TO was a US export like the show it was based on.</p>

		<p>Please, please have this go on to Seattle or get made into a movie so I can see it!</p>
<p>And if they can dumb it down a bit so I don&#8217;t have to learn what words like &quot;coloratura&quot; mean, I&#8217;d appreciate it.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve seen this, I&#8217;d go back. It was worth the half-price. Hopefully it&#8217;ll stop by Seattle.</p>

		<p>@mikeb: It is available on Region 1 DVD (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://snipurl.com/1xlit" rel="nofollow">http://snipurl.com/1xlit</a>) if you have a compatible player. And it&#8217;s more an episode of Jerry Springer turned into an opera than an opera turned into an episode of Jerry Springer. Coloratura is never even mentioned ;)</p>

		<p>Towards the end of last year, a religious group tried to prosecute the Director General of the BBC (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Thompson" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Thompson</a>) for Blashpemy. They lost in the High Court in a judgement which gutted (the already gutless) blaphemy laws. As a result the British Government has effectively agreed to repeal them.</p>

		<p>@Mark: thanks for the pointer &#8211; I should have thought to do a search&#8230; &nbsp;Oh, why can&#8217;t Raymond do all this work for us ahead of time?</p>
<p>So lets see, with today&#8217;s exchange rate &#163;4 would cipher out to about as much as going to see it in person &#8211; guess I&#8217;m good then!</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
