		<p>English can often verb its nouns, but the verb &quot;to family&quot; does not family well with my sense of English style.</p>

		<p>I know that &quot;Microspeaks&quot; are not exclusive to Microsoft, but this one is the last straw! &nbsp;If I heard someone say &quot;they don&#39;t family well&quot; I&#39;d probably punch him in face and say &quot;That&#39;s for ruining English!&quot;</p>
<p>Perhaps we can put in a company suggestion requiring that Microsoft employees be forced to hang out with regular non-programmer types for a while just to keep the damage done to the English language at a minimum.</p>

		<p>The reason we fnd this so disturbing is that this idiom doesn&#39;t add anything to the language, and is actually much more clunky than the word consistent, which can be easily negated.</p>
<p>It also is a very active word for a completely passive concept.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t know what you guys are talking about. This novel verb families well with other English zero-derivations. (And Pitor, what, linguistically speaking, do you mean with &quot;active word&quot; and &quot;passive concept&quot;? How is this different from &quot;harmonize&quot; or &quot;fit in,&quot; which are undoubtedly fine with you? I suspect you mean the lack of semantic Agency on the synactic subject, but this is hardly unique to these verbs.)</p>

		<p>Right, so the Office 2013 user interface is supposed to family well with the Metro UI that Windows 8 has. &nbsp;Yet, since I hate, hate, hate, all-uppercase menus, I&#39;ll have to see how long I can stay with Office 2010. &nbsp;Sigh. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I use Excel so much, and the Excel 2013 interface is so visually horrible, but there&#39;s nothing I can do about it.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t family well with the Metro UI.</p>

		<p>As Raymond mentioned a couple times, this is a term used by designers. Designers regulary talk about font families, color families, etc. This is just an extension of that sort of usage.</p>

		<p>@DWalker &#8212; There is plenty of reason to hate the Office UI (for me the main pain is a tossup between is that it is hard to tell which part of a scroll bar is the thumb tracker and which is the tray part and several parts of the UI which have adjacent white background elements with missing or very faint borders making it hard to tell where one element ends and the next begins).</p>
<p>At least the menus can at least be rectified by manually renaming each menu (under Customize Ribbon)</p>

		<p>I&#39;ll show my age here &#8212; again.</p>
<p>In my world, nouns are nouns and verbs are verbs. &nbsp;They are not interchangeable. &nbsp;Using a noun as a verb or doing the opposite merely shows a lack of education or disipline.</p>
<p>BTW, &quot;trending&quot; is not a word and it drives me crazy as well.</p>

		<p>@ skuggi</p>
<p>There are some words that are relatively new to the language that started out as both nouns and verbs &#8212; at least as far a common usage goes. &nbsp;The best example that I know is &quot;email&quot;. &nbsp;It is used as a nound and as a verb almost universally. &nbsp;I try to use it as a noun, but I slip up from time to time and use it as a verb.</p>

		<p>@12BitSlab &#8211; It doesn&#39;t really show your age.</p>
<p>&quot;Through the ages, language mavens have &nbsp;deplored &nbsp;the &nbsp;way &nbsp;English &nbsp;speakers convert &nbsp;nouns &nbsp;into verbs. (&#8230;) In fact, easy conversion of nouns to verbs has been part of English grammar for centuries; it is one of &nbsp;the &nbsp;processes &nbsp;that &nbsp;make English &nbsp;English. I have estimated that about a fifth of all English verbs were originally nouns.&quot;</p>

		<p>@Skuggi and 12BitSlab&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure that mail and salt are used as nouns and verbs. &nbsp;Rather they are used in grammatically incorrect fashion, which is never-the-less comprehensible.</p>
<p>We don&#39;t &quot;mail letters&quot; (or &quot;email messages&quot;). &nbsp;We send letters/messages, and the method of transport by which they are delivered is mail/email.</p>
<p>i.e. &quot;I emailed you&quot; or &quot;I mailed you a letter&quot; are simply shorthand, grammatically incorrect forms of &quot;I sent you a message by email&quot; and &quot;I sent you a letter in the mail&quot;.</p>
<p>Then again, words &#8211; their very existence, meaning and usage &#8211; are fluid. &nbsp;Usage informs definition as much as, or perhaps even more than, definition prescribes usage. &nbsp;So give it time, and all of us will be/will have been correct. &nbsp;:)</p>

		<p>People, movement to/from noun &lt;-&gt; verb is neither uncommon nor incorrect in English or any other language. It&#39;s a regular linguistic process. There&#39;s no reason to condemn it. </p>
<p>That said, not *every* conversion makes sense or emerges elegant. &quot;To family&quot; certainly is a less successful example.</p>

		<p>@SimonRev: &nbsp;Thanks for that tip about renaming the menus. &nbsp;Now if I could get the colors fixed, that would be great and I can embrace Excel 2013!</p>

		<p>If &#39;mail&#39; is a verb, why not &#39;email&#39; (or at least &#39;e-mail&#39;)? After all, &#39;email&#39; the noun is just short for &#39;electronic mail&#39;, so &#39;email&#39; the verb can just be short for &#39;electronically mail&#39;.</p>
<p>That said, everybody knows verbing weirds language.</p>

		<p>As a non-native speaker of English, I find this discussion very interesting. So I&#39;ll rank xerox it just to make sure, the minute I am done hoovering the living-room.</p>
<p>Rüdiger, living in a country where talk like this would be more than just a little odd</p>

		<p>Ah all those people who&#39;d prefer if we still spoke Anglo-Frisian ;-) To be fair these kind of movements exist in lots of languages (German, Spanish,..) too. Languages are fluid and change over time, resisting that change is futile, or at least complaining about it to the young kids is.</p>
<p>@Jolyon Smith: As a matter of fact &quot;to mail&quot; is recognized as a verb by the oxford dictionary in the common usage, so I&#39;m afraid you&#39;re already behind the times ;) (Although it&#39;d be interesting to see when they added that one, too bad).</p>
<p>@rwilke I can think of enough German words that function as both nouns/verbs (although thanks to conjugating them it may seem less weird?). But then it&#39;s German, there are not many things that language hasn&#39;t dabbled in to make it more complex ;)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
