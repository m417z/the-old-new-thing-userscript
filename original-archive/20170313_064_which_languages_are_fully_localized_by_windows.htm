A little while ago, I discussed
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20161227-00/?p=95025">
that not all languages get translated console output</a>.
For reference, here are the languages that are fully-localized,
including console output:

		<p>It drives the people in Portugal nuts that it is the Brazilians driving the evolution of the Portuguese language. And really, couldn&#8217;t you add en-UK to the list just by changing the text &#8220;Error&#8221; everywhere to &#8220;Bloody Hell!&#8221;?</p>

		<p>The Portuguese will just have to get used to it, like the British did, and like the North Americans will have to <em>probably rather sooner than they expect</em>. It is probably only a matter of time before the Spanish have to as well.</p>

		<p>I thought having a language pack meant the language was fully localized? I do know the difference between an LP and an LIP. For example, en-GB was added in Windows 8 and can be the base language for a system. So does that mean there are essentially three levels, not two? Fully localized, localized enough to be the base system language, and then LIPs?</p>

		<p>In the case of Serbian (or Serbocroatian in general), many users will have become used to US English long before even a partial translation became available (think back to the days of DOS &#8211; things like &#8220;Bad command or file name&#8221; were some of the first English sentences I was exposed to on a daily basis), often to the point of not immediately recognizing the US equivalents of the translated elements, or knowing what they are but not feeling comfortable with the translation. I suppose UK English could&#8217;ve also been used as a base language, but it wouldn&#8217;t make much difference in practice. I assume that speakers of many other languages had a similar experience in this regard.</p>

		<p>Interesting timing of this article.  I came across many news articles today about &#8220;features Microsoft is removing from the creators update&#8221;.  One that caught my eye is the &#8220;Interactive Services Detection&#8221; feature since I still find it handy.</p>
<p>Anyway, whilst searching for some official source I came across this MS KB support article<br />
<a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4014193/features-that-are-removed-or-deprecated-in-windows-10-creators-update" rel="nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/help/4014193/features-that-are-removed-or-deprecated-in-windows-10-creators-update</a></p>
<p>Sure enough it&#8217;s there, although sadly with very little information.</p>
<p>I also noticed that Paint is being removed (not just deprecated) for languages not on the &#8220;full localization list&#8221;.  That text has a link to the list at<br />
<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications#Windows-10-localization" rel="nofollow">https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-10-specifications#Windows-10-localization</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s a different list from what&#8217;s published here so I suspect either<br />
a) the meaning of the word &#8220;full&#8221; is not the same (console maybe being the only difference)<br />
or<br />
b) some of the languages listed in that article just use the language pack here for their Windows experience or just for their console  (eg Ukraine falling back to Russian and Serbian falling back to whatever it should&#8230;, etc)</p>
<p>Multi-language stuff is *hard*.  Kudos for the effort put into it even if it doesn&#8217;t directly benefit me personally (more languages means a bigger ecosystem of users and developers which is a very definite but non-tangible benefit).</p>

		<p>Thomas,<br />
&#8220;Chinese&#8221; has two main written forms that are very different (simplified, mostly used in China, and traditional, mostly used in Taiwan).  There also are many very different verbal dialects (Mandarin, Cantonese, &#8230;), although those wouldn&#8217;t be reflected here.</p>

		<p>There are technical reasons as well as culture/political reasons. Taiwan and Hongkong use traditional written form of Chinese and its encoding is called BIG5. However, the two are still slightly different in written form and usage habit for some characters. Mainland China use simplified written form and GB* series encodings. Singapore and Malaysian Chinese followed this move. Although later ones like GB18030 also includes traditional written forms, the shape and usage habit are also a little different from Taiwan and Hongkong. </p>
<p>This issue can trace back long that most Chinese characters have many different written forms because of large territory and artist creation, and they are all OK. However, each regime will define a standard form so as to be consistent and reduce learning cost. And the simplified Chinese is a big move in recent history.</p>

		<p>I learned traditional characters, and to me simplified is unreadable. If you grew up with traditional English spelling, try reading something written in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundSpel#Examples" rel="nofollow">simplified English spelling</a>. Conversely, people who grew up with simplified characters think traditional characters are overly complicated, like reading Middle English.</p>

		<p>Talking about language, one of the things I don&#8217;t like is to bind language to input method.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s a rare situation to other places, lots of us want to use English UI with Chinese IME. Binding the display language choice to default IME creates usability problem for us.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve taken time to add this to the now Feedback Hub when Win10 is just released, but seems no one bothers to change it back to separated options. It&#8217;s very annoying.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
