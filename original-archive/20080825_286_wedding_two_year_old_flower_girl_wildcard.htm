<p> During the <a href="http://www.loveisanexplodingcigar.com/shirleyjump/wedding_disasters_and_funnies"> unity candle ceremony</a>, the two-year-old pushed her way to the table, joining the bride and groom, in order to get a front-row seat for the ritual. And then when the unity candle was lit, she tried to blow it out. </p>
<p> Because when you're two years old, the only time you see people make a big deal about lighting a candle is when it's atop a birthday cake, and you know what to do with birthday candles! </p>

		<p>&quot;Unity candle&quot;? &nbsp;Maybe I&#8217;m just not in touch with my feminine side, but this &quot;tradition&quot; sounds like another step in the continuing wussification of America. &nbsp;Let me guess, was the two-year-old put in &quot;time-out&quot;? &nbsp;Spanking is long overdue for a comeback. &nbsp;How I long for the days when a man could be a man and a woman could be a woman.</p>

		<p>We had a 3-year old ring-bearer who got bored and untied the ribbon from the pillow and promptly began swinging it around his body. Thankfully, the videographer did manage to catch it on the video so we were able to see it.</p>

		<p>Funny, about six months ago my 2-year-old daughter was a flower girl at my sister&#8217;s wedding. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We had plans, though. &nbsp;We didn&#8217;t make her stand up front during the entire ceremony. &nbsp;I was in the wedding party, and used one of her favorite stuffed animals to encourage her progress down the aisle, and as soon as my father gave away the bride he took my daughter back to the seats with him.</p>

		<p>My 3 year old daughter finished dropping the flower petals and immediately came and sat with me. &nbsp;My 7 year old ring-bearer decided to stand up front (the plan was for him to come sit with me too), and he did fantastic.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s preparation, sometimes it&#8217;s just good luck. :)</p>

		<p>Hey, John, why don&#8217;t you piss on your own parade? &nbsp;You&#8217;ve read three paragraphs about someone else&#8217;s wedding, and you&#8217;re ready to pass judgment on who is a wuss and who isn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>Ya know what? &nbsp;Shut your freaking mouth, and mind your own business. &nbsp;How&#8217;s that for wussification? &nbsp;How do you know what *someone else* wanted to do for their wedding?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a story about someone&#8217;s kid, not your opportunity to whine about society.</p>

		<p>My niece (now 18) was our flower girl when she was less than three. &nbsp;We expected that she may provide some comedy relief and she was great &#8211; wandering around us during the ceremony, wanting to share the communion and ducking under the ribbon ahead of us at the reception. &nbsp;And no fears or tears, which was our only concern before the event.</p>

		<p>Anything under 6 or 7 years old is a wildcard. If it works for you, consider yourselves lucky. I&#8217;ve seen kids run down the aisle screaming, girls sitting on the altar lifting their skirts over their heads, and some not even want to perform after begging for the honor.</p>

		<p>My 4 year old niece started crying loudly when she could not come down the aisle with my bride, and her older brother(7), the ring bearer, was so angry at her for not coming down the aisle with him (as she was meant to) he stomped down the aisle looking like he was going to kill someone.</p>
<p>I enjoyed the entertainment</p>

<p>You advocate spanking as part of the wedding ceremony? I think that&#8217;d be a hilariously great idea, but I suspect lots of people may find it inappropriate :)</p>

		<p>Heh, the wussification of America. Are weddings supposed to have chainsaws and handguns or something? &nbsp;Usually when you see a comment like that it&#8217;s coming from someone who&#8217;s fairly &#8216;wussified&#8217; himself.</p>

		<p>&quot;Are weddings supposed to have chainsaws and handguns or something?&quot;</p>
<p>If they are, don&#8217;t have the wedding in St. Louis. While leaving from their airport we noticed a glass case full of examples of things you shouldn&#8217;t pack in your luggage &#8211; one of the items&#8230;a chainsaw. &nbsp;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
