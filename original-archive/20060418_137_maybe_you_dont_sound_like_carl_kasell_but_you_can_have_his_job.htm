<p> According to the wonderful <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5251026"> Mixed Signals</a>, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5323281"> the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is searching for radio hosts</a>. They're calling it "American Idol for public radio". </p>
<p> I recently stumbled across Mixed Signals and was instantly hooked. Some of my recent favorites: </p>
<ul>
<li> <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5294997"> Mike Pesca reports from South Dakota</a> on the simple frugality of the state capitol building. </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5295188"> An executive order establishing the order of succession</a> in the case the Archivist of the United States and the Deputy Archivist of the United States are both unable to perform the functions and duties of the office of Archivist. </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5298435"> Mike Pesca runs afoul of some park rangers at Mount Rushmore</a>. For some reason, Mike Pesca has the perfect voice for this type of stuff. He always sounds slightly annoyed and a bit condescending. </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5303729"> An insurance company withdraws coverage from an animal charity</a> because their building is too close to a luxury apartment building whose only famous residents are "a couple of lingerie models". (There is even a response from the insurance company that didn't really seem to explain much.) </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5312224"> Riding elevators in order to secure press credentials</a> because security regulations prohibit forming a line. </li>
<li> <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5316792"> Mike Pesca again (sense a pattern?) sets the record straight on GMU's surprise performance in the NCAA men's basketball tournament</a>. </li>
<li> One last Mike Pesca story: <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5228264"> This (somewhat misguided) essay on Iceland's lack of success at... um... ice sports</a>. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/07/01/170857.aspx"> Icelandic sits at the bottom of my list of Germanic languages to learn</a> (but at least it's doing better than Danish, which doesn't make the list at all). </li>
</ul>
<p> The curatorship of Mixed Signals appears to change hands rather frequently. The last few entries I linked above were from <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=2101217"> Robert Smith</a>, whom I had the pleasure to meet at KUOW studios when he was stationed in Seattle. </p>

		<p>Danish is not even on your list? You cut me deep just now.</p>
<p>Did you know it&#8217;s easier than German? And you could speak natively with Anders Hejlsberg and Bjarne Stroustup&#8230;</p>
<p>Please bump it up above Icelandic&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
