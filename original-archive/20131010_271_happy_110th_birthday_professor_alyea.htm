<p>Professor Hubert Alyea would be 110 years old today, if he were still among us. (He <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1996/10/27/nyregion/hubert-newcombe-alyea-93-made-chemistry-a-lively-art.html"> passed away in 1996</a> at the ripe age of 93.) <i>LIFE</i> magazine called him <a href="http://life.time.com/culture/hubert-alyea-the-science-teacher-you-wish-you-had/"> the science teacher you <i>wish</i> you had</a> for his engaging (and often explosive) chemistry demonstrations. He was called an "<a href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1997JChEd..74...20S">international grand master of lecture demonstrations</a>" by <a href="https://www.chem.wisc.edu/users/bassam"> Bassam Shakhashiri</a>, noted chemist and author of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/s/?search-alias=stripbooks&amp;field-author=Shakhashiri&amp;field-title=Chemical+Demonstrations&amp;sort=daterank&amp;tag=tholneth-20"> several books on chemical demonstrations</a>.</p>
<p> I had the immense good fortune to attend one of his lectures. As he prepared his equipment, he casually popped a piece of dry ice in his mouth. (DO NOT TRY THIS AT HOME.) You can see a demonstration at the start of this video: </p>

<p> Somebody asked, "Professor Alyea, how can you handle dry ice like that?" </p>
<p> He spit out the dry ice and replied, "Oh, I'm not handling it. I'm putting it in my mouth." </p>
<p> Here is a VHS recording of his lecture <i>Lucky Accidents, Great Discoveries and the Prepared Mind</i>. </p>
<p><iframe width="420" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jSw7cHfxbu8?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>
<p> The lecture concludes at 25:15 with a series of reactions, culminating in his signature demonstration. The colors don't show up well in the video, so you'll have to trust that they are what he says they are. </p>

		<p>What a brilliant man, and a fun lecturer. I wish I&#39;d had teachers like that!</p>

		<p>I remember being lucky enough as a child to attend several of the Royal Institution lectures for schools in the 60s and 70s (including at least one by Prof Laithwaite). Sitting in the same auditorium that had people like Faraday and Davy as lecturers was an inspiring feeling. </p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
