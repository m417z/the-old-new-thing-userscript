A customer liaison forwarded a problem from their customer:
When the customer changed the volume label
on a drive,
the change is not reflected in Explorer.
Explorer continues to show the old volume label.
</p>
<p>
A
<a HREF="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-US/sysinternals/processmonitor.aspx">
ProcMon</a>
trace revealed that <code>svchost.exe</code> running as
<code>NT AUTHORITY\<wbr>SYSTEM</code>
attempted to open
the root of the drive but got <code>STATUS_<wbr>ACCESS_<wbr>DENIED</code>.
The access was coming from the shell hardware service
at a point where it calls
<code>Get&shy;Volume&shy;Information</code>
to get the volume label.
</p>
<p>
Okay, that makes sense that the shell hardware service was
trying to access the volume to read the volume label.
After all, it was told that there was a change to the volume label,
so it's going to the volume to see what the new label is.
The question is why the shell hardware service,
running as <code>SYSTEM</code>,
got <code>STATUS_<wbr>ACCESS_<wbr>DENIED</code>.
</p>
<p>
I asked,
"How did that happen?
The <code>SYSTEM</code> account should have full access to the drive by default.
Did the customer apply a custom CL that revokes <code>SYSTEM</code> access?
You'll find that a lot of things stop working when you revoke
<code>SYSTEM</code> access."
</p>
<p>
The customer liaison wrote back,
"Indeed, the customer did remove the <code>SYSTEM</code> account
from the drive's permissions.
I am not sure exactly what they were thinking when they
revoked
<code>SYSTEM</code> access.
I need to ask them."
</p>
<p>
We didn't hear back from the customer, so maybe the customer
was too embarrassed to explain why they revoked <code>SYSTEM</code>
access to the drive.
</p>
<p>
Another case of a customer changing a security setting without
really understanding why they did it,
and then wondering why stuff stops working.</p>

		<p>I thought System was normally a member of the Administrator group so did they remove that group as well or specifically deny the System user?</p>

		<p>Nope, System is not in Administrators group. If I recall correctly, adding it to administrators group on NT4 allowed it to log in on the console. I recall there was some reason why this wasn&#8217;t a particularly good idea.</p>

		<p>Process Explorer tells me that the relevant svchost instance is a Administrators group member (Win8.1).</p>

		<p>I checked. It looks like services that start as System don&#8217;t get tokes from LogonUser, so that accounts for the discrepancy.</p>

		<p>If the shell hardware service can&#8217;t access the volume to read the volume label, how did the customer change the volume label? If writing the volume label doesn&#8217;t go through the hardware service, why does reading the volume label do so?</p>
<p>And how did Explorer get the old volume label of the drive to show, from before the customer changed it?</p>

		<p>Explorer uses PIDLs/IShellItem and they often contain cached information (size, 8.3 name etc.) so the MyComputer IShellFolder shell namespace implementation in shell32 sits between Explorer and the filesystem/volume manager and owns the PIDL format for that folder.</p>

		<p>Even though SYSTEM doesn&#8217;t have access, the user does. So the user probably used the LABEL command to change the label. And Explorer runs as the user, so it probably used GetVolumeInformation to read the label. But since the service cannot read the label, it cannot notify Explorer, &#8220;Hey, the label changed.&#8221;</p>

		<p>does that mean there is a service polling for volume label changes all the time, just so that it can notify explorer?</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not polling. It&#8217;s subscribing to volume change notifications.</p>

		<p>My guess: the intent was to add an ACE to the existing ACL but they messed up the code and wound up deleting all the existing entries.  Easy to do, particularly if you&#8217;re using the older APIs.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
