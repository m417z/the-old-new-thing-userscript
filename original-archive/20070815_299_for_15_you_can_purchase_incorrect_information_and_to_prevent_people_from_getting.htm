<p>Given <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/03/14/395274.aspx"> what I know about Naveen Jain</a>, I basically view everything he does with enormous skepticism.&sup1; I mean, I trust lawyers more than I trust that guy, that's how bad it is.</p>
<p> After being booted from InfoSpace, Jain moved across the street and founded Intelius, a company that does basically the same thing: Selling directory information.&sup2; Recently, <a href="http://www.king5.com/business/stories/NW_081307BUB_cell_phone_directory_KC.2ff1ee06.html"> the company launched a cell phone look-up service</a>: For $15 you can obtain the cell phone number of anybody in their directory. Mind you, the information is cobbled together from various private sources, and it can even be wrong, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2003833862_intelius13.html"> but if the result is incorrect, you won't get a refund</a>. Cellphone industry lobbyist Steve Largent calls it a "scam", and that's saying a lot, coming from somebody whose own job doesn't rank very high on the trust scale either. </p>
<p> They claim to have collected this information from private sources. Did you give the pizza delivery store your cell phone number? They may have sold it to Intelius. The auto mechanic shop? They may have sold it to Intelius. Ironically, the very first sentence in the Intelius Privacy Policy is "Intelius respects your right to privacy, and we are committed to protecting it." And yet they make it difficult to protect your privacy: Read on. </p>
<p> I called their customer support line to remove my cell phone number from their database. You can try it, too: +1-425-974-6100, then 1, then 1; but I'll save you the trouble and tell you the answer. (If you don't trust me, you can call and confirm this information for yourself.) </p>
<ul>
<li>Make a cell phone search for yourself on their Web site. </li>
<li>Proceed as if you actually wanted to pay $15 to get the information,     but don't do it. </li>
<li>Print out the Web page that shows the information that they     are offering to sell for $15.     (Your cell phone number, your unlisted telephone number, etc.) </li>
<li>Send a fax to +1-425-974-6194 containing that screenshot,     your name, address, and date of birth. </li>
<li>Wait seven to ten days for the change to take effect. </li>
<li>The request is valid for three months; after three months,     you must repeat the process. </li>
</ul>
<p> Such is their commitment to privacy that they make you jump through these hoops four times a year. Even the opt-out requests for the dreaded Direct Marketing Association are good for five years. </p>
<p> According to the privacy statement, you can direct any questions or concerns regarding their Privacy Policy to privacy@intelius.com. Good luck. (<a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.intelius.com/corp/news.html?ShowID=04-09-07">They brag about the blog they started in April</a>, but if you follow the link <a rel="nofollow" href="http://blog.intelius.com/">you find no blog</a>.) </p>
<p> As Scott McNealy famously put it, "You have zero privacy anyway.  Get over it." </p>

		<p>2 points for George ;)</p>
<p>A quick search on myself reveals 2 cell phone hits, which from the carriers could be my current and previous cell #s. &nbsp;It also gets 8 other cell hits. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In residential, there&#8217;s what could be my current home phone #. And 3-5 previous phone numbers (the Tacoma and Seattle hits could be someone else, but could also be me, misfiled). &nbsp;And, again, other residential hits.</p>
<p>So, a bit like search results everywhere &#8211; loads of hits, need to check each one out. $15 for the #s of the whole results lists might be reasonable. &nbsp;$15 each? &nbsp;Please.</p>

		<p>This is the sort of shady tactics that the Data Protection Act here in the UK was designed to prevent. (In particular, data may only be used for the original purpose for which it was collected and may not be disclosed to third parties without the individual&#8217;s consent.)</p>
<p>Of course, last I heard the opposition party were advocating scrapping it in the name of cutting red tape.</p>

		<p>today I&#8217;ve found &#8216;spock&#8217; a site that agregates information from linkedin, facebook and other places, on everybody.</p>
<p>try it..</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.spock.com/Raymond-Chen" rel="nofollow">http://www.spock.com/Raymond-Chen</a></p>

<p>They say you can remove your information from the web if you don&#8217;t want it on their site. But isn&#8217;t it on their site forever once they found it?</p>

		<p>It is my recollection[1] that, similar to faxes, it is illegal to make unsolicited commercial calls to cell phones, because there is a direct cost to the person receiving the unsolicited call. &nbsp;In that case, could we[2] start a class action lawsuit against them as an accessory to illegal phone spamming?</p>
<p>[1] And I may be completely wrong about this, in which case, disregard.</p>
<p>[2] By which I mean &quot;you&quot;, because I don&#8217;t actually have a cell phone.</p>

		<p>I would expect cell phone spamming to be illegal because the user has to pay to receive the call, so direct market advertisers attempting to do so can be sued (they can be sued anyway).</p>
<p>But lets assume that this service is legitimate. Lets say I want to reconnect with an old friend from college by the name of Sara Smith, and I pay $15 for this service and call all the cell phone numbers for all the Sara Smiths they give me, but Sara Smith being a common name, I don&#8217;t actually get the right one. Then I&#8217;m out $15 and I voted with my wallet for a service which didn&#8217;t end up being helpful, and in doing so, I cost a bunch of people a couple of cell phone minutes.</p>
<p>Some ideas are just plain inconsiderate. I can&#8217;t imagine this service is useful enough of the time to justify the ridiculous price tag.</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8230;in what backward country do they charge people to receive phone calls?&quot;</p>
<p>Right here in the good &#8216;ol U.S. of A&#8230; and I like it!</p>
<p>I honestly believe that if cell calls were free to receive, I&#8217;d have as much problems with telemarketers as I do at home, even with the Do Not Call lists.</p>
<p>It just so happens that my phone plan gives me enough included minutes that I don&#8217;t usually &quot;pay&quot; to receive calls. If I received enough telemarketing calls though, I will pay 45 cents/minute and I will be PISSED OFF.</p>
<p>The pay-to-receive method doesn&#8217;t stop all junk: recently I&#8217;ve been getting junk SMS (text messages) offering &quot;cheap software&quot; &nbsp;The sender # is blocked and my phone company refuses to tell me who sent it.</p>
<p>In America, nothing is respected until it has a dollar value assigned. The time it takes for me to receive a junk call is not respected unless there is a dollar amount attached. Then the 45 cents to receive a call can be wielded against the telemarketer as a &quot;property rights&quot; violation (or whatever the proper legal theory is)</p>

		<p>Wait, in the US you have to pay to *receive* calls? Here (in Aus), you only have to pay to make &#8217;em.</p>

		<p>For cell phones, in the US you pay for the minutes you use, whether they are incoming calls or not. &nbsp;For a land line, you only pay for out-going long distance calls.</p>
<p>In Australia do people have to pay more when they call a cell phone than when they call a land line?</p>

<p>McNealy&#8217;s prognosis is right, but not his presctiption. Invasion of privacy is as inevitable as death, but that is no reason to roll over and die.</p>

		<p>mccoyn: yes, significantly. Calling a mobile (called a mobile here, not a cell) and you&#8217;re looking at about 30c/30sec, whereas a landline is around the district of 20c, untimed.</p>

		<p>Obviously the 20c untimed is for a local call, long-distance calls do cost more, and are timed.</p>

		<p>You don&#8217;t get it. &quot;Get over it&quot; doesn&#8217;t mean &quot;you should not happily hand out your information now&quot;. It means &quot;Nobody will protect you. You are on your own. Learn to behave in such a way as not to disclose anything of importance. Remember there&#8217;s *likely* always a camera/microphone/etc. trained on you.&quot;</p>
<p>In other words, welcome to 1984.</p>

		<p>Do what I do &#8212; don&#8217;t have a cell phone. &nbsp;That way you&#8217;re not paying for people to call you.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
