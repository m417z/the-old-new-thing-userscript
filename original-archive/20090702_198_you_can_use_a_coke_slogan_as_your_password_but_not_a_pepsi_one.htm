		<p>To be sure, there is likely to be a 14 character limit on the password, but it is just part of a greater anti-Pepsi conspiracy as it also stops people using &quot;Lipsmackinthirstquenchinacetastinmotivatingoodbuzzincooltalkinhighwalkinfastlivinevergivincoolfizzin&quot;</p>

		<p>I once had a password that had a backspace character in it.</p>
<p>On a rather brain-dead Eudora epass compatible mail server in college. &nbsp;I was using telnet to set my password (wasn&#8217;t using the Eudora client) and made/corrected a typo.</p>
<p>Took me a while to figure out why I couldn&#8217;t log on, and even once I realized my password had two more characters than I thought it did there was no way to use it from a mail program. &nbsp;Had to telnet back in and set it to something usable.</p>

<p>I think Pepsi is always a proper noun. So maybe your password checker was a big scrabble fan??</p>

		<p>@Jonathan:</p>
<p>Your description revealed two additional major security problems with that system (or at least the application used to set your password):</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>You weren&#8217;t prompted to re-enter your password for verification, which is necessary whenever either setting a password, or entering a password when it won&#8217;t be verified immediately. (I&#8217;m assuming you didn&#8217;t make and correct the same typo twice.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You were able to see how long the current password was without access.</p>
</li>
</ol>

		<p>@Jonathan one friend of mine once telnetted into an SMTP server to send an email to another friend of mine, and made and corrected several typos in the body of the email. &nbsp;The recipient was using a console-based client, and was quite amused to see his typos correcting themselves on viewing.</p>

		<p>One of my pet peeves is that the Windows password complexity requirements has four categories of characters, three of which must be used:</p>
<p>* Uppercase alphabet characters</p>
<p>* Lowercase alphabet characters</p>
<p>* Arabic numerals</p>
<p>* Nonalphanumeric characters</p>
<p>Frustratingly enough, spaces aren&#8217;t included in ANY category! They really should be in the fourth category.</p>

		<p>The Pepsi string contains 36 characters, which is 7*5+1, so the last chunk contains only one character, which I guess that wasn&#8217;t accepted by the password system.</p>

		<p>Several people have got the problem backwards: The Coke password doesn&#8217;t work. The Pepsi one does.</p>
<p>The limitation in LAN Manager (and LM-compatible passwords) is 14 characters of password material. LM doesn&#8217;t permit spaces in the password. &quot;Coke adds life&quot; is 14 characters, and so is rejected by Windows because it might need to be compatible with older systems.</p>
<p>The longer password is already incompatible with older systems, a warning message is shown when setting it, and therefore spaces are fine.</p>

		<p>I remember the days when Unix would only use the first eight letters of your password. A friend of a friend used to concatenate two words together to make his password &quot;for extra security&quot; until we guessed (the first word of) one of his passwords was &quot;elephant&quot;.</p>

		<p>Am I the only one that noticed that Raymond wrote &quot;Over a decade ago&quot;. That means over 11 years ago counting the time in the blog queue. At the time MS was running NT 4.0 or 3.51 (not all or MS&#8217;s internal servers were upgraded to 4.0). Judging by the slogans used it could have been as early as 1984.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
