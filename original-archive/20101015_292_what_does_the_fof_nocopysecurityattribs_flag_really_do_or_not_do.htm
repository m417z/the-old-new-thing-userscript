<p>In the old days, the shell copy engine didn't pay attention to ACLs. It just let the file system do whatever the default file system behavior was. The result was something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you copied a file,     it opened the destination, wrote to it,     and that was it.     Result: The copied file has the security attributes of destination     (specifically, picking up the inheritable attributes from the container). </li>
<li>If you moved a file within the same drive,     it moved the file with <code>MoveFile</code>,     and that was it.     Result: The file     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/08/24/717181.aspx">     retained its security attributes</a>. </li>
<li>If you moved a file between drives,     then it was treated as a copy/delete.     Result: The moved file has the security attributes of the destination     (specifically, picking up the inheritable attributes from the container). </li>
</ul>
<p> Perfectly logical, right? If a new file is created, then the security attributes are inherited from the container. If an existing file is moved, then its security attributes move with it. And since moving a file across drives was handled as a copy/delete, moving a file across drives behaved like a copy. </p>
<p> Users, however, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/04/07/9991494.aspx#9992570"> found this behavior confusing</a>. For example, they would take a file from a private folder like their <i>My Documents</i> folder, and move it to a public location like <i>Common Documents</i>, and... the file would still be private. </p>
<p> The <code>FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;ATTRIBS</code> flag was introduced in Windows&nbsp;2000 to address this confusion. If you pass this flag, then when you move a file, even within a drive, the security attributes of the moved file will match the destination directory. (The way the shell implements this flag, by the way, is to move the file like normal, and then reset the security attributes to match the destination. So even though it sounds like a flag that says "don't do&nbsp;X" would be less work than doing&nbsp;X, it's actually <i>more</i> work, because we actually do X+Y and then undo the X part. But it's still far cheaper than copying the file and deleting the original.) </p>
<p> Note that omitting the <code>FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;ATTRIBS</code> flag does not mean "Always copy security attributes." If you don't pass the flag, then the security attributes follow the default file system behavior, which sometimes transfers the security attributes and sometimes doesn't. In retrospect, the flag might have been better-named something like <code>FOF_SET&shy;SECURITY&shy;ATTRIBS&shy;TO&shy;MATCH&shy;DESTINATION</code>. </p>
<p> Now the question is how to summarize all this information in the MSDN documentation for the <code>FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;ATTRIBS</code> flag? After receiving this explanation of how the flag works, one customer suggested that the text be changed to read "Do not copy the security attributes of the moved file. The destination file receives the security attributes of its new folder. Note that this flag has no effect on copied files, which will always receive the security attributes of the new folder." </p>
<p> But this proposed version actually can be misinterpreted. Everything starting with "Note that" is intended to be guidance. It isn't actually part of the specification; rather, it's sort of "thinking out loud", taking the actual specification and calling out some of its consequences. But how many people reading the above proposed text would fail to realize that the first two sentences are normative but the third sentence is interpretive? In particular, the interpretation says that the copied file will "always" receive the security attributes of the new folder. Is that really true? Maybe in the future there will be a new flag like <code>COPY_<wbr>FILE_<wbr>INCLUDE_<wbr>SECURITY_<wbr>ATTRIBUTES</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></code>, and now the "always" isn't so "always" any more. </p>
<p> Anyway, now that you know what the <code>FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;ATTRIBS</code> flag does (and doesn't do), maybe you can answer this customer's question: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Download a file via Internet Explorer and put it on the desktop. The file will be marked as having come from the Internet Zone. </p>
<p> Now copy the file with the <code>FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;ATTRIBS</code> to some other location. </p>
<p> The resulting file is still marked as Internet Zone. I expected that <code>FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;ATTRIBS</code> would remove the Internet Zone security information. Is this a bug in <code>SHFileOperation</code>? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> (This article provides enough information for you to explain why the Internet Zone marker is not removed. The answer to the other half of the customer's question&mdash;actually removing the marker&mdash;lies in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms537034.aspx"> this COM method</a>.) </p>

<p>While you both are right, it&#39;s named &quot;FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;ATTRIBS&quot;, which implies application to all &quot;security attributes&quot; not just the ACL. &nbsp;Certainly internet zone info is stored in an alternate data stream, but this could be considered a security &quot;attribute&quot; as well. &nbsp;The suggested name that Marquess provides is a good one, but since it&#39;s already in the wild, it&#39;s too late.</p>

<p>It is. IMO it is not intuitve that the folder structure is hierarchical but security attributes aren&#39;t.</p>

<p>That&#39;s something I would not have guessed. Count me as one of those who would fail to realize that the 1st 2 sentences are normative and the last interpretive. &nbsp;However, I also wouldn&#39;t necessarily consider things broken if a new flag were added to override the 3rd sentence, but I guess you&#39;d have no shortage of people who would (and maybe applications that needed compatibility shims).</p>

		<p>This seems like a good example of how end users (&quot;normal people&quot;) and developers (&quot;technical people&quot;) can think so completely different about something relatively simple. &nbsp;I would never view the little zone marker agreement between IE and the Shell (and now most other browsers) as a security attribute. &nbsp;It&#39;s just metadata that&#39;s been somewhat arbitrarily tied to a file. &nbsp;However, when I stop and think about it, I suppose I could almost see it as related to file security&#8230; almost.</p>
<p>As far as FOF_NO­COPY­SECURITY­ATTRIBS entry on MSDN, you might just link to your blog entry. &nbsp;Sure, sure, I know this isn&#39;t official information of any kind, but from this point forward, if you Google (or Bing, if you lean that way) FOF_NO­COPY­SECURITY­ATTRIBS, your blog post will be the first result. Honestly, this is probably a good thing :)</p>

		<p>SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES (<a target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa379560%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/aa379560%28VS.85%29.aspx</a>) is clearly defined, and has been an integral part of the Windows API for two decades. &nbsp;Of issue is the fact that the SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES type includes the security descriptor and a BOOL indicating if the HANDLE is inheritable. &nbsp;The latter is not at all applicable to FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;ATTRIBS.</p>
<p>That leaves us the PSECURITY_DESCRIPTOR. &nbsp;So, as FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;ATTRIBS might be better named FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;DESCRIPTOR. &nbsp;</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is a bit besides the point. &nbsp;If one&#39;s ignorance of the Windows API leads one to believe that the Internet Zone marking is part included as part of the Security Attributes, one might also believe that it is included as part of the Security Descriptor.</p>

		<p>I agree with Phil that FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;DESCRIPTOR is a better name. The term &quot;security descriptor&quot; is very well-defined and should be understood unambiguously by any experienced Windows developer in any context (it even has a Wikipedia entry).</p>
<p>The term &quot;security attributes&quot; is more generic. In regular Win32 programming it applies to a handle (not a file or folder). In the context of the shell one could easily assume that security attributes include the zone information. After all, the properties page (a shell UI) for a file downloaded from the Internet will have, right under &quot;Attributes&quot;, the word &quot;Security&quot; is used to refer to the Internet zone.</p>
<p>Of course you could argue that Internet Explorer isn&#39;t part of the Shell, or that the property page didn&#39;t work like that 10-12 years ago when they were creating this option. Regardless, MSDN can be changed at any time, and should use the unambiguous term &quot;security descriptor&quot;.</p>

		<p>Does FOF_NO&shy;COPY&shy;SECURITY&shy;ATTRIBS take care of the case where the destination folder has no inheritable ACL entries? (Copying a file to such a folder gives it a default ACL giving you and SYSTEM full control.)</p>

		<p>Win32&#39;s use of .h-files suck. For example, h-files should be used to mitigate transitions and to help where the compiler&#39;s type system is insufficient. But win32 doesn&#39;t use h-files this way. Win32&#39;s h-files are useless. As a developer you can hard code everything anyway, because ms are afraid of changing h-files because some noob developers didn&#39;t use them back in the 90&#39;s. Why are current developers punished becuase some noob developers hard coded stuff in the 90&#39;s?</p>

		<p>.h-files are there to stay for Win32 development, because everyone relies on them (and for good reason). If you don&#39;t like .h-files, you can use what Microsoft provided when they decided to start over:</p>

		<p>What&#39;s the deal with .h files? What bugs me more is the *lack* of them when people distribute COM components; one has to jump through hoops to get a .h file from the type library, which makes using said COM components from C (or C++ under IDEs that don&#39;t support #import) a pain in the rear.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
