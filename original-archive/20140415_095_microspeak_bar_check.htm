<p>A <i>bar check</i> sounds like the sort of thing you receive at the end of a long evening of drinking, but that's not what a bar check is.</p>
<p> Among the things that happen at ship room meetings is reviewing each bug that has a proposed fix and deciding whether to accept or reject the fix. </p>
<p> Another thing that happens at ship room meetings is the <i>bar check</i>: The person <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/11/05/9043631.aspx"> representing</a> the bug describes the issue and what is known about it so far and asks for a preliminary assessment from the ship room as to whether this is the sort of bug they would approve if a fix were available, in other words, whether it meets the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2004/12/30/344424.aspx"> <i>bug bar</i></a>. If the answer is No, then there is no need to go to the effort of developing a fix for it right now, since you know it would get rejected anyway. </p>

		<p>If the fix isn&#39;t likely to have nasty consequences I usually develop it anyway. Of course I don&#39;t have to worry about somebody poking into my memory space (which doesn&#39;t mean I don&#39;t have to worry about someone depending on a bug).</p>

		<p>The equivalent of refusing to fix a structurally flawed I-Beam in a skyscraper because it would cost too much money to get to it for the repair.</p>
<p>When the building tumbles down around it, you&#39;ll wish you&#39;d fixed it, but no one will ever have to take any responsibility for a terrible decision, so it doesn&#39;t matter.</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure they do. Any substantial piece of software probably has hundreds of open bugs raised against it, ranging from crashes that impact some subset of users on a regular basis, to some undesired behavior which a tester found can occur if you poke it just right but users aren&#39;t running into a lot, to an icon in some out-of-the-way dialog being slightly misaligned. But if you never shipped because there were open bugs, you&#39;d never ship at all (and features and bug fixes you haven&#39;t shipped are no use to anyone), while if you don&#39;t prioritize, the icon alignment might be fixed instead of the crashes.</p>

		<p>@Chirs: I think you are right; except right is a tricky word. Three pieces of criticism often leveled against Microsoft is being slow, failing to properly interpret public feedback and not fixing bugs. In short: Instead of fixing the bugs and shipping on time, Microsoft wastes time on nothing tangible. (Oh, and Microsoft likes it huge too!)</p>
<p>I was one of the beta testers of IE7. I distinctly remember Firefox 2 started out later and came out earlier. I had this perception of &quot;piece of junk&quot; from Firefox, so when I saw version 2, my jaw dropped. Basically, it could match toe-to-toe with IE7. But when CNET released a comparison review of both with a boxing theme, I still shouted &quot;Biased!&quot;</p>

		<p>@Joshua: In the circumstances where this is even being discussed &#8211; glide path to release after all features are signed off, which is when &#39;ship room&#39; goes into effect &#8211; then you should be focused on the bugs that are blocking release: those that pass the bar check. You can work on your bug that didn&#39;t pass the bar check once the release is out. The team don&#39;t want to take the risk that your bug fix breaks something critical.</p>
<p>@Fleet Command: My hope is that the April 2014 Windows 8.1 Update is a sign that such bugs are actually being actively worked on by the product team with the intent of releasing them as an update to the current release, rather than being deferred to the next release, which might happen years later and bring with it other radical redesigns. Previously, only bugs and Design Change Requests raised by customers and OEMs went into service packs (excepting one-offs like Windows XP SP2). The work on them was typically done by Windows Sustained Engineering, who have apparently renamed themselves Customer eXperience Engineering (CXE), to keep them from distracting the product team from the new product, but that actually means the product team are quite insulated from the consequences of decisions made in the last cycle.</p>
<p>Of course if you do encounter such a bug, or a mis-designed feature, and you really can&#39;t tolerate it, you could always raise a support ticket (you will need to pay for a support incident or use a gratis one included as part of however you licenced the software or your company&#39;s support contract). </p>

<p>It started with Windows 7 (at latest with W8) and released quite few non-security bugfixes.</p>

		<p>@Mike Dimmick: I seem to be in the unique place of every support request in the past 2 years has resulting in my money being refunded (or not charged) and the problem left unfixed.</p>

		<p>Talking about Win8.1 update 1, they really should have fixed the bug in typing Chinese in DirectX environment. Unable to select every 1 word out of 10 is just not acceptable. This is the major factor that blocks Win8.X upgrade in Chinese speaking reign.</p>
<p>Okay I should have talk about this in Michael Kaplan&#39;s blog, but since his blog is down, hope that he can see this.</p>

		<p>@Anon: Presumably just hyperbole and/or trolling, but still: Clearly the thing you&#39;re describing is a serious *security* bug and I don&#39;t think the bar gets ever so high that MS would ship an OS with a known remote code execution exploit around..</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
