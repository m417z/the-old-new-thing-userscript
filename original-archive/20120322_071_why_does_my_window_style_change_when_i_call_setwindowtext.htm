<p>A customer observed some strange behavior with window styles:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We ran some weird behavior: Calling the <code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Text</code> function causes a change in window styles. Specifically, calling <code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Text</code> results in the <code>WM_<wbr>STYLE&shy;CHANGING</wbr></code> and <code>WM_<wbr>STYLE&shy;CHANGED</wbr></code> messages, and sometimes the result is that the <code>WS_<wbr>TAB&shy;STOP</wbr></code> style is removed. Is this a bug? What would cause this? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The <code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Text</code> message sends the <code>WM_<wbr>SET&shy;TEXT</wbr></code> message to the control, at which point anything that happens is the window's own responsibility. If it wants to change styles based on the text you sent, then that's what happens. The window manager doesn't do anything special to force it to happen or to prevent it. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> That's weird, because I'm not even listening for <code>WM_<wbr>SET&shy;TEXT</wbr></code> messages. I also verified that there is no call into my code during the call to the the <code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Text</code> function. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I'm assuming that the window belongs to the same process as the caller. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/08/21/54675.aspx"> If the window belongs to another process, then the rules are different</a>. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I'm changing the text of a window created by the same thread. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Okay, so let's see what we have so far. The customer is calling the <code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Text</code> function to change the text of a window created on the same thread. There is no handler for the <code>WM_<wbr>SET&shy;TEXT</wbr></code> message, and yet the window style is changing. At this point, you might start looking for more obscure sources for the problem, like say a global hook of some sort. While I considered the possibilities, the customer added, </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> It may be worth noting that I'm using the <code>Sys&shy;Link</code>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Okay, now things are starting to make sense, and it didn't help that the customer provided misleading information in the description of the problem. For example, when the customer wrote, "There is no handler for the <code>WM_<wbr>SET&shy;TEXT</wbr></code> message," the customer was not referring to the window whose window text is changing but to some other unrelated window. </p>
<p> It's like responding to the statement "A confirmation letter should have been sent to the account holder" with "I never got the confirmation letter," and then the person spends another day trying to figure out why the confirmation letter was never sent before you casually mention, "Oh, I'm not the account holder." </p>
<p> The <code>WM_<wbr>SET&shy;TEXT</wbr></code> message is sent to the window you passed to <code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Text</code>; in this case, it's the <code>Sys&shy;Link</code> window. It is therefore the window procedure of the <code>Sys&shy;Link</code> window that is relevant here. </p>
<p> The <code>Sys&shy;Link</code> control remembers whether it was <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb760706(VS.85).aspx#syslink_creation"> originally created with the <code>WS_<wbr>TAB&shy;STOP</wbr></code></a>, and if the markup it is given has no tab stops, then it removes the style; if the markup has tab stops, then it re-adds the style. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> How do I add a tab stop to a string? I couldn't find any reference to it and all my guesses failed. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The tab stops in question are the hyperlinks you added when you used the <code>&lt;A&gt;...&lt;/A&gt;</code> notation. If the text has no hyperlinks, then the control removes the <code>WS_<wbr>TAB&shy;STOP</wbr></code> style because it is no longer something you can tab to. </p>

		<p>I find this is pretty common with support &#8211; people providing misleading info. As a result I&#39;ve developed strong sense of skepticism when told &quot;facts&quot; About an issue&#8230;have to think &quot;in theory is there any potential for this result with suggested conditions&quot; if no 9 out of 10 times one of the &quot;facts&quot; was not really investigated or confirmed, rather it was assumed. Of course you still have the odd case where there really is a strange obscure bug.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s all too common that an end user gathers symptoms A, B, C and then concludes that it must be &quot;D&quot; that&#39;s the root cause. &nbsp;They then complain about &quot;D&quot; and C &#8211; psychic powers (similar to Raymond&#39;s) eventually draw out A and B and lead to the correct conclusion &quot;E&quot;. &nbsp;I then, as the ISV, go whinge to the customer&#39;s IT support people that then really need to fix &quot;E&quot; since it&#39;s not our issue, but that I&#39;ve fixed it for them this time.. &nbsp; (I just finished such a call) :)</p>

		<p>Oh my, Oh my&#8230; many customers are morons but it doesn&#39;t help that the customer support are arrogant a-holes either&#8230;.</p>
<p>Common ground, people, read about it !</p>
<p>We have all been beginners. So is it so hard to understand when other beginners fail at explaining wrong when they do not know what info we need ?</p>
<p>I have always wondered how some learned people becomes arrogant with an over-inflated self-importance, that think they are special because of what they know.</p>
<p>Elitism so disgusting and so illogical.</p>
<p>Baffling indeed.</p>
<p>Is it just something that goes wring in the head ?</p>

		<p>@Inflated: Uhm.. right.. So when I ask &#39;have you got 3rd party software v8 installed?&#39;, the customer replies &#39;yes!&#39;, and later I find they have v9 installed, and I tell the customer &#39;I asked about v8&#39; and they say &#39;I assumed v9 would be better than v8, so I said yes&#39; then I&#39;m the arrogant a-hole? Nice world view.</p>

		<p>Raymond, your response is disingenuous. You know damned well that when the customer said he&#39;s &quot;not even listening for WM_SETÂ­TEXT messages&quot;, he means that he&#39;s not doing he thinks would cause styles to change in response WM_SETTEXT &#8212; clearly, if his code isn&#39;t changing the style, the style change must be a mystery, because he assumes that the operating system can&#39;t possibly be badly-designed enough to react to WM_SETTEXT that way.</p>
<p>Now, this assumption turns out not to be valid, but that&#39;s not the poor customer&#39;s fault. It&#39;s our fault, and we should just fess up to it instead of blaming the victim for providing &quot;incomplete&quot; information. It doesn&#39;t help your case that the MSDN documentation to which you linked doesn&#39;t mention SysLink&#39;s silly WS_TABSTOP behavior.</p>
<p>The right response is &quot;Sorry about that. We&#39;ve filed a doc bug.&quot;</p>

<p>What? That&#39;s not what I get out of that at all. My reading of &quot;I&#39;m not even listening for WM_SETTEXT&quot; is much closer to &quot;not only am I not doing anything actively that would cause styles to change on WM_SETTEXT, I&#39;m not even grabbing WM_SETTEXT messages in the first place, so I can&#39;t!&quot;</p>
<p>What do you think &quot;not even&quot; means?</p>

		<p>@No, @Evan: &nbsp;exactly, don&#39;t blame the customer for not having source code to the SysLink control!! &nbsp;I assume Raymond was linking to this section of the MSDN page about SysLink creation: &nbsp;&quot;Specifying the WS_TABSTOP style ensures that the user will be able to select a link by tabbing to it and pressing the Enter key.&quot; &nbsp;Nowhere does it say anything about modification of WS_TABSTOP style on WM_SETTEXT. &nbsp;Without access to the source code like Raymond had, the customer had no choice but to go by what is stated in MSDN &#8211; which states nothing about this behavior. &nbsp;So they assumed there was a bug.</p>
<p>A more interesting question would be why did the customer notice this in the first place?</p>

		<p>And think about the typical usage of the SysLink control. &nbsp;I can&#39;t fathom a reason why I would have special handling for WM_SETTEXT. &nbsp;So most customers, probably including this one, aren&#39;t going to do anything special, and just defer to the SysLink control&#39;s default handling&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
