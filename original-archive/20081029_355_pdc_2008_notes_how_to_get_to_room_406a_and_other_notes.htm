<p> Today is the day of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/09/25/8965130.aspx"> my talk</a>. I'm always a bit nervous before these things, because I'm never sure if what I'm going to present matches up with what people are expecting. Most people who come to my PDC talk don't know who I am, so they aren't expecting me to toss out a few catch phrases, use my psychic powers, and tell stories about how a bug in a 16-bit scanner driver written in 1993 is the reason why TCP/IP is so complicated. (That last part was <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/12/04/yule_blogs/#The_Old_New_Thing"> a parody</a>.) </p>
<p> Today's notes: </p>
<ul>
<li>They certainly don't make navigating around the Los Angeles     Convention Center easy.     My talk is in room 406A.     Since the room number is in the 400's,     it is naturally on the <i>third</i> floor.     And to get to the third floor,     you get into the elevator and push&nbsp;<i>2</i>. </li>
<li>Someday, they will remember to put a clock in the room     where the speaker can see it.     That way, you have a clue how you're doing on time.     You might think that when I glance at my laptop,     I'm consulting some speaker notes.     Nope, I'm just checking the time. </li>
<li>A relatively quiet place to work is in the valley     outside meeting room 151.     The operative word here is <i>relatively</i>.     It's still noisy, but the carpeting muffles the noise better     than the big open spaces which are more echoey. </li>
<li>The meals at the PDC are free.     The snacks are free.     The milk, juice, soda, water, and coffee are free.     There is only one thing that isn't free,     and that's the coffee at the Starbuck's stand     near the main room.     And there's always a line.     Leave it to the geeks to find the one thing that     they have to pay for and line up for it. </li>
</ul>

<p>That was for backward compatibility with the previous convention center. Your room used to be on the fourth floor. The reason you need to push 2 to get to the third floor was to support a previous legendary king of England that I&#8217;m not allowed to name (please, no guess as I&#8217;ll have to delete them) who could not count up to 3.</p>

		<p>Paying for Starbucks &#8211; it&#8217;s odd that anyone would pay for the mysterious bitter burnt substance that they sell. Perhaps it&#8217;s the candy that they sprinkle said substance on that people are really buying.</p>

		<p>Ed: both 2 and 5 work because the room was mistakenly put on the 2nd floor before the center was completed and early visitors of the incomplete convention center got used to the location, so it could not be changed afterward to avoid confusing them.</p>

<p>&quot;Then shalt thou count to three, no more, no less. Three shall be the number thou shalt count, and the number of the counting shall be three. Four shalt thou not count, neither count thou two, excepting that thou then proceed to three. Five is right out.

		<p>Maybe it&#8217;s simply that the LA Convention Center is part of R&#8217;lyeh, which is described as &quot;abnormal, non-Euclidian, and loathsomely redolent of spheres and dimensions apart from ours&quot;.</p>

<p>It makes perfect sense to British English speakers, we essentially zero index floor numbers, although the ground floor gets called simply that not the zeroth floor ;-).</p>
<p>Only explains the lift numbers not the room number though&#8230;</p>

		<p>The office building I work in uses 0-based numbering, but like the British, refers to ground floor as &quot;Ground floor.&quot;</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s only zero-based because the building has 13 floors, but NO, we can&#8217;t have a Floor 13&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
