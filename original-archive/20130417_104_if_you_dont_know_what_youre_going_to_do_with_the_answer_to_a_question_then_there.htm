<p>A customer asked the following question:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  We've found that on Windows&nbsp;XP, when we call the XYZ function with the Awesome flag, the function fails for no apparent reason. However, it works correctly on Windows 7. Do you have any ideas about this? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> So far, the customer has described what they have observed, but they haven't actually asked a question. It's just nostalgia, and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/15/8397753.aspx"> nostalgia is not a question</a>. (I'm rejecting "Do you have an ideas about this?" as a question because it too vague to be a meaningful question.) </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  Please be more specific about your question. Do you want to obtain Windows&nbsp;7-style behavior on Windows&nbsp;XP? Do you want to obtain Windows&nbsp;XP-style behavior on Windows&nbsp;7? Do you merely want to understand why the two behave differently? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The customer replied, </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  Why do they behave differently? Was it a new design for Windows 7? If so, how do the two implementations differ? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I fired up a handy copy of Windows&nbsp;XP in a virtual machine and started stepping through the code, and then I stopped and realized I was about to do a few hours' worth of investigation for no clear benefit. So I stopped and responded to their question with my own question. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  Why do you want to know the reason for the change in behavior? How will the answer affect what you do next? Consider the following three answers: </p>
<ol>
<li>"The behavior was redesigned in Windows&nbsp;7." </li>
<li>"The Windows&nbsp;XP behavior was a bug that was fixed     in Windows&nbsp;7." </li>
<li>"The behavior change was a side-effect of a Windows Update     hotfix." </li>
</ol>
<p> What will you do differently if the answer is (1) rather than (2) or (3)? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The customer never responded. That saved me a few hours of my life. </p>
<p> If you don't know what you're going to do with the answer to a question, then there's not much point in others working hard to answer it. You're just <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/02/02/10263027.aspx"> creating work for others for no reason</a>. </p>

		<p>(3) has a real potential difference. Both (1) and (2) mean a simple version check is enough for which version to expect. (3) requires checking for the presence or absence of a hotfix.</p>

		<p>suppose they have an support agreement that entitles them to unlimited support cases, or more support cases then they would ever use in a given period. Why not ask questions for the sake of asking questions, What do they care if it took your hours to find the answer.</p>

		<p>Possible answer: &quot;We want to document the behavior for OUR customers.&quot; &nbsp;As mentioned above, this puts the hotfix case in a separate category from the XP-vs-Win7 case.</p>

		<p>More then likely the answer is &quot;Because my manager wants to know and is breathing down my neck about it. He isn&#39;t going to DO anything with it, but he&#39;s demanding to get an &#39;authoritative&#39; answer&quot;</p>

		<p>Seems to me they&#39;re asking so that they will know if the change was on purpose or perhaps an unintentional change that would be fixed later. Knowing that information would potentially keep them from having to re-engineer something when it&#39;s going to be just a transient issue.</p>
<p>No offense, Raymond&#8230; and perhaps the situation would have been helped if they actually replied to the last question you asked&#8230; but, the answer you gave really wasn&#39;t helpful and I&#39;d have been rather put off if that was the response I was given. &nbsp;(Then again, I would have explained why I need to know better than that person).</p>

		<p>@VIMH, Raymond&#39;s time (as is people&#39;s in general) is not free. &nbsp;If the customer doesn&#39;t have a reason for him to spend hours answering better than &quot;because I was curious,&quot; it&#39;s a waste of Raymond&#39;s time to figure it out.</p>
<p>@Tyler Reddun, then the Microsoft response can be &quot;file a support incident and we&#39;ll be glad to charge you for an answer.&quot;</p>

		<p>One possible answer: the customer wanted to deploy their app to Windows XP and Windows 7, and wanted to pass the Awesome flag to the XYZ function. This would entail backporting the fix to Windows XP (assuming the answer was 2), and giving the customer a hotpatch they could distribute with their app&#39;s installer.</p>

		<p>@arghhhhhhhhhhh: &nbsp;You could get all pouty about it, or take it as a life lesson to be direct and say what you mean. &nbsp;&quot;This behavior is different. &nbsp;Is this a bug or expected? &nbsp;Are there specific conditions that cause the difference so we can work around it?&quot;</p>

		<p>How is it unreasonable to ask for an explanation of the goal before taking on a time consuming task to answer a question, especially when it&#39;s couched vaguely? &nbsp;Chances are that if the asker can&#39;t articulate a coherent reason or goal, they didn&#39;t have a genuine need for the information anyway. &nbsp;(Not that it ever stops that type from asking.)</p>

		<p>The Windows 8 compatibility/compliance test program noticed that my employer&#39;s application is in the AppCompat list with a custom shim (i.e., not a standard shim). &nbsp;I figured out what exactly the shim does, but we don&#39;t know why it&#39;s in place, because what the shim is fixing we don&#39;t know. &nbsp;Who could we contact about this to get more information?</p>
<p>Also, would putting a compatibility manifest into our program suppress this shim, assuming we fixed whatever issue is occurring?</p>

		<p>@Myria: I believe Product Support Services should be your first port of call, unless anyone else knows better. However shims are applied only to a very specific version of an executable, so even a rebuild with a bumped version should remove any shims. Certainly a manifest declaring compatibility with a specific version of Windows should automatically disable all AppCompat functionality.</p>

		<p>too rude a reply IMHO, you should have said that you didn&#39;t know off hand why.</p>

		<p>@ulric Whoever submitted the question should see it just as a good opportunity to learn how to ask sensible questions. An extremely valuable skill that way too many people actually possess.</p>

		<p>I think it&#39;s obvious what they meant. They were interested in hearing what exactly is the contract for this behavior (XP results? Windows 7 results? Undefined?) so that they can rely on it in the future.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>They already said that the old behavior was a bug, so they&#39;re not asking what the correct behavior is. They already claim to know. So what are they asking?

		<p>I think Asdbsd is right. Hence it wouldn&#39;t have been useful for Raymond to fire up his VM, since he would have done more or less (but maybe with some more detail) what the questioner had already done. Then you see that the behaviour is different, but that was already known.</p>
<p>What the questioner wants to know is whether the change was intentional and if so, what the reason was, and if not, what the implications are.</p>
<p>The reason the questioner stopped asking was because he couldn&#39;t get a sensible answer.</p>

		<p>To be honest, it seems to me that Raymond&#39;s manager would be at fault. &nbsp;I&#39;ve always thought of managers are responsible for protecting their underlings from unnecessary work or bother. In general, it shouldn&#39;t have to be the people who are actually doing the work who also have to determine whether the work should be done at all.</p>

		<p>Hi, this BLOG post and the other you link to at the end is perfect. I have been supporting SDKs for Crystal Reports and related products for about 16 years now and we get these types of questions more often than you would think. Would you mind if myself or a colleague linked to this blog posting from on of our own blogs?</p>

		<p>&quot;I have to use this service and it appears to be working ok, but I&#39;m worried that I don&#39;t understand something about it that&#39;s important&quot;.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>They just word it this way. When they say &quot;However, it works correctly&quot; they probably mean &quot;However it does not return error&quot;. And they ask for reason because they can&#39;t pinpoint the correct question right and seek understanding in general.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
