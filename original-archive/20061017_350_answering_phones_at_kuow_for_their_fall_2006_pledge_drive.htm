<p>I spent Saturday evening as a volunteer answering the phone for one of our local public radio stations, <a href="http://www.kuow.org/">KUOW</a>. This was the first time I had worked a pledge drive, and it was a fun experience.</p>
<p> I was there sort of as an honorary member of a group of friends who get together every week for drinks; they decided to volunteer for the pledge drive as a fun change of pace. Here's sort of how the evening goes: You'll be sitting there at the table chatting with your friends, and then a phone rings and the conversation instantly stops while somebody took a call. By the time the call is over, everybody had forgotten what they had been talking about and a new conversation starts up. There were a lot of conversations that just ended abruptly and were never resumed. Great for people with short attention spans. </p>
<p> When the volunteer coordinator announces, "Pledge break in two minutes," it means things are going to get exciting soon. The calls arrive in waves. The moment the pledge telephone number is announced, the phones start ringing. A few minutes after the pledge break ends, the phones quiet down. (That's the best time to go for a bathroom break.) </p>
<p> At one point, the person next to me started taking a pledge and then went into a coughing fit. She handed me the receiver, and I finished the call for her. But while I was on the phone with her pledge, <i>my</i> phone rang, and another volunteer had to answer my phone. The second volunteer had the presence of mind to take her phone out of the rotation before answering mine, so the chain wouldn't continue! (During one of those short conversations, the volunteer that went into the coughing fit explained that she started volunteering because her then-boyfriend did it. "I wanted to make sure he wasn't coming just to meet cute girls.") </p>
<p> The second volunteer (the one who answered my phone) later took a pledge from the host of one of KUOW's news programs! She answered the phone and recognized the caller's name but played it safe because, hey, it might just be a coincidence. When she asked for the caller's e-mail address, he said, "They've got it already. I work there." Now sure of her caller's identity, she decided to have a little fun and tried to upsell him to the next pledge level. </p>
<p> I'm told that in the old days, the phone system didn't randomize the assignment of incoming calls to telephones. Instead, it operated as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hunt_Group"> hunt group</a>: There was a "hot seat" that always got the first call, then the second seat always got the call if the hot seat was busy, and so on. Eventually, they realized that this wasn't fair to the person in the hot seat and they installed a system that spread the calls out more evenly. </p>
<p> When you're in the car or at home listening to the pledge drive, it sounds like the hosts are right there in the pledge room, but that's just an illusion produced through the magic of radio. (Special effects in radio are a lot cheaper than they are on television.) The hosts are upstairs in the main control studio, and the pledge drive volunteers are downstairs in <a href="http://www.kuow.org/about/studio_rentals.asp"> the performance studio</a>. There is a microphone in the pledge room so the hosts can hear if, say, a cheer goes up. </p>
<p> The entire operation is low-tech. We take pledges with the tried-and-true "pen and paper" technique. Some of the people who call in think we're all in front of computers with the entire membership database available at the touch of a button. No such luck. It's great that you've been a member for ten years and have your membership number handy, but I can't call up your address; you'll have to give it to me again. </p>
<p> On the other hand, the low-tech way of recording pledges means that when somebody makes a pledge, say, ten minutes after their favorite show ends, you can <a href="http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/05315/604987.stm"> backdate</a> their pledge form so their pledge counts towards the show they wanted to support. </p>
<p> The current tally is recorded on a whiteboard that is updated by hand. The highest-tech part of the whole operation is a webcam that sends a picture of the whiteboard upstairs so the hosts can see how things are going. </p>
<p> If everybody is quiet in the pledge room, you can hear the on-air audio feed, which is piped in at low volume. When the calls are coming in, the room gets quite noisy, and some people use an earplug to block the non-telephone ear. It basically means that down in the pledge room, we have no idea what's happening on-air. I'm told that during an earlier pledge drive, the host said something like "At some point during the evening, I'm going to repeat a song. When this happens, call the pledge line and tell us the name of the song." Of course, nobody told the volunteers about this. Somebody would call up and say the title of a song and the volunteers would have no idea why. </p>
<p> When the volunteer coordinator asked us for the name of our group so we could be acknowledged on the air, we had to do a bit of brainstorming. The group doesn't have a name (it's just a bunch of friends who get together for drinks), so we made up a funny name on the spot. I'm told that one year, the group gave its name as <i>The Bill Radke Fan Club</i>. (This was back in the heyday of Radke's show <a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/news/0250/news-dawdy2.php"> <i>Rewind</i></a>.) Bill Radke was upstairs in the booth and freaked out. He was afraid it was a bunch of stalkers who rummage through his trash looking for discarded socks or something. Once convinced that they weren't a bunch of crazy people, he came down and even answered the phones for a while. But he didn't do a very good job: It was as if he'd never seen a pledge form before. He'd be baffled by the instructions and fill it out wrong. Ultimately, his technique settled into "answer the phone, chat with the caller for five minutes, then hand the phone to a volunteer to collect the pledge information." </p>
<p> This year, the show that happened to be on the air at the time was <a href="http://www.kuow.org/programs/swing_years.asp"> <i>The Swing Years and Beyond</i></a>, so we chose the name <i>The Swing Beers</i>. When the name was announced, the on-air banter went like this: </p>
<p> Amanda: "And in our pledge room answering phones we have a group called <i>The Swing Beers</i>. I don't know what that means." </p>
<p> Ken: "I do." </p>
<p> Ken Vincent obviously drinks beer. </p>

		<p>May I be the first to ask, what on Earth is a pledge drive? I<br />
understand it&#8217;s some kind of fundraising. Is this common in the US?</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

		<p>&quot;Instead, it operated as a hunt group:&quot;</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s still a hunt group. &nbsp;They just got a system that supports a different hunt group algorithm (that one is sometimes called &quot;distributed&quot;) instead of a simple linear search.</p>

		<p>Public radio is supported completely bu contributions from corporations as well as private citizens. &nbsp;Advertising it not allowed. &nbsp;When a public radio station gets short on funds, they have a Pledge Drive, where people call in and pledge to donate a certain amount of money. &nbsp;Hopefully, they also send that money in. &nbsp;Once the pledged funds reach the required amount to keep operations going, the pledge drive is stopped and the station returns to regular programming.</p>

		<p>I haven&#8217;t listened to radio at all since my car radio broke, let<br />
alone public radio, but if it&#8217;s anything like public tv has become in<br />
the last few years, saying &#8220;advertising is not allowed&#8221; isn&#8217;t exactly<br />
correct&#8211;sponsors essentially get a free, short ad at the end of shows,<br />
and they are actually doing short commercials as such for the sponsors<br />
these days (last time I watched PBS, I remember seeing what I vaguely<br />
remember were Toyota ads after a home improvement show.) &nbsp;They&#8217;re<br />
not your typical broadcast tv ads, but they ARE, in fact, ads.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Not exactly. &nbsp;After all, it is &quot;public&quot; radio. &nbsp;On the other hand, KNON in Dallas is a funky little station is supported only by listener contributions. &nbsp;So the only interruptions I&#8217;ve heard during &quot;Texas Blues Radio&quot; (6pm &#8211; 8pm M-F) is when they are having a pledge drive. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve never voluteered for them, but it sounds like each show must hold its own pledge drive to pay for themselves and some portion of the general operating expenses. &nbsp;In their case, it really is important that you call in during the shows that you want to support.</p>

		<p>&quot;Special effects in radio are a lot cheaper than they are on television.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always struck by the fact that one of the most popular shows on radio in the late 1930&#8217;s through the 1940&#8217;s was a ventriloquist &#8211; Edgar Bergen! I guess it proves how good his jokes and delivery were.</p>

		<p>I was more than happy to pledge money to our local public radio, KPFT, a Pacifica station (listener-supported only). &nbsp;Note that this is not the same as &quot;Houston Public Radio,&quot; which is run out of the University of Houston, and is sponsored by members AND companies.</p>
<p>Their recent pledge drive was to upgrade their antenna that was the replacement for the one that had been damaged in multiple bombing attacks in the &#8217;70s. &nbsp;The voice of independence is a harsh mistress sometimes.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a small price to pay to not have to listen to any of the other stations that are, with the exception of music format, clones of the same ClearChannel crap.</p>

		<p>Just out of curiosity, has anyone ever pulled a Homer Simpson and called in a $250 million pledge just to get the pledge drive off the air?</p>

		<p>KUOW used not to play the sounds from the pledge room. When my wife, a professional fundraiser and veteran of WBUR (Boston) drives, showed up, she pointed out the difference to the station management: WBUR fundraising is *frenetic*. I like to think we&#8217;re hearing the results of her involvement!</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
