<p>
It should be second nature to you that the code which allocates memory
and the code which frees memory need to use the same allocator.
Most of the time, you think of it as
"If you allocate memory, you need to free it with the
corresponding mechanism,"
but this sentence works in the reverse direction as well:
If you hand memory to a function that will free it,
you have to <i>allocate</i> the memory with the corresponding mechanism.
</p>
<p>
Let's look at this question that appeared on a discussion group:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
I have the following method defined in my IDL file:
</p>
<pre>
HRESULT GetSomething([in, string] LPCWSTR pszArg,
                     [out] DWORD* pcchOut, 
                     [out, size_is(, *pcchOut)] LPWSTR* ppszOut);
</pre>
<p>
My server implementation of this method goes like this:
</p>
<pre>
STDMETHODIMP CSomething::GetSomething(
    LPCWSTR pszArg, DWORD* pcchOut, LPWSTR* ppszOut)
{
    HRESULT hr = ...
    DWORD cch = ...

    *pcchOut = cch;
    *ppszOut = new(nothrow) WCHAR[cch];
    // ... fill in *ppszOut if successful ...

    return hr;
}
</pre>
<p>
When I call this method from a client,
the COM server crashes
after <code>CSomething::GetSomething</code> returns.
What am I doing wrong?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The answer should be obvious to you,
particularly given the hint in the introductory paragraph,
but for some reason, the people on the discussion group
got all worked up about how the annotations on the <code>ppszOut</code>
parameter should have been written,
whether <code>*pcchOut</code> is a count of bytes
or <code>WCHAR</code>s,
how the marshaller was registered,
and nobody even noticed that the allocator didn't match the
deallocator.
</p>
<p>
The rule for COM is that any memory that one module allocates
and another module frees must use the COM task allocator.
The intent of this rule is to set down one simple,
straightforward rule;
without it,
everybody would have to
create their own mechanism for allocating and freeing
memory across module boundaries,
resulting in the same mishmash that we have in plain Win32,
with the global heap, the local heap, the process heap,
the C runtime library,
or even ad-hoc explicitly paired memory allocation functions like
<code>NetApiBufferAllocate</code> and
<code>NetApiBufferFree</code>.
</p>
<p>
Instead, with COM, it's very simple.
If you allocate memory that another COM component will free,
then you must use <code>CoTaskMemAlloc</code>*
and if you free memory that another COM component allocated,
then you must use <code>CoTaskMemFree</code>.*
</p>
<p>
In this case, the <code>CSomething::GetSomething</code> method is
allocating memory that the calling component will eventually free.
Therefore, the memory must be allocated with
<code>CoTaskMemAlloc</code>.*
</p>
<p>
<b>Nitpicker's corner</b>
</p>
<p>
*Or a moral equivalent.
Note that <code>SysAllocString</code> is not a moral equivalent
to <code>CoTaskMemAlloc</code>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Remark</b>:
MSDN can't seem to make up its mind whether to
double the L at the end of "marshal" before adding a suffix,
so when searching for information about marshalling,
try it

		<blockquote><p>
  &gt; SysAllocString is not a moral equivalent to CoTaskMemAlloc.
</p></blockquote>
<p>As far as I can determine, SysAllocString does use CoTaskMemAlloc but stores the length of the string at the start and returns you the pointer to the string immediately following the length. SysFreeString must presumably decrement by 4 then CoTaskMemFree. So you can&#8217;t mix and match API, but they have come from the same pool.</p>

		<p>I apologize if this is considered a moral equivalent, but I think that it&#8217;s kind of an oddball&#8230; if your code ever comes across a STGMEDIUM structure, I recommend reading the documentation for ReleaseStgMedium very thoroughly.</p>
<p>The STGMEDIUM/ReleaseStgMedium mechanism is quite useful, but you should be very clear about who is supposed to free (or release) the medium. I&#8217;ve caused a memory leak or two by getting it wrong.</p>

		<p>@Nawak:</p>
<p>The COM task memory allocator IS required, because it has one requirement that none of the pre-existing memory allocators (HeapAlloc, LocalAlloc, malloc, etc.) could support: cross-process allocation and freeing.</p>
<p>Due to the joy of DCOM, it&#8217;s entirely possible for process A (on machine X) to allocate memory and send it to process B (on machine Y). &nbsp;No pre-existing allocator (that I know of) will support this, and this is required for DCOM to actually be Distributed.</p>

		<p>I cannot understand how people cannot know this, but then again I learned though the book OLE 2.0, and as far as I can see 99% of programmer seem to just copy/paste/hack as they go along. &nbsp;No one learns.</p>
<p>CoTaskMemAlloc (or rather, IMalloc) is not really about allocating cross-process, it doesn&#8217;t allocate shared memory. It probably just maps to LocalAlloc underneath.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s about having a platform-neutral API that provides 1) alloc 2) free 3) get block size,</p>
<p>all three of which are required by a marshaller.</p>
<p>The OLE API 2.0 is cross platform and is not supposed to be dependent on the Win32, that&#8217;s why it has its own allocation API, and a language neutral one.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t allocate shared memory, there is no shared memory on Windows. </p>
<p>Something that marshals between processes or machine can get the task allocator on one side, get the size of the block with 3) and copy the date in a shared location, then get the allocator on the other side and copy the block back in there. &nbsp;And now the client on the other side can safely free that memory with his task allocator &#8211; even if he&#8217;s using a customized allocator.</p>

		<p>OK, can someone hit me over the head with it? Where is the deallocator?</p>

		<p>Maybe it will be an incredibly stupid remark as I don&#8217;t know anything about COM.</p>
<p>Does this CoTaskMemAlloc really solves a problem?</p>
<p>Why is this different from the &#8220;mishmash that we have in plain Win32&#8221;? It really looks like Yet Another Memory Allocator from where I stand (far from the subject remember)</p>
<p>Ok, defining what allocator is *the* COM allocator was really needed, but couldn&#8217;t it have been one of the already existing ones?</p>
<p>It wouldn&#8217;t change the moral of the story here, except that there would be one less allocator in the wild.</p>
<p>It seemed to me that if the returned block of memory had any special property other than &#8220;must be freed with CoTaskMemFree&#8221;, maybe more people on the mailing list would have noticed. &#8220;Dude! Memory you allocate with &#8216;new&#8217; is too coarse and insufficiently lubricated! It can&#8217;t pass module boundaries man!!&#8221;</p>

		<p>@Ian:</p>
<p>eventhough I have never programmed with COM before (i think), the idea is that you should know what the de-allocator is, because of the agreement that COM always uses CoTaskMemAlloc and CoTaskMemFree.</p>
<p>So, implicitly the de-allocator is CoTaskMemFree, because that&#8217;s what was agreed upon when entering the world of COM.</p>
<p>I think Raymod didn&#8217;t add the de-allocator because the people on the mailing list didn&#8217;t know what it was either (they sent the memory to some 3rd pary component maybe).</p>

		<p>Jonathan Pryor: They way cross-process allocation works is that the marsheller in the client frees the memory after it sends it to the server, then the marsheller in the server allocates it in that other process. The memory isn&#8217;t &quot;magically&quot; shared between the two (consider the case where client and server are on different machines).</p>
<p>With that in mind, you still *could* use an existing memory allocation strategy. The reason CoTaskMemAlloc exists is as Raymond said: IMallocSpy (though COM could&#8217;ve been done without IMallocSpy, obviously).</p>

		<p>My understanding has always been that the reason CoTaskMemAlloc exists was strictly for the in-proc case. &nbsp;If my COM object is served out of DLL 1 and consumed by DLL 2, I can&#8217;t make the assumption that we&#8217;re both using the same implementation of new and delete. &nbsp;</p>
<p>*Most* of the time new just calls into LocalAlloc but it&#8217;s possible that DLL 2 could have been compiled against a custom heap implementation. &nbsp;Thus the need to agree on allocator and deallocator.</p>

<p>I had a look at COM on the Mac. There are two competing implementations, that provided by the module &quot;Microsoft OLE&quot;, where mine is CFM and that done by rolling your own using the CFPlugIn architecture. The later one depends on any plug-in respecting the CFAllocator it was given at factory creation time. So can the real Mac CoTaskMemAlloc stand up?</p>

<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
