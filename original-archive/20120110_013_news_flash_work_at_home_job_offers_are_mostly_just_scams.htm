		<p>Also, the sites where you need to &quot;register&quot; keep your credentials in open form.</p>
<p>Well, if you use same credentials as in your other accounts (bank, email) &#8212; trouble is coming!</p>

		<p>This &quot;mostly&quot; aspect is somewhat intriguing. Now I&#39;m interested in the tiny fraction of these offers that aren&#39;t scams! Where do they exist? What are they for? How can you tell they&#39;re not scams? Etc.?</p>

		<p>@Gabe That&#39;s probably the same problem those people have who really want to give a ferrari to the one millionth user of their website! ;)</p>

		<p>There&#39;s a catalogue of pointless kitchen gadgets and the like in the UK that uses work-at-home people (although it&#39;s not exactly &quot;at home&quot;). The people that sign up receive a batch of the catalogues and distribute them to doorsteps, then collect them back up later (the catalogues come with notes saying when this will happen). If you have an order then you just leave it with the catalogue, but even if not the catalogues get collected (I&#39;m not sure why; perhaps to distribute to other roads later). These people also deliver the actual goods, I believe.</p>
<p>I suspect the way you tell what type of job it is is the pay! Although perhaps even the legitimate ones quote unrealistic wages in the adverts.</p>

		<p>@Gabe: Some freelance programmers can and MUST work at home. Their &quot;customers&quot; sometime even cannot setup proper development environment for them to work at, and they really pay when they get the resulting website/application package anyway so they don&#39;t care where you code it. (Wile others will require you to buy yourself a laptop to work at their places.)</p>

		<p>Cheong00: Where do you live that you see freelance programming job offers on signs posted on random utility polls and such?</p>

		<p>Yeah the &quot;Make £££ working at home&quot; ads are pretty much a scam (Though my mum was actually on one of those catalogue things that @Jim mentioned &#8211; it wasn&#39;t a scam, though she only made a few quid from it).</p>
<p>More startups now are using &quot;telecommuting&quot; where people work from home (and often use a VPN to connect to the work network) because it saves money.</p>

		<p>I work at home, using oDesk. And as programmer. Not all &quot;work at home&quot; offers are scam, and lately the shift is from bogus offers to real offers. What you said is exactly that, is related to &quot;years ago&quot;, today is 2012.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
