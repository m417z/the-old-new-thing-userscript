		<p>One of my favorite Onion columns from long ago was &quot;Walken in LA&quot; which was just a huge rant about hot dogs, ostensibly by Chistopher Walken. You can find it in various posts via Google (for some reason it&#8217;s not archived on the Onion website or I&#8217;d link to it). It&#8217;s a hilarious article to imagine being spoken in Christopher Walken&#8217;s diction.</p>

		<p>I still maintain that Walken should have been cast as Willy Wonka in the recent re-make of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. &nbsp;He&#8217;s the perfect mix of creepy and weird.</p>

		<p>Christopher Walken&#8217;s greatest performance, as everyone knows was as &quot;Crazy Dancing Man&quot; in Fat Boy Slim&#8217;s seminal work &quot;Weapon of Choice&quot;.</p>

		<p>Raymond, sorry for offtopic &#8211; your Suggestion Box is closed for comments now.</p>
<p>Please, answer the question about Rich Text Format (RTF):</p>
<p>Why RTF notation is so similar to Knuth&#8217;s TeX notation?</p>

		<p>I always gave him top marks after watching The Legend of Sleepy Hollow. Most actors insist on a big part, good dialogue and lots of lines. Walken&#8217;s lines comprised of: &quot;grrrrraaaaahhh&quot;. Once.</p>
<p>Kudos to the guy for putting in a performance that matched the character instead of the usual ego-trip.</p>
<p>He did a skit for (I think0 Saturday Night Live once where he read the fairytale of the 3 little pigs, in his inimitable style, wearing a patterned jumper.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I loved that cameo he did on the Simpsons:</p>
<p>Christopher Walken (reading to a bunch of kids): Goodnight&#8230; room&#8230; Goodnight&#8230; Moon&#8230;. Goodnight&#8230; cow&#8230; jumping over&#8230; the moon.</p>
<p>[frightened kids slowly try to move away]</p>
<p>Christopher Walken: Please, children&#8230; scootch closer&#8230; Don&#8217;t make me tell you again&#8230; about the scootching&#8230; You in the red, chop-chop.</p>

		<p>Ha haha, this is great. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been a Christopher Walken fan since &#8216;Brainstorm&#8217;. &nbsp;Great movie.</p>
<p>Hey oldnewthing, I&#8217;d like to talk to you about a msdn blog post of yours I saw a while back about a SPAM archive you had. &nbsp;I can&#8217;t find your contact info on here anywhere. &nbsp;Can you please contact me at norm31455, minus the 31455, at laudermilch dot com? &nbsp;That should throw the spam crawlers for a loop :)</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>
<p>Norm</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
