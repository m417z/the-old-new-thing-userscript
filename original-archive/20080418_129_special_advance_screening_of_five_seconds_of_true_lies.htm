<p>In response to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/04/19/2182810.aspx"> <i>Perhaps the movies made too literal a translation</i></a>, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/presspass/exec/ssinofsky/default.mspx"> Steve Sinofsky</a> reminded me that everybody at Microsoft got a special advance screening of the movie <i>True Lies</i>, or at least five seconds' worth.</p>
<p> The computer that Arnold Schwarzenegger's character infiltrates runs the Arabic version of Windows&nbsp;3.1, and the Arabic version of Word&nbsp;6 appeared on screen as well. Steve was in charge of the Office division at the time and managed to get permission to show a clip from a rough cut of the movie at the 1994 <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/09/21/764634.aspx"> company meeting</a>. He explains, "I had to run to the airport and pick up a beta tape, show it at the meeting, and then return it via air-courier." </p>
<p> It was like some sort of spy movie. </p>
<p> Oh, wait. </p>

		<p>How did Win3.1 handle arabic ? Did it support unicode ? Was right-to-left font rendering a standard feature of win3.1 ?</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t believe 3.1 supported Unicode, but rather used the &quot;per language&quot; code page approach. &nbsp;That is, while the first 128 characters always remained the same, the last 128 characters for each byte were specific to a language, and could only be interpreted properly if you were running it in the appropriate language mode. &nbsp;I have no idea on font rendering, but RTL rendering is extremely old, I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised.</p>

		<p>Apologies for the off-topic comment, but I just wanted to thank you for pointing out the Asteroid Cafe in one of your previous posts. &nbsp;With me working in Fremont and my fiance working in Ballard, we like to try out various places in Fremont before heading off to the ballet. &nbsp;With it&#8217;s fantastic food, Asteroid has become one of our favorites. &nbsp;So thank you for pointing them out.</p>

		<p>Hebrew Windows 3.1 had RTL rendering, including TrueType fonts. Actually, Windows for Workgroups 3.11 imporved on the Hebrew support, hence everyone in Israel used (=pirated) it instead.</p>
<p>And yes, it didn&#8217;t support Unicode, just used codepage 1255 for Hebrew. Which, of course, was incompatible with DOS Hebrew support (CP 862).</p>

		<p>But he wouldn&#8217;t have to return the HD-DVD via air-courier, the distributor is looking for an excuse to be rid of it&#8230;</p>

<p>This was not consumer Beta (Betamax). That was professional Betacam format.</p>

		<p>Beta is a word Sony used in several trademarks. <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Betamax</a></p>
<p>The link mentions that the last Sony Betamax was made in 2002.</p>
<p>@Yuhong Bao: I took the beta to refer to the tape because the movie hadn&#8217;t been released and the tape was lent by the studio to Microsoft.</p>

		<p>That movie inspired me to install the Arabic version of Windows 3.1 on a spare computer in the office. &nbsp;Then I swapped the spare with a co worker&#8217;s primary computer as a prank. &nbsp;She was very confused for awhile&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
