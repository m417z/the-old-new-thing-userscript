<p>A trend I've noticed in journalism is to make some sort of outrageous statement, but then stick a question mark at the end to disavow any responsibility for the statement. By changing it to a question, you're avoiding actually having to back up what you write. "I'm not saying this is actually true. I'm just raising the question."</p>
<p> For example, a headline might read "The sign of something new?" The author doesn't want to actually back up the claim that the subject is the sign of something new, so he'll just say it with a question mark. Now the responsibility to support or refute the claim has been shifted to you, the reader. </p>
<p> The question itself doesn't need to have any merit whatsoever. In fact, you can just make up the craziest stuff imaginable; as long as you put a question mark after it, you're home free. And it doesn't even need to take the form of a question! </p>
<p> Made-up examples: </p>
<ul>
<li>"Is  Bill Gates the Leader of an Underground Cult?" </li>
<li>"Does exercise kill you?" </li>
<li>     "Is Tiger Woods a Sex Addict?"     Oh wait,     <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/tiger-woods-sex-addict/story?id=9295425">     I didn't make that one up</a>. </li>
<li>"Is Microsoft's Kinect racist?"     Okay, that     <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/209708/Is_Microsoft_Kinect_Racist.html">     wasn't made-up either</a>.     But making it a question relieves the reporter of     actually investigating the report.     Fortunately,     <a href="http://blogs.consumerreports.org/electronics/2010/11/consumer-reports-tests-kinect-facial-recognition-problems-video.html">     Consumer Reports did the legwork to debunk the charge</a>.     Even better: The article that started it all     uses the weasely statement-question-mark:     "<a href="http://www.gamespot.com/news/6283514.html">Kinect has problems recognizing dark-skinned users?</a>" </li>
</ul>
<p> Perhaps I should've titled this article "Journalists are just making up stuff and printing it as if it were news?" </p>
<p> <b>Bonus journalistic head-scratcher</b>: The word "official" appears to have taken on a meaning I was previously unaware of. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/222142/remains_of_the_day_zune_out.html"> It's official</a>: The Microsoft Zune has gone the way of the Kin, the Courier, and Bob. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> If you actually <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/zune-2011-3"> click through to the article's source</a>, and then <a href="http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-03-14/microsoft-said-to-stop-releasing-new-zune-models-as-demand-ebbs.html"> click through to <i>that</i> article's source</a>, you'll see that the source is a person "who declined to be identified because the decision hasn't been announced." </p>
<p> So let me see if I understand this. They're saying that a statement is "official" because it comes from an anonymous person who doesn't wish to be identified because no official statement has yet been made. </p>
<p> (I think my copy of <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0465026567?tag=tholneth-20"> <i>G&ouml;del, Escher, Bach</i></a> just exploded.) </p>

		<p>I remember the Daily Show did a short segment on this a few months ago as well. Unfortunately I can&#39;t track the particular episode down, but it&#39;s along the same thing: &quot;President Obama: The worst president ever?&quot;</p>
<p>I for one believe it&#39;s a growing trend, and I for one think it&#39;s horrible. But what can you do short of buying Fox News and changing their ways?</p>

		<p>Is the Raymond Chen&#39;s Old New Thing turning into just another .NET blog? &nbsp;Some readers certainly think so according to an unscientific poll posted on our website visited only by editors, who are looking to create a story.

		<p>Raymond, I dunno if you Fark, but you should read the Fark book if you&#39;re interested in the ways mass media make up stories/run filler/are generally lazy as hell: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.amazon.com/Its-Not-News-Fark-Media/dp/1592403662/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1318529086&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/&#8230;/ref=sr_1_1</a></p>
<p>It&#39;s a good read even if you&#39;re not a fan of the Fark webpage, and yes it covers the &quot;questions as headlines&quot; phenomenon.</p>

		<p>The completely-joking sense of &quot;it&#39;s official&quot; (as in &quot;it&#39;s official: [whatever] now sucks&quot;) has all but replaced the actual meaning of &quot;it&#39;s official&quot;, to the point where it&#39;s disorienting to see it applied to something that could possibly be an official statement of something. &nbsp;Oh, and it&#39;s completely played out, which stops nobody.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s also not journalism to make your headline simply attribute another source. &nbsp;Say the New York Times headline is: &quot;USA Today: Raymond Chen blog entry suggests Zune statement not official.&quot;</p>
<p>I just don&#39;t feel it&#39;s news to report what someone else is reporting. Why don&#39;t your reporters confirm the story?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Newspaper <span style="text-decoration:underline;">love</span> this, because it lets them cover the story while claiming that they&#39;re not covering the story. &quot;USA Today reports that &lt;young female celebrity&gt; is &lt;something scandalous&gt;. Hand-wringing ensues.&quot; The New York Times would never cover &lt;young female celebrity&gt;, because that&#39;s beneath them, but they <span style="text-decoration:underline;">can</span> cover the fact that other newspapers are reporting on it. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Amanda Knox was recently found not guilty, released, and sent home.</p>
<p>The Daily Mail had pre-written a story for the &quot;guilty&quot; and the &quot;not guilty&quot; option, and accidentally published the wrong one.</p>
<p>Somehow, the pre-written stories had quotes from lawyers at the trial. And while it&#39;s true that everyone at a trial always say the exact same damned thing regardless of the details, we have to ask if they information in the other version was any more genuine?</p>
<p>No, seriously, if they had published the right story, would there be any reason to believe that it contained any genuine information? I don&#39;t think so.</p>
<p>&quot;Journalists are just making up stuff and printing it as if it were news?&quot; &nbsp;Damn, I had no idea that Raymond was putting stuff into the queue before the internet was invented.</p>

		<p>I think John should have written: &quot;Is writing software that enables hundreds of thousands of posts with millions of comments, providing entertainment, knowledge, pathos, tales of love and death, soul searching, trivia, jokes and more IS worse than anything a certain former German leader did? Film at 11.&quot;</p>

		<p>&quot;The Kinect may not be racist, but by all accounts it demos quite well but is pretty much worthless in real-world use unless your living room is approximately the size of an aircraft hangar&quot;</p>
<p>Like a typical white guy&#39;s living room.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a documentary some years back about Fox News (Outfoxed?) where they show a string of clips of the station&#39;s hosts interviewing people / talking amonst themselves, and starting questions / comments with &quot;People are saying&#8230;.&quot; and &quot;Some people say&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>Also, I&#39;ve heard there&#39;s an Area Man who takes the Onion News for real&#8230;</p>

		<p>IMO, it&#39;s pretty standard to start a controversial topic like this as an eye catcher, then continue with an article that could be remotely tangent to the topic and come to conclusion with a few unconfirmed / non-credited opinion in between.</p>
<p>I regard this is a good training for analytical mind. Sometimes it could be quite challenging to figure out what is stated as fact and what is opinion.</p>

		<p>Maybe journalists can adopt the question mark as a ternary operator and have a &quot;Choose Your Own Adventure&quot; vibe going on:</p>
<p>&quot;Are Macs Better Than PCs&quot; ? See A3 : See B17</p>
<p>&quot;Does Smoking Really Cause Cancer&quot; ? See B3 : See the Cartoon section</p>
<p>etc.</p>
<p>This way, as long as journalists restrict themselves to strictly Boolean questions, everyone can be happy!</p>
<p>BTW, I just read on CBC that Dennis Ritchie died today. Sadly, that wasn&#39;t a made-up headline. :-(</p>

		<p>Does somebody at Improbable Research read The Old New Thing?</p>
<p>The very next day they have a post about a paper with a similar title (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.improbable.com/2011/10/14/ig-nobel-winner-writes-best-abstract-ever" rel="nofollow">http://www.improbable.com/&#8230;/ig-nobel-winner-writes-best-abstract-ever</a>): &quot;Can apparent superluminal neutrino speeds be explained as a quantum weak measurement?&quot;</p>
<p>The complete abstract: &quot;Probably not.&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
