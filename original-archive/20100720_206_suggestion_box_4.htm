<p>The topic backlog from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx"> Suggestion Box&nbsp;3</a> has nearly cleared out, and I've actually been enjoying not having to write up a reply every Monday for the past several months, but all good things must come to an end, and so, without much fanfare, we now have Suggestion Box&nbsp;4.</p>
<p> Remember, the suggestion box is for suggestions for future topics. It isn't for developer support, bug reports, or ranting. Topics I'm inclined to cover: </p>
<ul>
<li>Windows history (particularly the Windows&nbsp;95 era). </li>
<li>Windows user interface programming in Win32,     and shell programming in particular. </li>
<li>General programming topics (selectively). </li>
<li>Issues of general interest. </li>
<li>My personal hobbies. </li>
</ul>
<p> Topics I am not inclined to cover: </p>
<ul>
<li>The blog software itself.     You can visit the     <a href="http://communityserver.org/">Community Server home page</a>     and cruise their support forums. </li>
<li>Internet Explorer.     You can try     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie">the IE folks</a>. </li>
<li>Visual Studio. You can try one of the Visual Studio blogs. </li>
<li>Managed code. This is not a .NET blog.     I do not work on .NET technologies.     As far as .NET is concerned, I'm just another programmer like you.     Occasionally I touch a .NET-related topic     (including the annual "CLR Week"),     but I do not bring any inside expertise to the subject. </li>
<li>Non-software Microsoft topics, such as product support policies,     marketing tactics, jobs and careers, legal issues. </li>
<li>Microsoft software that isn't Windows. (Exchange, Office, ...) </li>
<li>Windows topics outside user interface programming.     (Plug and Play, Terminal Services, Windows Messenger,     Outlook Express, SQL, IIS, remoting, SOA...) </li>
<li>User interface programming in anything other than Win32.     (Because I know nothing about it.) </li>
<li>Debugging a specific problem. (Not of general interest.) </li>
<li>Predictions for the future. (What's the title of this blog again?) </li>
<li>Participation in Internet memes. </li>
</ul>
<p> Selected products at Microsoft participate in the <a href="http://connect.microsoft.com/">Connect</a> program, and many more have official blogs. </p>
<p> Suggestions should be between two and four sentences in length. Think of it as an elevator pitch: You have three seconds to get your point across. Please also search the Web site first because your suggestion may have already been covered. (Possibly as a suggestion that was submitted to an earlier Suggestion Box that was not accepted.) And remember, questions aren't suggestions. </p>
<p> The Suggestion Box will be open for only two weeks, and I will be much more selective about which one I choose to accept than in previous go-rounds. I'll answer one every Monday of 2012 (minus holidays and special events such as CLR Week), and once the end of the year is reached, that's the end of Suggestion Box&nbsp;4. </p>

		<p>In Windows XP (and possibly later versions as well): Why does it take longer for the task manager to appear when you start it from the secure attention sequence dialog than when you start it from the taskbar?</p>
<p>(this is not to implement some stupid programmatic hack or anything like that. It&#39;s just that the delay is noticeable and I was wondering why)</p>

		<p>When and how was the registry introduced on 16 bit Windows? How much of that carried over to Windows 95? I remember many years ago seeing something reminiscent of it on a Windows 3.1 system, but I know it isn&#39;t in a vanilla 3.1 installation.</p>

		<p>(second and last question)</p>
<p>In a multiple monitor setup, how does Windows choose where to place a newly opened window? The question comes from using VLC, where videos play in a hardware accelerated window. Sometimes the next video continues on the same monitor at full screen as the previous one and sometimes it starts playing full screen on the other monitor.</p>

		<p>In Windows 95, 98 and (possibly) Me, the mouse pointer movement was noticeably jerky. In Windows NT, this was still the case with a serial (RS-232) mouse, but with a PS/2 mouse, the movement was smooth.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve always been curious about this.</p>

		<p>Windows 95 had one very quirky feature. If you gave the Start button focus and hit Alt+-, it would bring up a system menu for the Start button itself. From there, you could select Close and close your Start button and its associated menu. Why did this exist?</p>

		<p>Suggestion (not a question or comment): You should do a series on a runtime code generator &#8212; a JITter for dummies. Small assembler, various issues with marking pages as executable &amp; writable, lifetime management for runtime generated code&#8230;</p>
<p>It would be fun! In the end, we could all have our own ATL thunk generators for any functions that didn&#39;t take a context parameter. Bonus points for illustrating currying in the general case.</p>

		<p>In Windows Vista/7, when Windows are grouped together in the taskbar Windows uses an icon pulled from the application binary for the entire group.

		<p>When converting a point size to pixel height for a LOGFONT on a given device context, you typically use the LOGPIXELSY in the calculation: pt_size * LOGPIXELSY / 72. &nbsp;But what if you&#39;re trying to specify a font with a diagonal escapement and orientation? &nbsp;And what if the devcie context is for a printer with different DPI values in the horizontal and vertical directions?</p>
<p>Empirically, the results seem printer dependent, which probably means the drivers are buggy. &nbsp;How is it intended to work for text at a non-zero angle?</p>

		<p>The MSDN documentation for SetClipboardData states &quot;When responding to the WM_RENDERFORMAT and WM_RENDERALLFORMATS messages, the clipboard owner must not call OpenClipboard &nbsp;before calling SetClipboardData&quot; but the MSDN documentation for WM_RENDERALLFORMATS states &quot;When responding to a WM_RENDERALLFORMATS message, the clipboard owner must call the OpenClipboard and EmptyClipboard functions before calling SetClipboardData.&quot; &nbsp;Which is it?</p>

		<p>Starting with Windows XP&#39;s themes, the individual tab pages inside a tabbed dialog box have a light, white-ish background rather than gray. What&#39;s the recommended way to achieve this light background/transparency if you would like to roll your own system creating the Tab Control manually?</p>
<p>If you use PropertySheet(), this is done for you automatically, however, only if the tab child dialog box contains at least one STATIC control. Why is this seemingly strange requirement?</p>
<p>Why do Windows Task Manager&#39;s tab pages still have the gray background?</p>

		<p>Way back in the modality series, you showed a way to use WM_QUIT for a timed message box. &nbsp;It suffered from an assumption that the WM_QUIT message would be the first in the queue, and thus could end abruptly without letting the user save his/her work. &nbsp;(See the comments in: &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/03/04/385100.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/385100.aspx</a> )</p>
<p>Did you ever come up with a solution? &nbsp;The WM_QUIT was buried under messages from some enterprise anti-malware program that posts its own private messages onto the thread queues of all GUI processes in the system.</p>

		<p>Can you shed light on how windows activation works. In particular how it is possible that GetActiveWindow() != NULL (local thread state) and GetForegroundWindow() != NULL (global state) and GetActiveWindow() != GetForegroundWindow() at the same time (and this is not a temporary state that lasts only few seconds).</p>

		<p>I suppose this falls under the General Programming category.</p>
<p>Does your team/division go back and revise code based upon newer enhancements to the languages. &nbsp;For example, with C++0x, there are many new language enhancements. &nbsp;Would those manifest themselves in existing code, or is it the case (as you tend to imply), that once its written/tested/shipped, it is too costly to go back and rework/retest, etc. just to use newer (and safer and more readable) language constructs?</p>

		<p>I may be able to help with some of these, I love loading old Windows on virtual machines. :)</p>
<p>@Carlos: What do you think the Shell preview for Windows NT 3.51 was?</p>
<p>@Chris: You can grab a copy of the aforementioned Windows NT 3.51 and the free Shell preview download to see yourself.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_NT_3.51#Overview" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Windows_NT_3.51</a> &nbsp;A paragraph of info about it is buried in here.</p>
<p>@Niels running regedit.exe on a NT 3.51 or 3.11 system will reveal the first Registry Editor. &nbsp;IIRC it was mostly for managing file associations and classes and such, I think? &nbsp;I forget, it&#39;s been awhile.</p>
<p>@Henke37 Because the capability of drawing text on a button in any font is built in. &nbsp;Drawing images is not and requires ownerdraw which is a bit more work.</p>
<p>@Amit: Didn&#39;t we just have an article about something like this with windows on multiple monitors? &nbsp;I think it&#39;s up to the application to decide.</p>
<p>@Programmerman: Alt+- is the hotkey for opening the system menu for MDI windows. &nbsp;It sounds like a bug that the hotkey was not blocked.</p>
<p>@Chris: Good question, in 3.11 it&#39;s on the left as well. &nbsp;I assume it wasn&#39;t moved as much as turned into the application icon. &nbsp;Then the X was added since there was no longer a clear way to close the window.</p>
<p>@fda242: IIRC with my experiences wrangling visual styles out of .NET 1.1 it&#39;s drawn for you, but you have to make any controls overlayed on top of it have a transparent background so they don&#39;t paint the control color over it. &nbsp;Of course with the Visual Styles API you can always draw the background yourself as needed.</p>
<p>In Task Manager&#39;s case, I theorize someone made the tab pane have a panel child with the control background color covering the whole thing, maybe. &nbsp;Grab Spy++ and check.</p>

		<p>Since the Chicago team was designing and implementing the Windows 95 User Interface while the NT team was busy trying to ship NT 3.1 with an interface approximately equal to the Windows 3.1 UI, how did the new Win95 UI get into NT for 4.0? &nbsp;Was the code from 95 simply adopted into the NT project, did they rewrite it or major parts (say, explorer.exe) from the specification, or was there some other sort of code-grafting process?</p>

		<p>I&#39;d like to hear about the GetRandomRgn() API call, specifically how it ended up with that particular name, what the intended purpose of the third parameter was, and why it ended up being extra-random by returning screen coordinates in NT and window coordinates in 9x.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m interested in why Alt+F4 was chosen as the keyboard shortcut for closing a window. &nbsp;It&#39;s not exactly easy to reach that combination quickly. &nbsp;I assume it has something to do with the Alt+F4 being a shortcut not commonly used by applications.</p>
<p>It has always bothered me that I have to stretch my fingers to close a window. &nbsp;Mac&#39;s Cmd+Q (or W) is much easier to reach.</p>

		<p>@Josh &#8211; From what i&#39;ve read, some of the early windows UI design was based on IBM CUA standards, which can also be seen in Motif/CDE on Unix, and which (IIRC) had a whole set of Alt-Fx key bindings for window management.</p>
<p>The function keys were on a different place on the XT/AT keyboards.</p>

		<p>Hi Raymond,</p>
<p>I recently finished reading Show Stopper, and I&#39;m curious about the relationship between the Win95 team and the WinNT team. Was it strained, or was there camaraderie? Any code sharing/reuse, especially in areas one might not expect? Was Win95 started as a stopgap, or was it intended to live as long as it did? Or perhaps even longer?</p>
<p>Thanks for writing such an interesting weblog!</p>

		<p>Why is the focus management so crappy in windows?</p>
<p>When I&#39;m typing a text, the focus should never be allowed to move to another program.</p>
<p>I always hate it when I write an email (letter, code, &#8230;) and a window pops up,</p>
<p>asking some stupid questions and I accidentally press space or return before I see the box.</p>
<p>Never ever lose focus while you are typing.</p>

		<p>I&#39;d enjoy hearing stories about sloppy/ugly code or strange workarounds or code comments during the development of Windows 95 (I&#39;m assuming there are a few since it was a big jump from Windows 3.1), how they got there, anything TheDailyWTF-worthy. The type of code that works surprisingly well but makes you hate your life when you read it.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve always been curious, what is the difference between the F5 menu and the F8 menu on boot? Everyone knows you can use the F8 menu to reach Safe Mode or what not, but F5 seems to bring up the same menu. In particular, I&#39;ve noticed very sporadically that sometimes you wont see the Disable Automatic Restart option in F8, but you will in F5, so I guess I know they&#39;re not exactly the same :). Thanks for any insight!!</p>

		<p>Why in Windows 95/XP could you not drag and drop a file into a running application on the taskbar?</p>
<p>If I recall, it gave you a message saying that you couldn&#39;t do that and you had to restore the app then drag/drop the file onto it. If Windows knew what I was trying to do, why didn&#39;t it just do it? I assume there is some technical reason behind this limitation that probably has an interesting story.</p>

		<p>3 suggestions:</p>
<p>How come that normal processes can kill elevated ones via TerminateProcess, but not do a trivial ShowWindow(hwnd, SW_MINIMIZE) Only explorer seems to be able to do so somehow.</p>
<hr />
<p>Why doesn&#39;t Windows memorize all clipboard listeners on his own and makes everyone think that the process is the only one in the clipboard chain? When applications forget to forward the message to the next clipboard listener (which easily happens when not reading MSDN) applications will stop working.</p>

<p>Why is the desktop threatened so special in window ordering?</p>
<p>When selecting a folder in the desktop and then immediately closing it, the focus should go back to the desktop (like pressing Win+D), but some random window recieves it. Is that a feature?</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve always been interested in how the architecture of Windows Extended 386 Mode related to Windows 95&#39;s architecture. Windows 3.1 plus Win32s seems to be the base for Windows 95 functionality, even if it ran 32-bit tasks in a shared memory space and with collaborative task switching. Also, it seems that the VFAT filesystem from the Chicago project got backported to Windows 3.11. There seems to be close to no information about this in the Internet. What are the differences between Windows 3.1&#39;s VxD kernel and Windows 95&#39;s one (apart from the obvious)?</p>

		<p>What does SHChangeNotify really do? MSDN mentions you should call it after an SHFileOperation (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb776887%28VS.85%29.aspx#unknown_68206" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/bb776887%28VS.85%29.aspx</a>), yet (1) a code sample right there on MSDN doesn&#39;t (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualc/cc879182.aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/cc879182.aspx</a>), (2) as far as I can tell explorer windows are updated properly after SHFileOperation calls *without* an SHChangeNotify call, (3) I just don&#39;t understand this API design: if there are any shell-internal updates to be made, SHFileOperation is fully capable of doing them itself, without requiring extra user code. Are there scenarios where a user might prefer to skip such a notification? </p>

		<p>Why no more capability to do an &quot;Explore from here&quot;, like in the Windows 95 Powertoys. I&#39;ve been using it for about 15 years now (95 through XP), and really miss it in Windows 7 Explorer capabilities. With Win 7 there&#39;s a ton of folders and such in the left pane you can&#39;t supress, and it hops all over the place when I navigate around.</p>

		<p>@Antonio Rodriguez, Andrew Schulman did a book called &quot;Unautorized Windows 95, which covered your questions and much more. I&#39;m sure that Raymond would have much more authorative andswers and such, but there is a whole book out there with sample programs and such if you still had your Windows 95 CD handy you could expirement with first hand. It was a good read back in the day.</p>

		<p>It would be interesting to know the logic that the Windows shell uses to determine what icon to show for a shortcut (lnk). &nbsp;Especially with the recent announcement of security advisory 2286198, it seems there&#39;s something more going on there than meets the eye (unless the shell does something silly like not using LOAD_LIBRARY_AS_DATAFILE when grabbing the icon, thus allowing DllMain to run, but I hope the shell team is smarter than that ;)</p>

		<p>The WS_EX_COMPOSITED window exstyle is interested. &nbsp;It solves a flicker problem for the kind of Windows Forms programmers that drop hundreds of controls on their form. &nbsp;I&#39;ve been recommending it in forums for a while, but it doesn&#39;t appear to be completely trouble free. &nbsp;No solid diagnosis though. &nbsp;I&#39;m &nbsp;curious how it works when only a single control repaints itself.</p>

		<p>Suggestion: RasEnumConnections would make an interesting case-study of how API designers (and documenters) need to be careful of subtle issues resulting from structure-sizeof variations between OS and/or SDK versions.</p>
<p>(If you ask it for the required buffer size in the naive way, which is what the documentation suggests, your code will not work with Windows versions older than the SDK you compile with.)</p>
<p>See my &quot;A fix to work with older versions of Windows&quot; comments in the community content for the API:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa377284%28VS.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/aa377284%28VS.85%29.aspx</a></p>
<p>(There&#39;s also the usual race condition w/ functions which you call once to get the buffer size and then again to get the data, but that&#39;s less interesting.)</p>

		<p>@Leo Davidson: If you look at RasEnumConnections in a older SDK like Platform SDK 2003 you will see that passing NULL is not documented as a valid parameter (And the sample code uses a loop starting with a buffer of sizeof RASCONN bytes)</p>
<p>This sizeof(STRUCT) problem is very common in the win32 api (GetVersionEx,Shell_NotifyIcon,GetOpenFileName etc) and if you want to support down-level systems, you need to use constants like OPENFILENAME_SIZE_VERSION_400 (Now that we have had the NTDDI_VERSION system for a while we can only hope that all future structs take a version value like NTDDI_WIN7 and not a byte size so re-compiling with a new SDK will never break existing apps)</p>

<p>Back in the days when a new common controls DLL was released with IE, IE and/or Explorer took advantage of new features in each new DLL right away, but that didn&#39;t happen with HDS_FILTERBAR. Why?</p>

<p>You said that even though the functionality behind EM_GET/SETHILITE was removed before Vista shipped, the messages couldn&#39;t be removed from the header file. Why?</p>
<p>APIs were changed between betas and RTM of Vista, such as transactional NTFS and registry, which caused changes in the header files and broke previously-compiling code. Why was it impossible to remove two constants that were even older than the transactional APIs?</p>

<p>Do you have any insights into the Microspeak term &quot;parking lot&quot;? &nbsp;I saw it on a Powerpoint slide at an MVP Summit a few years ago. &nbsp;It was in a sentence fragment so I couldn&#39;t tell what part of speech it was, but it seemed to mean &quot;ask me long or off-topic questions after the meeting is over.&quot;</p>

		<p>@WndSks: I don&#39;t think you&#39;ve grasped what makes RasEnumConnections interesting compared to most other APIs which take structure sizes.</p>
<p>Most APIs are fine because they just fill in as much of the structure as they can (i.e. up to the minimum of the size they know about and the size the application specified) and zero out the rest.</p>
<p>RasEnumConnections is interesting because it makes assumptions &#8212; which seem fine until you really think about them &#8212; about the OS and caller structure sizes, and mixes the two of them up. If the caller&#39;s size is larger than the OS&#39;s, the OS will tell the caller to allocate a buffer which is too small.</p>
<p>MSDN makes no mention of the NULL argument only working in certain versions of Windows, even if it was undocumented before, so I would expect that to work in any version. Even if it doesn&#39;t, a future version of Windows may extend the structure further and cause the same problem. Even if that never happens, I still think it&#39;s an interesting thing to talk about to encourage people to think:</p>
<p>&quot;How will this work in the future when these structure sizes change? Am I mixing my sizes with the callers?&quot;</p>

		<p>Re Li Xiong&#39;s suggestion, &quot;How about the hisotry of the Windows Error Reporting/Debugging support.&quot;</p>
<p>If that&#39;s discussed, it&#39;d be interesting to hear the rationale behind making the user wait for Windows to &quot;check for solutions&quot; before being offered the chance to restart the crashed app.</p>
<p>(i.e. Why isn&#39;t the app restarted immediately while the check is done on the background? Is it in case the check can fix the problem and prevent the re-run from crashing immediately? In my experience the check never finds anything and just delays restarting the app. I&#39;d like the check to be done in case it does find something, but I&#39;d also like to get on with things ASAP.)</p>

		<p>Dear Raymond;</p>
<p>What was the design team smoking when they decided to make the Win7 Taskbar behave more like the OSX Dock? More seriously, which design elements/usability guidelines were they trying to add in/adhere to?</p>
<p>I ask because I am an old-school PC power user/administrator, and I HATE HATE HATE the OSX Dock &#8211; making any part of Windows like the Max OS is suboptimal in my book. It is AFAICT pretty much undiscoverable how to revert the Taskbar to XP/Vista function (separate QuickLaunch/active apps sections) while maintaining Win7 form (Aero Peek etc), and given that Windows is all about backward compatibility, this is somewhat disturbing.</p>
<p>Note: I do know how to revert it, I just want to know what they were smoking when they came up with it. Or, if you came up with it, what *you* were smoking, I guess&#8230; ;)</p>

		<p>RE: wina20.386</p>
<p>Just to update my previous suggestion: I would be very interested in how Windows 3.0 found and loaded this file. It seems to me there must have been some magic happening, e.g. DOS somehow forcing the driver to be loaded by Windows. Because Windows by itself did not know it needs to load some additional driver, or did it?</p>

		<p>Why was the Start Button and the Task Bar placed at the bottom of the screen by default? From a usability point of view, reading bottom up seems less user friendly than reading top down (and I&#39;ve always moved the task bar to the top of the screen as it feels more intuitive up there). I&#39;ve always wondered if this was a &#39;do it different to the Mac&#39; decision to avoid any possible lawsuits (which had happened a few times in the 80s).</p>

		<p>How would one host *two* Active X controls in the scratch app. On the one hand it is simple, but time consuming to implement all the objects and their various interfaces. On the other hand, none of the documentation explains how to choose which control to send IOleInPlaceActiveObject::TranslateAccelerator to, or IOleInPlaceObjectWindowless::OnWindowMessage to. (Or indeed, how to track or set &quot;focus&quot; if there is at least one windowless control).</p>

		<p>I have my usual genuine shell/Explorer/taskbar related questions whose answers I never found:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Shell: Why are taskbar live previews are not retained in Windows 7 when using Fast User Switching.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Shell: Why is the sort bar restricted back again to Details view in Windows 7 when it was improved upon by adding it to every view in Vista?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Shell: Why did the taskbar infotips lose their icons from Vista to Windows 7?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Shell: Why can&#39;t I run the 32-bit shell in Windows 7 any more?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Shell: Why are &quot;Arrange by&quot; and &quot;Sort by&quot; only there in Libraries in Windows 7 but not all folders?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Shell: Why does Windows 7 Explorer force each toolbar on its own row when IE8 doesn&#39;t?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Shell: Milestone 2 of Windows 7 showed the number of combined taskbar windows in a circular little overlay icon. Why did this not make into RTM?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Shell: Why does selecting multiple taskbar items using Ctrl and choosing group close or group minimize not available in Windows 7?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Shell: Why does the Game Explorer limit customizing command line, target etc in Windows 7?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Shell: Why are all three power profiles not shown from the taskbar power icon in Windows 7?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Shell: Why is the sorting order in Vista/7 not constant? Sorting by Name or Type is Ascending but sorting by Date or Size is Descending?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Shell: Why is autorefresh forced in Vista/7 Explorer?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Shell: Why doesn&#39;t the Preview pane save this state per folder like XP&#39;s Filestrip view?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Shell: Why does the View Available Networks (VAN) UI give quick access to dial up, VPN and wireless connections but not ethernet connections?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&nbsp;Shell: Why was the remaining functionality of File Types dialog (such as defining a new file extension and associated file type without doing it programmatically, defining/editing custom secondary verbs by the user who knows nothing about programming, showing extensions only for specific file types, customizing the file icon and IE related settings like &quot;Confirm open after download) removed in Vista?</p>

		<p>@Feroze:</p>
<p>File extensions are like labels: they do help in identifying the things they are sticked on, but they aren&#39;t a requisite (e.g., a can of beans is still a can of beans without a label). The labels are useful to the shell (Explorer) to know what action it should perform when an user double-clicks on an file, but they are only informational.</p>
<p>From a Win32 point of view, AFAIK a file extensions mean nothing, you can pass a file with any extension to CreateProcess() and it would work fine (supposing the file is actually an executable). Borland products like Delphi use &quot;custom&quot; libraries with the extension .BPL that are if fact regular DLL&#39;s with the extension changed.</p>
<p>This is applicable also to data files: you can rename a Word document using another extension (for example &quot;document.test&quot;), and open it from Word using the &quot;all files&quot; filter. Even more, you can rename it to &quot;document.xls&quot; and it would work fine as long as you open it directly from Word.</p>
<p>On the other hand opening a &quot;mislabeled&quot; file from Explorer won&#39;t work since Explorer relies in the extension to know what program use to open it.</p>

		<p>Answers about a remarkable number of these suggestions can be found with a simple web search (like Windows 3.2). Still, Raymond&#39;s perspectives and background stories would be entertaining, even for these.</p>

		<p>I&#39;d like to ask a rather open-ended (and hard) question:</p>
<p>Given your experience keeping Windows compatible with past versions, what realistic* changes would you make to versions of Windows from 1.0 through to 3.11 if you were able to go back in time and change them?</p>
<p>* realistic in this context is something that fits within the constraints these versions of Windows had to fit in &#8211; so a change to Windows 1.0 must be something that would work on an 8086 with 256k running from floppies, while a change to Windows 3.11 can assume a 286 with 640k conventional RAM and 256k XMS, with a small hard disk fitted.</p>

		<p>Now I have 2 displays connected to my computer. With software bundled with display driver, I&#39;m able to configure them as extended desktop with top-down design (with the main display at the bottom).</p>
<p>Now I wish to ask, whether there&#39;s any supported way of making them behave as single large display? (e.g.: click &quot;maximize&quot; button will make that window cover both displays, etc.)</p>

		<p>When you close a window its location gets saved.</p>
<p>When having 2 monitors and you close windows on the second monitor then its location is saved and it opens on the second monitor at that location by default.</p>
<p>When having a laptop and you work undocked you only have one screen, but the windows that were opened on the second monitor don&#39;t show anymore because they open on the second (unattached screen).</p>
<p>Why aren&#39;t these windows automatically moved to the first screen when windows only detects one screen?</p>

		<p>2 Mark: isn&#39;t it obvious? Cause it&#39;s application responsibility, not Windows. Windows can&#39;t move your windows on your own, saying &quot;oh, you&#39;re placing it on missing monitor, let me move it for you&quot;. What if placing window off-screen was your intention? Recall that minimized windows are real windows, that are placed in the corner of desktop area, long way away from monitor&#39;a area. Do you want them to drag into visible area too?</p>

		<p>I have a taskbar-related question. For years, (I think since IE4 on Windows 95), the taskbar has allow minimizing the app if it is active and clicked again. This greatly increases usability as you don&#39;t have to position your mouse accurately on the minimize button and also the minimize button is at the top whereas to switch apps taskbar is at the bottom. But in Windows 7 when I set buttons to combine, clicking a grouped applicationâs taskbar button or thumbnail when it is active (in the foreground) or inactive (in the background) always switches to that app. Only ungrouped application buttons minimize upon being clicked again. Why was this change made? It is why I don&#39;t use button combining. Clicking on a grouped thumbnail should minimize it when the same thumbnailâs window is already active, that is, in the foreground. If the app was in the background and its thumbnail was clicked, only then it should switch to that app. This was the behavior on Windows XP when grouping was on.</p>

		<p>In XP (and Vista/7), how mouse pointer acceleration works was changed (the Control Panel &#39;Enhanced pointer precision&#39; checkbox).</p>
<p>One of the drivers for the change was to better handle high DPI monitors, by scaling pointer movement by a factor that included monitor DPI.</p>
<p>But by mistake, the scaling was &#39;anti-scaling&#39; and included a factor of (MonitorRefreshRate/MonitorDPI) which causes pointer movement to be REDUCED for high DPI monitors, rather than INCREASED as one would expect.</p>
<p>(I&#39;ve written about this on my blog: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://donewmouseaccel.blogspot.com/2009/06/out-of-sync-and-upside-down-windows.html" rel="nofollow">donewmouseaccel.blogspot.com/&#8230;/out-of-sync-and-upside-down-windows.html</a> and also about problems with how the acceleration calculation fractional remainders are handled: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://donewmouseaccel.blogspot.com/2010/02/windows-mouse-pointer-acceleration_28.html" rel="nofollow">donewmouseaccel.blogspot.com/&#8230;/windows-mouse-pointer-acceleration_28.html</a>)</p>
<p>These problems are fixed in Windows 7, and I&#39;d love to know any inside stories and why it took so long to fix.Mark Crannr</p>

		<p>@Cheong: &nbsp;To stretch one application window across two displays, you need to have it not-maximized (maximize will maximize it to one window), and then resize it across both windows the same way you resize any non-maximized window. &nbsp;Works great. &nbsp;There&#39;s no convenient single-click way to do this, though.</p>

		<p>At one time in Windows or NT, I think about 10-15 years back, &nbsp;accessing a file would change the file accessed date/time of the file. &nbsp;That is good. &nbsp;However, changing the accessed date/time of the file counted as modifying the file, so it also changed the file modified date/time of the file. That is kind of bad. &nbsp;The file accessed time and the file modified time were thus always identical, except for maybe some obiwon clock anomalies. &nbsp;That was obviously wasting a good field on nothing. &nbsp;I believe that somehow I asked someone at MS about this and was told that it was in conformance with posix. &nbsp;As posix documents are priced out of my range, I was never able to verify. &nbsp;Can you give any history of this, before or since?? Thanks.</p>

		<p>Back to Windows 95, there were a lot of undocumented stuff / assembly quirks which allowed to receive pointers to system internal structures, like IMTEs/MODREFs with kernel32 functions or IsWindow returning direct pointer to WND structure (!).</p>
<p>Since Win95 (98,Me) they weren&#39;t actually obfuscated. So the question is &#8211; did those quirks ever made a problem? Have any Win95 era Microsoft software abused them? Does Windows team now use some special measures for obfuscating/protecting important internal variables?</p>

		<p>Why does NTVDM create empty io.sys and msdos.sys files every time a DOS app is launched? Is it a bug? How can I disable this? It didn&#39;t do it in NT 3.x; it was introduced in NT4. Sorry for my poor English.</p>

		<p>You made a couple of blogs about WaitForInputIdle. I have had a nagging question about that function for years now and have never seen a good answer: What exactly causes WaitForInputIdle to return WAIT_FAILED?</p>
<p>I encounter this seemingly at random sometimes with the same (GUI) application being launched, more so it seems with applications that are WinForms or WPF apps. If I could duplicate the problem I would, but it&#39;s simply too arbitrary.</p>

		<p>Is it legal to use NULL for the icon parameters of IExtractIcon::Extract? The documentation hints that it is &#8211; &quot;This parameter may be NULL&quot;. But I&#39;ve seen at least 2 cases when it doesn&#39;t work:</p>
<p>1) When getting icons from the C:WindowsAssembly folder, Extract just crashes in shfusion.dll</p>
<p>2) When getting icons from the Games folder (FOLDERID_Games), Extract returns E_INVALIDARG</p>
<p>And actually, is there any performance benefit of getting just the small or just the large icon, or is it almost as quick to always get both?</p>

		<p>@Leo Davidson (I&#39;ll quote myself for a change) &quot;The callers size should never be larger than the OS size&quot; while it is true that some functions validate arguments with &gt;= ossize, there are lots of examples where it (mistakenly IMHO) uses == (This was probably a bigger problem back in the 9x/NT4 vs NT5 days)</p>
<p>&quot;you need to code to your minimum supported OS version&#8230;&quot; This part is always true, even if all checks used &gt;= you would still need to know which OS you are running on since you can&#39;t access somestruct.MemberAddedInVista on XP etc.</p>

		<p>@WndSks:</p>
<p>&quot;@Leo Davidson: The callers size should never be larger than the OS size, you need to code to your minimum supported OS version and dynamically adapt at runtime if you need newer features&quot;</p>
<p>That *isn&#39;t* true in general. If it was true for all (or even most) structure arguments with size members then our programs would break all over the place on older OS whenever we upgraded to newer SDKs, which doesn&#39;t happen (in general).</p>
<p>The API I brought up is interesting because it is one of the few cases where that *does* (or at least can) happen.</p>

		<p>Since history and Windows UI are your favorites, it&#39;d be interesting to hear more about Windows and skinning. Possible topics include:</p>
<p> * Possibilities for making custom skins for Vista/7 (possibly with Areo capabilities);</p>
<p> * The reasons for prohibiting 3rd party skins on Windows XP (with the signature check in uxtheme.dll and not providing any APIs/tools) yet not creating more skins of their own;</p>
<p> * Your personal view on people reverse-engineering the whole thing, patching uxtheme.dll, creating tools, and making a huge amount of custom skins for Windows XP;</p>
<p> * Your personal view on the possibility for 3rd parties to create skins for Windows.</p>

		<p>Suggestion 1: What about how Explorer handles documents being renamed? I have noticed that (at least in Windows 7) Explorer keeps track of renamed / moved recent documents, so opening a shortcut to a renamed file actually updates the shortcut&#39;s destination and opens the renamed file. How is this done? Is it an NTFS feature?</p>
<p>Suggestion 2: It would be nice to know about the history of multi-monitor configuration support in Windows, for example, since when it is supported, were there any limits (monitors of the same resolution maybe?) and so on.</p>

		<p>Could you provide some history on Window Media Center Edition (MCE)? Why did MCE get rolled out as a unique platform? Could it not have been sold as an application or service pack instead of a dedicated OS?</p>
<p>Second, has there ever been a more painful user interface than the Set Top Box configuration wizard in MCE? The wizard demands the user have the infrared receiver extender AND infrared blaster AND the Media Center remote before MCE will display video from the S-Video or Composite Video inputs. Many MCE users have expressed great frustration about this design (you can google it). What makes the Wizard design completely baffling is that after forcing the user to provide these components the Wizard does a lame job of actually ensuring the remote control function actually works. Would it not have made a better user experience to separate the selection of the video input from the configuration of the remote control?</p>

		<p>The edit delay in Windows Explorer. Is it 500ms? Why 500ms and not 1 second, or 20ms? Is it a property that comes from the ListView common control? Is it a customizable preference in Windows? Through my testing it does not appear linked to configurable double-click timeout.</p>

		<ul>
<li>
<p>Why does the IsDialogMessage function have to be called inside the message loop? It seems to me that all its activity could take place inside the window procedure of the modeless dialog itself when it has focus, just as if it were a modal dialog; and when it doesn&#39;t have focus, it should&#39;t be called for the dialog anyway. Is it my limited understanding, or does it have some historical reason? (There has been a post about TranslateAccelerator earlier where it was nicely explained why that one has to reside in the message loop, but in my understanding those reasons don&#39;t apply to IsDialogMessage).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I understand that the AltGr key is only a shortcut for Ctrl+Alt. However, many programs which are unaware of the fact that using a non-English keyboard layout, many characters can only be typed using AltGr, and therefore they define several keyboard shortcuts with Ctrl+Alt modifiers, making it impossible to type several characters. My opinion is that it would be good idea to implement keyboard handling in a way that when such a key combination is pressed, it should never be interpreted as a shortcut, but only as the character being typed. Is this even possible in a global manner? If it is, I think it would be a better solution (I&#39;m trying the cancel the &#39;Because the alternative is worse&#39; argument here) because functionality available through shortcut keys is almost always available through other means (like as a menu item), but being unable to type specific characters in legacy applications one has to use without any chance of getting them fixed is extremely annoying.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
