		<p>Ray, I think you are in love with Renton and are just afraid to come out and say it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s ok to admit it, they have a Fry&#8217;s and the High school facade was used in War Games so there is a little bit of geekness we all can understand.</p>

		<p>While no one was looking, Renton has gone upscale. There&#8217;s The Landing, with its anchor chain movie theater, and the city has been accreting to itself great swathes of bourgoisie via the tactic of annexation. (We&#8217;re next.) They&#8217;ve kicked Burien&#8217;s butt in attracting businesses to south of Lake Washington. Then again, it&#8217;s no Mercer Island.</p>

		<p>I can see their point. The food isn&#8217;t all that good .. so why pretend you are going there for the food?</p>
<p>And if the girls are hired to show hooters, why wear a modest t-shirt and short shorts? bikini tops would be less pretentious.</p>
<p>Looks like Renton is a good spot to open up a strip club with good food open during regular business hours.</p>

		<p>You misquoted the title of the article &#8211; it is actually &#8220;Hooters too upscale for us&#8221; &#8230; &nbsp;and in turn, what the Rentonites actually are saying is really &#8220;Hooters too expensive for us&#8221; &#8230;</p>
<p>Now, a Hooters with $2 drinks .. that would be nice to have in Renton (or anywhere).</p>
<p>It does support your contention that Renton is a working class town, though.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Actually what happened is that the Seattle Times silently revised the title of the article. <a href="http://cc.bingj.com/cache.aspx?d=76696423107629&amp;w=9108c854,c3ff7fbf" rel="nofollow">You can find the original title (temporarily) in Bing&#8217;s web cache</a> and on <a href="http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/reader_feedback/public/display.php?source_name=mbase&amp;source_id=2009843262" rel="nofollow">the article&#8217;s comment page</a>. -Raymond</i>]</div>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
