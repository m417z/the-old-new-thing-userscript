A customer wanted to make a change to a system setting.
We advised them to use the <code>System&shy;Parameters&shy;Info</code>
function, adding
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
The
<code>System&shy;Parameters&shy;Info</code>
function
lets you specify whether you want the change to be permanent
or this-session-only.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The customer wrote back,
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
Were trying to figure out whether there is a way
for the settings to only apply for the current user session
(e.g. automatically restore itself on the next reboot).
Your engineers alluded earlier that this is possible,
though looking at the MSDN docs on SetParametersInfo,
it seems that both options persist the setting permanently:
</p>
<dl>
<dt><b>SPIF_<wbr>UPDATE&shy;INI&shy;FILE</b></dt>
<dd>Writes the new system-wide parameter setting
    to the user profile.</dd>
<dt><b>SPIF_<wbr>SEND&shy;CHANGE</b></dt>
<dd>Broadcasts the <b>WM_<wbr>SETTING&shy;CHANGE</b> message
    after updating the user profile.</dd>
</dl>
<p>
What are we missing?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
These two flags control different things.
The <code>SPIF_<wbr>SEND&shy;CHANGE</code> message controls
whether the
<code>WM_<wbr>SETTING&shy;CHANGE</code> message
is sent to all top-level windows to inform them of the change.
It has nothing to do with whether the change is temporary or permanent.
</p>
<p>
The first flag is the relevant one here.
If you pass the
<code>SPIF_<wbr>UPDATE&shy;INI&shy;FILE</code>
flag,
then the changes are written to the user profile,
so that they also take effect the next time the user logs on.
</p>
<p>
Since this customer doesn't want the changes to persist
beyond the current session,
what they want to do is omit the
<code>SPIF_<wbr>UPDATE&shy;INI&shy;FILE</code>
flag.
Maybe it never occurred to them that they can omit flags.
</p>
<p>
The customer clarified:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
We were wondering if someone could give me more insight into
how to accomplish this. 
We were looking
into
the
System&shy;Parameters&shy;Info MSDN page,
specifically at the "UINT fWinIni" parameter.
We are not sure what is meant by the update the user profile.
Does this mean these settings persist longer than the current user session?
</blockQUOTE></p>
<p>
Let me see if I can explain this in simpler terms.
</p>
<p>
If you pass the
<code>SPIF_<wbr>UPDATE&shy;INI&shy;FILE</code>
flag,
then the change is written to the user profile.
This means that the setting takes effect not only
right away but also the next time the user logs on.
If you do not pass the
<code>SPIF_<wbr>UPDATE&shy;INI&shy;FILE</code>
flag,
then the setting takes effect right away,
but it does not affect what happens the next time
the user logs on.</p>

		<p>Consider yourself lucky. This customer at least is trying to READ the documentation. We have a customer that has at least 3(!) developers who don&#8217;t bother doing even that. For any question that they have, they just straight away ask our customer support.  Never mind that the answer is clearly stated in the documentation and easy to find.</p>

		<p>If people frequently use a specific keyword not included in the documentation, then the documentation should be updated to add the keyword, to help searchability.</p>
<p>I have this complaint about manpages (something about curl, -O automatic file name, or find) as well.</p>

		<p>Ah yes. The junior developer who has plenty of exposure to enumerated sets, but little experience of bitwise flags (or bitwise anything), and expects there to be a named constant for all possible values, including &#8216;0&#8217;. (e.g. SPIF_SESSIONONLY).</p>
<p>Warning &#8211; these developers sometimes add the flags instead of or-ing them. This seems to work fine&#8230; until the day that they pass a flag twice and things get very confusing.</p>

		<p>Rarely, adding the flag is right. MSIDBOPEN_READONLY | MSIDBOPEN_PATCHFILE won&#8217;t even compile; you have to use MSIDBOPEN_READONLY + MSIDBOPEN_PATCHFILE.</p>

		<p>Maybe the source confusion is that they want to broadcast the WM_SETTINGCHANGE message, but don&#8217;t want to permanently update the user&#8217;s profile. &#8220;Broadcasts the WM_SETTING­CHANGE message after updating the user profile&#8221; indicates that it does both.</p>

		<p>To be fair, you have to have some experience reading Microsoft documentation to know that &#8220;after updating the user profile&#8221; doesn&#8217;t actually mean you HAVE to update the user profile.</p>

		<p>Adding an alias for the flag might be a good idea in this case.</p>
<p>Create a new semantic flag with the same value as the existing flag.<br />
#define the existing flag to the new semantic flag&#8217;s name.<br />
Reference the old flag&#8217;s name from the documentation with &#8220;SPIF_UPDATEINIFILE is a legacy flag.&#8221;</p>
<p>What I&#8217;m about to say is going to make some people feel very old&#8230;</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s been a very long time since WriteProfileString was the primary mechanism for saving data.  It&#8217;s even been a long time since WritePrivateProfileString was.  It&#8217;s been over 20 years for WritePrivateProfileString.  For the past decade, the move has been to JSON or XML, and for the decade before that the move was to the Windows registry.</p>
<p>Just saying, there is an entire generation of developers who have never had to deal with win.ini or WritePrivateProfileString.  The flag was communicative when it was named, but for that entire generation &#8212; it is just random letters chained together.</p>

		<p>In fairness, I have been working with Win32 docs for over 20 years and I can say that even today it still takes a few extra mental cycles to remember that I can pass zero into a flags field after reviewing all available flags and deciding I don&#8217;t want any of them.  For me, at least, it isn&#8217;t intuitive to pass zero into an enumerated field like that, even though I am perfectly aware that I can.</p>

		<p>Sounds like they saw the list of options, and thought it was an enum, rather than a bitset&#8230;</p>
<p>I note that the documentation now says:<br />
&#8220;This parameter can be zero if you do not want to update the user profile or broadcast the WM_SETTINGCHANGE message, or it can be one or more of the following values.&#8221;</p>
<p>I wonder if that sentence was there when this story happened, or if it had been added since&#8230;</p>

		<p>I was thinking along the same lines. Although this function allows for no flags to be set, there are other functions that require exactly one setting, or at least one setting. The documentation does not always make this distinction clear, unfortunately. Having a flag called SPIF_NOUPDATEINIFILE would make this clearer. Changing INIFILE to USERPROFILE would be nice too, but that&#8217;s a nitpicky issue.</p>
<p>For this function, if I was reading the documentation for the first time I could easily think that SPIF_SENDCHANGE is dependent on SPIF_UPDATEINIFILE being set (wouldn&#8217;t an update to the user profile be a write by necessity?) The conflation of temporary user profile settings (&#8220;session user profile&#8221; perhaps?) with the on-disk user profile makes this one interesting.</p>

		<p>To be fair, the docs are not worded well. Both flags talk about &#8220;propagating changes into user profile&#8221;, which even to me sounds like &#8220;both flags save the changes, but in a different way</p>

Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
