><code>PeekMessage</code></a> functions
allow you to pass a filter,
restricting the window handle or range of messages
that the function will retrieve from the message queue.
While it's okay to use these filters,
make sure you eventually get around to making an unfiltered call
so that any straggling messages can come through.
</p>
<p>
A common mistake is to use a window-filtered GetMessage in your message loop.
In
<a HREF="/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
our scratch program</a>,
a window-filtered <code>GetMessage</code> would look like this:
</p>
<pre>
        while (<i>GetMessage(&amp;msg, <font COLOR=blue>hwnd</font>, 0, 0)</i>) { // Wrong!
            TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
            DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);
        }
</pre>
<p>
Even though the program creates but one window,
this program is nevertheless incorrect.
</p>
<p>
"How can this be?" you ask.  "My program has only one window.
Why would there possibly be any messages for any other windows?
The filter, while redundant, isn't harmful, is it?"
</p>
<p>
Many system services create windows on your behalf.
For example, if input method editing is enabled,
the method editor may create helper windows to assist in character input.
If you initialize COM,
then COM may decide to create a helper window
to assist in inter-thread marshalling.
If you use only a filtered GetMessage,
then messages destined for these helper windows will never be retrieved,
and you will be left scratching your head wondering why your program
occasionally hangs when it tries to perform a drag/drop operation,
for example.
</p>
<p>
Moral of the story:
Make sure your message loop eventually performs an unfiltered
message retrieval so that these services can operate properly.</p>

		<p>Useful reminder! I&#8217;ve just been through my code to check I never over-filter&#8230;</p>
<p>On a tangentially related subject, is there any rational way to call a PeekMessage function in Windows? The function PeekMessage is actually PeekMessageAndSilentlyPerformAnyIncomingSendMessagesThatAreLyingAround, which can be disastrous if all you really want to do is peek. I&#8217;ve got seriously caught out by this in the past, and I can&#8217;t be the only one.</p>

		<p>Not quite on topic, but close-enough&#8230;</p>
<p>Having played with QueueUserAPC and WSASend() and WSARecv() with completion functions recently, it seems a bit overly verbose to have to use MsgWaitForMultipleObjects() and a host of flags to implement an alertable GetMessage() loop, to have my completion routines run on my main gui thread.  Just wondering why things are this way, or if, perhaps, I&#8217;m doing something wrong.</p>

		<p>Filtering also causes some weird results if you have a dropdown combobox on your window. When the drop list is opened, everything seems to stall since the list gets no messages.</p>

		<p>Wez Furlong: 1. Compatibility &#8211; programs would have code running at times they weren&#8217;t expecting. 2. Compatibility &#8211; what should GetMessage return when it was woken alertably? You can&#8217;t return FALSE &#8211; that will cause the loop to exit. You can&#8217;t return TRUE &#8211; that will cause the app to try to dispatch a nonexistent message.</p>

		<p>Also, GetMessage returns more than just TRUE and FALSE, so using it like that in the condition of a while loop seems to be showing the kind of disregard for API specification that Raymond is usually so careful to publicly abhor.</p>

		<p>Tom, I didn&#8217;t explain myself very well &#8211; I *wanted* PM_REMOVE &#8211; the point was that I did want to remove selected messages but specifically not have all the incoming SendMessages processed.</p>

		<p>Slightly offtopic but one thing I&#8217;d be interested for you to blog on is how some apps apparently get away with missing out a call to BeginPaint/EndPaint in their WM_PAINT handling code.</p>
<p>Some open source win32 apps do this and yet don&#8217;t hang, but if I just do:</p>
<p>case WM_PAINT: return 0;</p>
<p>then Windows 98 loops forever inside CreateWindow. </p>
<p>Are there some appcompat hacks in this area? It feels like some magic API calls do a BeginPaint for you if you forget, or do *something* so that Windows is happy.</p>

		<p>Mike: One more thing that just occurred to me: in addition to a PM_QS_* flag you also need the PM_NOYIELD flag &#8212; evidently the act of &quot;yielding&quot; involves processing sent messages.</p>

		<p>Raymond: it&#8217;s my understanding that GetMessage() does other things internally while waiting for messages; it seems like it could also handle kicking off APCs without returning to the caller.  So I guess the main reason is your #1; compatibility with code that doesn&#8217;t expect things to happen that way.  Thanks :)</p>

		<p>while (GetMessage(&amp;msg, hwnd, 0, 0)) &#8211; is also wrong for other reason &#8211; your applicaion will never exit. WM_QUIT is posted to main thread with NULL for windows handle ( PostQuitMessage ). In this case GetMessage never retrieves WM_QUIT and application hangs. I have learned it in hard way teaching class of people Windows programming. My test application never exited and in Windows 3.1 blocked whole OS. I honestly said that I do not know the problem and found it only for next meeting.<br />
<br />I always knew that teaching brings a lot of new knowledge and this is good example.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
