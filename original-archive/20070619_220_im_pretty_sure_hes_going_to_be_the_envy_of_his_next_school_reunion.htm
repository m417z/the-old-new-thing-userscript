<p>Masi Oka has <a href="http://www.wired.com/culture/lifestyle/news/2006/10/71984"> pretty much everything</a> the dorky nerd geek has ever dreamed of.</p>
<p> Right out of college, he lands a job at Industrial Light and Magic doing digital effects, developing complex algorithms for water and other fluid effects seen in movies like <i>The Perfect Storm</i>. That'd already be enough to make him the hit of his next school reunion. </p>
<p> And then he scores a major role in the television series <i>Heroes</i> as a, well, dorky nerd geek. But one with a super power. Now at his next school reunion, he's going to be mobbed by people who wouldn't even give him the time of day when he was in school. </p>
<p> But wait, there's more. Now it is rumored that Riyo Mori, the newly-crowned Miss Universe, is being considered for a role on <i>Heroes</i> as "<a href="http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1631932,00.html">the love interest of one of the show's superhero characters</a>." Given that her character has a Japanese name, it's not unreasonable to suppose that the superhero in question may be Oka's character Hiro. If so, and she gets the role, then he'll not just be an accomplished digital effects artist, not just a prime-time actor, but an actor whose on-screen girlfriend was crowned the most beautiful woman in the world! At his next reunion, Oka's going to be mobbed by people who didn't even attend his school. </p>

		<p>Surely if he was a real Hero he&#8217;d have to go incognito and therefore no one would recognise him at his school reunion anyway?</p>

		<p>Subtle how &quot;to mob&quot; and &quot;mobbar&quot;/&quot;mobben&quot;/&quot;mobbing&quot; have slightly different meanings (and different connotations) in English, Swedish, and German. Makes the text so much more cruel.</p>

		<p>Masi Oka clearly isn&#8217;t the actor I thought it has.</p>
<p>IQ of 180, cover of the Times, programmer of special effects, actor on Scrubs and Heroes, &#8230; This one can be called a hero.</p>

<p>Londo: But this&#8230;this, this, *this* is like being *nibbled* to death by&#8230; What are those Earth creatures called? Feathers, long bill, webbed feet&#8230; go quack&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
