While having lunch with my colleagues a few days ago,
they complained that they get annoying email for all their
calendar events.
</p>
<p>
I mentioned,
"So turn off the email notifications."
</p>
<p>
"You can do that?" they replied, incredulous.
</p>
<p>
Here's how you do it.
</p>
<p>
First, go to
<a HREF="http://calendar.live.com/">calendar.live.com</a>
and sign in to your calendar.
</p>
<p>
In the upper right corner of the screen, click on the gear icon.

<p>
My colleagues also noted
"It used to mean something when somebody remembered your birthday.
But now, everybody gets a notification on your birthday,
and you get birthday wishes from random people you haven't talked
to in years."
Which led to the next complaint,
"I just want to turn off the birthday calendar."
</p>
<p>
No problem.
Go back and click on the gear icon,
and instead of selecting Options,
look under <i>Filter Calendars</i> and
untick the check box next to <i>Birthday calendar</i>.
</p>
<p>
If you have a Windows Phone,
you can remove it from your phone calendar by
opening the Calendar app,
opening the appbar,
selecting <i>settings</i>,
and then unticking the check box next to
<i>Birthday calendar</i>.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s amazing that programmers (I&#39;m assuming that, since they were colleagues of Raymond&#39;s) didn&#39;t ask a search engine if they could turn off e-mail notifications. &nbsp;Yet I have seen that often. &nbsp;There are smart people who don&#39;t think about searching the Web for solutions to common complaints they have! </p>

		<p>I&#39;ve been using Windows Phone since 7.5, the emails were enabled by default then (and I assume probably always), I didn&#39;t think it was that big of a deal to click the link at the bottom of every email they send out to disable them if you wanted to&#8230; You can also setup an Outlook &quot;Sweeper&quot; in the web client to clean them up after a week which is pretty slick.</p>

		<p>@algr1:</p>
<p>Because the defaults are not designed for power users, they are designed for grandma (not the literal grandma but the typical user who is non-technical).</p>
<p>Grandma doesn&#39;t know that you can turn on reminders for birthdays. &nbsp;Grandma isn&#39;t going to know to ask if it is possible. &nbsp;Grandma just accepts the technology for what it is.</p>
<p>With features on by default Grandma sees what is possible. &nbsp;Being on by default can motivate Grandma to inquire how to turn it off (if desired), where as if features are off by default and the software sits idle then there is nothing motivating Grandma to ask questions. &nbsp;Remember, Grandma just accepts the technology as is.</p>

		<p>It isn&#39;t like Outlook.com doesn&#39;t tell you how to turn them off:</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>When: &nbsp;Monday, July 7, 2014 </p>
<p>Send an email</p>
<p>View contact profile</p>
<p>Edit birthday</p>
<p>Stop getting notifications</p>

<p>Tap &quot;Stop getting notifications.&quot;</p>
<p>Tap &quot;Get reminders for events and tasks&quot;</p>
<p>Tap &quot;Save.&quot;</p>

		<p>@Bruno&amp;Boots: The birthday calendar is automatically generated by your contacts&#39; data, either manually or from social networks. It&#39;s fine you don&#39;t care for Facebook, but Raymond was referring to the general service, where the birthday of a contact may or may not have been set by you. </p>
<p>The calendar service looks at your contact data and generates the birthday calendar, but it doesn&#39;t go the other way. The contacts service does not touch the calendar. There&#39;s no need to, the calendar takes care of itself. The reminders are all or nothing.</p>
<p>And if you don&#39;t want the birthday calendar at all, you can just remove the calendar from your Microsoft account completely. Problem solved. Instead of just filtering it out, go back to Options, click Birthday Calendar, then click Delete. When this is done, there is always a &quot;Birthday Calendar&quot; option in the Calendar&#39;s New menu. Making a new birthday calendar regenerates the calendar automatically from your contact data. Useful for troubleshooting the birthday calendar.</p>

		<p>I hope I could get the correct calendar on my WinPhone 8.1. It correctly gets Hong Kong weather information but chosen to get the Taiwan Holiday list instead of Hong Kong one. I can add that back myself on live calendar but no option is given on WinPhone Calendar App. That&#39;s not very helpful.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
