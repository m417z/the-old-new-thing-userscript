		<p>Did you not read Raymond&#39;s first link? They&#39;re hidden because those folders are for PROGRAMS to store data. Data that you expect USERs to play with should be stored in My Documents, which is not hidden by default.</p>

		<p>This document states that it applies to Vista. Since Raymond is providing a link to this, I guess nothing changed for Windows 7. Is this correct? I&#39;m asking because I avoided Vista and went straight to Windows 7 when I built my new PC.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: I&#39;ll accept that as valid when they provide an easy way to get to the magic folder that programs written before Vista reach when they try to save a file somewhere under Program Files. &nbsp;Sometimes those are documents that the user needs to be able to get access to.</p>

		<p>How does this advice change with respect to the Libraries introduced in Windows 7?</p>
<p>Specifically, the document recommends creating a new data folder at the root of the user&#39;s profile. &nbsp;With the Libraries in Windows 7, would the recommendation change to creating and leveraging a Library with the default-write location as previously recommended? &nbsp;Or is the creation and use of Libraries a user-specific function?</p>

		<p>Joshua:</p>
<p>The thing is, unhiding appdata and programdata doesn&#39;t show desktop.ini, you need to use a completely different option to show desktop.ini. (It is a protected operating system file.) So if anyone is showing these and getting desktop.ini then it is obvious that they are doing something wrong.</p>

		<p>@Joshua:</p>
<p>Desktop.ini files are only shown if you also un-check the &quot;Hide protected operating system files&quot; box in Folder Options.</p>
<p>I used to always choose &quot;show hidden files&quot; and &quot;show protected files&quot; &#8212; dealing with the annoying desktop.ini files all over the place &#8212; until one day I stopped and asked myself why I was even bothering with it. &nbsp;Since then I&#39;ve left the &quot;Hide protected&#8230;&quot; option checked, and using Explorer is much more enjoyable than before.</p>
<p>Give it a try. &nbsp;You can still see all the hidden files and folders so navigation is easy, but aren&#39;t bothered by files that are extraneous 99.99% of the time (e.g., desktop.ini, System Volume Information, etc).</p>

		<p>&quot;Show hidden files/folders&quot; should be a button that appears every time there are those in the current folder. It&#39;s too much hassle to enable when necessary, and too much clutter when you don&#39;t need them.</p>

		<p>Well it turned out it was my turn to take a beating. Protected operating system files are no longer being abused and so that setting is be safe to turn off (ages ago that used to hide a bunch of programmer file types).</p>
<p>My point about the hidden file creep still stands. Application data folders are exactly what you *don&#39;t* want hidden because many applications store actual data (not just cache data) there and so you really do want to see it (to back it up if nothing else). The old quote of &quot;Where&#39;s your music?&quot; &quot;In Kazaa.&quot; really did indicate something that needed better handling.</p>

		<p>@Kaso:</p>
<p>LocalLow is the user&#39;s roaming profile that is accessible to low-integrity processes like Internet Explorer. This means that processes that are at heightened risk of being hacked (like your browser, PDF readers etc) can write data to there, but can&#39;t steal or attack other critical files in your roaming profile.</p>

		<p>@alegrl1: There&#39;s nothing stopping you from handling WM_NCPAINT from an AppInitDLL or some other mechanism to change the look of the thing (no it&#39;s not as easy as it sounds). Now the Metro application system on the other hand &#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
