		<p>Perhaps Microsoft should get into the corporate hospitality business. I don&#8217;t know what the margins are (probably not as good as you would think due to the requirement to pay top $$$ for surly staff to run them (the only thing you can&#8217;t outsource to India is staffing of this kind)), but when I have had occasion to book this kind of thing in the staff they tend to provide cheap food (chicken, low-quality burgers), at two or three times what you would pay at a sit-down restaurant.</p>

		<p>Well, there you go. Before today, I never knew there was such a thing as a professional picnic company.</p>

		<p>I have a close friend who works at Honeywell and discovered last night that they have the same picnic as Microsoft.  Same events, same food, wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if they were the same boyscouts.  I think the only difference was the gift shop tent.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve known for the last few years that both picnics are held at the same grounds, with Honeywell&#8217;s picnic being one or two weekends before Microsoft&#8217;s&#8230;I just didn&#8217;t realize they were the exact same picnic.</p>

		<p>You must be picnicking rather than blogging today, wednesday (tuesday your time).</p>
<p>MS provides good food. I was a network admin for one of their caterers (though not mass events). The Win 2000 launch was very american with lots of mustard (which Australians use on different foods to the yanks). Though the Sun people pigged in.</p>

		<p>T-Mobile <a target="_new" href="http://www.tmobile.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.tmobile.com</a> had their picnic there as well the weekend before. Same layout etc. It was 95&#176;F, which was record setting for Seattle. Unfortunately, Catherine Zeta-Jones <a target="_new" href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001876/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001876/</a> was a no show. :-)</p>

		<p>In my almost 9 years as a Microsoft employee, I&#8217;ve never been to one company picnic.  I&#8217;m at the point now where *not* going is a tradition for me, so I doubt I&#8217;ll ever see what this is like.  (I heard its screaming kids running around everywhere.)</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also wondered how much money could be saved if Microsoft stopped having the yearly picnic&#8230;  not to say we should not have it, but I&#8217;d be curious where this stacks up in the budget compared to infamous &quot;towel-service&quot; that was recently cut. :-)</p>

		<p>And, if you leave near the picnic grounds, you get complimentary admission to make us for having hordes of people travel through your neighborhood every weekend during the summer.<br />
<br />From talking with the picnic staff and neighbors, the Microsoft picnic has a better alcohol and food selection than nearly all the other ones, but the events are all pretty much the same.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
