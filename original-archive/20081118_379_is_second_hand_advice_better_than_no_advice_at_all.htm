<p>Commenter <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/11/06/5924058.aspx#5987948"> Grow Up</a> (if you're so grown up yourself, why not use your real name?) took issue with the second-hand advice I gave when the discussion of protecting sensitive data. In that discussion, I gave second-hand advice on how one could protect information, and one reader apparently thought I was trying to malign said second-hand advice or was holding it up as non-authoritative. (In case you forgot: Everything here is non-authoritative. It's all just my interpretation of the world around us. And that interpretation is often wrong. Don't make me bring back the nitpicker's corner.)</p>
<p> I added the second-hand advice only because upon re-reading, I noticed that I wrote a lot about what you shouldn't do but didn't write about what you should do. I didn't want to put my own neck on the line in an area I am not an expert, so I passed along second-hand advice instead, figuring second-hand advice was better than no advice at all. </p>
<p> It may surprise you that I am in fact an expert at very few things. I do have a rather extensive background in general programming principles, and I use that experience to "fill in the gaps" in places others may need help doing so. For example, I'm pretty good at the "Imagine what the world would be like if that were true" game because I've seen a good amount of the computer world and can think of scenarios that others may miss. On the other hand, I'm good at the "What if two people did this?" game only because I bother to play it at all. (Usually, the answer to the question "What if two people did this?" is obvious. People merely forget to ask it.) I'm also good at reverse-engineering history. I can see how something evolved and work out why it ended up that way. </p>
<p> So, suppose there's a topic that I know a little bit about but not enough to come up with an expert recommendation. For example, I may want to caution you against doing something but I don't have a good answer as to what you should be doing instead. Here are my options: </p>
<ol>
<li>Become an expert in the topic and develop a personal recommendation.     If it's worth doing, it's worth doing well. </li>
<li>Pass along somebody else's recommendation.     Second-hand advice is better than none. </li>
<li>Develop an uninformed recommendation.     Even though it's bad advice, at least it's my bad advice. </li>
<li>Don't provide any recommendation at all.     If you can't stand by it, then don't write it. </li>
<li>Don't write the article in the first place.     If you can't do a complete job, then don't do it. </li>
</ol>
<p> The first option is not going to happen; I don't <i>want</i> to become an expert in the topic. The last one is also unpleasant, because I do want to warn against what I consider to be a bad practice, or at least I may have some thoughts that I think are worth sharing. The middle option isn't very pleasing either. Besides, this is a blog, not a textbook. If you want a thorough treatment of a topic, you're looking in the wrong place. There are plenty of other bloggers who throw out half-baked ideas. I should be able to do it, too. </p>
<p> Like I just did. </p>

		<p>There are some to whom the world needs to be perfect, and each and every action they do within that world has to be perfect.</p>
<p>They walk within this world happy and constantly judging the others who do not perform at their &quot;level&quot; of excellence.</p>
<p>I find this arrogance quite annoying but usually i just laugh and move on.</p>

		<p>Because of your admitted areas of expertise and your significant amount of experience I think your half-baked ideas arte better than many others best attempts. Please ocntinue to share with those of us who appreciate what you do and ignore the rest. If they are not smart enough to understand what you are doing here, &nbsp;then does their opinion really matter anyway? I say no, it doesn&#8217;t. Of course, thats just my opinion, half baked or otherwise.</p>

		<p>What if the second hand advice is bad? &nbsp;Then you&#8217;re better off giving no advice at all. &nbsp;But how do you know if the second hand advice is bad? &nbsp;You are no expert, so you rely on your source. &nbsp;But what if he is really not an expert? &nbsp;What if he has built an intricate network of support only to fool people like you into giving bad second hand advice from so-called experts? &nbsp;Did you ever think about that?</p>

		<p>You can&#8217;t be right all of the time, even on things that you actually are an expert on.</p>

		<p>I just don&#8217;t get why nerds feel the need to score points over minute details, especially when they&#8217;re demonstrably wrong or just being completely unpleasant about it. &nbsp;Its like some sort of Aspergers where they only pretend to be knowledgeable on something.</p>

<p>Both of those disclaimers are true of /every/ piece of writing. &nbsp;What makes something authoritative is whether the author is an authority on the subject.</p>

		<p>Maurits, Raymond Chen is not an authority on all things Windows in the hard and fast way you would like him to be. In fact a lot of the time Raymond defers to a higher authority&#8230; executable code and published documentation.</p>
<p>Until the words &quot;Because Raymond said so&quot; prevent termination of employment I&#8217;ll follow Regans advice. &quot;Trust but verify.&quot;</p>

		<p>Maybe your dedicated staff of fact-checkers can, when verifying that you are accurately passing along this second-hand advice, add a hyperlink to the source of that advice. &nbsp;That way, members of the audience could click the link to go to a place where that second-hand advice is, uhm, first-handified.</p>
<p>Eh? &nbsp;What&#8217;s that? &nbsp;You don&#8217;t have a dedicated staff of fact-checkers? &nbsp;Well then, instead of a link, maybe you can add a &quot;[citation needed]&quot;. I think I saw that phrase in some web article or another that folks treated as pretty authoritative. &nbsp;Uhm, I forget exactly where, though. [citation needed]</p>

		<p>Larry Hosken: Well said, except when it happens that the &quot;second hand advice&quot; is deliver by word&#8230; It&#8217;s a bit too much to just ask &quot;whoever your friend is&quot; a question and request him / her to make a blog entry so you can link to it.</p>
<p>Raymond already quoted that the information is come from &quot;the memory manager folks&quot;. I think that&#8217;s the best he can reasonably do. If you think it&#8217;s not enough, perhaps you&#8217;re asking too much.</p>

		<p>If you find that Raymond doesn&#8217;t do what you feel is a &quot;good enough&quot; job, if you don&#8217;t think the advice is worth what you paid for it, hit him where it hurts. Cancel your subscription!</p>
<p>If enough people do so, he&#8217;ll be forced to alter the value of advice to cost of advice ratio, either by increasing the value of the advice, or decreasing the cost of it.</p>
<p>Where&#8217;s a copy of the SLA that came when I purchased access to this blog, I&#8217;m pretty sure it spec&#8217;d out the percentage of advice that has to be infallibly correct&#8230;</p>

		<p>Actually (and I hope this isn&#8217;t a nitpick) a more useful question than &quot;what if two people did this&quot; is &quot;what if three people did this&quot; if the question is about programming principles. I&#8217;ve found that having three players in a thought experiment can show up more potential problems than just two, especially where there are queues or other resource availability issues.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
