<p>Writing <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/09/17/10063630.aspx"> that entry last Friday</a> reminded me that I never did share my stories of that emergency vacation, save for a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/29/55062.aspx"> cryptic list</a> of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/01/06/9284334.aspx"> learnings</a>. Here's a little story about the ferry crossing.</p>
<p> Part of the trip involved driving from Copenhagen (<i lang="da">K&oslash;benhavn</i>) to Munich (<i lang="de">M&uuml;nchen</i>), which means taking a ferry. (It's faster than driving down the peninsula.) Realizing that we would also have to take the ferry on the return trip on Saturday, we grabbed a ferry schedule during a rest stop in Denmark. </p>
<p> What we didn't realize until it was time for the return trip was that the schedule was (naturally) in Danish, a language none of us could read or speak. As the closest thing in the car to an expert in northern European languages (it wasn't a close vote), I was called upon to do my best to puzzle out the timetable. The choice was between the Puttgarten&ndash;R&oslash;dby ferry and the Rostock&ndash;Gedser ferry. If we could make it, the Rostock&ndash;Gedser ferry would have been a better choice since it is a more direct route. </p>
<p> I was able to decode that the Puttgarten&ndash;R&oslash;dby ferry ran every half hour around the clock, whereas the Rostock&ndash;Gedser ferry stopped running at 11:30pm. (This sounds like a no-brainer, except that the Puttgarten&ndash;R&oslash;dby timetable didn't give the actual run times; it just said <i lang="da">afgang hver halve time, sejltid 0:45</i>.) We consulted the map, estimated our driving time, and calculated that if we stayed focused and didn't dawdle at the rest breaks, we could make the 11:30pm Rostock&ndash;Gedser ferry. </p>
<p> In the fine print of the schedule I was able to translate that the late-night Rostock&ndash;Gedser ferry run does not operate on ... um ... <i lang="da">l&oslash;rdag</i>. </p>
<p> What's <i lang="da">l&oslash;rdag</i>? </p>
<p> We decided to play it safe and go to Puttgarten. </p>
<p> It was a good call, because  <i lang="da">l&oslash;rdag</i> is Danish (and as I later learned, Swedish) for Saturday. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus ferry story</b>: After paying the fare on the Danish side for the morning crossing into Germany, the toll booth agent quickly mumbled, "<i lang="da">Syv</i>, <i lang="de">sieben</i>, seven" as we pulled away. He said it so quickly and unexpectedly, the English-speaking people in the car didn't hear the "seven" since they tuned out what the guy said once they determined that it wasn't English. I was paying more attention, figuring there was an off-chance the agent would speak German to us, and I picked out the <i lang="de">sieben</i>, and then upon mentally rewinding and replaying what he said, I also recognized the "seven." </p>
<p> But why did he keep saying "seven" in various languages? As we reached the waiting area, we figured it out: Because he was telling us to line up in row number seven. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus ferry storylet</b>: As we waited for the ferry, I noticed that the car behind us had a sticker saying that it was purchased from... a town just a few miles from where I grew up! How the heck did a car from a small town in New Jersey end up in Denmark? We asked the people standing next to the car&mdash;it was a nice day, so people stood outside&mdash;and they explained that they bought it from somebody who moved to Denmark from the States, and he brought his car with him. Strange coincidences abound. </p>
<p> Of course, an even stranger coincidence would have been if I happened to have known the original owner. (Not the case here.) </p>

		<p>Apparently crossing through a zero vertically to avoid confusion with the letter &#39;O&#39; has a whole new level of ambiguity if you happen to live in Northern Europe&#8230;</p>

		<p>@h.attila</p>
<p>Which is why you generally just put a dot in the zero if you need to disambiguate it from letter O in Danish.</p>
<p>@Raymond</p>
<p>I&#39;m surprised there weren&#39;t any English or even German brochures about the ferries; travel-related companies over here tend to know the value of putting out at least key information in foreign languages. (Even if it might be badly mangled at times&#8230;)</p>
<div class="post">[<i>I wasn&#39;t the one who grabbed the schedule, but my guess is that all the different language schedules look sufficiently similar that unless you paid close attention you wouldn&#39;t realize that they were in different languages.

		<p>h.attila: Strangely enough, that practice has never taken hold here. We meet it mostly in the form of slashed zeroes in console fonts. But it&#39;s not a real ambiguity because (in all of the console fonts I&#39;ve met) the slash in a slashed zero stops inside the round outline, whereas the slash in a capital √ò must protude beyond the O-oval. Monospaced fonts often make it descend a bit below the baseline (and ascend above the other capitals).</p>
<p>It does give new opportunites for hexspeak. If you ever find yourself debugging a corrupted heap on a 24-bit machine you can fill the memory with 0xD0DB0F&#8230;</p>
<p>(In fact, most of the console fonts I encounter in my daily life use dotted zeroes rather than slashed ones).</p>
<p>It&#39;s a larger problem that √∏√ò was not included in code page 437 when IBM launched the PC in 1981, despite many other special letters for Western European languages being there. Once in a while you still come across legacy systems that pass, say, customer addresses through a CP437 conversion. Then the √∏&#39;s may either disappear or become Greek phis, whereas √¶ and √• (the two other non-English letters usid in Danish and Norwegian) survive fine.</p>

		<p>I had a similar thought to Niels: when I was in Denmark, every Dane I met spoke better English than half the English I meet. They also have the common feature of being almost achingly polite. After all, that seems to have been the case with the car&#39;s owners. Wasn&#39;t there a passing streetsweeper or urchin who could have helped you translate?</p>

		<p>Actually, it&#39;s l√∂rdag (with diaeresis) in Swedish. Sort of the Swedish equivalent of l√∏rdag though. If you want bonus points you should know that l√∂rdag is short f√∂r l√∂gardagen, a very old way of saying &quot;bathing day&quot;, the day of the week you should take a bath. However, most Swedish people wash more often these days.</p>

		<p>I recently moved to Denmark and was surprised by the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>almost everyone (at least in cities) speaks decent English;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it pretty easy to decipher basic written Danish (and I was told that is even simpler if you know German);</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>it is impossible to decipher spoken Danish :-)</p>
</li>
</ul>

		<p>Talking of coincidences, when me and my wife were in Argentina last March, one day we decided to stop for lunch in a mom-and-pop restaurant in the middle of nowhere. We met a very friendly older Canadian couple there and while chatting over the desserts, after doing the excellent steak and pasta the appropriate honors, we found out we were both going to travel to Ushuaia (deceivingly called &#39;the town at the end of the world&#39;) the following week. We also found out we were using the same airway to go there so, jokingly, they asked me what day we were going because &quot;we might be on the same flight&quot;, and I said &quot;oh, I doubt it! We depart at some ungodly hour because we had to get our tickets at the last moment and those were the last remaining cheap tickets&quot;, and the woman says &quot;oh, really? our plane departs at 5.15, I doubt you can beat *that*!&quot;. </p>
<p>To make a long story short: of the millions of people in Buenos Aires we get to know a couple, in the middle of nowhere, who are travelling in the same exact plane, and sitting on the row right in front of us. What are the chances of that happening?</p>

		<p>Cool thing about taking the train from Denmark to Germany. The Ferry sits and waits for the train. The train pulls on board the ferry, and the ferry takes off.</p>
<p>My one regret is forgetting to take a picture of the train sitting on the ferry.</p>

		<p>Perhaps this is a *trifle* naive, but didn&#39;t someone have an Internet-connected phone they could type these phrases into a translation engine? &nbsp;I realize that machine translation is not a solved problem, but wouldn&#39;t it be &quot;good enough&quot; to divine which ferry to take?</p>

		<p>I was going to say the same thing, obviously the car was full of guys because no-one stopped to ask a convenient Dane for help&#8230; even on the Autobahn, a Plattduutsch speaker at a rest stop should have been able to have a go at translating.</p>

		<p>Magnus Hult &amp; Andreas Rejbrand:</p>
<p>I&#39;m pretty sure Raymond knows that much Swedish, i.e. that the Swedish word for that day is l√∂rdag and that the Danish word is l√∏rdag. It isn&#39;t exactly a completely new, different, word, as, say, uhm, Saturday. So one could say that it is pretty much the same word.</p>
<p>But, of course, not all his readers know this, so it&#39;s worth mentioning.</p>

		<p>Probably the biggest coincidence that I&#39;ve heard of was when a friend from xyz.edu of mine was traveling Europe. He was in a German nightclub and started a conversation with some local girls. Naturally small talk included asking where he was from, and the conversation went something like this: &quot;So where are you from?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m from America.&quot; &quot;Oh, I know an American. Do you know Chad Abc?&quot; &quot;Actually, yes! Chad Abc is a friend of mine.&quot;</p>
<p>Then a week or so later he ran into these girls again, only in England.</p>

		<p>&quot;Cool thing about taking the train from Denmark to Germany. The Ferry sits and waits for the train. The train pulls on board the ferry, and the ferry takes off.&quot;</p>
<p>These days it seems to be more common that the ferry takes off without the train, whereupon the train arrives 5 minutes late and has to wait for the next ferry. Always add 30 minutes when planning your onwards connection!</p>
<p>It was different in the old days when the railways actually operated the ferry line. But it was sold off later, and the current management seems to consider it more important to get their motorists get across in time than to help the railways keep their timetables. (This probably makes sound business sense).</p>

		<p>Wait a few more years and a bridge will replace the ferry, i.e. even on Saturdays you can cross at any time :-)</p>

		<p>They are not so much &quot;letters&quot; as it is a ligature used for the ae and oe diphthongs: such as in oestrogen, haemoglobin, encyclopaedia etc. Webster clerely must have decided that diphthongs were to confusing and stricken them from the langwige.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
