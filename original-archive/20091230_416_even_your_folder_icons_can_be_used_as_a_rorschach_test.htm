<p><a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/shows/WM_IN/Jenny-Lam-Designing-Experiences-at-Microsoft/"> Jenny Lam</a> (now at <a href="http://www.jacksonfish.com/blog/author/jenny/"> Jackson Fish Market</a>) forwarded me <a href="http://www.artlebedev.com/everything/folderix/"> this picture of a USB thumb drive</a>. She also reminded me of another one of those <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/08/25/54700.aspx"> Windows as Rorschach test</a> incidents that surrounded the Windows Vista folder icons.</p>
<p> It was reported during one of the betas that the 16&times;16 folder icon looked like someone <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_(gesture)"> flipping the bird</a>. Sure, this interpretation required some creativity, and it perhaps reflects more on the person making the observation than on the folder icon itself, but the report still had to be taken seriously, because one thing you don't want is a newspaper headline saying that your product uses crudely offensive imagery. And yes, we went back and changed the icon to avoid the problem. </p>
<p> Now, if you take that Folderix flash drive and tilt your head to the right about 60&deg;, you can turn it into somebody giving you the finger with their right hand: The folder tab is the thumb, the folder body is the back of the hand, and the USB connector is the extended middle finger. </p>
<p> Who knows, maybe that was intentional after all. </p>

		<p>A developer at a company I worked for put a smiley face with arms giving two thumbs up that I guess the developer had grabbed off some free icon site. &nbsp;When I was looking over the changes she had made, I thought it looked a little weird, but it was difficult to see detail at the small size. &nbsp;So I took a screenshot and increased the size. &nbsp;Sure enough, it wasn&#8217;t a smiley giving two thumbs up, but rather it was a smiley giving the finger with both hands.</p>
<p>I shouldn&#8217;t have said anything, but my professionalism took over and I suggested the developer change the image.</p>

		<p>@quanta: &quot;and now there&#8217;s no image&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe the new one offended some people because it looks a bit like a wizard&#8217;s hat which reminded them of a wizard&#8217;s sleeve which is a euphemism for&#8230;</p>

		<p>Surely if that&#8217;s offensive, anything with a squareish protrusion must also be. Skyscrapers are giant flicking fingers! Tennis racquets insult everyone at the court! And don&#8217;t get me</p>

		<p>If your product doesn&#8217;t offend at least one person, you don&#8217;t have enough market share.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if you get multiple reports of Hitler hiding in your wallpapers you might just have a little too much market share :)</p>

		<p>Speaking of folder icons, why does Windows 7/Windows Vista not have a separate icon for an &quot;open&quot; folder like Windows XP? Another example of change for the sake of it or ignorance? In a huge folder tree view, why is it not easy to locate the currently open folder in the left pane of Explorer especially if the selection is in the right pane and left pane&#8217;s selection is gray/background selection color?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
