<p>I was out of town for the grading of the seventh grade essays, so I pitched in with the sixth grade essays instead. The students were asked to think of an adult and describe the qualities that make that person an adult. This topic was not very well received by the students, who deemed it uncreative and boring. While I understand their lack of enthusiasm, it's also true that for most of your life, you're going to have to write on topics that are uncreative and boring (and <a href="http://apps.carleton.edu/admissions/counselors/essay/"> the stakes are going to be higher</a>), so you'd better get good at it.</p>
<p> The difference in writing skill between sixth and seventh graders (between eleven year olds and twelve year olds) is quite noticeable. Many of sixth graders could not get past the literal definition of the word <i>adult</i>, describing the qualities that make an adult purely in terms of biology: Age, height, strength, puberty, armpit hair. Many others focused on accomplishments or privileges that distinguish adults from children: Advanced education, having a job, knowing how to drive a car, and being able to stay up late without getting yelled at. </p>
<p> Remember, these are just the funny sentences/excerpts. Do not assume that all students write like this. The assignment is given under standardized test conditions: 90 minutes with nothing but pencil and paper, with one additional hour available upon request. </p>
<p> <b>The easy life</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>After     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="college">collage</span>,     you could just go home and relax for the rest of your life.     <i>And you wonder why scrapbooking is so popular?     It's because everybody goes to collage!</i> </li>
<li>Adults go on vacation to international countries and play golf.     <i>Gosh, I wonder if this student comes from a wealthy family.</i> </li>
<li>My dad is a big fan of football.  Who's not? </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Check your fun at the door</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Adults don't like to do anything fun 60% of the time.     <i>I think I'm getting shortchanged on the other 40%, too.</i> </li>
<li id="talktalktalk">They talk and talk and talk, that's all they do. </li>
<li>When an adult takes you somewhere it is usually to a     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="department">depactment</span> store. </li>
<li>My mom was so busy she had to step up her gear to get it all done. </li>
<li>My mom is nice, she likes to get new kitchen supplies and carpet. </li>
<li>Just like kids, adults still make mistakes and just want to have fun. </li>
<li>Being an adult means living     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Under_the_influence">     above the influence</a>. </li>
<li>Adults don't do stupid things like throwing wild house parties 24/7. </li>
<li>Mature people order off the adult menu at     <a href="http://www.redrobin.com/">     Red Robin</a> and     do not order jumbo sundaes with extra cherries. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Responsible behavior</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>My mom is responsible because she cleans the house before     anybody tells her to. </li>
<li>My dad is good sport.     If he wins something, he doesn't say, "nanny nanny boo boo." </li>
<li>Being mature is one big part about being an adult     because if no one was mature then we would be at war all the time.     <i>Instead, adults just talk and talk and talk.</i> </li>
<li>My mom cleans the house because my dad doesn't.     <i>Are you suggesting that your dad isn't an adult?</i> </li>
<li>Being a civilized adult is simple,     and all adults have it just not all the time. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Let me tell you about my parents</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>She's now a mail women. </li>
<li>My dad is an adult because of his hair.     He is losing his hair, and I hope he will not be bald soon. </li>
<li>He has a wife (my mom).     <i>Thanks for clearing that up.</i> </li>
<li>My dad is really smart.     He's been married three times.     <i>Most people are satisfied to be only one third as smart as him.</i> </li>
<li>A good dad makes his own meals,     and who doesn't like a guy that knows a thing or two about the stove? </li>
<li>My dad is tough.      He is not easily scared by spiders,     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="lightning">lightening</span>,     or the dark.     <i>I'm assuming that     <a href="http://www.epigee.org/pregnancy/signs.html">     lightening</a> was a spelling error, but who knows?</i> </li>
<li>My mom helps me appreciate that I don't live in a third world country.     <i>For example, she frequently reminds me that there are starving children     in Africa.</i> </li>
<li>I hope one day my mom will live longer than ever before.     <i>"Hey Mom, have you ever been this old before?"     "How about now?"</i> </li>
<li>My mom is the first adult I ever met. </li>
<li>My parents are not overly protective.  They let me     <a href="http://www.teenhealthfx.com/answers/Health/3218.html">     eat raw cookie dough</a>. </li>
<li>When I saw my Uncle Mike in Texas, I knew he was an adult. </li>
<li>Sarah has     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder">     many personalities</a> that make her an adult. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Assorted commentary</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Adults can't whine unless their car gets totaled,     or their house burns down. </li>
<li>But I think of you more as an adult when you have to shave your back hair. </li>
<li>My dad is one of the most manly adults I know.     <i>Must be the back hair.</i> </li>
<li>Eight-teen is a huge age! </li>
<li>OK, you've survived the first paragraph.     Good, because here comes the second one. </li>
<li>Most adults I know are pretty smart.     Not Albert Einstein smart, but common sense smart. </li>
<li>Adults are great people unless they aren't what they shouldn't be. </li>
<li>Every single adult has gone through puberty or at least half way.     <i>I believe the ones that went through only halfway     are known as 'Frat boys'.</i> </li>
<li><i>Best opening sentence</i>:     When you grow up to be an adult, you get armpit hair. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Concluding thoughts</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>I also think I'm going to have a hard time when I be an adult. </li>
<li>And those are just some snidbits from my brain. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Misspelling corner.</b> I've included more context; that may make the game a bit easier. </p>
<ul>
<li>He doesn't goof around when he is     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="supposed">so post</span>     to be doing work. </li>

<li>Being grown up is never     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="goofing">goffing</span> up. </li>

<li>When you become an adult you get     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="facial">fatiol</span>     hair. </li>
<li>She doesn't     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="whine">wine</span>     like a baby.     <i>Hey, baby, how about another glass of chardonnay?</i> </li>
<li>My dad also plays     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="musical? notable?">motable</span>     instruments. </li>
</ul>
<p> Other remarks on student writing: </p>
<ul>
<li>     Most essays followed the standard introduction formula     "There are three qualities that make a person an adult.     Those qualities are A, B, and&nbsp;C."     It's a treat to find an essay that opens more creatively,     but alas, the essays with excellent introductions failed to     maintain the quality level for the rest of the essay. </li>
<li>     You can't just write "And that's why X" to conclude your     paragraph if you never actually explained why&nbsp;X.     I read many paragraphs that took the form     "Adults have quality&nbsp;Q.     Quality&nbsp;Q means that XYZ.     That's why adults should have quality&nbsp;Q."     The paragraph did nothing to explain why quality&nbsp;Q     is an important one for adults to have;     it merely stated and defined it.     One teacher explained to me that this isn't a conscious     writing choice but is rather simply a bad habit.     "I've written a bunch on topic&nbsp;X.     Now I need to wrap it up.     And the way you wrap it up is to write,     'And that's why&nbsp;X.'" </li>
</ul>
<p> And that's why I read student essays. </p>

		<p>Blame it on the Mad Men:</p>
<p>&quot;Above the Influence&quot; is an antidrug campaign tag line. &nbsp;The fact that a kid used it in an essay means they&#8217;re either simply swayed by anything they see on TV; a rules oriented child who might otherwise be a tattletale personality; or a cynic who is using the line to mock the tattles.</p>
<p>A &#8216;fun razor&#8217; is possibly a &quot;Razor scooter&quot;, though I&#8217;d like to see the insurance bill for the school district that buys them! &nbsp;</p>
<p>The structure of the standard introduction formula gave me flashbacks to &quot;the five paragraph essay&quot; expository writing technique I think I had in middle school. &nbsp;That&#8217;s the exact formula: opening paragraph, three concrete paragraphs with three supporting elements, conclusion paragraph. &nbsp;I bet that&#8217;s what the kids were taught!</p>

<p>I and most of my high school classmates achieved armpit hair about age 15; in anything but legal status, adulthood was a minimum of half again that.</p>

		<p>Many (most?) middle-high school English classes teach the horrible &quot;There are three qualities that make a person an adult. Those qualities are A, B, and C.&quot; approach as dogma. &nbsp;Yes, it dumbs everyone down, but anyone can pull it off, regardless of natural talent. &nbsp;The downside is that for some people (e.g. me) it turns you off of writing completely. &nbsp;I ignored English class from sixth through twelfth grade, and only picked up writing again when a teacher encouraged me to write in a less rigidly formulaic way.</p>

		<p>&gt; I was out of town for the grading of the seventh grade essays, so I pitched in with the sixth grade essays instead.</p>
<p>So how does this work ? You go to your local school and ask to see the essays the kids wrote, and they just give them to you ?</p>

<p>Volunteer to do what, exactly ? They actually let you grade essays ? Can anyone volunteer for that or do you happen to be a licensed teacher ?</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never heard of anything similar in my country (.nl), I doubt it would even be legal.</p>

		<p>@Aaargh!</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t have to be a licensed teacher to grade papers, at least, not in America. &nbsp;Teacher&#8217;s Assistants, often students themselves, do it all the time; even in high school (9th &#8211; 12th grade).</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not an easy question to answer, either, when asked of non-adults.</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s like asking a layperson what makes somebody a good programmer. At the very best they&#8217;ll be able to offer an extensional definition (someone who easily writes correct, maintainable programs), but in order to make a qualified guess at the underlying traits that cause somebody to be a good programmer, you need to be one yourself. (Or, perhaps, a very perceptive journeyman programmer).</p>

		<p>re: &quot;And that&#8217;s why &#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>I read (edit) white papers and miscellaneous texts produced by non-professionals all the time that have a &quot;Conclusion&quot; section at the end. Which is the growed-up version of &quot;And that&#8217;s why &#8230;,&quot; in most cases, anyway. (But I can&#8217;t remember a time when such a paper needed much concluding.)</p>

		<p>Ugh, I hated English, or Language Atrs or whatever it&#8217;s called. All this stuff I never got like subtext, etc.</p>
<p>Still, I do write a fair bit in my day job, and it&#8217;s not just code. Just that technical writing is a bit more formulaic and has definite structure. Plus the audience I write to doesn&#8217;t care for the flowing kind of writing, just a more to the point boom-boom-boom done writing. Thus, a quick introduction, followed by the meat.</p>
<p>Just it was to be well structured so headings are obvious and be possible to be read out of order. Unless a sensible reason is mentioned in the introduction that can&#8217;t be gleaned from the headings.</p>

		<p>My first thought about &quot;suplise&quot; was &quot;surprise&quot;, possibly by an Asian student. &quot;supplies&quot; makes more sense in the sentence though.</p>

		<p>I think maturity is based on Kersian personality type, and seen in reaction to situations:</p>
<p>Artisan (SP): Knowing how to react from experience.</p>
<p>Guardian (SJ): Reacting responsibly; not shirking duties.</p>
<p>Idealist (NF): Reacting with empathy; sharing the burden.</p>
<p>Rational (NT): Reacting based on what is best for the situation; remove the personal aspect.</p>
<p>As we are (hopefully) always growing in maturity, possibly reaching its peak a bit later in life, it would be hard to call anyone under 50 or 60 an &quot;adult&quot;. But, we just draw the line somewhere.</p>
<p>I think i draw it at my age, and adjust it each year. How can i expect 6th grader&#8217;s to do otherwise?</p>

		<p>&quot;Being grown up is never goffing up.&quot;</p>
<p>Are you sure that&#8217;s not supposed to be &quot;giving&quot; instead of &quot;goofing&quot; (as your tooltip suggests)? &nbsp;F and V are very similar sounds, and &quot;giving&quot; makes more sense in the context. &nbsp;Not sure how they would have sounded out an &quot;o&quot; as the first vowel, though.</p>

		<p>This is always one of my favorite blog posts of the entire year. &nbsp;If only for these &#8216;wisdom&#8217; posts I would continue to subscribe to the blog.</p>

		<p>&quot;Mature people &#8230; do not order jumbo sundaes with extra cherries.&quot;</p>
<p>Hmph! &nbsp;As Adam Savage would say, &quot;I reject your maturity and substitute my own.&quot; &nbsp;With extra cherries too!</p>

		<p>Re: &quot;I&#8217;m trying to imagine what a fun razor is&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m pretty sure that &quot;Fun Razor&quot; is an accessory for Mainway Toys&#8217; Johnny Switchblade: Adventure Punk Action Figure.</p>
<p>Of course Johnny Switchblade isn&#8217;t as popular as it was in the 70&#8217;s but Bag O&#8217; Glass, Chainsaw Teddy bear and the classic Halloween costume Johnny Human Torch are still popular.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
