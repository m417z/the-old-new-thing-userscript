A customer reported that their program ran on Windows XP just
fine,
but on Windows 7,
its icons are all black boxes.
They included a code fragment to demonstrate:
</p>
<pre>
CBitmap *pBmp = new CBitmap;
pBmp-&gt;LoadBitmap(IDB_BITMAP);

CImageList m_ImageList;

SHFILEINFO sfi;
HIMAGELIST hHandle = (HIMAGELIST)SHGetFileInfo(_T(".txt"),
    FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL, &amp;sfi, sizeof(sfi),
    <a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040601-00/?p=39073">SHGFI_USEFILEATTRIBUTES</a> | SHGFI_SYSICONINDEX | SHGFI_LARGEICON);
m_ImageList.Attach(hHandle);
int n = m_ImageList.Add(pBmp, RGB(0,255,0));

m_listctrl.SetImageList(&amp;m_ImageList, LVSIL_NORMAL);

m_listctrl.InsertItem(0, _T("Sample"), n);
</pre>
<p>
Okay, there are multiple things wrong here,
but they all boil down to the same root cause:
Modifying the system image list.
</p>
<p>
The system image lists are managed by the system.
It adds images to the system image list when you do things like
call
<code>SH&shy;Get&shy;File&shy;Info</code> with the
<code>SHGFI_SYS&shy;ICON&shy;INDEX</code> flag,
or if you host an Explorer Browser control or open
a common file dialog.
The system needs to keep all of the system image lists in sync,
so that an index refers to the same image across all of the
system image lists.
It also needs to know how to regenerate each of those images,
in case it needs to resize the images.
</p>
<p>
If you go in and make changes to the system image list
(say, by adding new images),
this bypasses all of the internal shell bookkeeping
and gets everything out of sync.
Once that happens, the results are unpredictable.
</p>
<p>
It so happens that Windows XP was far more forgiving
of misuse of the system image lists,
but optimizations introduced in Windows Vista
made it less tolerant of abuse.
</p>
<p>
(The other bug here is that when the
<code>m_ImageList</code> destructs,
it will destroy the attached image list,
which means destroying the system image list.
This also tends not to end well,
but my guess is that the customer never noticed
because the <code>m_ImageList</code> was not destructed
until the program was exiting anyway.)
</p>
<p>
The correct thing to do in the customer's scenario above
is to create your own image list
and put your custom images there.
</p>
<p>
Of course, if the image list had consisted entirely
of app-provided bitmaps,
then the customer probably would have done this in the first place.
I suspect they are adding custom images to the system image list
because they want their list view to be able to display
both custom images and system images.
In that case, it should create a custom image list,
and put its custom images there.
If it also wants to show a system image in the list view control,
it should copy that image into their custom image list.</p>

		<p>Which reminds me, what was the initial purpose of the Shell Icons key? I remember using it back on Windows XP to give some custom 48*48-capable icons to some standard file types like .reg files, because I didn&#8217;t like the upscaled look&#8230;</p>

		<p>The Shell Icons registry key was available as far back as Windows 95.</p>
<p>The original Windows 95 release only had 16- and 256-color icons. A post-release add-on, Windows 95 Plus!, contained (among other things) multiple hi-color icon themes which its configuration utility activated by rewriting that key.</p>
<p>Perhaps supporting Plus! was the keyâ€™s sole intended purpose.</p>

		<p>All *shell* functions that interact with the system imagelist are safe to use but that does not mean it is a good idea. On Windows 95 the system imagelist is shared by all processes and therefore it is pretty rude to add your own images just because you don&#8217;t want to create a private imagelist. The system imagelist is supposed to make the system faster by caching icons that are used often.</p>

		<p>I just assumed it was an mfc snippet, as opposed to qt or whatever. The _T() macro is a bit old school for Windows code but. But I bet Modern IDE&#8217;s could make it look flash again.</p>

		<p>to be fair to people that &#8220;misuse image lists&#8221;, once upon a time the shell assigned an empty &#8220;shell&#8221; imagelist to each process that requested one, so one got into the habit of using it more liberally. E.g. what is the &#8220;recommended&#8221; way to add a custom overlay image nowadays?</p>

		<p>It was not completely empty, it contains the first 5 or so images from the &#8220;global&#8221; imagelist (off the top of my head; unassociated file, closed folder, shortcut arrow overlay). Every process gets a new copy because some apps are buggy and NT was all about security and stability. It was shared on 9x because a lot of stuff was shared by all processes there. There is a function in shell32 you can call to get the fully populated list.</p>
<p>If you are not displaying the items exactly like the shell does then the shell imagelist is the wrong choice and you should use your own list (IMHO) but you might be able to pull it off with custom draw in listviews and treeviews.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
