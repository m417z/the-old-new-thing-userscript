		<p>You can also get a whole lot more than $25, if you have the credit card statements that indicate a large value of such transactions. &nbsp;Also includes cash advances with debit cards and such. (I traveled to the UK a lot in that period.)</p>

		<p>You don&#8217;t even need the credit card statements. Once you&#8217;ve exhausted your archives, online statements, and the six other monthly statements that the credit card company is required to fish out of their own backups at your request, you can put in a good faith estimate for the rest.</p>
<p>The terms of the suit have been changing; that &quot;good faith&quot; thing was added and the deadline was pushed back several months.</p>
<p>With all the trips my wife and I made in 2001 and 2002 (aging parents and other family stuff) I reckon I&#8217;m due about a grand.</p>

		<p>Kind of interested to see what will happen if I use option 2, number of days outside of the US.</p>
<p>I have been living in Europe since 2002 so I will have a huge number of days but I don&#8217;t use that card except for travel and hotels.</p>

		<p>I think that this will cost the Credit Card companies a lot of money. 30 million people received an official packet!</p>

		<p>You aren&#8217;t going to be refunded everything you spent outside the US. &nbsp;Probably about 1% is my guess. &nbsp;So to get a grand, you would have had to spend $100k or so. &nbsp;I&#8217;m sure some did, but I suspect the intersection between those and the readers of this blog is small.</p>
<p>I signed up for the $25. &nbsp;Considering all the class-action suits I&#8217;ve &quot;won&quot; where my award was less than the price of a postage stamp to claim it, that&#8217;s not bad.</p>

		<p>This article is missing an important piece of information: those who may be eligible are people who used credit cards to complete transactions in a foreign currency.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
