<p>Last year, our friends over in the Fargo campus <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/12/22/9244583.aspx"> mocked us wusses for shutting down the campus over something as weenie as a touch of snow</a>. Yesterday, there was a safety alert on the internal company home page:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  <b>Alert</b> </p>
<p> The Fargo Campus is closed effective immediately due to inclement weather. The City of Fargo is pulling the plows from the snow emergency routes. Employees are encouraged to leave the Fargo Campus. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Yup, <a href="http://www.cityoffargo.com/"> Fargo</a> has been shut down due to <a href="http://apps.cityoffargo.com/newsevents.asp?id=1704"> inclement weather</a>. </p>
<p> <b>Explanation for people who don't get it</b>: Both this and the mock weather advisory issued by the Fargo campus are just examples of friendly teasing between the Redmond and Fargo campuses, like cousins who live in different parts of the country. I encourage readers to interpret the teasing in the spirit in which it was intended. (Though given the nitpicking from yesterday, I'm not sure this caution will be heeded.) </p>

		<p>What would have been more fun if it read &quot;&#8230;Employees are encouraged to leave the Fargo Campus, and move to Redmond&quot;</p>

		<p>I live in Fargo, and yes, it was quite a storm.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not unheard of for businesses to close, but Tuesday&#8217;s storm (which came on the heels of a smaller storm the day before) basically shut down the entire town. Hospitals were open only to emergencies, gas stations and grocery stores (not that you could have made it there anyway). On the way in to work this morning, the road crews were cutting through an 8 foot high snow drift across I-29, which was still closed from Grand Forks to the South Dakota border.</p>
<p>Glad to see the two campuses trading some humor back and forth :-)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d like to say that the number of people who read, understood the intent of, and enjoyed yesterday&#8217;s post without comment probably dominate the &quot;Oh, but what about PACEMAKERS Raymond?!&quot; crowd by several orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d personally be sad if interesting posts like yesterday&#8217;s went away.</p>

<p>He already pointed out there are exceptions to the rule. This would be one of them (I presume).</p>

		<p>So now we start commenting AND nitpicking totally off topic on a post where commenting was closed&#8230;</p>
<p>Anyway, Fargo always reminds me of the scene in movie by the Coen brothers where one of the kidnappers tries to hide the money in the snow.</p>

		<p>Bob: Congratulations, you just nitpicked the *example* of a idiotic nitpick, therefore causing some kind of nitpick spatial distortion that will now kill us all.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
