		<p>It&#8217;s gotta be at least as interesting as poker championships.</p>
<p>And that deflection shot into the corner pocket, as it were, was pretty neat.</p>

		<p>I saw the shot live (yes I actually scheduled ahead of time to watch a curling game) and although I know it was a great shot and a high-pressure situation, in a sense it&#8217;s really just a pool shot, you have to hit the Ontario stone at the right angle and then you&#8217;re golden. You don&#8217;t need to make it curl and you don&#8217;t have to worry about weight (as long as you throw it hard enough) because the shooter is going to hit another rock at the end. So I&#8217;m surprised it is being hailed as the &quot;best shot ever&quot;. Then again I have never actually curled. One thing is your sweepers can&#8217;t help you, because you have to throw it so heavy &#8212; if you aim wrong initially you can&#8217;t do much about it.</p>
<p>Jenn Hanna is right, however. She should have drawn deeper with her last rock in an effort to sit two instead of guarding the out-turn side of the rings.</p>
<p>I think they call that the Bill Clinton shot&#8230;the in-turn past the guard (hoho, a little curling humor anyone?!?).</p>
<p>&#8211; adam</p>
<p>P.S. For all you Seattleites or others with access to CBC, they are showing the Men&#8217;s tournament (the Brier) this week, finals next weekend.</p>

		<p>Those in the know realize that curling has always been more exciting than hockey.  Even here in Canada.</p>

		<p>Funny thing that you mentioned curling. I, too was bit by the curling bug first in the &#8217;98 Olympics and then during the &#8217;02 Olympics. Unlucky thing that I live in Texas (native of WA). The only ice we have is in our drinks (and that doesn&#8217;t last long either).</p>

		<p>Regarding the shot being &quot;just a pool shot&quot;, remember it was made from about 86 feet away. All curling shots curl a bit, and although there was a little latitude on the angle, a little bit too high or low and Manitoba&#8217;s shot just skips off the Ontario stone and doesn&#8217;t move it far enough. The number of times you see this kind of shot made with the two stones separated by ~ 6 feet even in championship play is pretty low.</p>
<p>I miss the old corn brooms that were used in the past (loved that slapping sound as they hit the ice), but the quality of ice thanks to both the ice makers and brooms that don&#8217;t shed debris is better than ever nowadays. The level of play for the men is amazing; just one great shot after another.</p>

		<p>The Daily Show on Feb. 16 addressed this right at the beginning.</p>
<p>&quot;I watch more curling than I watched hockey.   Do not cancel curling.&quot;</p>
<p>They had a special report about bloggers too.</p>

		<p>If you live in the Seattle area and ever want to try curling out, there&#8217;s actually a curling club (filled with a ton of expats from Canada :). <a href="http://www.curlingseattle.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.curlingseattle.org</a>.</p>

		<p>While I won&#8217;t try to argue that curling is or isn&#8217;t exciting, I have to say that being more exciting than hockey this year isn&#8217;t saying much. Unless you&#8217;re able to watch Swedish Elite League games or are a fan of photographs of Trevor Linden looking disheveled outside of airport conference rooms there&#8217;s precious little hockey excitement for us North Americans this year.

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
