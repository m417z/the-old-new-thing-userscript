<p>The <code>WM_NOTIFY</code> message takes the following parameters:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>wParam</code> = identifier of the control sending the message </li>
<li><code>lParam</code> = pointer to a <code>NMHDR</code> structure     
<ul>
<li><code>hwndFrom</code> = handle of the control sending the message     </li>
<li><code>idFrom</code> = identifier of the control sending the message     </li>
<li><code>code</code> = notification code     </li>
<li>other fields depending on the notification code     </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> Notice that the identifier of the control sending the message appears in two places, once in the <code>wParam</code> and again in the <code>idFrom</code>. What's the difference? </p>
<p> There is no difference. It's just a convenience. The same value is passed in both places, and you can check whichever one is easier for you. You might use the <code>wParam</code> because it avoids having to dereference a pointer. You might use the <code>NMHDR</code> because that way you have only one thing to pass to your <code>On&shy;Notify</code> helper function. </p>
<p> Whatever floats your boat. </p>
<p> Passing the same information multiple ways is hardly new. The <code>WM_<wbr>COMMAND</wbr></code> message also passes redundant information: The control identifier is passed in the low word of the <code>wParam</code>, and you can also get it by calling <code>Get&shy;Dlg&shy;Ctrl&shy;ID</code> on the window handle passed in the <code>lParam</code>. </p>

		<p>Its mentioned in the comments to the WM_NOTIFY MSDN page, but the example given passes the hwnd of the control as wParam and not the ID.

		<p>I have a question about this.</p>
<p>The documentation for WM_NOTIFY has</p>
<p>&quot;The identifier of the common control sending the message. This identifier is not guaranteed to be unique. An application should use the hwndFrom or idFrom member of the NMHDR structure (passed as the lParam parameter) to identify the control.&quot;</p>
<p>for wParam.</p>
<p>To me, this implies that it is possible for wParam and lParam-&gt;idFrom to be different, this contradicts what you wrote in this post. Could you please clarify this?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>The documentation is saying, &quot;It is legal for two different windows to have the same ID, so the wParam may be ambiguous. If you have multiple windows with the same ID, you should use hwndFrom to distinguish them.&quot; I don&#39;t know why it&#39;s talking about idFrom, since that suffers from the same problem as wParam. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>I would suggest that you do one of two things:</p>
<p>(a) Fix your program so that it doesn&#39;t send broken messages, or</p>
<p>(b) Work out which other program is sending broken messages, and take appropriate action, possibly of a violent nature.</p>

		<p>[What if the two values in WM_COMMAND happen to be different? -Raymond]</p>
<p>Ummm&#8230; that&#39;s what *I* was asking? What do I do if I receive a message that says &quot;I came from window HANDLE#2718, and it reports that it, window HANDLE#9001, processed a character key&quot;? Do I just panic and call ExitProcess(), or pick one of those handles arbitrarily or something else?</p>

		<p>One could send these messages from their own code, and put inconsistent values in them, accidentally or intentionally. But then it&#39;s your own program that has to process these messages, and it&#39;s up to you how to proceed.</p>
<p>You can have two buttons with the same ID. HWND allows you to distinguish between them.</p>

<p>If you think you need send WM_COMMAND across processes, you want to seek therapy.</p>
<p>And for obvious reasons, you CANNOT send WM_NOTIFY across processes. See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/08/21/9877791.aspx">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/9877791.aspx</a>, if the reason is not obvious to you.</p>

		<p>Having something in 2 places (in this case, 2 vars in the API) always causes confusion:</p>
<p>* Should I check if they&#39;re really the same? What if not? Assert?</p>
<p>* Which one should I use?</p>
<p>* Why are there 2?</p>
<p>The best solution would be, of course, to write everything exactly once. Of course, now that the API is public, you can&#39;t break it.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
