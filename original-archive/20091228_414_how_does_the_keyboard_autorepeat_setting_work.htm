<p>Commenter eric johnson wonders <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#735946"> how that control panel keyboard autorepeat setting works</a>.</p>
<p> This is one of those questions that has many answers, depending on how deep you want to dig. </p>
<p> The first layer of the question is how the control panel changes the keyboard autorepeat rate. That's simple: It uses <code>SystemParametersInfo(SPI_SETKEYBOARDSPEED)</code>. From the documentation, you can see that the keyboard speed is an integer in the range 0..31, where 0 indicates 2 characters per second and 31 indicates approximately 30 characters per second. </p>
<p> The next layer of the question is why the <code>SystemParametersInfo</code> expresses the keyboard autorepeat setting in a 0..31 range, and why the upper end of the range is 30 characters per second. Well, the <code>SystemParametersInfo</code> function is merely passing the buck; that is the format that the Windows keyboard driver uses. </p>
<p> Okay, so why does the Windows keyboard driver use this representation for the keyboard speed? Because <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080822115611/http://www.computer-engineering.org/ps2keyboard/"> that's how the hardware keyboard autorepeat setting works</a>. Command 0xF3 sets the keyboard autorepeat, and it takes a single byte argument, of which the bottom five bits encode the autorepeat speed, ranging from 2 characters per second up to 30. (That document describes the PS/2 keyboard interface, but the PS/2 command interface was based on the AT interface, for which the typematic control commands were the same. The XT keyboard did not have a configurable autorepeat as far as I can tell. Note that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/09/18/9896621.aspx#9897076"> typematic was implemented in the hardware, not in the BIOS</a>.) </p>
<p> So at the end of the day, it all goes back to the 8042 keyboard controller chip. The hardware interface was reflected in the driver interface, which was reflected in the application interface. And when you issued the application call to change the keyboard autorepeat speed, that call went to the hardware; it was the hardware that actually did the autorepeating. </p>
<p> Since the semantics were codified in the application interface, they were locked into the <code>SystemParametersInfo</code> function even as the driver model and the keyboard hardware changed around it. (But I believe that if you're using a PS/2 keyboard, then the PS/2 keyboard driver will still defer the actual work of autorepeat to the physical hardware, so at least the semantics are still applicable.) </p>

		<p>That&#8217;s interesting, but how do the accessibility functions work then? By editing the keyboard accessibility registry options (HKCUControl PanelAccessibilityKeyboard Response), it&#8217;s possible to get a repeat rate up to ~60 CPM.</p>

<p>Judging by how various KVM switches behave, that sounds right. One brand flatly ignores the autorepeat setting from the computer and enforces its own. This means the computer setting does nothing, but behaviour is consistent across both attached computers (there&#8217;s a hotkey combination on the KVM to vary it). Another brand passes the autorepeat through unchanged and does not track it for each attached computer, which is annoying when the computers have different autorepeat settings (for added fun the second brand resets the PS/2 mouse when switching computer, and does not preserve mouse acceleration).</p>

		<p>Alexander: Space shuttle boosters, not fuel tank. &nbsp;The boosters are transported by rail &#8212; the fuel tank is barged in. &nbsp;The connection is tenuous at best. &nbsp;Snopes.com did a pretty good debunking/explanation.</p>
<p>Aside from IBM, the Bell System is the other common source of long-lasting standards. &nbsp;You&#8217;ll find a lot of telephone standards that have stuck around for compatibility reasons.</p>

<p>Yep, in fact electronically the PS/2 and AT keyboard interface was I think the same, so only a physical adapter was needed to convert between the two.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m using a Turbo-Plus PS/2 keyboard, where there&#8217;s a &quot;Turbo&quot; key, which with a combo Turbo+F1 sets the repeat-rate to 1Hz, and Turbo+F7 to 31Hz.</p>
<p>Low repeat-rates somehow delay the keypress detection a bit, though (70ms max, I have quick eyes). I&#8217;m not sure why.</p>

		<p>@Dinev: Your keyboard is just offering a keyboard-accessible way to change the typematic rate, and it appears it also controls the delay (since it&#8217;s PS/2, the hardware generates the repeat).</p>
<p>I believe the lowest setting is aroung 1-2 characters. and the highes is just over 30, which I guess your keyboard calls 1Hz and 31Hz, respectively. At the lowest settings it&#8217;s also probably using the 1 second delay, and at the highest, the .25 second. Both of which are controllable through the control panel&#8230;</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
