Some time ago, I noted that
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/08/20/10551502.aspx">
If you're looking for the code that displays a particular dialog box,
the most directly way to find it is to look for the dialog box</a>.
That works if you have a screen shot of the dialog box.
But what if you don't?</p>
<p>
A colleague of mine wanted to find the code that displays the
"Your password is going to expire soon" notification,
but he didn't know what string to look for.
It so happened that he asked me four hours too late,
because my password happened to have expired that morning,
but by the time he asked me for the text of the message,
I had already changed my password.
</p>
<p>
Think out of the box:
You know who probably has a screen shot of the "your password
is going to expire soon" notification?
<i>Somebody on the Internet</i>.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=windows+password+expiration">
A Web image search</a>
quickly turned up the exact text.

		<p>&quot;A Web image search quickly turned up the exact text.&quot; &#8211; Maybe that link worked when you wrote the article, but now, 4 of the 6 returned images are &quot;how to cancel your Apple subscription&quot;. 1 is for software to protect children while they use the internet, and the last is an image of a news article.</p>
<p>I think the search term is no longer specific enough.</p>

		<p>One little know feature of Windows:</p>
<p>On plain vanilla dialog boxes in recent versions of Windows, if you press &lt;ctrl&gt;+C while the dialog is displayed, the text of the dialog (including caption, buttons, everything) will be written to the clipboard as text. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t always work, but it often does (sometimes you will get an error &lt;beep&gt;, but you can just ignore that).</p>

		<p>@Brian: I didn&#39;t know that. Thanks a lot for the tip! Now I can write down those pesky 0x8&#8230; automation error codes without risking a typo. Now, that&#39;s a handy feature I should add to my custom MessageBox/MessageBoxEx substitute.</p>

		<p>Something feels off about the Bing results for that specific search term. &nbsp;Only 6 results. &nbsp;Also the suggested alternatives at the top weren&#39;t any better &#8212; with the one for XP returning nothing at all.</p>
<p>On the other hand, another leading search engine turns up piles of results with the one you want as the first result and the next dozen or so being pretty close.</p>

		<p>@Brian_EE: The search works fine for me. Are you sure you didn&#39;t click the wrong tab in your browser or something? It&#39;d be rather odd for Apple subscription screenshots to come up for &quot;windows password expiration&quot;.</p>

		<p>Actually if you click the link in Raymond&#39;s post, then you can still see some oddness. &nbsp;Near the top of the page for me there are suggestions for &quot;Windows 8 Password Expiration&quot; and &quot;XP Password Expiration Notification&quot; &nbsp;Both of those turn up unusual results (especially the Windows 8 one)</p>

		<p>That&#39;s interesting. The search link now has relevant results. At least I know it wasn&#39;t just me (SimonRev). Wish I had captured a screen shot.</p>
<p>According to browser history, the link now and earlier are the same.</p>
<p>Maybe the person who filters the results when you click search hadn&#39;t had their cup of coffee yet this morning. After all it was only 7am in Redmond.</p>
<p>@Max &#8211; Hard to click the wrong tab &#8211; only one open and clicking the link opened the search in the current tab.</p>

		<p>Of course, if Raymond had linked to the search engine which cannot be named, it would&#39;ve drawn attention in another way. Isn&#39;t it possible to create a politically correct hyperlink that would use the browser&#39;s default search provider? :)</p>

		<p>@Kevin: That was for launching the default search provider from OUTSIDE the browser, from something such as the command line, and doesn&#39;t really apply to invoking search from within HTML. The problem is that &quot;default search provider&quot; isn&#39;t something that exists in HTML or any other web standard &#8211; it&#39;s a proprietary feature implemented independently by every major browser developer, without any collaboration or information-sharing between them. Neither HTML nor Javascript has any concept of a &quot;default search provider&quot; or the ability to perform a &quot;default search&quot;, and browser makers have not cooperated to create a common programmatic interface for interacting with search from within the HTML document.</p>

		<p>Regardless of who the blogger&#39;s employer may be, I can&#39;t help but feel that linking to search engines other than Google is insulting the reader&#39;s intelligence.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
