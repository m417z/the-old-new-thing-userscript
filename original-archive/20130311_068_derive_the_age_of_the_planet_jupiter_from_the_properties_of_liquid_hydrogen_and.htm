<p>I dreamed that my homework assignment was to derive the age of the planet Jupiter. The professor hinted that physical properties of liquid hydrogen and the current Jupiter surface temperature would be useful.</p>
<p> <a href="https://facultystaff.richmond.edu/~ebunn/"> My classmate Ted</a>, on the other hand, had to extend a C++ base class to record a GUID name. </p>
<p> The two of us were taking a class together where we watched a reality show about two ditzy celebrities, and the professor said, "The next episode is so stupid, I don't even want anybody to watch it. But they do learn about Sirens of Greek mythology, so can you guys write up a quick one-pager to get everybody up to speed?" </p>
<p> That's how I ended up dreaming that Ted and I had to write a one-page overview of Greek Sirens. </p>

		<p>The answer obviously was 42, wasn&#39;t it? (I couldn&#39;t resist).</p>

		<p>@crescens2k: It&#39;s not nice to explain one&#39;s joke, but you are forcing me to explicit that the point was exactly that, today&#39;s anniversary. :-)</p>

<p>I&#39;m told that this doesn&#39;t work because the cooling that should be observed with Jupiter&#39;s net radiation excess was not observed. In other words, Jupiter is functioning as a low-power nuclear furnace.</p>

		<p>To dream that you are doing homework symbolizes the lessons that have learned or are learning. Pay attention to the assignment in your dream and figure out how it can be applied to your waking life.</p>

		<p>I wonder if Jupiter is getting the extra heat from fission of radioactives or some sort of catalyzed fusion reaction. I&#39;m sure I read somewhere that Jupiter&#39;s core pressure isn&#39;t enough for fusion as stars do it.</p>

		<p>But it might be enough for muon induced fusion. There&#39;s enough radioactive storm around Jupiter due to its magnetism to make that believable.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
