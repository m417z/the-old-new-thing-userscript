		<p>Brings up some interesting points about Microsoft culture. I was telling people for quite a while that Microsoft was reportedly a fantastic place to work . . . then they tried to hire me.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if it was just a problem with the guy who was headhunting me, or if it&#8217;s a problem with all of Microsoft, but he made it very clear that my opinions about what I wanted to do meant nothing to him. I&#8217;m a gamer, see &#8211; I want to make games. End of story. I told him this, and his response was &quot;Well, I don&#8217;t think games are very important, and so I&#8217;m going to suggest that you work for our research department.&quot;</p>
<p>Gee. Thanks for invalidating my entire life.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I&#8217;m not working at Microsoft, don&#8217;t plan to, and no longer tell people that Microsoft is a good place to work. Even a practically doubled paycheck (which is what they were offering me), plus all the non-inconsequential perks of working at MS over working at a 15-employee company in Bellevue, isn&#8217;t worth giving up my plans for the future.</p>
<p>So it goes.</p>

		<p>Yup, blue blazer and tie. I&#8217;ve since explored other colors, though.  Still wearing the hat, John?</p>
<p>Zorba: Whoever headhunted you was a dork. Sorry you got soured on the whole idea by that recruiter. (I wonder what the recruiter&#8217;s reaction was once they discovered that Microsoft has an entire division devoted to writing games&#8230;)</p>
<p>Gary: Not sure what you&#8217;re getting at. Do you want DOS stories?</p>

		<p>Last month or so, Raymond showed up in shorts to pop in while on vacation.  People actually came by to see because they&#8217;d heard rumors about it.</p>
<p>Gotta second the opinion on Zorba&#8217;s experience &#8211; someone&#8217;s an idiot.  It doesn&#8217;t make sense to tell someone that they can&#8217;t do what they love &#8211; people do better work when they love it.  You can&#8217;t just shoehorn people like that.  I honestly think you got a bad one, Zorba, but I hope you&#8217;ve got something good these days.  ;)</p>

		<p>I missed the Dress Like Raymond Day (AKA &quot;Make Raymond Wear Normal Clothes Day&quot;), but if I recall, you set it up as a charity fund raiser for your school, right?</p>
<p>The picture of Raymond in the blue suit in back of David C&#8217;s pickup truck covered in ice and Dom Perignon is a favorite.</p>

		<p>Apologies for bumping an old entry.</p>
<p>Did the DLRD occur or after before your success on the t-shirt competiton circuit?</p>
<p>One year, you had boasted on winning the MS &#8216;Most Unique T-Shirt&#8217; award (or was it the &#8216;Most Sexy T-Shirt&#8217;..) After reading Kraig&#8217;s account of your reputation, one must ponder the motivations of the judges.</p>
<p>&quot;Hey, Raymond made a special effort today.. Let&#8217;s give him a n-i-c-e reward to encourage him&#8230;&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
