<p>
There are two categories of "Access denied" errors.
One occurs when you attempt to create the handle,
and the other occurs when you attempt to use the handle.
</p>
<pre>
HANDLE hEvent = OpenEvent(SYNCHRONIZE, FALSE, TEXT("<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/10/01/10561544.aspx">MyEvent</a>"));
</pre>
<p>
If this call fails with <i>Access denied</i>,
then it means that you don't have access to the object
to the level you requested.
In the above example, it means that you don't
have <code>SYNCHRONIZE</code> access to the event.
</p>
<p>
A common reason for getting an <i>Access denied</i>
when trying to create a handle
is that you asked
for too much access.
For example, you might write
</p>
<pre>
<i>HKEY hkey;
LONG lError = RegOpenKeyEx(
    hkeyRoot, subkeyName, 0, KEY_ALL_ACCESS, &amp;hkey);
if (lError == ERROR_SUCCESS) {
 DWORD dwType;
 DWORD dwData;
 DWORD cbData = sizeof(dwData);
 lError = RegQueryValueEx(hkey, TEXT("ValueName"), nullptr,
                          &amp;dwType, &amp;dwData, &amp;cbData);
 if (lError == ERROR_SUCCESS &amp;&amp; dwType == REG_DWORD &amp;&amp;
     cbData == sizeof(dwData)) {
  .. do something with dwData ..
 }
 RegCloseKey(hkey);
}</i>
</pre>
<p>
The call to <code>Reg&shy;Open&shy;Key&shy;Ex</code> fails
with <i>Access denied</i>.
The proximate reason is that you don't have
<code>KEY_<wbr>ALL_<wbr>ACCESS</code> permission on the registry key,
which makes sense because <code>KEY_<wbr>ALL_<wbr>ACCESS</code>
asks for
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/02/27/7912126.aspx">
permission to do <i>everything imaginable</i> to the registry key</a>,
including crazy things like "Change the permissions of the key to deny
access to the rightful owner."
</p>
<p>
But why are you asking for full access to the key if all you're
going to do is read from it?
</p>
<pre>
HKEY hkey;
LONG lError = RegOpenKeyEx(
    hkeyRoot, subkeyName, 0, <font COLOR=blue>KEY_READ</font>, &amp;hkey);
if (lError == ERROR_SUCCESS) {
 DWORD dwType;
 DWORD dwData;
 DWORD cbData = sizeof(dwData);
 lError = RegQueryValueEx(hkey, TEXT("ValueName"), nullptr,
                          &amp;dwType, &amp;dwData, &amp;cbData);
 if (lError == ERROR_SUCCESS &amp;&amp; dwType == REG_DWORD &amp;&amp;
     cbData == sizeof(dwData)) {
  .. do something with dwData ..
 }
 RegCloseKey(hkey);
}
</pre>
<p>
If you want to go for bonus points,
ask for
<code>KEY_<wbr>QUERY_<wbr>VALUE</code> instead of
<code>KEY_<wbr>READ</code>,
since all you are going to do with the key is read a value.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=m><p>
When requesting access to an object,
it's best to ask for the minimum access required to get the
job done.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is like the old principle of mathematics:
After you've proved something,
try to weaken the hypothesis as much as possible
and strengthen the conclusions as much as possible.
In other words, once you've solved a problem,
figure out the absolute minimum requirements for your
solution to work,
and figure out the largest amount of information your
solution produces.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, if you get an
<i>Access denied</i> error when trying to <u>use</u> a handle,
then the problem is that you didn't open the handle
with <i>enough</i> access.
</p>
<pre>
<i>HKEY hkey;
LONG lError = RegOpenKeyEx(
    hkeyRoot, subkeyName, 0, KEY_READ, &amp;hkey);
if (lError == ERROR_SUCCESS) {
 DWORD dwData = 1;
 lError = RegSetValueEx(hkey, TEXT("ValueName"), nullptr,
             REG_DWORD, (const BYTE*>)&amp;dwData, sizeof(dwData));
 if (lError == ERROR_SUCCESS &amp;&amp; dwType == REG_DWORD &amp;&amp;
     cbData == sizeof(dwData)) {
  .. do something with dwData ..
 }
 RegCloseKey(hkey);
}</i>
</pre>
<p>
Here, the <code>Reg&shy;Open&shy;Key&shy;Ex</code>
succeeds, but the
<code>Reg&shy;Set&shy;Value&shy;Ex</code> fails.
That's because the registry key was opened for
<code>KEY_<wbr>READ</code> access,
but the
<code>Reg&shy;Set&shy;Value&shy;Ex</code> operation
requires
<code>KEY_<wbr>SET_<wbr>VALUE</code> access.
To fix this, you need to open the key with the
access you actually want:
</p>
<pre>
HKEY hkey;
LONG lError = RegOpenKeyEx(
    hkeyRoot, subkeyName, 0, <font COLOR=blue>KEY_SET_VALUE</font>, &amp;hkey);
if (lError == ERROR_SUCCESS) {
 DWORD dwData = 1;
 lError = RegSetValueEx(hkey, TEXT("ValueName"), nullptr,
             REG_DWORD, (const BYTE*>)&amp;dwData, sizeof(dwData));
 if (lError == ERROR_SUCCESS &amp;&amp; dwType == REG_DWORD &amp;&amp;
     cbData == sizeof(dwData)) {
  .. do something with dwData ..
 }
 RegCloseKey(hkey);
}
</pre>
<blockquote CLASS=m><p>
When requesting access to an object,
it's best to ask for the minimum access required to get the
job done, <u>but no less</u>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Armed with this information, you can solve this problem:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
In the main thread, we create an event like this:
</p>
<pre>
TheEvent = CreateEvent(NULL, TRUE, FALSE, name);
</pre>
<p>
A worker thread opens the event like this:
</p>
<pre>
EventHandle = OpenEvent(SYNCHRONIZE, FALSE, name);
</pre>
<p>
The <code>Open&shy;Event</code> succeeds,
but we try to use the handle, we get
<i>Access denied</i>:
</p>
<pre>
SetEvent(EventHandle);
</pre>
<p>
On the other hand, if the worker thread uses the
<code>Create&shy;Event</code> function to get the handle,
then the <code>Set&shy;Event</code> succeeds.
</p>
<p>
What are we doing wrong?
</p>

		<p>@Joshua Given that CreateEvent returns with EVENT_ALL_ACCESS wouldn&#39;t DuplicateHandle give your copy the same access rights? &nbsp;This would seem to violate the &quot;When requesting access to an object, it&#39;s best to ask for the minimum access required to get the job done&quot; rule. &nbsp;Curious and too lazy to look it up. &nbsp;:)</p>

		<p>And if you are lazy you can use MAXIMUM_ALLOWED. This is especially useful when supporting XP/2003 (PROCESS_QUERY_INFORMATION) and Vista+ (PROCESS_QUERY_LIMITED_INFORMATION), otherwise you would have to OpenProcess twice in some cases on NT6.</p>

		<p>One reason many people ask for too much at create time is because the second failure &#8211; to use &#8211; is often problematic. </p>
<p>It can happen only rarely on some unusual code path and not caught in normal testing</p>
<p>It requires modifying code possibly far away from the use point under development. </p>
<p>The whole thing seems to be insufficiently well designed. Why cannot rights be, if allowed, increased at use time?</p>
<p>That is if access X is denied at use time try to add the permission to the handle and only fail if that fails. </p>
<p>I know I could probably code such a wrapper myself but it seems like something that ought to be baked in. </p>

		<p>&gt;&gt;That is if access X is denied at use time try to add the permission to the handle and only fail if that fails.&lt;&lt;</p>
<p>You want to be able to open all files without specifying any restriction, and if you call FileRead() or FileWrite(), it should just happen (if the user of your application has this permission in theory)?</p>
<p>Beside other issues, this would delay permission checks to some random points in the code instead being performed at CreateFile.</p>
<p>If you want to be able to write to something, what is in the way for you to just open the handle with write permission?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Other problems: File locking. (If you could upgrade a handle, then that would invalidate prior file locking decisions.) Also, giving an intentionally low-access handle to another component. (E.g., a handle to an event you can wait on, but which you cannot signal.) The basic principle is that permissions are checked at the time the handle is created. This saves having to do permission checks at every operation. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Someone wrote: &quot;If you want to be able to write to something, what is in the way for you to just open the handle with write permission?&quot;</p>
<p>Please re-read my comment where I gave some examples why. The basic issue is that the code doing the use is often written at a different time from the code that creates and not even by the same person.</p>
<p>Raymond: I get the basic principle, the perf benefit it provides and that there are scenarios where having non-upgradable handle is deliberate. My point is that the most common scenario is made cumbersome by this. Whenever you write UseObjectX you need to find where the handle was created and validate that you have the permission (or deduce it in some other way). If you *remove* the UseObjectX line you ideally need to go and validate that the permissions you ask for are not an overkill now (nobody really does that of course).</p>
<p>It *would* be better design IMO where you had to explicitly do something for special scenarios you mention (e.g. mark the handle as non-upgradable at create time if you really want it to) while the most common way &quot;just works&quot;.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t a super big issue by any means but enough people get bitten by it as your blog post and my own experience suggest.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>The perf benefit is definitely non-negligible. Suppose you access a file or registry key that is remote. You get &quot;access denied&quot;. Now instead of propagating the result back to the caller, you try to upgrade the handle, which is another network round trip. Everything now takes twice as long. (Also, upgrading the handle will invalidate earlier security decisions made based on the previous handle access level.) And finally, making handles auto-upgrade means that the actual error condition is <span style="text-decoration:underline;">harder</span> to find. &quot;Most of the time, the upgrade succeeds, but occasionally, there is a sharing violation and the upgrade fails.&quot; Instead of catching the problem up front, it is detected only if the code path is exercised. Going back to the original problem: You should set up the &quot;give me a handle&quot; function so you tell it the access you want from that handle, instead of having that function guess what access you want and hoping for the best. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@Rozalinda Ramirez:</p>
<p>The security descriptor (ACL) is only checked when you open the object handle. If the ACL changes after that, it doesn&#39;t affect access through existing handles.</p>

<p>No, this is a non-issue. You have an object with some methods, all designed around the usual &quot;open&quot;, work and &quot;close&quot; principal (for example, logging to a file or reading some text file). The file access is only done by the very few methods of this object. it is not visible to anyone else, and there is absolutely no desire to read from a logfile or to write to your input file.</p>
<p>There is no &quot;often&quot; here.</p>

		<p>&gt;That is if access X is denied at use time try to add the permission to the handle and only fail if that fails. </p>
<p>Why stop there? &nbsp;We could get rid of opening files entirely. &nbsp;Just write to the file, and if necessary, all of the &#39;open&#39; nonsense happens for you.</p>
<p>In reality, one major reason for the existence of &#39;open&#39; is that so we can get the expensive stuff over and done with once. Where expensive stuff includes ACL checking.</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>On a more philosophical level, if I open for read access and then my program does a write, why should the system conclude that I *want* to write? &nbsp; Perhaps it&#39;s a bug, and if it is, I want to fail, not possibly corrupt data. &nbsp; </p>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
