<p>Mark Russinovich pointed out that <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/archive/2005/12/12/circumventing-group-policy-as-a-limited-user.aspx"> if you let users run arbitrary programs, they can circumvent policies</a>. This is actually not surprising, because policy is not the same as security.</p>
<p> Shell policies control how Explorer and other shell components behave, but that's just blocking the front door. For example, there is a shell policy to prevent the user from changing the wallpaper from the Desktop control panel. This disables the controls on the Desktop control panel for changing the wallpaper, but there are ways to change the wallpaper other than that. If users can run an arbitrary program, then they can run a program that calls <code>SystemParametersInfo(SPI_SETDESKWALLPAPER)</code> to change the wallpaper directly, bypassing the shell. The purpose of the shell policies is merely to make it more difficult for users to perform various categories of operations by removing them from the shell interface. But, of course, if the users are allowed to write their own program with its own user interface, then they can still access the underlying functionality. </p>
<p> Setting a policy to remove the user interface for a feature is like removing the staircase that leads to the second floor to keep people out. If you let them bring a ladder, then they can still get up there. </p>
<p> Mark Russinovich points out that policies are enforced at the application level, and since applications run as the user, the user can run a program that commandeers the application and patches out the code that checks the policy setting. </p>
<p> Shell policies are just for modifying the user interface. If you want to block an operation even from users who bypass the normal user interface, you have to block it at a level below the user interface. For example, you might revoke write permission to the relevant registry key; that way, even if the user manages to run their own code on the machine, they still can't change the underlying setting. </p>
<p> Every so often, somebody who doesn't understand the difference between shell policy and security submits a security vulnerability report to MSRC saying, "Check this out, I can set the policy to prevent the user from changing the desktop wallpaper via the shell, but through this clever technique of injecting code into Explorer and patching the binary in memory, I can change the desktop anyway!" Well yeah, but why go to all that effort? Just write a program that changes the desktop wallpaper already. </p>

		<p>In the case of desktop wallpaper, it doesn&#8217;t even matter if the key is read-only unless the wallpaper file itself is also read-only. Otherwise if you let me run Paint, I can always open the file I want as wallpaper and save it as whatever file the registry says is wallpaper.</p>
<p>Fortunately most things that policy protects are not files and don&#8217;t suffer from this additional point of failure.</p>

		<p>This is definitely an old new thing&#8230;</p>
<p>Years ago, IT at the tech support call center I worked in decided to disable registry editing in Windows 95 and pushed the policy to workstations that turned off registry editing. We all had copies of the Windows 95 Resource Kit, and within a week everyone had placed into their Startup folder a .REG file that undid the policy change.</p>

		<p>@consequence</p>
<p>Policies can prevent accidental changes.</p>
<p>i.E. your Corporate Policy is to have each computer match the CI. With policies, you can prevent users from making accidental changes.</p>
<p>Malicious users can still change their wallpaper, but in that case they did that maliciously.</p>

		<p>Windows have &#252;ber complicated security under the hood, but still throw in speed bumps like policies, UAC and privileges on top. I really don&#8217;t get it. If they made a simple security system that we could actually use, that&#8217;d be something. I often find systems &quot;protected&quot; by policies, while the underlying system is unprotected. Off course, its the sysadmins fault, but Windows made it real easy for them.</p>

		<p>you mention that there is an API function that does wallpaper changes for you. Why not enforce the policy within the API function as opposed to the application that calls the function? &nbsp;Would it still be the same problem? </p>

<p>Ohh&#8230; I can do that one&#8230; Just write a program that runs &quot;always at the back&quot; (ie behind the icons) that displays the custom wallpaper, just like Active Desktop used to do to display web pages and stuff.</p>
<p>Not being a win32 programmer, I don&#8217;t know the actual API and Google doesn&#8217;t show up anything easily, but I&#8217;m sure Raymond can tell us&#8230;</p>

		<p>osexpert: It&#8217;s one thing to say &quot;somebody should do this&quot;, but doing it is another matter. What sort of simple security system do you propose that would permit login scripts to run but not allow the user to get a command prompt?</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t even need to do that. The shell is just another program running as the user, and the desktop background is part of the shell. There&#8217;s nothing the shell can do that the user can&#8217;t do, so ultimately it&#8217;s a battle you can&#8217;t win.</p>

		<p>BTW, one should notice that permissions in HKCU are irrelevant. A user can change the permissions on ntuser.dat and usrclass.dat as well as their top directories to either</p>
<p>a) allow another user to modify them</p>
<p>b) to stop windows from loading them on next login</p>
<p>This way, a user can directly write into these files to change permissions, and then load the hive again.</p>

		<p>Gabe: its impossible with any security system. Only the check within cmd.exe can accomplish this. But this is not security! The user could use an alternate command shell or run a patched cmd.exe. This kind of security is pointless: if the user can run harmful commands via cmd.exe, the problem is someplace else.</p>
<p>Also, a simple security system wouldn&#8217;t make things possible that aren&#8217;t already, but chances are people would use it thus making the system more secure. Currently, you must be an expert to fully understand Windows security and even I struggle.</p>

		<p>On a terminal server, everything that prevents information disclosure (from mther users) and system failures is welcome. Unfortunately, it&#8217;s impossible to get it right. When the shell is locked down to an almost useless level, users complain. When other users hose the server, users complain. It might have to do with the idiot theory.</p>
<p>BTW, don&#8217;t forget memory quotas. It ain&#8217;t fun when you think everything has been fool-proofed only to discover a couple of sessions running paint can cripple a server, all they have to do is change the size to 99999&#215;99999 pixels.</p>

		<p>What&#8217;s the point of having shell policies, given that 1) they don&#8217;t really prevent anyone from doing anything, and 2) buried somewhere under all the Vista / XP cruft is a real security system that really *can* secure the machine?</p>

<p>My Uni disabled Internet Explorer&#8217;s New Menu and CTRL+N feature to make a new window&#8230;</p>
<p>Why oh why when you just had to shift-click a link?</p>
<p>Not to mention we had Visual Basic, Delphi, Turbo c++ and just about every other compiler you could think of installed so it make little difference anyway.</p>
<p>You have to wonder what&#8217;s going on in the minds of the people who set these things. Yes, they have their uses, in internet cafes where you dont want settings being changed &#8211; but not where a user has their own profile.</p>

<p>Congratulations. You&#8217;ve completely missed the point of that comment and this blog entry.</p>

		<p>The point of policies is a deterrent, nothing more. &nbsp;You can achieve a lot by preventing the idly curious from messing around with system settings, even if it&#8217;s just in terms of reducing the number of helpdesk calls.</p>

<p>No, I did not.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t confuse Group Policies with written Computer Usage policies and guidelines.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a technical issue.</p>

		<p>My favorite example of Microsoft Insecurity nonsense was the setting that let you limit the programs that could be run in Win 98 to those on a named list.</p>
<p>How did it check the program was on the list? It read the program&#8217;s name. So if you called NastyVirus.exe, Word.exe it would run fine. Not even shutting the front door; just painting a picture of one.</p>

		<p>&quot;It&#8217;s not a technical issue.&quot;</p>
<p>Except it is. A user shouldn&#8217;t be able to cause a system to hang or crash. The solution involves a policy but that doesn&#8217;t make it any less technical.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
