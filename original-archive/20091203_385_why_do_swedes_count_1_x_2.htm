<p> Occasionally, when an article in Swedish needs to count off three items, they are not labelled "1,&nbsp;2,&nbsp;3" but rather "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/crmnorway/archive/2006/10/26/s-blir-av-med-dina-datakvalitetsproblem-f-r-alltid.aspx">1,&nbsp;X,&nbsp;2</a>". Why is that? </p>
<p> I asked <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jesperh/"> Jesper Holmberg</a>, and he was kind enough to explain. (The entire exchange naturally was conducted in Swedish. Here's my translation.) </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> As with most of the good things in life, it has to do with football [soccer].  </p>
<p> In Sweden, it is not only legal to bet on horse races, football, and other stuff, but the Swedish government even has its own betting agency. "One, cross, or two" comes from the betting ticket, the slip of paper you fill in when you bet on football or hockey. The ticket consists of thirteen matches, and for each match you choose whether you think the home team will win (1), whether the visiting team will win (2), or whether you think it will be a draw (X). You can see an example of the ticket by going to <a href="http://www.svenskaspel.se/"> http://www.svenskaspel.se/</a> and clicking on "Stryktipset" in the upper left corner. </p>
<p> If you want, you can, in one or more matches, choose two options, if you, for example, think that the home team is going to either win or draw. This is called "half-covering" (halvgardera). You can even mark all three, which is then "full-covering" (helgardera). The odds of winning goes up, but also the cost of playing. (My grandfather and I would bet on football on the weekends when I was little; it took us hours to fill in the ticket, analyze statistics, discuss odds, the payouts... I don't think we ever won a dime.) </p>
<p> So this is how I interpret why that blogger you linked to chose 1X2 instead of 123: The point he's trying to make is that the answer is somewhat random, possibly even unknown. With 1X2, there's more of a sense of betting on circumstances one doesn't control, while 123 is more of a quiz where it's up to you to win or lose. I dunno, maybe I'm overanalyzing. Maybe he's just got a gambling addiction! </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I thanked Jesper for his explanation, noting that I had been wondering about this for many years. "Now it makes sense. No, I'm lying. It doesn't make sense, but at least it's less confusing. It was more like a joke targetting people who bet on football or hockey! On the other hand, it's probably impossible to find a Swede who doesn't bet on football or hockey..." </p>

		<p>It reminds me of the way some kids here in NZ play their hide and seek games. The traditional &#8216;count to 100&#8217; has a kiwi twist: &#8216;one, two, miss-a-few, ninety-nine, a hundred&#8217;.</p>

		<p>Israel too &#8211; it&#8217;s called &quot;Toto&quot; (×˜×•×˜×•). I&#8217;ve never actually gambled, but I do remember it from middle school math lessons where I calculated the odds. It was 14 matches then, and now it&#8217;s up to 16.</p>

		<p>I fear I must be missing something crucial &#8211; the options are &quot;the home team will win (1), the visiting team will win (2), or it will be a draw (X)&quot; and &quot;You can even mark all three, which is then &#8216;full-covering&#8217;&quot;.</p>
<p>This basically sounds like you&#8217;re betting on whether or not the match will be canceled? &nbsp;Because one would normally expect that either one team will win or the other will or they&#8217;ll tie&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Adam: I don&#8217;t gamble, but to my understanding, if you have a guess about twelve of the thirteen matches, you could buy three tickets, fill in the twelve matches identically in all of them, and then mark the match you&#8217;re uncertain about differently in each one. You pay for three tickets to play in &quot;guess 12 out of 13 mode&quot; instead of the regular &quot;13/13&quot;. Marking the three different possibilities on a single ticket is more user friendly, but then to file it you have to pay for three tickets (which makes it fair).</p>

		<p>Thanks for a great blog, we&#8217;ve been following it for a long time here at Svenska Spel!</p>
<p>You know there wasn&#8217;t always &quot;1, X, 2&quot;.</p>
<p>The &quot;stryk&quot; in &quot;stryktipset&quot; means strike (out), and that&#8217;s how it worked in the beginning, the player would strike out the name of the team he thought wouldn&#8217;t win.</p>
<p>Don&#8217;t know when they changed it, but it was a long time ago (the game has been running since 1934(!))</p>

		<p>&quot;it&#8217;s probably impossible to find a Swede who doesn&#8217;t bet on football or hockey&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve lived in Sweden my whole life, and I don&#8217;t think I know a single person who does this on a regular basis. The way I see it it&#8217;s mostly the realm of slightly overweight, working-class dudes way past their 40&#8217;s. Not that this doesn&#8217;t represent a significant part of the Swedish population, but I wouldn&#8217;t want to think of them as being representatives of swedes in general ;)</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think the blogger of the linked post is counting to 3 rather than enumerating 3 items. This means that 1,X,2 is not very different from A,B,C (would you say he is counting if he used A,B,C instead?)</p>
<p>Normally I would see 1,X,2 as two opposing ideas (1,2) and the middle, &quot;grey&quot; area between them (X). But I don&#8217;t think this is the case.</p>
<p>BTW, we also have the football (soccer) &quot;1,X,2&quot; lottery in Portugal, called &quot;Totobola&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
