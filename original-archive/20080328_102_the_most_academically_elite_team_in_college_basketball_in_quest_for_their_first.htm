<p><a href="http://www.quantumhoops.com/"> <i>Quantum Hoops</i></a> is a new documentary which follows the college basketball program at the <a href="http://www.caltech.edu/"> California Institute of Technology</a> through its 2007&ndash;2008 season. The school is regularly honored as one of the finest academic colleges in the United States. Their basketball team, on the other hand, is not as well-honored. It has won two conference games in the last 35&nbsp;years. Their last victory was 240 games ago.</p>
<p> The elite college basketball teams dream of winning the NCAA tournament, or at least winning their conference championship. Lesser teams dream of posting a winning record. These guys just want to win a game. <i>Just one game</i>. </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.onlyagame.org/index.php/2008/03/21/film-review-quantum-hoops/"> <i>Only a Game</i> reviews the film</a> and <a href="http://www.onlyagame.org/index.php/2008/03/21/college-hoops-heats-up-losing-at-cal-tech-and-the-blue-jays-taking-flight-32208/#jvflv6"> interviews the filmmaker</a>. I love the soaring soundtrack as former players recount one of their two "recent" victories, breaking a 99-game losing streak. That happened in 1979. "We won a game. A real game." </p>
<p> The film has a limited run in selected cities. In Seattle, it plays at the <a href="http://www.landmarktheatres.com/market/Seattle/MetroCinemas.htm"> <i>Metro Cinemas</i></a> March&nbsp;28 through April&nbsp;4. Don't spoil it for me. </p>

		<p>I was on a team in the grad school league there. &nbsp;We weren&#8217;t very good, but we liked to play. &nbsp;Some of the guys from the undergrad team got together and entered our league. &nbsp;We had heard about how long it had been since they won a game, and expected them to be pushovers. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t remember the score, but I don&#8217;t recall it being close; they beat us handily. &nbsp;They were actually pretty good players &#8211; much better than we expected.</p>

		<p>The SCIAC doesn&#8217;t appear to be up there with the PAC 10. But I do like the wrought-up poet on the Whittier College logo&#8211;not at all how I think of the author of &quot;When the Frost is on the Pumpkin&quot;&#8211;and sex-specific team names of a couple of the schools.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m looking forward to Quantum Hoops, if only to see the gymn again. &nbsp;I played a lot of basketball in there, and recall at least one of the film&#8217;s characters.</p>
<p>One of my heroes from those days won the Abel Prize yesterday, so I&#8217;m having a double dose of nostalgia.</p>

		<p>I played in the Interhouse leagues and the Grad League as an undergrad during the 70&#8217;s. &nbsp;We used to win more league games in those days. &nbsp;Why, we even went 3-3 in football in the &#8217;73 &#8211; &#8217;74 season. &nbsp; Three bonfires in one year! &nbsp;I guess they need more games against Life College&#8230;</p>

<p>Here is an intresting discussion about the crapness of Win32 and Dot net, I have to say, looking at the arguments i have to agree that somewhere in the near future you will have to clean up shop. Otherwise it will all fall down.</p>

		<p>I played on the team in the mid 90&#8217;s and we couldn&#8217;t even beat the Alumni teams back then&#8230;</p>
<p>I never could confirm this, but at the time, the coach was Gene Victor, who according to the rumor mill was one of the winningest Coaches in the NCAA before coming to Tech. Apparently he had to leave his previous job because the stress was too much and he had a bad heart. I don&#8217;t know if never winning was more or less stressful than his previous coaching positions though.</p>
<p>Regarding the Caltech football teams: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.bookstore.caltech.edu/CALTECH/shop_product_detail.asp?mscssid=28KAPND5WQWE8H3DMS7590XRJP1ECE3A&amp;catalog_group_id=MzNcXCAzOQ&amp;catalog_group_name=R2lmdHMgJiBNZXJjaGFuZGlzZVxcIENsb3RoaW5n&amp;catalog_id=235&amp;catalog_name=Q2FsdGVjaCBUZWVz&amp;pf_id=9HU8P9GRP3FM0134CMN1&amp;product_name=QmVhdmVyICBVbmRlZmVhdGVkIEZvb3RiYWxsIFQgU2hpcnQ&amp;type=1&amp;target=shop_product_list.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.bookstore.caltech.edu/CALTECH/shop_product_detail.asp?mscssid=28KAPND5WQWE8H3DMS7590XRJP1ECE3A&#038;catalog_group_id=MzNcXCAzOQ&#038;catalog_group_name=R2lmdHMgJiBNZXJjaGFuZGlzZVxcIENsb3RoaW5n&#038;catalog_id=235&#038;catalog_name=Q2FsdGVjaCBUZWVz&#038;pf_id=9HU8P9GRP3FM0134CMN1&#038;product_name=QmVhdmVyICBVbmRlZmVhdGVkIEZvb3RiYWxsIFQgU2hpcnQ&#038;type=1&#038;target=shop_product_list.asp</a></p>
<p>A bit of Caltech football trivia: Caltech has played more games at the Rose Bowl than any other team &#8212; it was their stadium in the WW2 era.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
