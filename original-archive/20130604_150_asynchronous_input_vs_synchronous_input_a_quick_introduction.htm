<p>One of the topics I covered at my PDC talk was <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Blogs/scobleizer/Raymond-Chen-PDC-05-Talk-Five-Things-Every-Win32-Programmer-Needs-to-Know"> the asynchronous input model</a>. I don't think I ever discussed it on this Web site, so I guess I'll do it now, so that I can point people at it in the future.</p>
<p> In the old days of 16-bit Windows, input was synchronous. All input went into a system-wide input queue, and the intuitive rule for input processing is that input messages are dispatched in chronological order. If the user clicked on one window, and then clicked on some other window, the first window must receive and process its click message before the second window will receive its own click message. </p>
<p> This model ensures that the user sees input being processed in the order it was generated, which is good. It also means that if an application stops processing input, it gums up the entire input system, which is bad. But since 16-bit Windows was co&ouml;peratively multi-tasked anyway, getting upset that a bad application could clog up the whole system by refusing to process input is missing the big picture: A bad application could clog up the whole system by simply refusing to release control of the CPU back to the operating system. </p>
<p> It's like getting upset that somebody with the keys to your house could mess up the order of books on your shelf. I mean, they have <i>the keys to your house</i>. If they wanted to make your life miserable, they would do much more than just screw with your book collection. </p>
<p> In Win32, the input queues were made asynchronous. As well as a system input queue, there is also an input queue for each thread. Hardware devices post events into the system input queue, but the messages doesn't stay in the system input queue for very long: A dedicated thread known as the <i>raw input thread</i> takes the events out of the system input queue and distributes them to the appropriate application input queues. (This distribution can't be done at the time the hardware devices post the event, because that happens asynchronously. In unix speak, the hardware devices post the events into the system input queue from the <i>bottom half</i>, and the raw input thread processes them from the <i>top half</i>.) </p>
<p> The advantage of this model is that one thread that stops processing input does not prevent other threads from processing input, because the input for the two threads has been separated and are not dependent on each other. (This property of asynchronous input has been called <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20130102205725/http://www.os2bbs.com/os2news/OS2Wishlist.html"> the Holy Grail</a>.) </p>
<p> More generally, input-related activities that were global in 16-bit Windows were made local in Win32. Each input queue has its own focus window, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/10/16/10456992.aspx"> its own active window</a>, its own caret, its own mouse cursor, and so on. </p>
<p> Things get weird when you have cross-thread input attachment, which can happen either when a parent/child or owner/owned relationship crosses a thread boundary, or by an explicit attachment created by the <code>Attach&shy;Thread&shy;Input</code> function. If cross-thread attachment is active, then all the threads which are attached to each other (which I call a <i>thread group</i>) share an input queue, and then the co&ouml;perative rules for input apply to that group of threads. It's like putting on your skinny tie and shoulder-padded jacket and inviting all your friends over to pretend that it's the 1980's all over again. </p>
<p> Anyway, that's just an introduction. We'll dig in deeper as the week progresses. </p>

		<p>I have attached thread input queues cross-process in order to get windows stacked on top of each other cross-process. It seems to me this is nicer then setting topmost. As to whether or not this action should attach thread queues I have no idea.</p>

		<p>@Joker_vD:</p>
<p>Not everyone knows that the second o in cooperative is not pronounced with the first. The dieresis is used to indicate that the vowels are pronounced separately.</p>
<p>But I guess as a native speaker of English, there are some things that you take for granted. Well, I always write it as co-operative.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m looking forward to more in this series.</p>
<p>Lately I&#39;ve been wondering why all sorts of normally well-behaved apps often show a blinking caret when they don&#39;t have the keyboard focus and often aren&#39;t even the active window. &nbsp;It happens far more frequently on Vista and Windows 7 than it did on Windows XP, so I assume it&#39;s a combination of not-quite-right app code and some subtle change in the input model on the newer versions of the OS. &nbsp;I&#39;d love to understand that better and to make sure my applications don&#39;t confuse the user in the same way.</p>

		<p>With all the complexities of queues, ordering, attaching queues across threads, sharing windows across processes, do you think that the model is self-consistent? Or are there inherently broken or undefined behaviors that can be triggered by calling the right APIs? Maybe ones that would destabilize the system (crash, create undestroyable windows, leaks, &#8230;).</p>

		<p>@Maurits: &nbsp;I think you&#39;re reading too much into Wiktionary. &nbsp;It says &quot;the dieresis is becoming increasingly rare in US English typography, so the spelling cooperate predominates&quot;. &nbsp;Just because something predominates doesn&#39;t mean that it is preferred. &nbsp;Heck, txt-spk might soon predominate.</p>

		<p>Also need to mention: kernel-user callbacks, locks, windows classes and window-associated state, GDI (which seems to be integrated into user32 internally), direct x drawing to window handles, the DWM, messaging windows, hooks, sessions, window stations and desktops, UIPI. What crazy behaviors and bugs can we trigger by combining all of those pairwise? :)</p>

		<p>@xor88:</p>
<p>It is more like User and GDI have some cross dependencies. But User has more dependencies on GDI (an example, BeginPaint, it is a User function, but requires a HDC, which is a GDI structure.)</p>
<p>User and GDI are part of the Win32 Subsystem, so they are implemented in the same location. Up until NT 3.51, they were implemented in csrss.exe afair, and from NT4 they were both moved to Win32k.sys.</p>

		<p>@640K</p>
<p>Are you thinking of Multilingual User Interface or NLS? If so, you have it backwards, the locale is a system/session setting which affects the UI. There is no real cross dependencies between Kernel and User or GDI. The only little hiccup that I can think of is that DuplicateHandle can duplicate desktop handles, but that is about it.</p>
<p>@Joshua:</p>
<p>User should be responsible for allocating its own heap memory, so any fixes to Kernel would have no effect on your problem.</p>

		<p>@Adrian, @alegr1: My understanding is that the classic caret API doesn&#39;t interoperate well with the newer drawing systems, such as Windows Presentation Foundation, Direct2D or DirectWrite. WPF has its own CaretElement; I don&#39;t think DirectWrite implements one at all. Visual Studio has been a WPF app since VS2010; Internet Explorer uses DirectWrite rather than GDI from version 9. Office 2013 is now a DirectWrite app and the caret behaviour is reported as being quite strange, often not keeping up with typing even if you have the &#39;smooth caret positioning&#39; option turned off (can&#39;t remember exactly what it&#39;s called).</p>
<p>I do find that often, when entering text on web pages in IE9 or later, the caret either doesn&#39;t appear, doesn&#39;t blink, or doesn&#39;t move correctly. This might be more to do with the &#39;enhanced&#39; edit controls that are often used by web designers, rather than just using a standard multiline input control.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know whether Windows Runtime has more sensible/compatible caret behaviour.</p>

		<p>@Mike Dimmick: &nbsp;Thanks for the insight. &nbsp;I didn&#39;t realize that all the new-fangled drawing schemes re-invented the caret on their own. &nbsp;But I&#39;ve even seen good ol&#39; Notepad blinking a caret when it doesn&#39;t have the focus. &nbsp;Surely Notepad hasn&#39;t been corrupted?!</p>

Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
