<p>In Windows&nbsp;2000, Explorer let you add properties like Summary and Author to nearly any file type. But when you view the files from a machine running Windows&nbsp;XP or later, those properties are lost. Where did they go?</p>
<p> Most file types do not have extensibility points for adding metadata. For example, every byte of a plain text files is devoted to text data; there is nowhere to put metadata like Author or Summary. In Windows&nbsp;2000, the shell chose to store this extra information in NTFS alternate data streams (or more accurately, the shell chose to use the <code>STGFMT_FILE</code> storage format, which is <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa379964.aspx"> implemented in terms of NTFS alternate data streams</a>.) Storing the information in alternate data streams attaches the data to the file without affecting the file contents. </p>
<p> This was a clever idea, taking advantage of NTFS's ability to attach arbitrary data to a file, but it also had a serious problem: Alternate streams are not preserved by simple and common operations like sending the file by email, copying the file to a (FAT-formatted) USB thumb drive, uploading or downloading the file from a Web site, or burning the file to a CD. Basically, once the file leaves the comfortable confines of your local hard drive, there's a good chance that the metadata will be destroyed. </p>
<p> To avoid this problem, Windows&nbsp;XP switched to storing the metadata in the file contents itself. Doing this, however, requires support from the file format. Each file type can have registered for it a property handler which describes how to read and write properties for a file. (Windows itself comes with a few such handlers, such as for JPEG images and MP3 files, with more recent versions of Windows supporting more properties.) If no such property handler is registered, the shell will use structured storage, provided the file format is compatible with structured storage. </p>
<p> The data you added in Windows&nbsp;2000 are still there. It's just that newer versions of Windows don't bother looking for them. (If you were sufficiently resourceful, you could write a program which opens the file in <code>STGFMT_FILE</code> mode, reads the properties, then <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/benkaras/archive/2007/01/05/choosing-your-property-api.aspx"> reopens the file via the shell namespace</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/benkaras/archive/2006/11/21/writing-properties-9-summary.aspx"> writes the properties back out</a>.) </p>
<p> For lots of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/benkaras/archive/2007/01/09/code-for-previous-blog-posts.aspx"> programming goodness</a> about the shell property system, check out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/benkaras/"> Ben Karas's blog</a>, which I have been liberally linking to. </p>

		<p>File metadata sounds like such a nice feature in theory. In practice, however, it is simply not practical. Many protocols and software products are simply not designed to keep this data intact when moving files from place to place.</p>

		<p>Property handlers were introduced in Windows Vista, not XP. You have to install WDS 4 on XP to get property handlers and still Explorer doesn&#39;t really benefit from them. Just replace &quot;XP&quot; with Vista and the article won&#39;t be full of inaccuracies. Also, the approach Vista/7 take is better (storing metadata within the file) but Microsoft does a very poor job of supporting others&#39; formats. They should ship property handlers for as many formats as possible. Because no one writes property handlers for some formats which actually support storing XMP or other metadata tags, the user is left without the ability to tag any of his non-text based formats in Vista/7. Hopefully, Windows 8 will correct this abomination. It&#39;s been 5 years since Vista arrived but there are only a few property handlers for some obscure formats like FLAC. We need property handlers *AT LEAST* for AVI (store them in RIFF chunks), MP4, MKV/MKA, MOV, PNG, PDF, GIF, JPEG 2000. Out of the box, Windows currently only supports JPG, TIFF, MP3, HDP/WDP, WMA and WMV.</p>

		<p>When I heard about ADS doesn&#39;t work on other filesystems, I always think that would it be a good idea that: When Windows has to copy a file that have ADS attached to other places which doesn&#39;t have the support, Windows can copy the ADS as hidden file in names like filename.stream1.ADS if the target supports long filename. Sure the file view can become obscure to some users if &quot;view hidden file&quot; is enabled, it could help in some case&#8230; possibly even in email (which would require email client support to make attachment&#39;s ID follows certain rule for easy discovery)</p>

		<p>The Property System APIs may have been introduced in Vista, but the underlying functionality was present in XP. &nbsp;Well before the release of Vista, I remember right-clicking on a JPEG, adding a caption, then trying to figure out how it was stored. &nbsp;Naturally, I did what Raymond Chen hates and wrote my own EXIF header parser, which displayed and edited the tags created by XP.</p>
<p>I&#39;m a Mac OS user these days, but credit where it&#39;s due: Preview.app will display a load of information about exposure times, DPI and suchlike, but won&#39;t show &#8211; let alone edit &#8211; any of the standard JPEG caption tags. &nbsp;iPhoto is even worse, storing captions in its own files where no other application can see them. &nbsp;So, Mac OS / iLife still haven&#39;t caught up with XP when it comes to JPEG captions. &nbsp;They&#39;re ahead on PDF management, but I don&#39;t think that&#39;s Microsoft&#39;s fault. &nbsp;Given the legal trouble you had with PDF export from Office 2007, I assume making a Windows native PDF viewer would be treated with hostility.</p>
<p>On the JPEG side, it would have helped if other photo albums had made use of these tags (and the Property System APIs, when they became available), instead of kludging up proprietary caption storage. &nbsp;When the Microsoft Research time machine comes back from the shop, someone needs to send copies of this blog post to every digital camera manufacturer in 2002. &nbsp;It&#39;s doubly annoying when the music player world did this properly: Windows Media Player, iTunes and a plethora of other applications use the same MP3 header tags, to everyone&#39;s benefit.</p>

		<p>@Stefan Kanthak, wrong again I&#39;m afraid. WIC is available for XPSP2 as a backported downloadable component but built-in only beginning with XPSP3.</p>
<p>@10 HGR 2, Yes somewhat. Microsoft called them &quot;metadata handlers&quot;. The ability to edit metadata of some file types is there in XP such as JPEG (only EXIF metadata). Office also installs its metadata handler for formats which are not OLE compound documents (DOCX, XLSX). But that&#39;s about it. WMP may have it this ability via Advanced Tag Editor but not the shell. Other document formats require property system APIs introduced with Vista and later and it can store metadata in XMP format.</p>
<p>Also XP still has the Summary tab on NTFS volumes for any file type whereas the article says it doesn&#39;t give access to that metadata. The Summary tab was removed in Vista with no consideration for backward compatibility with existing tagged files using ADS, especially when developers aren&#39;t writing ANY property handlers at all for Vista/7. Another issue is MS have made the property system very difficult to debug.</p>

<p>JFTR: the version of the original WIC DLLs for Windows XP and 2003 is 6.0.6000.16385, their timestamp 2006-11-01.</p>
<p>You can stop trolling now!</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
