<p>After a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/04/19/578992.aspx"> Seattle Symphony concert</a>, it has long been a tradition among my friends to walk the three blocks from Benaroya Hall, up University Street, past <a href="http://www.lulyyang.com/"> Luly Yang Couture</a> to gawk at the jaw-dropping gowns in the window (the pictures on the web site fail to capture their fabulousness), arriving at the <a href="http://www.starwoodhotels.com/whotels/property/overview/index.html?propertyID=1154">W Hotel</a>, home of <a href="http://www.earthocean.net/"> Earth &amp; Ocean</a>, where we would settle ourselves in for a post-concert dessert. The desserts themselves were exquisite, thanks to the inspiration of Seattle's "diva of desserts", <a href="http://www.seattledining.com/Current/coco_la_ti_da_by_sue_mccown.htm"> Sue McCown</a>.</p>
<p> Or at least, that was our routine until this season. </p>
<p> <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/food/274914_chef22.html"> Sue McCown left Earth &amp; Ocean during the summer</a> to open her own restaurant, and when we went to Earth &amp; Ocean after a September concert, we could tell that the magic touch was gone. We waited anxiously for Sue's new restaurant <a href="http://www.cocolatida.com/"> Coco la ti da</a> to open, which it did last week. (We so adore her desserts that we feel like we're on a first-name basis with her.) </p>
<p> It was the new restaurant's opening weekend and the place was so packed that a few of us had to spend some time squeezed two in one chair. Even though it's hardly walking distance from Benaroya Hall, the drive was well worth it. Here's the power Sue McCown has over us: When the waiter came to take our orders, one of my friends who has very high standards for food quality (and those who know this circle of friends will immediately recognize who it is I'm talking about) said, "I'll have one of everything on this page." </p>
<p> (Now, mind you, there were seven tiny desserts on the page, and a typical order would have been for two to four of them. Therefore, ordering all seven was not too absurd, especially since they were shared with the rest of the table. But the story just sounds better when you say, "X&nbsp;ordered everything on page seven!") </p>

<p>Re: stalkeresque stuff, yeah, I sometimes wonder about such things with my livejournal. I also tend to post about trips after I get back instead of saying &quot;Hey internet, no one is going to be home this weekend, drop on by&#8230;!&quot;</p>

		<p>earth &amp; ocean is losing status as my favorite restaurant and i am sad that my favorite dessert place (the generic abstract notion) is no longer in walking distance of benaroya or the seattle public library.</p>
<p>however, i immensely cheered that sue is still is town, that i&#8217;m not deprived of luscious desserts (at least, not when i&#8217;m in seattle), so yay for entrepreneurial endeavors! &nbsp;and kudos for anyone willing to take on the risks of being in the restaurant business.</p>

		<p>Their eponymous cake tasted a bit too much like an Almond Joy, but I&#8217;m looking forward to trying the other menu items. &nbsp;Thanks for the review.</p>

		<p>Thanks for the post &#8211; I&#8217;ve been waiting for that place to open. &nbsp;Also fabulous for dessert and also (sort of) on Cap Hill is Lark, just south of Madison on 12th. &nbsp;Really great desserts there (and really great food, too).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
