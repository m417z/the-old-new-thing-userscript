<p> Some time ago, there was a mechanical problem with the heating/cooling system in our part of the building, and one of the senior managers in our group took the opportunity to tell a story of a one-on-one <a href="http://www.wilymanager.com/skip-level-meeting/"> skip-level meeting</a> he had with Steve Sinofsky. </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p> I'm sitting there in my office with Steve, and there was something wrong with the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HVAC"> HVAC</a>, because as the meeting progresses, it gets warmer and warmer, and eventually I'm sitting there sweating profusely, not exactly making the best impression on our group president. Steve, on the other hand, appears to be completely unaffected. It's sweltering in my office, but he's cool as a cucumber. </p>
<p> It can't be more than five minutes after the meeting is over before a team of technicians swarms into my office to figure out why the heating system has gone berzerk. </p>
<p> Steve must've whipped out his phone as soon as he left, called the Facilities desk, and said "Dude, there's something seriously wrong with the heating system over in room 1234. It's like an oven in there. You need to check it out." And since the request came from a corporate president, it got dispatched with high priority. </p>

		<p>Makes you wonder how many levels are between Raymond&#39;s manager and his group president, as Raymond certainly is a senior software architect or something. Can you count that number on one hand?</p>

		<p>Not having served in a branch of the military, I cannot verify the story, but presumably drill instructors would wear long underwear on sweltering hot days so their charges would think they never broke a sweat. &nbsp;Maybe Sinofsky did something similar. &nbsp;Or maybe it was nanotech &#8212; who knows? </p>

		<p>It lets me wonder: Since this is one-on-one meeting, if the room is that hot, why wouldn&#39;t he just change to another room? A corporate president should be able to get a spare room quickly. Have a meeting in a sweating-hot room doesn&#39;t sound productive at all to me.</p>

		<p>I suppose Sinofsky&#39;s office was too far away for something like &quot;Hey, you wanna continue in my office while send for a team to check out the AC?&quot; Or maybe they needed something from this manager&#39;s office?</p>

		<p>Note that at any point as the temperature was rising it would have been fine had the subordinate got up and objected to the temperature of the room. Just like many of the Sinofsky underlings could have raised more questions during the win8 cycle. I was there, many people knew the crummy tablet and the crummy app platform were going to fail hard. But few could say very openly that the emporer had no clothes. Meanwhile there is very little honor in sitting in an overheated room.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t know about Microsoft&#39;s campus, but maybe there are a few conference room on each building, like those for individual team briefing?</p>
<p>It seems very useful to me for having conference room of 4 people&#39;s size with projector.</p>

<p>As someone who grew up in a warm, often humid, area, one of the tricks you learn is that cotton underclothing will keep you cooler especially when soaked in water or sweat. For the same reason, you should never wear cotton during outdoor activities in cold weather climates (such as where I live now) unless you enjoy hypothermia.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
