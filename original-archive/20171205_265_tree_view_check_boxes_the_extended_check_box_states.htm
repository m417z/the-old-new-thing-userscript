Version 6 of the common controls in Windows Vista introduced
some new check-box-related extended styles for the tree
view controls.
Unfortunately,
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb759981(v=vs.85).aspx">
the documentation for them</a>
is kind of spare.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<dl>
<dt>
    <code>TVS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>PARTIAL&shy;CHECK&shy;BOXES</code>
</dt>
<dd>
    Include partial checkbox state if the control has the
    <code>TVS_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code> style.
</dd>
<dt>
    <code>TVS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>DIMMED&shy;CHECK&shy;BOXES</code>
</dt>
<dd>
    Include dimmed checkbox state if the control has the
    <code>TVS_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code> style.
</dd>
<dt>
    <code>TVS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>EXCLUSION&shy;CHECK&shy;BOXES</code>
</dt>
<dd>
    Include exclusion checkbox state if the control has the
    <code>TVS_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code> style.
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
Yeah, that doesn't really explain anything.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, more information about what these check box states
are for can be found in
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd378458(v=vs.85).aspx">
the documentation for the <code>NSTCSTYLE</code> enumeration</a>.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<dl>
<dt>
    <code>NSTCS_</code><code>PARTIAL&shy;CHECK&shy;BOXES</code>
</dt>
<dd>
    Adds a checkbox icon on the leftmost side of a given item
    with a square in the center,
    that indicates that the node is partially selected.
    Maps to the
    <code>TVS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>PARTIAL&shy;CHECK&shy;BOXES</code>
    tree view control style.
</dd>
<dt>
    <code>NSTCS_</code><code>DIMMED&shy;CHECK&shy;BOXES</code>
</dt>
<dd>
    Adds a checkbox icon on the leftmost side of a given item
    that contains an icon of a dimmed check mark,
    that indicates that a node is selected because its parent
    is selected.
    Maps to the
    <code>TVS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>DIMMED&shy;CHECK&shy;BOXES</code>
    tree view control style.
</dd>
<dt>
    <code>NSTCS_</code><code>EXCLUSION&shy;CHECK&shy;BOXES</code>
</dt>
<dd>
    Adds a checkbox icon on the leftmost side of a given item
    that contains a red <b>X</b>,
    which indicates that the item is excluded from the current
    selection.
    Without this exclusion icon, selection of a parent item
    includes selection of its child items.
    Maps to the
    <code>TVS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>EXCLUSION&shy;CHECK&shy;BOXES</code>
    tree view control style.
</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
Okay, so that explains what the intended purposes of these
new styles are.
</p>
<p>
Of course,
when you use those state images, you can use them to mean
whatever you like.
Though for consistency with the rest of Windows,
you probably want to use them to mean what Windows uses them
to mean,
just like you should probably use the checked state to mean,
y'know, that the thing is selected.
</p>
<p>
Don't forget that these are tree view extended styles,
not window manager extended styles,
so you set them by using the
<code>TVM_</code><code>SET&shy;EXTENDED&shy;STYLE</code>
message or the corresponding
<code>Tree&shy;View_</code><code>Set&shy;Extended&shy;Style</code> macro.
</p>
<p>
The documentation for these extended styles says that
they must be combined with <code>TVS_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code>,
but that is not true; these extended styles imply
<code>TVS_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code>;
you don't need to set
<code>TVS_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code>.
In fact, it's worse than that.
If you set
<code>TVS_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code>
first,
and then set the extended styles second,
you won't get the extended styles at all.
That's because of the rules we spelled out last time:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<ul>
<li>
    Turn on the check boxes,
    either by setting the
    <code>TVS_</code><code>CHECK&shy;BOXES</code> style
    (if all you want is unchecked and checked)
    or setting one or more of
    the <code>TVS_</code><code>EX_</code><code>XXX&shy;CHECK&shy;BOXES</code>
    styles
    (if you want other states, too).
</li>
<li>
    Do not touch any of the checkbox-related styles any more.
    You get one chance, and that's it.
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>
Okay, so that's really a documentation error, not a quirk.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, let's take these new extended styles for a spin.
Save the scratch program we've been using up until now,
because we're going to be reusing functions from it.
Grab a new
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20030723-00/?p=43073">
scratch program</a>
and make these changes:
</p>
<pre>
<font COLOR=blue>#pragma comment(linker,"\"/manifestdependency:type='win32' \
name='Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls' version='6.0.0.0' \
processorArchitecture='*' publicKeyToken='6595b64144ccf1df' language='*'\"")</font>

BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
  <font COLOR=darkgreen>// Copy this from the old program.
    g_hwndChild = CreateWindow(WC_TREEVIEW,
    nullptr,
    TVS_HASBUTTONS | TVS_HASLINES | TVS_LINESATROOT |
    WS_CHILD | WS_VISIBLE,
    CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT,
    CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT,
    hwnd, nullptr, g_hinst, 0);</font>

  <font COLOR=blue>// New code
  DWORD desiredStyles = TVS_EX_PARTIALCHECKBOXES |
                        TVS_EX_DIMMEDCHECKBOXES  |
                        TVS_EX_EXCLUSIONCHECKBOXES;

  TreeView_SetExtendedStyle(g_hwndChild,
        desiredStyles, desiredStyles);</font>

  <font COLOR=darkgreen>// Copy this from the old program
  PopulateTreeView(g_hwndChild);</font>

  return TRUE;
}

void
OnDestroy(HWND hwnd)
{
  <font COLOR=darkgreen>// Copy this from the old program
  ImageList_Destroy(TreeView_SetImageList(
    g_hwndChild, nullptr, TVSIL_STATE));</font>
  PostQuitMessage(0);
}
</pre>
<p>
The new image list states are added in the order above:
Partial, then dimmed, then exclusion.
If you omit one of the states, then the others move up to close
the gap.
For example,
if you ask for partial and exclusion (but not dimmed),
then the images are
unchecked (1), checked (2), partial (3), and exclusion (4).</p>

		<p>There is LOTS of documentation that&#8217;s very much like what&#8217;s in the first box above.  All over the place, and not just from Microsoft.</p>
<p>Doc that defines &#8220;set frobish=True&#8221; by explaining that it sets frobish to True.  And not telling you what frobish is.  </p>
<p>All doc that shows how to Set something should also show how to Query that same thing.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know, sometimes the examples given on the documentation are not that helpful either.</p>
<p>Either code that show you how to set something in and immediately retrieving back but without explanation on &#8220;something&#8221;, or just with example on broken link. (Say, the documentation of WTSEnumerateSessions() tell you to find example on KB article, <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/291789" rel="nofollow">https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/kb/291789</a> but it&#8217;s no longer there. I don&#8217;t know KB articles can go away given much of KB in DOS days are still accessible)</p>

		<p>I also miss a few KB articles, and not all of them can be recovered from the Internet Archive.</p>
<p>So I save web pages I&#8217;d like to keep as postscript files using the MS Publisher Imagesetter printer driver on FILE:, and then batch-create tiny and compatible PDFs using Ghostscript. That&#8217;s also why IE is still my favorite web browser, as it has the most decent printing options.</p>

		<p>Actually, it&#8217;d be really great if somebody put together an index of Raymond&#8217;s posts. List the series that he&#8217;s done, pick some &#8220;best-of&#8221; and &#8220;people new to Raymond should definitely read&#8221; posts, and just generally organize some of the decade-and-a-half of content here.</p>
<p>I find it unlikely that I&#8217;d have the time to do so myself, but if somebody&#8217;s bored out there, I think it&#8217;d be useful and nifty, even though I think I&#8217;ve read almost all of the posts at this point.</p>

		<p>There are some inconsistencies compared to drawing yourself:</p>
<p>The image type do not match the other checkboxes used in this series.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t need to handle WM_NOTIFY for the state image to change (mouse and space).</p>
<p>The return value of TVN_KEYDOWN is ignored, you need to handle NM_TVSTATEIMAGECHANGING to block changes from the keyboard. (Both NM_TVSTATEIMAGECHANGING and TVN_KEYDOWN are documented to ignore this return value)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
