<p>I dreamed that I was part of the crew of an underwater spaceship, and we had to deal with an alligator that got on board. How the alligator got on board was never explained, but now is not the time to ask questions because, you know, alligator.</p>
<p> The plan was to flood the ship and wash the alligator out. There were only enough air pills for the female crew members. The men would have to hold their breath and hope for the best, with the expectation that not all would make it. But before we could execute the plan, the door caved in and the ship began to fill with water. </p>
<p> At this point, I transferred to another dream in which I discussed cookbook organization techniques with a friend of mine. "Do you organize alphabetically by title? By main ingredient? By frequency of use?" </p>
<p> None of the cookbooks had any alligator recipes. </p>

		<p>Did your second dream actually include searching the cookbooks for alligator recipes, or are you just making an assumption?</p>

		<p>Frankly, I&#39;m less interested in the alligator than the fact that it was an underwater spaceship. How does that work, exactly?</p>

		<p>Star Trek: Voyager had a water planet, and I believe that they had a shuttlecraft that went in; would that be a underwater spaceship?</p>
<p>Personally, my cookbooks/reference materials are organized by topic, then frequency of use. That being said, the ones that I use are never actually on the bookshelf.</p>

		<p>@ErikF: Well said. A book is only be put on bookshelf when you think you won&#39;t need it in a while. Otherwise it usually ends up on the book pile on the desk, probably buried days later.</p>

		<p>AFAIK alligator tastes like chicken to some or like fish to others. Taste the alligator, see what it takes for you and then all the fish / chicken recipes can then use alligator instead.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a Futurama episode where the crews ship ends up beneath water, and somebody asks about the pressure the ship can withstand.</p>
<p>The answer being somewhere between zero atmospheres and one.</p>

		<p>Did the dream ever explain how an underwater spaceship was materially different from a submarine, or was it just described as an &quot;underwater spaceship&quot; in your dream and you didn&#39;t question it because it was a dream?</p>

		<p>Star Trek Into Darkness has a scene where the Enterprise is under water. &nbsp;That makes it&#8211;at least at that moment&#8211;an underwater spaceship.</p>
<p>(hopefully nobody will get upset about the trivial spoiler. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t give away any plot points.)</p>

		<p>Both space and ocean are rather unknown, good sources for fiction and imagination.</p>
<p>Jules Verne wrote &quot;From the Earth to the Moon&quot; and &quot;Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea&quot; almost sequentially.</p>
<p>X-COM: UFO Defense is &quot;invaders from outer space&quot;, X-COM: Terror from the Deep is &quot;invaders from under water&quot;.</p>

		<p>I haven&#39;t tasted alligator meat before, but have tasted quite some crocodile meat instead. In the view of Chinese medicine, soup containing crocodile meat is good for curing Asthma.</p>

		<p>Thinking about it, underwater spaceships seem surprisingly common in sci-fi considering how silly it seems (as the Futurama line points out, of all structures, a spaceship is surely one of the *least* suited for underwater use!) Having said that, NASA do use a giant swimming pool for astronaut training (using buoyancy to simulate microgravity), and of course their early space capsules splashed-down on the ocean&#8230;</p>
<p>I don&#39;t really have enough cook books to think about organising them as such, but I&#39;d probably group by type first: Thai, Chinese, Indian, etc &#8211; it makes more sense to me than title or author in general.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
