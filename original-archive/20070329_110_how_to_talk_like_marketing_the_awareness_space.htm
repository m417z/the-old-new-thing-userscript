		<p>Interestingly enough (as a coincidence at least from my perspective), on Tuesday during my Introduction to Marketing class at university we learned about some key aspects of targeting customers for new products, and &quot;Awareness&quot; is the first step in the &#8216;social adoption of innovation&#8217; process&#8230; So the phrase probably made PERFECT sense to the person, and probably was intended to bring along with it a whole range of other positive connotations.</p>
<p>I guess the failure in communications therefore came from the director forgetting that while &#8216;basic principles&#8217; might indeed be extremely basic and easy to understand, if no one has ever taught them to you, they still don&#8217;t make any sense. It&#8217;d be like talking to a non-programmer about loops and functions and interrupts; it&#8217;s all basic to us, but to the outsider, not quite so much!</p>
<p>Still, isn&#8217;t that what communications directors are supposed to think about? ;)</p>
<p>(and, in the end, I suppose that&#8217;s probably the point you were making in the first place, making this entire comment somewhat redundant)</p>

		<p>the awareness space is actually the blanket that is covering discoverability, &nbsp;I thought everyone knew that by osmosificationalism</p>

		<p>Back when I worked on a helpdesk, some of the dumbest support calls I ever got were from IT directors. You would expect an IT director of a large company to know how to turn on the laptop, log ni and read email&#8230; but no.</p>

		<p>From what I remember in the entrepreneurial computer science course at university, selling things is a process of 4 things: AIDA, where</p>
<p>A stands for Awareness</p>
<p>I stands for Interest</p>
<p>D stands for Decision</p>
<p>A stands for Action</p>
<p>This is part of what is called the &quot;sales funnel&quot;, look it up. From what I remember, this is something every salesman should know.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
