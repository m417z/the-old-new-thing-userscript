<p>Another episode in the sporadic series on the wisdom of seventh graders: The topic this time is "What do you want to be when you grow up?" The students really enjoyed this topic because, as one young man put it, "I could write a book about myself!" Here are what some students had to say. Spelling mistakes are intact, but ellipses are editorial. (I have provided tooltips to assist non-native English speakers. Actually, even native English speakers may have trouble with some of the spelling errors...)</p>
<ul>
<li>The best job in the world would be a dog consultant. </li>
<li>I also watch the history channel     because you can never know too much about history. </li>
<li>My talent would be having good     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="slang: charisma, luck">     mojo</span>. </li>
<li>In science I am achieving an easy     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="the highest mark">     A</span>, and hardly     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="trying very hard">     giving it my all</span>. </li>
<li>I like to blow up stuff. </li>
<li><span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="Counseling">Couciling</span>     teens is a low stress job, and you get paid a lot of money. </li>
<li>I am very interested in rockets and their     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="propulsion">purpltion</span>     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="systems">sistims</span>. </li>
<li>Also my dad does not believe I will be able to become a dentist     so my goal is to prove him wrong and become a dentist. </li>
<li>I want to be a     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title='architecture (should be "architect")'>arcetecture</span>. </li>
<li>Theories can turn into     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title='"facts", but "farts" changes the meaning'>     farts</span>     by proving it. </li>
<li>I've been called short and weird,     but no one has ever called me chicken.     In fact, if I were a chicken every chicken would call me     "<span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="chicken noise">backa</span>" or     "<span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="chicken noise">cluck-chirp</span>". </li>
<li>(From a male student)     Also another reason good pay is important is because     if I get married and have kids... I want to buy them nice things.     For example, a wedding ring, dress, food... an alarm system... </li>
<li>There is no better job     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="than">then</span>     getting paid to argue. </li>
<li>(About being a doctor)     You get to help them by saving their life     or getting a lego out of their throat and are rewarded with joy.         </li>
<li>I would slide down the helicopter ropes and     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="slang: barge in">     bust in</span>     to save the day. </li>
<li>Creating is creativity. </li>
<li>There is     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title='"no", but "now" changes the meaning'>     now</span>     whining or crying in 5th grade. </li>
<li>I have     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title='grammar: should be "gone"'>     went</span> to every     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="Husky, the local college team">     Huskie</span> home game in the past 5 years. </li>
<li>I wanted to be a writer, but writing this paper makes me think I shouldn't. </li>
<li>I will understand that no matter the child,     the punishment will fit the crime.  No student will be left behind. </li>
<li>I have the natural ability to become frustrated. </li>
<li>I will have a sufficient retirement if I don't go bankrupt. </li>
<li>(About being an architect)     Make everything extremely simple...     architects have to deal with the     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="puny">     puenie</span> minded construction worker around them. </li>
<li>My ways of teaching will make life and school a lot easier,     I will clearly write my name on the whiteboard,     in purple ink and I will have a neon green poster board     with the rules written on it. </li>
</ul>
<p> Bonus misspellings:     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="emotional">     omocinal</span>,     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="nurture">     nurcher</span>,     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="passion">     pation</span>,     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="masseuse">     mussuse</span>. </p>
<p> (And I thought I didn't have to say this, but apparently I do: These are just the funny-bad sentences. There were of course plenty of well-written essays, but they're not as funny.) </p>
<p> Bonus explanation: In <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/12/06/500514.aspx"> the previous series of essays on humanity's greatest invention or discovery</a>, one of the responses was "marrying a princess". I had to ask my friend for an explanation of that one. "Well, one student decided to ignore the assigned topic and instead wrote a fairy tale about a beautiful princess who gets married." </p>

		<p>I would have figured that the &amp;lt;abbr&amp;gt; and &amp;lt;acronym&amp;gt; tags would have worked fine for your purposes.</p>

		<p>Well, except nothing in there is an acronym, so an acronym tag would not have been appropriate. &nbsp;And abbr wouldn&#8217;t have been exactly correct, either (these aren&#8217;t short versions of other words or phrases, they&#8217;re misspelled versions of other words). &nbsp;;-)</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not aware of a tag meaning &quot;this is incorrect usage&quot;, though, so I&#8217;d say span is actually most appropriate. &nbsp;(Perhaps the &lt;strike&gt; tag, but that&#8217;s deprecated; you&#8217;re supposed to use CSS for that now.)</p>

		<p>English just rips off other languages for bits and pieces. The spelling rules are an absolute horror&#8230; I assume everyone&#8217;s heard of the &quot;ghoti&quot; spelling for &quot;fish&quot;?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sort of lucky in that I seem to have a built-in proofreader for whatever wacky reason. I can look at a page, poster, website, piece of marketing material, etc and any misspellings jump out in bold type.</p>
<p>It made me very unpopular with an English Lit friend for a while. &quot;It took me 30 seconds to find all the errors, and YOU&#8217;RE the Lit major!&quot; :)</p>

		<p>Good god&#8230; a non-technical discussion and people have to start criticising the HTML tags used? Is your life that bereft? Take the article for what it was, a bit of light relief. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Some day you may realise that the world does not revolve around computers and coding.</p>
<p>Keep up the good work Raymond.<br />
<br />(I apologise Raymond if this post goes against the ToC for this site, but those kind of comments p!$% me off)</p>

		<p>i love the thought of kids.<br />
<br />so pure.</p>
<p>wonder how many adults still hold their child dream and working on it.</p>
<p>or just simply get a job to earn a living.</p>
<p>should life be so pathetic like that? lol</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
