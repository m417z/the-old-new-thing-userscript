		<p>Ref: Unquoted service paths. &#8220;Only administrators can create these files.&#8221; Wait what? On my newly installed Windows 10 I discovered I have write permission to C:\ without UAC elevation. I directly tested this from an unprivileged command prompt so it&#8217;s not explorer elevating behind my back.</p>

		<p>&#8220;This configuration error becomes a security issue only if additional misconfiguration of file system permissions allows non-admins to create files in locations that should be protected. In Windows XP and newer, non-admins can create subdirectories in the root directory of the system drive (typically &#8220;C:\&#8221;) but they cannot create files there. Permissions are set that way specifically to prevent this type of attack.&#8221; If you can create files in the root, then somebody messed up the security permissions after Windows was installed.</p>

		<p>An unelevated non-admin can still move a file to the root of the system drive. I.e. what windows tries to prevent as default is totally useless, only an inconvenience, not any protection at all. As usual.</p>

		<p>I have taken the time to test it in Windows XP SP3, Windows 7 SP1 and Windows 10 RTM. In all of them, you can create a directory in the root of the system drive from a non-admin (&#8220;unelevated&#8221;) account, but when you try to create a file, you get an access denied error.</p>
<p>I second Raymond. You (or somebody else) must have messed with the file system permissions. Maybe you are using one of those modified &#8220;all-in-one-with-drivers&#8221; Windows setup disks, which do more harm than benefit, because they also change setup settings to match the creator&#8217;s tastes and opinions &#8211; settings that Microsoft has established after extensive user, security and compatibility testing. As a software developer, I have found those unofficial install disks to be the root cause of many setup and compatibility problems for my applications.</p>

		<p>In the asymptotic autoshape complexity paper, it seems like the axis labels for Figure 1 must be reversed in order to reach the same conclusions as the authors.  As plotted, it seems that the DFA approach is extraordinarily effective, with only a few dozen autoshapes needed to solve problems larger than the data capacity of the Internet.</p>

		<p>To me, the Ctrl-X, Ctrl-C, Ctrl-V harks back to WordStar (except they were Ctrl-K+X, Ctrl-K+C, Ctrl-K+V respectively).  Also the Turbo Pascal editor used the WordStar editing commands in most cases.  Plenty of legacy experience out there by the time Windows became mainstream.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
