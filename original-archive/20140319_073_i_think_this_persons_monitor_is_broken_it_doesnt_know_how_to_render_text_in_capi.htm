		<p>Could just be the default font in their email reader, and not the monitor.</p>
<p>Actually, setting one&#39;s default reading font to one that sets the kerning between adjacent capital letters such that they all overlap and just make one big blob may be a clever ideaâ€¦</p>

		<p>I haven&#39;t used a terminal for years. Every monitor I&#39;ve used in the last ~20 odd years has just faithfully put pixels where the graphics controller/card has told it to. So I think it&#39;s their graphics card that&#39;s broken, not the monitor. :-)</p>

		<p>1) All caps text is hard to read and annoying. That&#39;s why lower-case has been invented in the first place. Try reading a book in all caps without losing track. (Apparently the devs of everybody&#39;s favorite IDE didn&#39;t realize that, but that surely backfired)</p>
<p>2) Let Darwin do his work and let him have all the data loss in the world. He got warned, it&#39;s his problem.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s a good idea to disable the 456 before they start taking our children. I think killing 2 is a small price to pay.</p>

		<p>Thus we learn the importance of burying the information by placing the warning before and after (and optimally intertwined).</p>
<p>(And caps were rendered just fine.)</p>
<p>What the was sent:</p>
<p>&quot;The extra 3 is there because of the 456 feature. BUT DO NOT DISABLE THE 456 FEATURE JUST BECAUSE YOU DON&#39;T LIKE 3. The 456 feature is important, because it ensures that 2 runs to completion. Otherwise, you risk data loss.&quot;</p>

		<p>The proper answer were &quot;The 2 can not be finished properly without doing 3.&quot; </p>
<p>Don&#39;t mention the feature 456 in this scenario, unless they say that they don&#39;t care for completion of 2 and ask how to break it. </p>

		<p>I am not going to assume that the customer indeed disabled 456 just because he said so. In all the probability, he just wrote that back to make a point that he does not take orders from you.</p>
<p>Microsoft engineers in Michael Crichton&#39;s novels are overbearing duds that deserve being stand up to or even abused. I&#39;m not saying you should read too much into a work of fiction, but I am also not saying no body does!</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
