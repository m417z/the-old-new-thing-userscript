<p>
Some time ago, I told the story of
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160906-00/?p=94255">
how we used psychology to get
people to stop using a leaked build and
upgrade to a newer build</a>.
People had suggestsions for other ways this could have been done.
</p>
<p>
One suggestion to avoid the problem in the first place
was to have internal builds refuse to activate from an IP address
that is not assigned ot Microsoft.
This would stop people from installing and activating a build,
but of course you can use a build without activating it,
and by resetting the activation timer,
you can extend the lifetime of an unactivated system to quite
a few months.
That's quite a few months of potentially messing up the Internet.
</p>
<p>
So you might say that internal builds should simply refuse to run
unless activated.
That would prevent these systems from getting off the ground.
Unfortunately, it would also prevent our
software development partners
from installing and activating the builds.
Hardware partners wouldn't be able to develop new drivers for the
upcoming version of Windows to take advantage of whatever
new features are being added.
Software partners wouldn't be able to send the Windows team feedback
on a proposed new feature,
and they wouldn't be able to have an updated version of their software 
ready to go on release day.
</p>
<p>
Another suggestion was to have Windows perform an online check
at startup to determine whether the build has been declared
"fatally broken",
and if so, refuse to boot or at least time-limit the build so
the user can upgrade to a non-broken version before time runs out.
</p>
<p>
Well, first of all,
that solution would have to be applied retroactively.
Somebody ahead of time would have to convince management to
devote engineering effort (as well as dedicate
bandwidth in our servicing stack) to handle the case that
a build at some point in the future needs to be blocked.
Seeing as nothing this horrific has happened before
in the thirty years of Windows, it might be a hard sell.
</p>
<p>
Besides, even if such a feature were implemented,
you could imagine the PR disaster if it were discovered
or deployed:
"ZOMG Windows has a remote kill switch!"
</p>
<p>
And then there were the suggestions to do something
that Microsoft was already doing.
</p>
<p>"<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160906-00/?p=94255#comment-1264135">Maybe
it's the time</a>
to put up somewhere a disclaimer that
a build not intended to be public is more likely to corrupt the system,
malfunction or not even boot,
and it's better to wait for a proper build from Microsoft to the public."
</p>
<p>
Yup, that's what Microsoft does.
You see that statement
any time somebody asks for a comment about a leaked build.
It goes roughly,
"We don't recommend installing unofficial builds because
who knows what's in them."
</p>
<p>
Another superfluous suggestion was to
<a HREF="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12437999">
include a warning in all pre-release builds</a>
saying that, you know, it's a pre-release build
and anything can happen.
</p>
<p>
Yup,
that warning already exists for pre-release builds.
But the warning has been around for so long that
people have gotten inured to it and don't
pay it much heed.
It has sort of become the boy who cried wolf:
Every single pre-release build comes with this warning,
and every single pre-release build manages not to destroy
your computer.
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12438851">
Another suggestion</a>
was to announce that the build
contains a potentially fatal flaw that could cripple your
computer and disrupt any networks it is connected to.
"We don't care how you acquired this build.
We simply do not want you bricking your computer."
</p>
<p>
People would probably say,
"Wow, Microsoft is really worried about this build.
There must be some secret feature in that build that they don't want
us looking for,
and they're using this lame excuse to get us to stop using that build.
Hey everybody, make sure you keep your ISOs
because there's gold hiding in there somewhere!"
</p>
<p>
And they'd be right, too.
Because the feature that had the fatal flaw
was not yet publically announced.
If you're installing leaked builds,
it's because you're the sort of person who wants to
get at non-public information,
and unannounced features are the
best kind of non-public information.
This is basically an announcement that says,
"Hey everybody,
I strongly recommend that you crawl through every single
option dialog you can find,
because buried somewhere is going to be a new checkbox
that reveals an unannounced feature.
Happy hunting!"
</p>
<p>
The Windows team ultimately
decided to solve the underlying problem of people
itching for builds in
a different way:
Make the internal builds public,
via the
Windows Insiders Program.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
Ultimately, most of the proposals
ended up just over-engineering the solution.
If you can solve a problem in ten minutes with psychology,
what's the point of spending hundreds of hours trying
to solve it with technology?</p>

		<p>Yep, the Windows Insiders builds are pretty cool.  I have seen some things that don&#8217;t work quite right, but I knew that could happen, and the problem is not fatal, just cosmetic.  I only run an Insider build on one of my five computers.</p>

		<p>I mean, I wouldn&#8217;t have commented on the psychology approach, but now I feel like I have to engineer a solution&#8230; On boot (or maybe on screen unlock), require someone type in constantly changing text, forcing them to read and type something:</p>
<p>This is a pre-release build and may be broken. To continue type &#8216;prerelease-{random 16 characters}&#8217;:<br />

		<p>[what&#8217;s the point of spending hundreds of hours trying to solve it with technology?]<br />
Maybe someone would get a nice bonus because of that? [/j]</p>
<p>Btw, if I were really assigned to solve this problem with technology, I&#8217;d simply make the internal builds can&#8217;t live without a debug symbol server on local subnet. You know, for nearly all the intended purpose of internal builds, you want to work with debug symbols. And for those who have it, I think it could be safely assume they understand the consequence to use leaked internal builds for daily use.</p>
<p>After that, just make the ver.exe on these machines show the current and latest available build numbers is good enough.</p>

		<p>That would mean that internal builds &#8220;phone home&#8221; (look for a debug server), which is bad PR. It would also prevent internal builds from being used outside of the Microsoft corporate network, which means (1) developer partners couldn&#8217;t use them even though we want them to, and (2) we wouldn&#8217;t be able to test domain controllers and other things which need to run on an isolated network.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s why I say &#8220;debug symbol server **on local subnet**&#8221;. In that case it&#8217;s much like KMS. When that is acceptable, I can&#8217;t see why it is not.</p>
<p>And btw, I&#8217;m not stopping them to use &#8220;localhost&#8221; as debug symbol server if that&#8217;s applicable.</p>

		<p>Okay I now understand what is missing here&#8230; a debug symbol server relay much like WSUS to the public Windows Update server.</p>

		<p>Now think about it a bit, it sounds like something with (dubious) value to have such debug symbol server integrated with PXE boot server so they download the selected internal build images along with corresponding debug symbols. When need to test something on latest build, just use the UEFI boot option menu to select PXE boot then install a newer build of Windows. ( <a href="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2008.07.desktopfiles.aspx" rel="nofollow">https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/2008.07.desktopfiles.aspx</a> ) Sounds convenient enough to worth all the trouble to install such server to me.</p>

		<p>I disagree that symbols are needed.  One purpose of the Windows Insider program for Windows 10, as far as I can tell, is to let people who understand that they are using prerelease software, to look at the early iterations of new features.  It &#8216;s not always (or only) for debugging.</p>

		<p>Compare and contrast &#8220;leaked builds&#8221; and &#8220;public previews&#8221;.</p>
<p>&#8220;Public previews&#8221; are intentionally released to public for the said testing purpose and it&#8217;s intended audience are general users. In the other hand. &#8220;leaked builds&#8221; are nightly builds or builds sent to vendors for driver/application development. The purpose is different. Even testers for QA will want debug symbols in order to generate more meaningful dumps.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
