Some time ago, I explained
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/02/25/10595729.aspx">
why the mouse cursor jumps a few pixels if you click on the
very bottom row of pixels on the taskbar</a>.
Commenter ender noted that
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/02/25/10595729.aspx#10596520">
a similar jump occurs
if you right-click the Start button</a>.
What's up with that?
</p>
<p>
This is not an issue with Fitts's Law,
because you already hit the target successfully.
The purpose of the little mouse jump is to put the mouse
into the menu.
I guess the idea is that the people who designed that menu
wanted to enable the mouse shortcut of
right-click followed by left-click.
When your taskbar is positioned at the bottom of the screen,
this means that a right-click followed by left-click
invokes the bottom menu item,
which is
<a HREF="http://winaero.com/comment.php?comment.news.30">
normally</a> <i>Desktop</i>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
The <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> menu was a secret feature,
which isn't quite the same as a
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/09/12/10348441.aspx">
rogue feature</a>.
The feature was reviewed and approved,
but it wasn't something that was advertised.
It was a bonus thing for power users.
Allowing the <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>X</kbd> menu to be customized
was also intentional,
and it's a tricky balancing act to come up with a design that lets
the menu be customized by the end user without making it too easy
for applications to customize it as part of their installation.
(There were a lot of designs that had to be abandoned.
For example, we couldn't
incorporate the user's SID in the hash due to
the possibility that
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/11/28/10576639.aspx">
the user's SID changes</a>.)</p>

		<p>There were a lot of changes to the context menus in Win8+.<br />
But why are the Jump Lists always above the taskbar buttons and not directly where I right click?<br />
It&#8217;s very stupid to always check how far you have to move your mouse.</p>

		<p>That doesn&#8217;t make the positioning more useful. I don&#8217;t care if it&#8217;s a new window, a flyout or whatever. I just want to use it and when I always have to check the distance I have to move then it&#8217;s not a good idea how it is.<br />
That&#8217;s the reason why I disabled Jump lists and use classic menus.</p>

		<p>Try using jump menus from a touch screen and they make all the sense in the world. Or from the keyboard. Even with the mouse, I&#8217;m happier with the consistent position clicking on a fixed item than based on where I click (think left-clicking on the top-left of a window, that&#8217;s a fixed menu that&#8217;s based on what you clicked and not where you clicked).</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s pretty cool. I never noticed the mouse move when right-clicking. Unfortunately for me, my taskbar is on the side of the screen so the cursor just moves to nothing clickable.</p>
<p>I know I&#8217;m already at the edgiest of edge cases by moving my taskbar (what is it, like 1% of Windows users?), but I&#8217;m gonne file feedback in the feedback app.</p>

		<p>This jump pre-dates the right-click menu though (Windows 2000/XP in classic theme) had to move the cursor up/over this amount in order to hit the target because the Start button didn&#8217;t extend to the edge, but it only did it on left click (right-clicking the extreme corner would give you to taskbar&#8217;s context menu, not the start button&#8217;s).  Windows 7 removed this jump completely, then Windows 8+ put it back.  So definitely intentional and not a hold over.</p>
<p>Bonus: double-right-click still invokes the last menu item.</p>

		<p>Actually, the code to jump the cursor was always there. It&#8217;s just that Windows 7&#8217;s Start button stole the click from the taskbar, so the taskbar cursor-warp code never got a chance to kick in.</p>

		<p>Interestingly enough right click behaves as primary click on some of those menus (something I never thought to try) doesn&#8217;t seem to be standard behavior though (for example in Skype for Business right click on a misspelled word you must still primary click).</p>

		<p>[When your taskbar is positioned at the bottom of the screen, this means that a right-click followed by left-click invokes the bottom menu item, which is  normally Desktop. ]<br />
For people like me who prefers to place the taskbar at the side it&#8217;ll make me jump on &#8220;Program and features&#8221; though.</p>
<p>With wide screen, putting the taskbar on the side helps to make your normal screen area closer to &#8220;square&#8221; than putting it at the top or bottom.</p>

		<p>Never noticed this until now.</p>
<p>Windows 10 also embed a digital signature on explorer.exe, starting with shell32.dll in Windows 8. Why&#8217;s that?</p>
<p>It prevents customization of the icons and image resources present in them. I really wished you all moved all the Windows image and icon resources to a single place, it&#8217;s really too unorganized now.</p>

		<p>I would respectfully disagree with this statement: considering that Explorer is the default shell for all accounts, altering explorer.exe is essentially the equivalent to introducing a security hole. If you can change resource data in the file, what&#8217;s to prevent code alterations as well?</p>
<p>It may be a nice idea to allow for resource modification of the shell, but changing system executables seems like the wrong way of doing it (it also is a global solution to what is probably a local problem.)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
