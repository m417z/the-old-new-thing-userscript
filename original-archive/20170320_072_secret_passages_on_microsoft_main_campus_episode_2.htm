<p>
As with
<a HREf="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20101005-00/?p=12623">
most "secret passages" on campus</a>,
they aren't actually secret,
but they are handy and not well known.
</p>
<p>
If you are trying to walk to the Building 43 cafeteria
from the southwest,
the usual route is to take the unnamed service road
that runs between Building 43 and the highway,
then
<a HREF="https://binged.it/2jngksi">
go up the gravel emergency driveway</a>
that runs between buildings 43 and 44.
</p>
<p>
The secret way to get to the cafeteria is to enter
the Building 43 parking garage
<a HREF="https://binged.it/2jnhkMW">
via the small loading dock</a> that sits
opposite the pedestrian crossing.
</p>
<p>
Go up the stairs, and then turn left.
</p>
<p>
Look both ways before crossing the main driveway,
and then continue through a tall, narrow passageway
to another driveway.
</p>
<p>
Follow the second driveway, past the loud ventilation fans,
and then you will see ahead and slightly to the right of you
a wall painted purple with the message "Stairs to&hellip;"
Follow that wall.
(If you forget to turn, then you will continue through a second
tall, narrow passageway to the large loading dock.)
</p>
<p>
After you turn the corner, you will see that the rest of
the message reads "&hellip; Cafeteria."
Follow the path down the slight ramp and use your cardkey to
unlock the door at the end of the path.
</p>
<p>
When you go through that door, you will find yourself in the
cafeteria,
via a door that you probably didn't even know existed.
(And the message on the purple wall is a lie:
There are no stairs.)
</p>
<p>
This shaves a bit of distance off the outdoor route,
but a major benefit is that this version is inside the
parking garage,
so even though it may not be indoors,
at least it's covered,
so you don't have to deal with the rain,
and it's not quite as cold.</p>

		<p>Last I was on campus (2010?), the food in building 43&#8217;s cafeteria was identical to the food in all the other cafeterias.  Maybe things have changed.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not that Cafeteria 43&#8217;s food is any better than the others. But it&#8217;s the closest cafeteria to my building.</p>

		<p>In one of the place that I worked, there were only two passenger lifts for the whole building. Since we worked in the middle floors, it&#8217;s not uncommon to have to wait 15+ minutes until you can finally rush yourself into one of the lifts.</p>
<p>However, if you&#8217;re willing to wait for 15 minutes before going to lunch, you can go to the cargo area and take a ride with the goods via the cargo lifts. (The cargo lifts needs a key inside to run, normal staffs don&#8217;t have it. The goods were scheduled to load to the vehicles about the same time every workday) So you save 10+ minutes to surf the web everyday instead of waste time waiting in the lobby, plus you don&#8217;t need to rush in the lift because the cargo lift is usually loaded only half full)</p>

		<p>I find that if a building has N floors (where N &gt; 10 or so) and I&#8217;m roughly on floor N/2, and it&#8217;s busy  (ie check-out time at a hotel), then it&#8217;s a lot faster to hit the &#8220;up&#8221; button, ride the lift up and then ride it back down, than it is to hit the down button and keep being hit with already-full lifts.  You occasionally get a puzzled expression from the person at the highest floor wondering why you&#8217;re not hopping out but they quickly realise the method in the madness when they, and the 10-15 other people in the lift, make it impossible for people on floors 2, 3, 4, etc to go down to the ground floor.</p>
<p>No such trick is available to help if you&#8217;re on the ground floor and wanting to go up, although at peak time for leaving (again, hotel check-out time) that&#8217;s not such a big issue.</p>
<p>If I ever make it to the Microsoft campus one day (can you just visit and wander around the buildings?) I&#8217;ll definitely try this route just for kicks :D</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s well known that if you are on a top floor trying to go down, elevator cabs are being trucked in at the basement, only go up, and are removed from the roof by helicopters.</p>
<p>If you are on the first floor, cabs are being flown in to the roof by helicopters, only go down, and are trucked out at the basement.</p>

		<p>Yup. This applies to MTR at peak hours as well.</p>
<p>If you want to travel from &#8220;Island&#8221; line to &#8220;Tsuen Wan&#8221; line, you get off at &#8220;Admiralty&#8221; station, but instead of take the train at the opposite platform to &#8220;Tsuen Wan&#8221;, you go upstair to platform &#8220;Tsuen Wan&#8221; line towards &#8220;Central&#8221;, go to Central terminus and then travels back.</p>

		<p>Do you get to stay in the same train or do they make you get off? Either way, I guess you get on when the train&#8217;s pretty empty.</p>

		<p>Stay at the same train, or it loses the purpose of intentionally travels backwards. :P</p>
<p>And no, the train is not quite empty as there are plenty of people doing so. To give you the idea why, typically at rush hour if you change to Tsuen Wan line in normal way at peak hours, you have to wait for 3 trains (with train arrive in every 2 minutes) and the trains will be near fully packed when arrive the station. If there are control system malfunction so the trains reverted to manual control, or when someone hit the emergency button call for help, make the trains to wait 6.</p>
<p>So if you want better control of time going home, usually at least you&#8217;ll have to go the &#8220;travel to Central terminus and change there&#8221; way.</p>

		<p>This used to be my favourite route as well, except that I worked in 43 (but at the far southern end) so the benefit of going down to the basement was that it was all covered, and you don&#8217;t walk past other teams offices.</p>
<p>I always wondered if it was that &#8220;slight ramp&#8221; that was the &#8220;stairs&#8221; mentioned on the wall. Or if it&#8217;s an affordance.</p>

		<p>When the old Safeco Insurance Company fortified complex was converted to Microsoft office space, much of the &#8220;planning for any sort of disaster including zombies and our customers wielding pitchforks&#8221; was kept.</p>
<p>Microsoft Buildings 84, 85 and 86 are Glorious examples of neo-Stalinist brutalist architecture. 84 and 85 have two walls of Windows, fitting because some of the Windows teams worked there. Building 86 had no Windows, and was referred to as &#8220;the Gulag&#8221; (I heard a variety of terms for this squat, dark, near Window-less cube).</p>
<p>There was a huge multi-level parking lot that ran under B84, 85 and 86, and internal car-free corridors that also ran the length the perimeter. During the Redmond Monsoon season, the wise choice to move between buildings was to go all &#8220;Dungeons and Dragons&#8221; to the first basement level, and then explore the corridors, which included some doors with card key access, and others not so much.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
