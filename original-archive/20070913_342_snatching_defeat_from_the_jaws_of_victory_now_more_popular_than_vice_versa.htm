		<p>To be fair evaluating popularity of a phrase based on search engine hits is hardly a valid means of gaging its true popularity across the entire spectrum of the populace. Unless of course you are only interested in the opinions of people who have websites or write things on the internet (admittedly a large number).</p>

		<p>James: I somehow doubt highly that Raymond was suggesting that this is a scientifically valid statistical insight. Some people like to have a little fun now and then, try it out.</p>

		<p>James, are you looking for the nitpickers corner or something???</p>
<p>Google fight says: defeat from the jaws of victory 621,000 results; victory from the jaws of defeat 604,000 results</p>

		<p>The reason for this is the phrase &quot;snatching victory from the jaws of defeat&quot; has been replaced by the motion of pounding oneself in the left chest repeatedly with the right fist and then optionally pointing the right index finger skyward.</p>

		<p>I first heard this expression on the Jim Rome show, back in 1994 or so. &nbsp;If he didn&#8217;t invent it, I would bet he popularized it. &nbsp;Another one I heard from that show that later became popular was the word &#8216;take&#8217; to mean opinion; i.e. &quot;what&#8217;s your take on the upcoming tomato funeral?&quot;</p>

		<p>As did the softball team I was on last summer. &nbsp;One game in particular stands out: we started off by scoring somewhere around 12 runs over two of the first three innings, and we were up 13-4 or something like that. &nbsp;We ended up losing, 17-16 &#8212; and that was an overtime loss; we were tied (16-16) at the end of regulation play.</p>
<p>Snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, indeed. &nbsp;That one hurt for a while&#8230; &nbsp;;-)</p>

		<p>To qualify for the &quot;Jaws of Victory&quot; award, the army, general or sports team in question must not only lose, but lose by adopting a large degree of stupidity as tactics. Mere chance, or an encounter against superior forces, is not sufficient.</p>
<p>The expression, which is older than the Internet, seems to have become popular. Here is a possible origin. (I suspect it goes back a hundred years or more, though.)</p>
<p>&quot;From the Jaws of Victory. A History of the Character, Causes &amp; Consequences of Military Stupidity from Crassus to Johnson&quot; is the title of a book by Charles Fair, published around 1971.</p>
<p>Fair&#8217;s discussion of General Ambrose Burnside (the Union general known for building a bridge across a stream shallow enough for wading, and thus losing a substantial advantage) is memorable. So are Burnside&#8217;s side-whiskers, known as sideburns.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
