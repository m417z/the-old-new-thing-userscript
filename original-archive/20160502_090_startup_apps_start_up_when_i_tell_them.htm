<p>
I remember some magazine article about Windows 8,
and it talked about how fast Windows 8 started up
compared to Windows 7.
The way they measured it was by putting a shortcut to Notepad
in the Startup group,
then booting the computer,
and timing how long before the Notepad window opened.
</p>
<p>
I laughed at this metric
because <i>I</i> control when startup groups start up.
As in me, personally.
</p>
<p>
The Explorer startup sequence has a number of phases,
carefully arranged to get visible things ready first,
and less visible things ready later.
And one of the lowest priority items is the Startup group.
</p>
<p>
In fact, even after everything is finished initializing,
there is a bonus extra delay before the Startup group gets
processed.
We've found that one of the big frustrations people have
with Windows is that after signing in,
they can't use the computer because all of the Startup
programs
are thrashing the computer.
Launching all the programs in the Startup group and similar
auto-start locations (like the Run key)
means that you have a dozen programs all trying to load
themselves off the disk,
which thrashes the computer so hard that the user can't
even open the Start menu.
</p>
<p>
There have been a variety of approaches taken to mitigate
the impact of auto-start programs.
One trick was to
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110817-00/?p=9883">
run auto-start programs
in a box that keeps them at low CPU and disk priority</a>
for 60 seconds.
In Windows 8, one new trick was to
delay launching the next program until the
previous one has settled down,
where "settled down" means "stopped consuming a lot of CPU
and disk I/O bandwidth."
Another trick was simply to wait longer before starting
the auto-start programs in the first place.
</p>
<p>
Measuring how long it takes for Notepad to open
is in large part simply a way of extracting the
parameter I passed to the <code>Sleep</code> function.
</p>
<p>
I could have made Windows boot faster or slower
according to their metrics by simply tweaking
how long I slept before firing up the auto-start
programs.</p>

		<p>I imagine this was done because Windows 8 would not boot to the desktop normally. Otherwise they would just measure how long it took for the full desktop to load &#8211; still a very bad metric as on Windows 10 it can thrash around for quite awhile to open anything from a fully visible desktop on startup. So how do you measure the real startup time?</p>

		<p>Enabling and looking at the profiling counters is probably your best bet. You can see when the CPU &amp; disk queues go from pegged to spiking to steady that way, when interrupts slow down, and so on. Specifically looking at explorer.exe&#8217;s full initialization might be even more useful (parts of it are still starting up even after the UI appears), since that&#8217;s how everyone starts interacting with the PC, but I&#8217;m not sure how you&#8217;d do that as someone who isn&#8217;t Raymond.</p>

		<p>Has the approach changed much with modern hardware?  I would guess that a CPU with multiple cores paired with a solid state drive would greatly reduce the amount of thrashing that takes place when multiple programs start executing at the same time.  But that&#8217;s just a guess.</p>
<p>Though perhaps there are other benefits of a more serialized initialization.  For example, I could see getting more advantage of shared code pages if many startup programs use the same libraries.</p>

		<p>A lot of software has expanded to fill the hardware. One starts up Java, one starts up .Net, one Python and one GTK, drivers load their UI components even if they don&#8217;t show them, everything injects itself into the shell&#8230; There&#8217;s also the particular pathology that they all want to update immediately on startup, instead of waiting and checking periodically. Any antivirus update will probably stall the system completely for a minute or three. Meanwhile services are doing all of their work in the background at the same time, unless you let the PC sit for a while before logging in. Lots of hardware makes it more bearable, but it&#8217;s still a bad situation if it&#8217;s unmanaged.</p>

		<p>&gt; Weâ€™ve found that one of the big frustrations people have with Windows is that after signing in, they canâ€™t use the computer because all of the Startup programs are thrashing the computer.</p>
<p>Cue sad laughter.</p>
<p>I bought a laptop a couple of years ago (when it still came with Windows 7, and a mechanical harddrive). And sure enough, out of the box it was basically an expensive paperweight for the first 10 or so minutes after starting it up.</p>
<p>The culprit was easy to find: about a dozen of programs running on startup, out of the box. One of these programs did a hard-drive performance check on starting up! Hello, shovelware. Back then, after unboxing, the next step was installing a clean copy of Windows.</p>
<p>But hey, at least my laptop actually finished starting up. I once witnessed another laptop starting up, thrashing, thrashing, and thrashing more for about half an hour, until it ran out of battery power and shut down.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m wondering: running those programs one after each other: is that how Windows 10 figures out how much &#8220;impact&#8221; a program has on start-up?</p>

		<p>&gt; you have a dozen programs all trying to load themselves off the disk, which thrashes the computer so hard</p>
<p>Why doesn&#8217;t the loader load (touches to page in) the whole module at Load, to make all reads linear (&gt;100 MB/s on modern HDD)? That would speed up the process load A LOT. Assuming the Explorer would call WaitForInputIdle.</p>

		<p>Disk I/O at startup is not just loading applications, there will also be an impact from paging and whatever the applications are doing. The applications may also be thrashing the CPU.</p>
<p>Machines that take ages to start up often don&#8217;t have much ram, after you preloaded all the pages then they could just get discarded again.</p>
<p>I assume SuperFetch, Prefetch and the boot optimisation essentially give you roughly the same advantage in a different way.</p>

		<p>1. Amount of private code in a typical process is under 10 megabytes. A typical box always has a much memory in a standby list. Keep in mind, it&#8217;s not year 2000 anymore.<br />
2. The article is about system startup, when there are no big user apps running yet. Even if there are, there&#8217;s always enough non-dirty pages to steal.</p>

		<p>Feels like this is a good place to say that MS really did great work wrt. startup issues from Win7 to Win8/10. It&#8217;s *so* much better in 8/10. Thanks for that.</p>

		<p>I found the new behavior undesirable.  I&#8217;d start using the computer and then 10 seconds later an auto-start program would change the foreground window causing my keystrokes to start going into a void.  Setting StartupDelayInMSec to 0 has improved the experience a lot for me.  Thanks for including this setting in the registry.</p>

		<p>There are measurements, stored in the Event Log, that tell you how long various phases of Startup take.  Anyone who is interested in checking out how long &#8220;startup&#8221; takes (and startup is a nebulous concept) should investigate those.  They are in the Windows-Diagnostics-Performance set.  For example, events 100 through 110 will tell you about performance degradation during startup.  One of the events says something like &#8220;Windows has started up&#8221; (I&#8217;m paraphrasing from memory).</p>
<p>Remember that there are services set to &#8220;Automatic (Delayed)&#8221; which delays their startup to some unspecified time, like when the system &#8220;has settled down&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Correction: Startup is not a nebulous concept, but &#8220;how long startup takes&#8221; probably has different meanings to different people.</p>

		<p>Thanks for the heads up.  I will look into those metrics.</p>

		<p>The last clause (&#8220;&#8230; tweaking how long I slept before firing up the auto-start programs&#8221;) makes me envisage a tiny little Raymond Chen inside my PC, waiting for a timer to go off so that he, personally, can kick off my auto-start programs. So thanks for an amusing mental image, Raymond!</p>

		<p>There are hundreds of millions (or billions) of tiny little Raymond Chens running inside all Windows PCs!</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).

<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
