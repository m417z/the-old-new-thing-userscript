<p>There is a group policy called <i>Turn off all balloon notifications</i>, but what if you want to turn off only one specific notification?</p>
<p> The taskbar does not offer fine-grained policy control over balloon notifications. All you have is the giant sledgehammer that turns off all of them. If there is a specific balloon you want to disable, you have to check with the specific program that is raising them, or the specific product feature, to see if it offers a way to turn the balloon off. </p>
<p> For example, there is a setting to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/285107"> disable the low disk space checks</a> and another one to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms814801.aspx"> disable notifications that tell you when you have lost the connection to a networked file and are working on the local copy</a>. </p>

		<p>But what if I&#39;ve written the greatest program in the world and we need to display balloon notifications but we need to make sure that competitors inferior product, that can display all kinds of annoying balloon notifications, no longer shows them?</p>
<p>It&#39;s as if you guys don&#39;t want me to get my raise.</p>

		<p>Of course, if the notifications are coming from a third-party application, you can block the whole app via the Control Panel. &nbsp;This may or may not be what you want (e.g. &quot;I want to see some Contoso notifications but hide others&quot;).</p>

		<p>If you want your raise then just code something that dismisses your competitors balloon notifications using automation.</p>

		<p>Even if there was a clearinghouse for managing which notifications to show and which to hide, it wouldn&#39;t be very useful because it seems like 90% of programs don&#39;t actually use the built in notifications, they implement their own pop-up notification systems. Presumably because the Explorer notifications auto-expire, and they want to be able to shove notifications in your face that will remain on-screen indefinitely.</p>

		<p>Doesn&#39;t the Windows 7 Notification Area Icons control panel allow you to suppress notifications on a per-app basis? That&#39;s at least a slightly more fine-grained hammer. Or are you referring to group policy adjustments in particular?</p>

		<p>@Kevin and Simon: Yes, that&#39;s true, the Control Panel does support that. &nbsp;But, that is a Shell &quot;user-preferences-first&quot; feature, which can&#39;t be controlled programmatically (at least, not with documented APIs).</p>

		<p>It amazes me that anyone would expect Windows to have a fine-grained control for app-specific functionality. &nbsp;If I write an app that displays various notifications, I had freaking better supply a control panel for that app to give my customers control over what, when, and for how long they see stuff. &nbsp;It is not Windows responsibility, but mine. &nbsp;And any failure to do so is clearly because I am an !@#$hole, and customers should say so. &nbsp;Yeesh.</p>

		<p>@Rob: There&#39;s a reason for that: they&#39;re *user* preferences. &nbsp;You shouldn&#39;t be touching them. &nbsp;They&#39;d be no point in having user preferences if software could just come along and decide it knew better, changing the setting to one it thinks is more suitable.</p>

		<p>On Windows 8.1, when I go to &quot;Control PanelAll Control Panel ItemsNotification Area Icons&quot;, I have options to disable notifications associated to specific task bar icons. Isn&#39;t that pretty close to what was asked for?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Maybe I&#39;m not reading it right, but the options I see are &quot;Show icon and notifications&quot;, &quot;Hide icon and notifications&quot;, and &quot;Only show notifications&quot;.

		<p>@Chris Crowther @ Work: A random commercial program shouldn&#39;t be messing with user preferences, but administrators of a corporate environment claim that privilege over their users. &nbsp;If the Help Desk is inundated by complaints about notifications from Line of Business Application X, administrators may very well want to push out a setting that turns off notifications for that app.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
