<p>
If you ask Explorer or some other disk space utility for the size of the
WinSxS folder, you'll get an inflated value because WinSxS consists mostly
of hard links into other parts of Windows, so it doesn't really occupy space
on its own, but na&iuml;ve disk space calculation algorithms don't take
hard links into account (in part because it's not clear how one should
account for them).
</p>
<p>
The command to analyze the contents of the WinSxS directory
is
</p>
<pre>
dism /Online /Cleanup-Image /AnalyzeComponentStore
</pre>
<p>
<a HREF="http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=293367">
This Web page</a>
explains how to interpret the results.</p>

		<p>It should, since that value comes from the file system directly.  I&#8217;m pretty sure it comes from the file allocation bitmap, but it could also be the MFT.  I don&#8217;t remember which exactly.  Pretty much every filesystem has a way of calculating the total volume allocation size or free volume size without examining every single file though.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Rule of thumb: the pie does not lie,&#8221; write Jeff Hughes (PubSec) and Robert Mitchell, Senior Support Escalation Engineer, in the <a href="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askcore/2013/03/01/where-did-my-space-go/" rel="nofollow">Ask The Core Team</a> blog.  For a &#8220;a non-naïve value&#8221; of disk space usage, they recommend just what Lennart supposed.  They write that the volume&#8217;s properties page gets its values from &#8220;a special metafile called $BITMAP&#8221;, which is one of the sources MNGoldenEagle remembered.</p>

		<p>Oh yeah, I remember one of these great &#8220;tuning tools&#8221; which shipped with a disk space analyzer. The whole diagram of the Windows partition was mostly useless since it claimed WinSxS would be 50% of it, and the best thing was it even suggested to &#8220;check and clean up WinSxS&#8221;.</p>

		<p>this command doesn&#8217;t work for win7 and your explanation link looks 404?<br />
Another way to check is sysinternals DU tool, but the end result is that winsxs is just big, and hard linking accomplishes very little<br />

		<p>The blog post is slightly disingenuous in stating that the hard links may be worse than the alternative.  The alternative would be actual files, which will always occupy more space.  The conclusion that the hard links themselves could occupy more space than the file they&#8217;re linking to is correct, but the alternative is still worse.</p>
<p>It is kind of unfortunate that the payoff is so small.  On my system the difference amounts to about 409MB, which by itself is pretty large but compared to 15.8GB is only about 2.5% of the total size of WinSxS (reported by Explorer, at least).</p>

		<p>There are plenty of stuff in WinSxS that are not hardlinked by anything and does occupy space.<br />
I guess they are needed for rollbacks or someting.</p>

		<p>Well, if an update is installed then it really needs to keep all of the update files around*.<br />
If an update isn&#8217;t completely superseded, that means that at least one of the files is actually linked into the Windows directory, then it must keep the rest of the update around regardless*. If an update has been completely superseded, then the update can be removed*.<br />
This is like this because prior to Vista, it was possible to install an update, and later uninstall it and have it restore out of date files under the Windows directory. The new CBS way of doing updates has it checking the WinSxS directory for the most recent version of the file and then links that to where it needs to go. So yes, those files are there for the case of uninstalling updates.<br />
One other thing to point out, along with the ability to analyse the WinSxS directory, Windows now has the ability to uninstall updates that are found to be unused after the analysis. While I can&#8217;t remember if 8.1 did it automatically, I know 10 does. You can also run it manually using DISM.exe /Image:C:\test\offline /Cleanup-Image /StartComponentCleanup<br />
*There is a major caveat here if the /ResetBase option was used at any point. It makes an update permanent in exchange for removing unused files from that update and the Windows base package.</p>

		<p>Isn&#8217;t the original file also a hard link, meaning that it is hard to define which file is using up the space and which one is &#8220;just a link&#8221; (well, in this case there&#8217;s more context about the directory, but in the general case)? At least that&#8217;s the impression I have for hard links on Linux.</p>

		<p>There is no original and link difference, they are all just file names in a directory and they all point to the same data stream. The only complication is for small files where the data might be stored directly inside the NTFS file entry structure and I&#8217;m not sure exactly what happens in this case, perhaps the file is forced to be non-resident when a hard link is created?</p>

		<p>The MFT will store multiple file name records in the file record. They aren&#8217;t that large, 94 bytes + size of file name, so if the file is 10 bytes just hard linking it a few times isn&#8217;t going to evict it. Eventually it will, but it&#8217;s not like a single extra hard link breaks MFT storage optimization.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
