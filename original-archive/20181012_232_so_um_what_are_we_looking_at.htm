Some of
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180330-01/?p=98405">
my relatives from Vancouver, British Columbia</a>
enjoy going on cruises.
During one cruise along the Alaska coast,
they found a large number of passengers gathered on the viewing deck
and gazing toward the shore in awe and amazement.
</p>
<p>
My relatives looked out toward shore but couldn't identify what it was
that drew everyone's attention.
Was something interesting happening on shore?
Was there a whale in the ocean?
</p>
<p>
After failing to identify the source of the awe and amazement,
one of them asked one of the awe-filled passengers,
"So, um, what are we looking at?"
</p>
<p>
The other passenger replied,
"Why, the snow-covered mountains, of course.
Aren't they gorgeous?"
</p>
<p>
My relatives were less impressed,
because they live in Vancouver,
where
<a HREF="https://www.tripsavvy.com/top-vancouver-winter-events-activities-3371064">
a view of snow-covered mountains
is what you get every winter</a>.
</p>
<p>
They surmised that most of the people on the cruise
are from parts of the world where they don't get
<a HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nSwGxvOviWM">
a view of snow-capped mountains on their daily commute</a>.
</p>
<p>
I'll be on my first cruise next week.
The blog will be running on autopilot.
This means that I won't be around to approve comments manually.

		<p>I have a similar feeling regarding leaf-peeping season (when the leaves of deciduous trees change colors from green to yellow to orange and red).  It&#8217;s apparently a popular thing to do in the autumn season of the Northern hemisphere.  I don&#8217;t understand it.  I get to look at the leaves every day from my house and on my daily ride to the office.  I don&#8217;t understand the appeal of driving hours out of my way to see them.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t imagine there&#8217;s much in the way of snow-covered mountains in mid-October.  Most/all of last year&#8217;s snow will have melted, and this year&#8217;s snow (if any) will be pretty meagre.</p>
<p>If you wanted something to illustrate &#8220;parts of the world where they don&#8217;t get a view of snow-capped mountains on their daily commute&#8221;, you should have shown something like my commute here in Dallas &#8211; no snow, no mountains, not really any hills.</p>

		<p>Mt. Rainier and Mt. Baker (both visible on my commute if the weather is cooperative) have year-round snow, and I was noticing last night (also on my commute) that the higher peaks of the Stevens Pass region of the Cascades appear to be accumulating some snow again already.</p>

		<p>Maybe there&#8217;s not much snow in Dallas, but I lived there through more than once ice storm.  I think there was SOME snow mixed in with the ice.</p>

		<p>Raymond, enjoy the cruise.  Mrs. 12BitSlab and I have been on many cruises &#8212; probably about 40.  It is a great way to get away from the phone, voice mail, email, etc.  Sometimes being completely disconnected is a vacation unto itself.</p>

		<p>Hope you have a great time &#8211; will it be an Alaska cruise like your relatives took? Or something in the Baltic Sea so you can practice your various viking languages&#8230;<br />

		<p>No matter how extraordinary, there is always someone for whom that is just Tuesday. For me that experience is snow and the midnight Sun. Living in Finland we get snow every year, and during midsummer we have nights that are never dark. For me those are yearly experiences, but there are people who will never have seen either in their lives. </p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t that long ago in history that most people didn&#8217;t travel, ever. With our modern perspective, it is odd to think that for many people throughout human history, even something as common as the sea would be outside their personal experience if they didn&#8217;t happen to live in a coastal region.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve seen plenty of snow cover, but real mountains only in passing, mostly just hills, and nothing tall enough to have snow cover in the summer. Still, I would appreciate a beautiful view whether I see it all the time or not. I go to the same places in the Poconos during the summer every year, and haven&#8217;t gotten tired of the waterfalls. Though I guess if I lived there and so them every day it would desnsitize me somewhat.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
