<p>At Microsoft, <i>leverage</i> is not a term of physics whereby a force can be magnified by the application of mechanical advantage. It is also not a term of finance whereby the power of a small amount of money can be magnified by the assumption of debt. In fact, at Microsoft, the word <i>leverage</i> isn't even a noun. It is a verb: <i>to leverage</i>, <i>leverages</i>, <i>leveraging</i>, <i>leveraged</i>, <i>has leveraged</i>. Oh, and it has nothing to do with magnification.</p>
<p> Here are some citations: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> How do I leverage a SiteMap? </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Allow advertising partners to leverage this resource for providing targeted advertising links. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Leverage existing design to power other designs </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Do we have documents on how Windows 95 can leverage Windows 2000 Active Directory? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> At Microsoft, <i>to leverage</i> means <i>to take advantage of</i>, or in many cases, simply <i>to use</i>. </p>
<p> Verbal use of the word <i>leverage</i> appears to be popular outside of Microsoft as well, such as this headline from eWeek: <a href="http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Enterprise-Applications/How-to-Leverage-IT-to-Speed-RandD-Innovation/"> <i>How to Leverage IT to Speed RandD Innovation</i></a>. </p>
<p> But can you do this: At Microsoft you can leverage people. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Alice, does Bob perform any component-Foo testing? Charles can be leveraged to actually execute tests if Donald can drive him with these asks. Let me know. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> That snippet was a whirlwind of Microspeak, with the passive form of the verb <i>to leverage</i>, plus <i>to drive</i> and the plural noun <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/07/48304.aspx"> <i>asks</i></a>. </p>

		<p>I&#39;ve never understood why people don&#39;t use &#39;lever&#39; as the verb. e.g. &quot;Use a crowbar to lever open the container.&quot;</p>
<p>Leverage sounds like the amount of power that a lever can lever something.</p>
<p>Apparently using &#39;leverage&#39; as a verb dates back decades/centuries (I looked it up once, trying to find out who was to blame, and was surprised) but I don&#39;t remember hearing it regularly until the late 90s.</p>

		<p>By definition, leverage should be NOT a verb. To level is a verb. Adding &#39;-age&#39; at the end of that verb explicitly transforms it into a noun. You &#39;lever&#39; a &#39;leverage&#39;. You don&#39;t &#39;leverage&#39; a &#39;leverage&#39;.</p>
<p>Explained much better here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://smyword.com/2010/01/are-you-stupid-enough-to-use-leverage-as-a-verb/" rel="nofollow">smyword.com/&#8230;/are-you-stupid-enough-to-use-leverage-as-a-verb</a></p>
<p>&quot;Apparently using &#39;leverage&#39; as a verb dates back decades/centuries&quot; This is related to the financial use of the term. It, however, did not create the catchall verb that has become commonplace in business. That was &#39;no doubt&#39; re-purposed by managers trying to confuse and bamboozle their clients &#8211; and then adopted as a general term by those clients or others at the meeting who didn&#39;t understand this was a completely made-up term.</p>

		<p>Alternatively it could be the genuine use of the finance term in a business context in &#39;repurposing&#39; financial risk&#8230; and then misused by the aforementioned clueless dolts at the aforementioned meetings.</p>

		<p>Well, now that leverage is a verb, it induces the new noun &quot;leveragables&quot;. &nbsp;As in, &quot;Alice&#39;s takeway is to drive a list of &#39;asks and leveragables&#39; for project Foo&quot;.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve always wondered whether my refusal to use Microspeak is one of those dubious &quot;career limiting moves&quot;. I talk about questions, not &quot;asks&quot;. I skip &quot;leverage&quot;, shun &quot;utilize&quot;, and just say &quot;use&quot;. I say &quot;I agree&quot; or not. &quot;Bandwidth&quot; is a term for networks: if I don&#39;t have time for something, I say I don&#39;t have &quot;time&quot;.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t seem any worse off so far.</p>

		<p>Mirospeak is an odd phenomenon since a large majority of employees at Microsoft attended college. English even applied incorrectly becomes acceptable and correct if used and accepted by enough people over time. Who knows in another 50 years maybe some Mircospeak will start to show up in text books.</p>
<p>Has anyone raised a hand in a meeting and proclaimed &quot;Uh, I don&#39;t believe you are using the term correctly. Do you really want me to leverage Charles?&quot;</p>

		<p>Troll: Considering that levers are actually used to boost things, I would have to argue that &quot;Microsoft leverages IE9 to boost Windows 7 sales.&quot; is proper usage of the term rather than Microspeak, even if the lever is metaphorical rather than physical in this case.</p>

		<p>You know, I&#39;ve been conditioned by this blog on Microspeak, yet a month and a half ago a Microsoft guy used ask in the Microspeak way (&quot;Is this an ask for me?&quot;) and I was stunned.</p>
<p>Adding to that was I&#39;ve interacted with him for 2 years prior and I never saw him say that.</p>
<p>Thank $DIETY for this blog. And even prepared, it can be a shock when you encounter it in the wild.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s not just Microspeak that uses leverage in that way. I worked for EDS (now HP) and the use of leverage as a verb was prevalent, and I hated it. I took on a personal rule that any email I received that contained such b*stardisation of the Queens English was to be completely ignored. That one action drastically cut down the level of BS that comes through my inbox.</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
