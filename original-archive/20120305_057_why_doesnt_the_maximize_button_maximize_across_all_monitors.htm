<p> If a window were maximized across the virtual screen, the contents of the upper left corner would not be visible at all! </p>
<p> Now, there may be specific cases where it would be meaningful to maximize a window across the virtual monitor, and if a program wants to do that, it can certainly implement that on its own. But even for a picture-viewing application, maximizing across the virtual monitor may not be a great idea: Pictures often have people in the center, and then you end up with somebody's head cut in half. </p>

		<p>What a coincidence. &nbsp;I was testing one of our in house applications this morning. &nbsp; It has a field with a dropdown list on it (our own control), when I put the screen on to my second monitor and pressed the dropdown button, the dropdown list was not appearing. In fact it was appearing, but not on the correct monitor, somehow the coder had mapped it&#39;s position onto the first monitor and not the second.</p>

		<p>RealTimeSoft&#39;s UltraMon has a button that will maximize across all monitors based on some rules (I don&#39;t believe it would maximize like Raymond&#39;s picture, for example). &nbsp;That said, I can count the number of times that I&#39;ve ever used that feature (since 2006) on one hand, and it&#39;s probably more by accident than on-purpose.</p>

		<p>Historical note: Some early attempts at multi-monitors would treat them like a single monitor with a double-wide screen. I had this at one point; the problems listed above were really, really annoying. It might have worked out better if I&#39;d had two absolutely identical monitors, I suppose; instead, I was forced to have one of them use a lower resolution than optimal in order to match up with the other. And if I wanted to use just the one monitor for something, I had to manually resize the window to fit.</p>
<p>In short: The new way is much, much better.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve tried using a pair of monitors spanned for a couple of days, and I remember how annoying it was to get centered pop-up dialog boxes. I&#39;d always move them to one side or the other instead of trying to read them in their broken form.</p>
<p>I&#39;m frequently impressed by your ability to create great visual demonstrations without resorting to using images. Keep up the good work, Raymond.</p>

		<p>Actually, I should point out that I have been using 5 monitors since Win 98 was released and I realized that the IT intern who sat next to me had a pile of disused monitors and PCI video cards he had pulled out of PCs that he was upgrading.</p>
<p>I do occasionally find a reason to have a window span multiple monitors but on those rare occasions I don&#39;t mind manually resizing the window. &nbsp;I would have to say that Microsoft made the correct choice in this case.</p>
<p>And for what it is worth Mc and kinokijf, since my bottom right monitor is Primary, it means that 4 out of my 5 monitors have negative coordinates. &nbsp;I see instantly when a program is poorly behaved in those circumstances. &nbsp;Over the years programs have gotten a lot better. &nbsp;In the VB5/6 days most programs had huge issues with it. &nbsp;Nowadays most do fine, with the occasional menu or tooltip issue being the most common. &nbsp;Oddly I see a lot of programs that seem perfectly OK with negative X coordinates, but still freak out about negative Y ones. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>The only time I find this annoying is for applications that insist on using MDI/tabbed interfaces (VS!) that don;t allow me to move a single code window to the other monitor.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I still use VB6 that has an SDI mode :)</p>

		<p>A friend has a 3 monitor setup and they are configured as a single display surface. It always drives me nuts when I maximize a window and it&#39;s suddenly five feet wide. He primarily plays a flight simulator on it that way, and I&#39;ll admit that the immersive quality of the game is pretty cool, it&#39;s just annoying for normal applications.</p>

		<p>I also think the presentation of this post is great.</p>
<p>The only application that I have spanning monitors is my programming editor (Epsilon/emacs), and then I split the window to have one source file filling each monitor, so the divide is no issue. Since that&#39;s just one of N applications I use, the Windows default works for me.</p>

		<p>Of course there&#39;s other reasons why you would want a properly spanned desktop across multiple monitor. One is gaming. The other is monitors like the IBM T221, where to get 48Hz refresh you can (given an appropriate adapter) drive it with two DL-DVI feeds. In that case there is no border. It&#39;d be nice if Windows had this ability built-in. Luckily AMD have Eyefinity, which does just this. It&#39;d be nice if it was available in NVIDIA drivers too (like it was in XP/XP64). It seems silly to not have an option, because there are cases where it can be used incorrectly, at the expense of the cases where it would be useful and work beautifully.</p>

		<p>There is one program which I regularly resize such that it covers multiple monitors: WinMerge. I size it so that the two files being compared each get their own monitor. And even then simply maximising the window wouldn&#39;t work as the file divider isn&#39;t in the middle of the window, but is offset slightly due to space taken up by the sidebar and scrollbars.</p>
<p>For everything else, I tend to position windows such that they are (or at least the portion I&#39;m interested in is) on one monitor only.</p>

		<p>@Imre Koszo I don&#39;t know, but because ClearType (TM) relies on the precise layout of each of the RGB subpixels which make up a pixel I expect it would not work optimally if these pixels&#39; layout was rotated 90 degrees as happens when a monitor is put on its side for a makeshift portrait screen. &nbsp;Perhaps the ClearType tuning software would help here.</p>
<p>Many thanks for another excellent post Raymond.</p>

		<p>Even number of monitors isn&#39;t very useful, a monitor in the center of the desktop is required to get a good user experience. Though it would be useful if GetDesktopWindow(), which countless of apps boundcheck against, returned the whole desktop.</p>

		<p>I use Remote Desktop to get around this problem.</p>
<p>You can maximize it and it will appropriately fill all monitors, even if they are of different sizes and resolutions.</p>
<p>The Windows team could learn from the RDP team on how to implement this well.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m the one who asked this question.</p>
<p>The background of this question, is that when I was visiting the control room of certain datacenter, I saw they combined multiple huge LED monitors to form a large display for the alert console. Each time they started the application, they have to manually pull the window to make it full screen. That&#39;s why I wish to ask whether there&#39;s &quot;smarter&quot; way for them to make it maximize across monitors.</p>

		<p>Regarding monitors of different size, I&#39;d think that since we have access to the size of each monitors, and we have the monitor&#39;s &quot;index&quot; number, it&#39;s not difficult to calculate the maximum rectangle area coordinates. In fact, the computer will have better chance to accurately fit to the maximum area.</p>
<p>And the dot pitch is seldomly a problem for people who want this configuration, because they tend to buy the same model at once. For people who can&#39;t, or have to buy a different one because of broken monitor, they&#39;ll understand the visual experience would be suboptimal.</p>

		<p>@Cheong: Here at work we &#39;inherit&#39; monitors when new ones come in, so the chance that both monitors are the same is rather slim. Also, there are applications out there that will allow you to specify sizes and hotkeys for those sizes and all sorts of things so you don&#39;t have to manually resize windows.</p>

		<p>@cheong00: And how would you fix this with a laptop / monitor setup? I&#39;m not going to pay for two laptops, just to get the effect properly. I like how Microsoft fixed it, perfect for the rest of the world, bad for one situation instead of perfect for this one case and the rest of the world having to move dialog boxes for the rest of their lives.</p>

		<p>Great post Raymond. This is in my opinion unquestionably the right design choice. Boggles my mind some people still want this feature. For those with edge cases where this is useful please be aware there is nothing stopping the app developer for implementing this, as is already the case. I.e. Games with multi-monitor support.</p>

		<p>@cheong00 You have the answer to your question: the application could have position its windows to fill the area of multiple monitors. Or in case the application was a third-party one, it would be quite easy to write another application that would reposition the window of the alert console.</p>
<p>So I actually agree with others, Windows does good job satisfying the most common scenarios.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in Windows 7 by pressing Windows+Shift+Up one can easily make a window fill entire vertical space without changing the width of the window, it&#39;s very handy.</p>
<p>@Raymond Great CSS magic. At first I thought it were images, and then went straight to post source to see how it&#39;s done. Wonderful!</p>

		<p>@cheog00, &quot;Each time they started the application, they have to manually pull the window to make it full screen.&quot; Why doesn&#39;t the application save it&#39;s current size (eg in the registry) as all other programs do, and start back up at that size?</p>

		<p>Since I&#39;m writing this currently from a workstation with a 30&quot; and 24&quot; dell monitors, I agree that the current solution is quite satisfactory. And I doubt most people who use multiple monitors for work have the same models or even bought them at the same time. Sure the whole multimonitor gaming hype has certainly lead to people buying monitors in triples, but the rest of us probably don&#39;t. There&#39;s just not much to be won by doing so &#8211; a smaller side monitor is just fine..</p>

<p>As has already been mentioned: they could just do a *little* bit of research and buy something like Ultramon. It doesn&#39;t cost much, certainly affordable for a &quot;datacenter&quot;.</p>

<p>Get headaches a lot? I immediately reject multi-monitor setups where the monitors are not identical because I can&#39;t handle the transitions.</p>
<p>BTW: I do have one program for which maximize across two (yes exactly two) identical monitors is the correct behavior, but it turns out the program is not multi-mon aware. I got lucky and it remembers its size from last close so I dragged it to the right size.</p>

		<p>In the days prior to this behavior, software such as Nvidia&#39;s nView were essential to fix things like the &quot;dialog in the center&quot; issue. Those programs were sometimes of the &quot;I bet somebody got a bonus for this&quot; nature, as each brought along their own set of inconsistencies and issues with how different multimon scenarios were handled.</p>
<p>These inconsistencies led to the creation of the CCD APIs <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff539590%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/hardware/ff539590%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a>&nbsp;and their associated requirements. Now, every IHV should exhibit the same behavior in how topology is chosen, saved, restored, et cetera.</p>

		<p>[As I noted in the article, special-purpose applications can customize their maximize behavior. -Raymond]</p>
<p>Obviously for some reason their application don&#39;t save it (whether they actually don&#39;t, or some reason prevent them saving/loading the previous location), so I can notice that they resize it again and again.</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know&#8230; I saw combined display panels in at least 3 datacenters so I thought it&#39;s common. But yeah, I guess laptop+monitor configuration is a more common scenerio given the number of laptops we have.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Or in case the application was a third-party one, it would be quite easy to write another application that would reposition the window of the alert console.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Just to remind you that in production enviornment of datacenter, getting software in aren&#39;t &quot;that&quot; easy. I remember that when I was installing data simulator to do configuration test, the application requires .NET v4 runtime but I forgotten I&#39;d need to install WIC package first to install that on Win2008R2. I gone through quite a hassle to get the package in.</p>

		<p>At home I bought monitors every 2-3 years, and kept the last two in multi-monitor configuration. With such a gap between purchases, it&#39;d be nearly impossible to get two identical models (not that I wanted to &#8211; each new monitor I bought was larger).</p>
<p>At work, one monitor was bought specifically for me, and the others I just picked up when I found them unused. I did manage to get two identical monitors this way, but the other two are different.</p>
<p>So, unless the multi-monitor setup was intended as such from beginning, you&#39;ll rarely see identical monitors in multimon setups.</p>

<p>I tried using a multi-monitor setup once where the monitors were not identical. &nbsp;It drove me crazy. &nbsp;I reverted to one monitor until I could buy another monitor of the same model number as my first one. &nbsp;Now it works great.</p>

		<p>@ender: At the previous company I worked for, we gone from single monitor to bi-monitor configuration 2 years ago. Since the company always buy monitors in batch, we were able to match almost everyone two monitors of same model. (Except notebook users who get just another monitor, of course)</p>
<p>It&#39;s just a matter of how large to company size is, and how far the management went to ensure everyone get 2 identical model of monitors.</p>
<p>Btw, I just asked whether there is such a feature built-in, not why there isn&#39;t (although it&#39;s nice to know). I thought it&#39;s possible to have such a feature. And if there is, Raymond is someone who has high chance to know. If there is, I would forward to knowledge to my now ex-coworkers to make their life easier.</p>

		<p>One of the programs I use has this problem &#8211; it would display a dialog in the center of the virtual monitor, so it got split across both monitors. Which is funny since otherwise the app is well-behaved&#8230; just one dialog it centers on the virtual monitor and not the one it&#39;s running on.</p>

		<p>I see people gasping at the CSS, and it&#39;s nice and all, but am I missing something about how much easier a simple mock-up in Paint (sufficient for this) would be, or is there some sort of weird image restriction that plagues this blog?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>There is a weird image restriction that plagues my home-grown content management system. (Also known as &quot;a script that runs every morning and picks an article to post.&quot;) And images aren&#39;t accessible. And it wouldn&#39;t have driven the point home as well. -Raymond</i>]</div>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
