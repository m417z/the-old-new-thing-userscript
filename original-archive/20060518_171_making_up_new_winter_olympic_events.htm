<p> My approach to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/technet/technetmag/issues/2006/05/WindowsConfidential/"> inventing new Winter Olympic events</a> is to create new opportunities for head-to-head competition, opening the door to new dramatic possibilities. For example, in Ski Jump Biathlon, one team jumps while the other team tries to shoot them (with paint pellets, of course) as they sail through the air. In Figure Curling, one team performs a free skate while the other team hurls granite stones down the ice in an attempt to foil that triple toe loop. </p>
<p> Japanese filmmaker Riichiro Mashima was also bitten by the sport-inventing bug. His creation: <a href="http://www.page.sannet.ne.jp/masm/"> Ski Jumping Pairs</a>. <a href="http://www.seattlefilm.org/festival/film/detail.aspx?id=20586&amp;FID=13"> I'm going to have to check it out</a>. </p>

		<p>Two danish comedians, Monrad &amp; Rislund, did a faked radio-reportage from Olympic Ski Drop &#8211; a Ski Jump with the landing area dotted with iron bars, poles and various other nasty stuff. The goal for the athletes is to get injured and/or killed in the most spectacular way possible. The event included cheating by starting with broken legs, and a team surprising everyone by the entire team doing a jump in a four-man bob.</p>

		<p>I just checked the Windows Confidential article you linked to, and can&#8217;t resist asking what in heaven&#8217;s name anyone is doing with a web browser on a server? Or am I just hopelessly old-fashioned? I hear that MediaPlayer is installed by default on Server2003, too&#8230;</p>

		<p>Someone, you&#8217;re a genius, except for the two-people-on-a-luge thing; the competitors would be scared stiff. (&#8230;yup, you ARE a genius.)</p>

		<p>That sounds suspiciously like the sport I tried to invent where snowboarders have to ski a course with occasional stops to shoot at the ski competitions on the next run over. &nbsp;Then, at the bottom, they wrestle a bear. &nbsp;To the death.</p>

		<p>David Smith: &quot;Server 2003&quot; is an operating system name, not a usage description. &nbsp;I prefer to run the Server versions of Windows on my desktop machines when I can &#8212; for me, the user experience is substantially better with 2k3 than XP, and I also like having all my data stored on mirrored partitions.</p>
<p>As for using a web browser on a machine that&#8217;s running as a server: I can certainly see it, at least for a one-computer installation. &nbsp;Either for looking up documentation if there isn&#8217;t a non-server computer handy, or for downloading software patches. &nbsp;But, then, I&#8217;m thinking about a server that does a little local-network file storage, and serves some low-priority web pages and a source repository for a small research group. &nbsp;Your five-nines-uptime rack-mounted corporate shopping cart server may differ. &nbsp;:)<br /></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
