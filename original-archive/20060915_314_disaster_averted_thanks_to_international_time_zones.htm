<p>Boy, the world has been really lucky this year. After successfully <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/06/07/620778.aspx"> avoiding a massive tsunami in the Atlantic Ocean</a>, the world narrowly escaped global disaster as predicted by <a href="http://yisraylhawkins.com/"> Yisrayl Hawkins</a>, leader of the organization <a href="http://www.yahweh.com/"> The House of Yahweh</a>. What saved us? Well, I'll <a href="http://news.scotsman.com/international.cfm?id=1356092006"> let Mosheh Sang, leader of the organization in Kenya, explain</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> According to Sang, a nuclear war between the US and North Korea only failed to kick off Tuesday as expected due to difference in international time zones. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> But they're not giving up yet. According to another leader, Eleazor Kamotho Mugwe: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> It can take up to seven years from now for the said nuclear war to take place because the prophecy talks about September 12. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> To play it safe, they're going to stay underground for a year. In a sense, then, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/08/23/world_will_end_on_9_.html"> BoingBoing reader Dave Kriesel got it right</a>. He predicted that the response would be, "Did I Say 9-12-2006? I meant to say 9-12-<i>2007</i>."  </p>
<p> Assuming the world hasn't been destroyed by then, we'll try to remember to check back on them next year, see how they're doing. </p>

		<p>-3 days remaining before the start of the nuclear war? I am glad they got their math right, atleast! They could have defined it an UINT and said 4294967293 remaining before&#8230;..</p>

		<p>The great thing about mocking people who predict the end of the world is that if it doesn&#8217;t happen, it&#8217;s funny. &nbsp;If it does happen, no one will be around to say &quot;I told you so&quot;. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a win-win situation.</p>

		<p>Win-win situation for whom, Ulric? Are you sympathizing with the doomsdayers (or doomsayers)?</p>
<p>At every second, somebody or the other in the world keeps saying &quot;oh..its end of the world&quot;, so one of them WILL happen to be right at the actual end of the world, eh?</p>

		<p>So long as they continue to exist, there are good odds that the laughter may continue:<br />
<br />1) They survived the End of the World: clearly cause for laughter and celebration.<br />
<br />2) The End of the World is potentially funny. Especially if it ends when a massive interstellar ASCII &quot;&lt;/world&gt;&quot; smashes into it.</p>

		<p>The end of the world is indeed funny, although I&#8217;ll have to disagree with Douglas Adams that it would make a great dinner-and-a-show. Unless there are celebrity guests.<br /></p>

		<p>It&#8217;s a win-win situation for people that laugh at people that predict the end of the world. &nbsp;Because if the laugher was wrong, they&#8217;ll never know it. &nbsp;(Well, probably; it would depend on what happens after the world ends, if anything.) &nbsp;But if the laugher was right, they get to laugh even more when the world *doesn&#8217;t* end.</p>

		<p>Revelations says that no one knows when the end of the world will be. So if someone says that it will be on a certain day, it definately won&#8217;t be. Just keep saying the end of world is coming, and we can avert it forever!</p>

		<p>Raymond, sorry for the off-topic comment, but all your knitting posts are closed for comments.</p>
<p>My wife is a knitter and checked out a book from the library which had a chapter that seemed like it might interest someone who likes knitting and computer programming. The book is &quot;Unexpected Knitting,&quot; by Debbie New, and the chapter is &quot;Cellular Automaton knitting: Self-generating patterns.&quot; Most of the book is pretty mediocre; I found most of the designs ranged between uninteresting and odd. But the CA chapter is not only intriguing from a uniqueness point of view; it also has what I think are the most visually interesting designs in the book.</p>

		<p>&quot;Boy, the world has been really lucky this year. After successfully avoiding a massive tsunami in the Atlantic Ocean, the world narrowly escaped global disaster as predicted by Yisrayl Hawkins, leader of the organization The House of Yahweh&quot;</p>
<p>I thought you weren&#8217;t supposed to say Yahweh.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh#Usage_of_YHWH" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahweh#Usage_of_YHWH</a><br />
<br />Josephus, who as a priest knew the pronunciation of the name, declares that religion forbids him to divulge it; Philo calls it ineffable, and says that it is lawful for those only whose ears and tongues are purified by wisdom to hear and utter it in a holy place (that is, for priests in the Temple); and in another passage, commenting on Lev. xxiv. 55 seq.: &quot;If any one, I do not say should blaspheme against the Lord of men and gods, but should even dare to utter his name unseasonably, let him expect the penalty of death.&quot;[17]</p>
<p>I only learnt about the taboo from the Life Of Brian of course.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
