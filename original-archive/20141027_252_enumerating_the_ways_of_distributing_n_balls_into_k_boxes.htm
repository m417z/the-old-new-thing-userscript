Suppose you had <var>n</var> indistinguishable balls
and <var>k</var> distinguishable boxes.
Enumerate the ways of distributing the balls into boxes.
Some boxes may be empty.
</p>
<p>
We can represent each distribution in the form of
<var>n</var> stars and
<nobr><var>k</var> &minus; 1</nobr> vertical lines.
The stars represent balls,
and the vertical lines divide the balls into boxes.
For example, here are the possible distributions for
<nobr><var>n</var> = 3</nobr>,
<nobr><var>k</var> = 3</nobr>:

This visualization is known in combinatorics circles
as
<a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stars_and_bars_(combinatorics)">
stars and bars</a>.
</p>
<p>
From this visualization, we see that what we are doing is
taking
<nobr><var>n</var> + </var>k</var> &minus; 1</nobr> slots,
and in each slot
placing a star or a bar, subject to the constraint that
there be <var>n</var> stars and
<nobr><var>k</var> &minus; 1</nobr> bars.
Another way of looking at this is that we are choosing
a subset of size
<nobr><var>k</var> &minus; 1</nobr>
from a set of size
<nobr><var>n</var> + <var>k</var> &minus; 1</nobr>
(the subset specifying where the bars go).
</p>
<p>
Now we can fire up
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/04/14/10516909.aspx">
our subset-generating machine</a>.
</p>
<pre>
function Distributions(n, k, f) {
 Subsets(n + k - 1, k - 1, function(s) {
  s.push(n + k);
  f(s.map(function(v, i) { return v - (s[i-1]||0) - 1; }));
  s.pop();
 });
}
</pre>
<p>
We ask to generate subsets of size
<nobr><var>k</var> &minus; 1</nobr>
from a set of size
<nobr><var>n</var> + <var>k</var> &minus; 1</nobr>.
For each such subset, we draw an artificial bar at the end
(slot
<nobr><var>n</var> + <var>k</var></nobr>),
then calculate the number of stars between the bars.
The number of stars between two bars is the distance between the
two bars, minus 1 because the bar takes up space, too.
</p>
<p>
Another solution is to reduce this to a problem we already know
how to solve:
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/07/14/10541999.aspx">
enumerating integer compositions</a>.
After distributing the balls into boxes,
we go around like Santa Claus and give each box one extra ball,
which produces a composition.
Conversely, for any composition, remove one ball from each box,
and you get a distribution.
</p>
<pre>
function Distributions(n, k, f)
{
 Compositions(n + k, k, function(s) {
  f(s.map(function(v) { return v - 1; }));
 });
}
</pre>
<p>
We added <var>k</var> extra balls, so we need to generate
compositions of
<nobr><var>n</var> + <var>k</var></nobr>.
When we get each composition, we take one ball away from
each box and call that the distribution.</p>

		<p>Huh? This is well known in math, is called arrangement. And the formula is in form : A(k,n) = n(n&minus;1)â‹¯(n&minus;k+1) = n!/((n&minus;k)!). See wiki, is simple and clear. And to not be confused with combinations of (k,n) where the formula is: C(k,n) = n!/(k!*((n-k)!))</p>

		<p>There is this two sentence summary: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Arrangement.html">mathworld.wolfram.com/Arrangement.html</a></p>
<p>It mentions that when order isn&#39;t important (indistinguishable balls, like you mentioned) that you use a combination (like you described) to calculate the number of &quot;arrangements.&quot;</p>

<p>It does use the term arrangement, but there&#39;s no A(k,n) notation involved. It uses the same method as Raymond. I am interested in the recipe from the example at the end.</p>

There is only one way to distribute 2 balls into 2 boxes (namely, put one ball in box A, and one ball in box B).

		<p>@Al Go, Oh no, the ratings are slipping? That&#39;s not good, Raymond you need to keep those key demographics interested or else they&#39;ll start reading other blogs.

		<p>How about a compromise: &nbsp;come up with real world examples instead of balls and boxes. That way it would seem more practical. I&#39;ve had it up to here with balls.</p>

		<p>@Al Go:</p>
<p>The thing is, these things while not seemingly practical can be used in other, more advanced algorithms.</p>
<p>For this particular combinatorial problem, you can use the principle in hashing algorithms. There are other interesting things, like the pigeonhole principle and the birthday problem which can appear. While not seemingly useful immediately, they all give a certain insight into situations that can arise in algorithm design.</p>
<p>So if I was to hazard a guess at what Raymond is trying to do. He is writing posts on how to solve these problems. If you don&#39;t know what the problem is though, you would go out and search for it, find the reason why you should know it in CS and feel enriched. That is speculation on my part though.</p>

		<p>@Crescens2k</p>
<p>Many of us can&#39;t learn a concept without some practical application presented, so merely presenting the theory isn&#39;t terribly educational.</p>
<p>Same way you can&#39;t learn to be a developer by merely reading some listings, really. You have to actually write code for practical purposes.</p>

		<p>@Anon:</p>
<p>And that is where the other part of someone working in CS comes into it. If you don&#39;t know something, research. These posts don&#39;t seem to be about really teaching the theory behind the problem either. Which is why I speculate that the thing that Raymond is doing is bringing to light these problems, so people become aware of them and go ahead and look them up.</p>
<p>Also remember, if you were to present this as a practical application, in such a small post it would most likely lose a lot of information. Also, as I said, they give insight into a problem and not end up being directly applicable. In fact, if you look at it another way, these are the practical application of the problem.</p>
<p>So, where do I get off on saying that. Imagine you have say 10 bins side by side, and you throw 10 balls into the bins, the probability of a bin containing more than 1 ball is not 0. The little code snippet is a way to generate different combinations at runtime. So how does this apply to an algorithm? Well, if you hash something with a finite set of possible output values (i.e. int32), the probability of a collision is not 0, and should be uniformly random if you have a good uniform hashing algorithm.</p>
<p>Theoretical problems usually use a real life example to study, but then apply it somehow to an algorithm. Like for hashing, you wouldn&#39;t really care too much about going around throwing balls at bins (or boxes) at all.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
