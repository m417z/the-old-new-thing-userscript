<p>Similar to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/23/9798532.aspx#9799824"> Mike</a>, I was able to scream (not whistle: scream) a 300 baud carrier tone. This skill proved useful when I was in college and the mainframe system was down. Instead of sitting around waiting for the system to come back, I just went about my regular business around campus. Every so often, I would go to a nearby campus phone (like a free public phone but it can only make calls to other locations on campus), dial the 300 baud dial-up number, and scream the carrier tone. If I got a response, that meant that the mainframe was back online and I should wrap up what I was doing and head back to the lab.</p>
<p> Mind you, this skill isn't very useful nowadays. </p>
<p> What stupid computer talent do you have? </p>

		<p>I can play a lot of old arcade games by just listening to the 8-bit sounds. This allowed me to play while reading a book, keeping track of what was happening around me and eating. Nowadays games are not that predictive anymore&#8230;</p>

		<p>This isn&#39;t a computer talent but when I was in middle school, whenever the announcements would come on I would try to mouth the words in real time. &nbsp;I found I could do it pretty effectively and when people watched me, they thought I had memorized the announcements or something.</p>

		<p>I remember once working with a (poorly single-threaded) app (under Win3.1), which would go into some process and just lock the machine for 10 minutes at a time. &nbsp;However, know that Windows could buffer 16 keystrokes, It&#39;s just type out what I wanted done when it complete (as I recall, alt-tabbing to Explorer ..er.. FileManager, copying a newly created file, alt-tabbing to different fileman in a different directory, pasting the file, and running it from there.)</p>

		<p>After using an Apple //c (the one with the single-sided 5.25&quot; floppy drive&#39;s door in the right side, beyond the keyboard) for more than ten years, I was (am?) able to open the door, extract the floppy, flip it, insert it again, and close the door &#8211; all in less than one second. Using just my right hand. A very useful ability back in the floppy days, because many programs came in two sided disks, and you had to manually flip them so the program could read the &quot;B side&quot;, sometimes with exasperating frequence.</p>

		<p>Back in my days of dialup tech support, I could tell what speed the modem had connected and what modulation type by the connection tones. It was very useful for troubleshooting line condition problems when customers weren&#39;t savvy enough to find the connection speed, or they had bad modem drivers installed that reported the serial port speed (115200 when you knew they only had a 33.6k modem didn&#39;t make sense!). Also if you knew they had a v.90 modem but were only hitting 28.8, or the classic &quot;endless handshake&quot; problems&#8230; ahh, memories.</p>

		<p>When singing, I can &quot;pitch leech&quot; off other singers very quickly, even for songs I&#39;ve never heard before. When I&#39;m &quot;in the zone&quot; it can also extend to the words and vocal patterns. I once sang a duet with somebody I had just met. She was surprised that I knew an obscure Japanese folk song. It took me a while to convince her that I actually didn&#39;t speak a word of Japanese, much less didn&#39;t know the song.</p>
<p>As for computer talents, I can keep a straight face and not laugh when a customer calls and tells me they can&#39;t find the &quot;any key&quot; on their keyboard. That takes skill, and actually happened to me (not a &quot;friend of a friend story) at my high-school programming job.</p>

		<p>I used to knock dialup-based Windows spammers offline by sending a ping packet with a payload of the Hayes modem string &quot;ATH0&quot;, which the stack dutifully replied with, hanging up the modem. I used to use the forth RPN calculator in SunOS&#39;s firmware to do simple calculations. I turned off compression in my Hayes init string to keep the connection from needlessly trying to recompress GIF files when surfing the early Web.</p>

		<p>primitive networking between a pc and a old macIISE involved a crossed-pair telephone wire and two 9600bps modems. &nbsp;The trick was always getting the carriers to detect dialtone and dial and force a &#39;pickup&#39;. &nbsp;We generally accomplished this by putting a handset in the middle and emulating the dial tone. &nbsp;Almost always worked.</p>

		<p>I have a 1997 P2 350Mhz with upgraded 512 MB SIMM RAM and 8 MB video plus 20 GB MATROX HDD. It&#39;s used by my wife and my 6yo kid as a terminal to connect to my PC and run in XP a different user (yes, you can connect 2 or more users, each with his own desktop under XP, using Remote Desktop Connection) for browsing web mostly. The wife for e-mail/eBay mainly and the kid to play the so many free games internet has to offer. They launch XP on that machine then use RDC to connect to mine and do the stuff.</p>
<p>My stupid computer skill regarding that PC is that I know what they are doing only by listening the motherboard/hdd sounds does without requiring me to watch on their monitor. The motherboard does some squishy sounds and the hdd is quite loud when crouching tracks. What the XP in that PC does internally don&#39;t ask me (ask Ray, he sure knows) but I am able to say based on sounds at what kind of page they are on web based on those sounds only. The most annoying is when my wife is starting to respond to a query on internal message eBay provides. Until she exits the response page the MB is literally crying out loud. Was fun at beginning (5 years ago), not so much today.</p>

		<p>i could tell, by listening to the mode screeching, if my dial-up connection was going to connect, or fail (because of wrong password, or something else). also, i was able to predict the connection speed, 56k or 32k.</p>
<p>also, like many others, i can hear crts too. i don&#39;t think its 50Hz though. its a very high frequency, possibly 15kHz or 16kHz, out of range for most adults.</p>

		<p>As a child in the 80&#39;s, I had a Sinclair ZX Spectrum who used an analog tape for storage. When loading, the computer would play the audio. Now, some games had a &quot;splash screen&quot;, who would load directly into the oddly-layed-out video memory. The sound of these screens burned into my memory, and 20 years later I used that memory to figure out the data rate of the tape storage (~200 bytes/sec).</p>
<p>I too can hear the ~15KHz sound of CRT TVs and mono computer monitors. I have to get a 100Hz TV to avoid that sound.</p>

		<p>For the CRT-listeners out there &#8211; I too was / am able to do this, and found the noise maddening. I had heard that it was the high frequencies generated via the <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flyback_transformer" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Flyback_transformer</a> which produces the noises as a function of the scanning.</p>

		<p>Speaking of hearing CRTs: &nbsp;Someone once reported that their dog knew when they switched from DOS into Windows (probably 3.1) and would start whining. &nbsp;Something about the sound emitted by the &quot;flyback transformer&quot; when going from text-mode into graphics mode.</p>
<p>And my sister can hear flourescent lights, which are also out of the range of most people&#39;s hearing (but annoying to her).</p>

		<p>@ChuckOp: there&#39;s nothing stupid about that talent. Good for your health (avoids RSI, since the mouse is a much bigger contributor than the keyboard) and can speed up productivity tremendously by avoiding costly switches. I can do this and the opposite as well (operate the computer solely by mouse when there&#39;s no keyboard). Entering text with any sort of speed is the challenge, of course &#8212; if you don&#39;t install a third-party program, charmap is your only hope.</p>
<p>I can&#39;t think of any stupid computer talent I have. Even the esoteric ones have all been useful, I&#39;d hesitate to call any of them stupid lest my luck abandon me. The one I least use is probably the ability to discern the type and rough content of embedded binary data through its text representation, but I suspect almost everyone who&#39;s done even slight reverse engineering can do this. Least useful in this day and age is probably the ability to write 6502 assembly &#8212; in hex. A9 0C 8D 20 D0 A9 06 8D 21 D1&#8230; 60.</p>

		<p>While in High School, one of my friends dad was a sysadmin at ISP in 94&#39; &#8211; he had a wicked setup of a desktop tower, every time his computer would write to disk I had feel a tingle in my body. &nbsp;The tingle felt like a small shock. His dad didn&#39;t believe me, so they blind folded me and covered my ears, again, I could feel a tingle. &nbsp;Through out my years I&#39;ll randomly feel a tingle when around some sort of electronic device that may not have a full &quot;protective&quot; covering over it.</p>
<p>I can also tell when a tv or monitor is still on (though no connection), my ears hear a faint high pitch noise.</p>
<p>I hope to live a long life around all these devices :)</p>

I got very good at using the HDD indicator light to confirm I typed things correctly. I could handle most all admin tasks this way much to the amazement of the people sitting nea me in lab.</p>

		<p>I can pretty quickly count in binary on my fingers. &nbsp;For numbers &lt; 32, I basically don&#39;t have to think about it at all, but carrying from the LSH (least significant hand) to the MSH takes a few cycles.</p>

		<p>@steve:</p>
<p>Sorry, ATH doesn&#39;t work that way. To switch a modem to command mode, you have to wait 2 second pause, then +++, then 2 sec pause again. Only then it will handle the ATH command. Otherwise it&#39;s just data.</p>

		<p>Used to be able to operate the ole&#39; win98 machine keyboard-only. Much like the early war-proof Siemens M35, certain functions didn&#39;t need visual feedback. The fun part was when we didn&#39;t have a power strip handy and only 2 sockets on a party. Box, speakers, keyboard and getting everything else running blind. Foobar2000 is one helluva player.</p>

		<p>I can tell if the light in the fiber optic cables we use isn&#39;t right just by looking at it.</p>

		<p>People ask me questions about EXE, DLL, LIB, or OBJ files. I open the file in Vim (my favorite text editor), look around, find the answer, and tell them what they need to know.</p>
<p>Sure, I could use a hex editor, but my hex editor isn&#39;t nearly as good at finding strings in the file.</p>

		<p>Back in the university, I can know whether a computer in computing lab have been infected with virus by merely hearing how it&#39;s harddisk spins. (I remember in year 2, I know the PC I&#39;m using is infected the instant I&#39;m working on it, and later proved it was Nimda.)</p>
<p>Then again, I have much better ear at that time, and the harddisk sound are much louder than today&#39;s.</p>

		<p>I knew my floppy drives were about to go out of alignment by the sound they made. &nbsp;I could also realign them using the same method.

		<p>As a uni student, I got special access to the university&#39;s CDC 6400. (I think this was the most powerful computer in the southern hemisphere at the time.) I eventually learned how to program the deadstart panel: a 12 x 12 matrix of switches that bootstrapped the whole machine. I reprogrammed it to do something funky, when you pressed the system deadstart button! Unfortunately, I&#39;ve forgotten what that funky thing was :-(</p>

<p>That&#39;s only true (requiring a pause around the +++ and the AT command) for modems that licensed the Hayes &#39;302 patent. (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Independent_Escape_Sequence" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Time_Independent_Escape_Sequence</a>) &nbsp;</p>
<p>Modem manufacturers who were unwilling to pay the license fee had to go with a straight guard character scheme which was vulnerable to the type of tricks Steve was describing.</p>

		<p>&quot;I think the frequency you get from a CRT television is around 15 kHz, a high pitched whine that many folks can&#39;t hear well, but drives others up the wall.&quot; &#8212; drives me up the wall!</p>
<p>&quot;Back in the university, I can know whether a computer in computing lab have been infected with virus by merely hearing how it&#39;s harddisk spins. (I remember in year 2, I know the PC I&#39;m using is infected the instant I&#39;m working on it, and later proved it was Nimda.)&quot; &#8212; same here, but also used to know that by just looking at the HDD led.</p>
<p>&quot;I used to be able to predict the connection speed based on the handshaking sounds.&quot; &#8212; same here, was really fun times!</p>
<p>Used to tell if a program is corrupted by listening to the sound of it loading off of a cassette to my AIX-170 machine.</p>
<p>I can most of the time accurately estimate the entropy of a file contents by listening to it. Hence being able to tell how much you can compress that file regardless to the algorithm you use.</p>
<p>I know ASL/AML.</p>

		<p>I was able to figure out what character was on a punch card by looking at</p>
<p>where the holes where. &nbsp; Sometimes you would &quot;dupe&quot; an incorrect card up to</p>
<p>where you wanted to make a correction, then type the correct char but sometimes</p>
<p>there was no ink on the ribbon so you could not see if you really typed the correct</p>
<p>char so you had to have the ability to read the chars just by where the holes were.</p>
<p>You also had to use a magic marker to put a squiggly line down your card deck so that</p>
<p>if you ever dropped your deck and the cards got mixed up you could restore the order</p>
<p>by restoring the squiggly line.</p>

		<p>I am good at measuring keyboard. In a old video game, to produce some action, you need to press several (&gt;15) keys in a specific sequence, and you need to press two or even three keys together in the middle of the sequence. I can produce the action very smoothly in a good keyboard. So every time when my friend buys new keyboard, they bring me together. We just install the video game, and let me run my fingers and count how many actions I can produce in 1 minute.</p>

		<p>@Maurits: Me too. I demonestrated how to use my teacher&#39;s email address to send email to me on computing lab, solely to prove that this is possible. (For why I had do that&#8230; my university had a Unix server with SendMail enabled at that time. I told her that the system admins didn&#39;t secure which account and send email by what email address, so basically everyone who has normal user account on the server can send email as any valid email address on the server)</p>

		<p>I could tell if RAM on my 286 was being used by the high-pitched sound it made. I could also unlock the keyboard lock on it with a small screwdriver (which proved very useful when my father wanted to prevent me from using it).</p>
<p>Sending mail by telnetting to the SMTP port is something I regularly do to test mail servers.</p>
<p>I also have the ability to just be near a computer, and it magically fixes itself (proven to even work over the phone).</p>

		<p>Back in old Amiga 500 days, while playing adventure games such as Dungeon Master and The Faery Tale Adventure you could get alerted that a monster was appearing by listening on the disc drive that started to load the monster data. For some games I learned to distinguish what kind of monster it could be by hearing how far the reading head was moving and how the drive sounded while loading. It didn&#39;t work all the time, but often.</p>

		<p>I have l33t protection cracking skillz on the 6502 BBC Micro. Cracked every game I tried except Exile, which was a doozy:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://exile.acornarcade.com/devel.html" rel="nofollow">exile.acornarcade.com/devel.html</a></p>
<p>&lt;quote&gt;</p>
<p>The disk loading mechanism was entertaining. After all the clever disk encoding it loaded the program into memory, but the entire thing is encrypted. At the end of this is a decoder routine with self modifying code (it just updates the arguments such as the #40 in LDA #40, not the code itself). This starts low down in memory (&amp;1100 for example) and starts decrypting code byte by byte. It has no check for when it&#39;s reached the end though &#8211; it just keeps stepping through memory until it reaches itself at which point it &quot;decrypts&quot; the decrypting routine, turning it into a jump statement to start the game proper. To decode it you have to copy the decryption routine elsewhere in memory, but update both your copy and the original so that the decryption works. With PC beeb emulators I&#39;m sure this all becomes trivial as we can just set a break point when the program counter reaches a certain point. Takes half the fun out of it though &#8211; to me cracking the code was always a significant part of the fun (sometimes more fun than the game itself). Kevin Edwards was the king of copyright protection and the only game author that truely defeated all my attempts :-) He had the bright idea of encrypting using the 1MHz hardware timer values, the code doing the encryption, and the program counter. This means that the code cannot be modified, it cannot be moved (as it&#39;s position dependent) and it cannot be easily simulated due to the real-time nature of the hardware clocks. Truely a genius. It&#39;d be interesting to see if any of the beeb emulators can work with his software.</p>
<p>&lt;/quote&gt;</p>

		<p>10 years ago or so, working part-time during college, I diagnosed a problem we were having with our web server by telnetting to it and typing in HTTP commands. My boss was over my shoulder watching, a little surprised at this talent, and said quite sincerely, &quot;You need to spend more time with your girlfriend.&quot;</p>
<p>(Now I&#39;m happily married to that girlfriend, and can still type fluent HTTP, so I suppose I&#39;ve got the best of both worlds‽)</p>

		<p>@JM: &nbsp;I was never a 6502 hacker. &nbsp;I did my share of RCA1802 machine-level programming around my own wire-wrapped SuperELF around 1980. &nbsp;I remember that F8 is Load Accumulator and that&#39;s about it.</p>
<p>I did some digging and I think you&#39;re changing the background and border colors on a C-64. &nbsp;The functional error is possibly STA $D121 should be STA $D021. &nbsp;Not sure what the other error is.</p>

		<p>I still know my Win95 product key by heart. This was useful because I had to reinstall it&#8230; quite a lot.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
