<p>It seems that whenever there is a technology conference, there's a decent chance that somebody will ask me via email or a comment whether I'm going.</p>
<p> The default answer to <i>Are you going to this conference?</i> is <i>No</i>. </p>
<p> You may find it hard to believe, but going to conferences around the world is not part of my job. My job is to sit in front of a computer and read ema^W^Wwork on code. I'm not a marketing person or a program manager who goes around promoting some feature or service. I'm the person back in Redmond actually implementing it. </p>
<p> The answer to "<a href="http://www.openmalaysiablog.com/2007/09/an-afternoon-wi.html">Why isn't Raymond at TechEd?</a>" is "Hm, let's see. Spend a few vacation days and a few thousand dollars of my own money on travel, accommodations, and registration for a conference I will derive no benefit from? For some reason, that's not my idea of a fun time." </p>
<p> In other words, if you want me to attend your conference, you have to invite me. That's what the folks at <a href="http://sinfo.ist.utl.pt/en/"> XV Semana Inform&aacute;tica do Instituto Superior T&eacute;cnico</a> did. I'll be there on March 11th to tell stories about Windows history. I don't have a specific list of stories set up yet, so if you want to suggest something, you can post a comment and I'll see if I can work it in. I've got 90 minutes to fill, so that's going to be a lot of stories. I'm usually game for burning some vacation days if the conference is held somewhere interesting, because I can tack on a little vacation after the conference is over. </p>
<p> (It also means that this Web site will be on autopilot from March 10th to the 20th because I'll be out of the country and unlikely to log on just to moderate comments.) </p>
<p> The conference organizers have reassured me that I will not have to give my talk in Portuguese. </p>
<p> You can save having to foot my travel and lodging expenses if you <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=%22TechReady+6%22"> hold your conference in Seattle</a>. Then again, I'm not actually an invited speaker or anything at TechReady, so I won't be able to get into the conference center. I'm just showing up at tonight's blogger geek dinner offsite. </p>
<p> <b>Pre-emptive snarky comment</b>: "Blogger" and "geek" are redundant. </p>

		<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&#8217;m part of the team organizing this event, and I just wanted to thank Raymond Chen for accepting our invitation!</p>
<p>His presentation will be one of the high points of the week, and we&#8217;re working to see if we can record it and make it available for download.</p>
<p>And since many of you have experience in this type of events (either as an organizer or as an attendee), feel free to suggest things we should (not) do!</p>
<p>Thanks in advance,</p>
<p>Andr&#233; Nogueira</p>

		<p>Thank you for pointing that out &#8211; it&#8217;s been fixed!</p>
<p>I guess it was one of those cases where you read what you &quot;know&quot; is there, and not what&#8217;s really there&#8230;</p>

		<p>I get those conference event brochures all the time. &nbsp;There&#8217;s a big one in California that keeps bothering me about Web development, or Perl, or C#, or whatever. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve never really be all that impressed with the content of these conferences, but perhaps learning something new may not be the purpose. &nbsp;If you think of conferences more as symposia (symposium being Greek for &quot;drinking party&quot;) it may be just a chance to rub elbows with other luminaries and increase your geek cred. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Yeah. &nbsp;I&#8217;m not much for hobnobbing either.</p>

		<p>I expect to learn things, network (in the social sense), and have fun at a conference. However, I do mostly go to free software conferences, which are not too expensive and relatively free of marketing guff. Maybe you should go to some of those. ;-)</p>

		<p>[You can&#8217;t seriously believe I can say, &#8220;Oh look there&#8217;s a Microsoft sales conference in Paris. I&#8217;m going to sign up and make Microsoft pay for it.&#8221; -Raymond]</p>
<p>Somewhat of a strawman, Raymond. &nbsp;Assuming there is a conference of some kind in (let&#8217;s say) the western half of the US, and it would be beneficial either for you or for MS for you to attend, would MS pay for it? &nbsp;In my niche of the software development industry it&#8217;s not all that uncommon for the boss to pay to send some people to some conferences every once in a while.</p>

		<p>&gt; Why would an MS employee attending an MS conference have to use vacation days and pay their own way?</p>
<p>You&#8217;d be amazed how many companies treat their employees this way. The bigger the company, the more likely it is, IME. Budgets. Bean counters. Budgets. Screwing immediate* expenses down as far as possible. Budgets.</p>
<p>* The long term expenses involved when the pissed off employee leaves is another matter, and is generally not considered.</p>

		<p>Hey, I might pay you a visit there: I live in Cascais, only 20 Kms (13 miles) away from where the conference is going to be held. :-)</p>
<p>Hope you like the Portuguese food, it&#8217;s very tasty&#8230; and the weather, although summer would have been a much, much, better time to visit, hehe.</p>

		<p>Please tell some bc stories like how you had to add a hidden, fake desktop properties tab to let a certain program mess about as usual, how a bug in Sim City 2000 was &quot;fixed&quot; in win95 and how you fixed pinball in winxp. Things like that :)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
