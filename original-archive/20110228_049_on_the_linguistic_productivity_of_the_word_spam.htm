		<p>I&#39;m not convinced; the only words of those which I&#39;ve heard before are spamdexing and spambot.</p>

		<p>You might be interested to know that in French the word for spam is pourriel, which is a portmanteau of poubelle (trash bin) and courriel (itself a portmanteau for courrier electronique = email). &nbsp;The start of the word could also be related to the word pourri, which means rotten.</p>

		<p>Like Adam, I&#39;m not sure how widespread the usage is. In my case I&#39;ve heard of spim (though not recently, and it was always with an explanation of the meaning, so even that is probably not used much). Spambot is the only one that sounds unremarkable to me to the extent that I&#39;d use it myself. Not sure I&#39;ve ever heard spamdex. The others I wouldn&#39;t even be able to guess what they mean without an explanation.</p>

		<p>It has changed the meaning of the word a lot over the last decade or so though. &nbsp;I never think of the Austin, MN based canned meat product when I hear the word Spam anymore without a qualifier. &nbsp;&quot;I hate Spam, the meat product.&quot;</p>
<p>What wonders Austin, MN has brought to the world. &nbsp;Both Spam and John Madden hail from there.</p>

		<p>There&#39;s also a related term &quot;bacn&quot; which never caught on. It means emails that are not spam (because you agreed to receive them) but don&#39;t really convey much useful information, such as notifications from social networking sites and blogs.</p>

		<p>@c</p>
<p>Yeah, they don&#39;t exist. 167,000 Google results just means that there are 167,000 copies of this site in an attempt in spamdexing, er wait a sec&#8230;</p>
<p>(Although a few that are words also used for other things turn up more, but still tend to have something related to this in their results)</p>

		<p>I guarantee you there are not 167,000 results, if you were to actually click through. Google takes a guess at the number of results. It *usually* overestimates.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
