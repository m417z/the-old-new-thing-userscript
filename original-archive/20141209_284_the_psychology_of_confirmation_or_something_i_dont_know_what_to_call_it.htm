		<p>This seems pretty normal to me. &nbsp;If I use an approach provided by a forum user and it doesn&#39;t work, I&#39;ll generally shoot back a &quot;No-go, do I need to have anything else configured?&quot; message and then go Googling for the answer myself. &nbsp;If the forum gets back to me first, so much the better, but it&#39;s not uncommon for that last line to be &quot;Thanks, I just found those settings (and some other tips) at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.linkforposterity.com">http://www.linkforposterity.com</a> and it&#39;s working.&quot;</p>

		<p>Users often tell you&#39;ve they&#39;ve tried something according to your instructions when they simply haven&#39;t at all. &nbsp;This sounds like a way they can resolve the ensuing cognitive dissonance.</p>

		<p>Maybe I&#39;m in the minority here, but it&#39;s a minor pet peeve for me when people update with things like &quot;Thanks, I just found those settings (and some other tips) at <a href="http://www.linkforposterity.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.linkforposterity.com</a> and it&#39;s working.&quot;</p>
<p>Invariably, I come across the post six months later, and linkforposterity.com has done a site revamp and the link is now dead. If I&#39;m lucky, Archive.org has it.</p>
<p>I prefer to update with &quot;Thanks, I just found that you need LtU&amp;E set to 42 or higher to use Snap/Crackle over Pop (and some other tips) at <a href="http://www.linkforposterity.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.linkforposterity.com</a> and it&#39;s working. &lt;Optional cut and paste of paragraph in question, if appropriate&gt;&quot;</p>

		<p>Possibly related, I find that it is much more likely I find something if someone tells me where it is, even if I already looked there and didn&#39;t find it, be it a product in a store aisle or a food item in a particular place in the fridge</p>

<p>If I&#39;m standing over a user&#39;s shoulder watching, whatever problem they wanted me to see will never occur.</p>
<p>Mysteriously, sending step-by-step instructions and even a screencast, the customer is unable to get something to work. &nbsp;But if a developer is within 3m, the setting mysteriously has the intended effect.</p>

		<p>The act of forcing the user to go through the steps resolves the issue. Same too with hovering over their shoulder. It&#39;s like assembling those pieces of furniture that come with the multi-step instructions. Sometimes you glaze over a few steps and get stuck. Only the act of going back and retracing your steps will work, even if when doing so you (think you) did nothing different than before.</p>
<p>In reality you missed a step. Go back and doing it correctly unsurprisingly resolves the issue.</p>

		<p>Sometimes this is the result of the user inventing a feature (or the behavior of a feature) completely and assuming that checking the box in Dialog Y is what enables their imaginary feature. Then, when you explain to them what the option actually does (or they gather the actual behavior from the context of your explanation), they realize that it&#39;s working as intended.</p>

<p>Amen to that. It once took me 2 weeks of back-and-forth to figure out that when a Japanese customer said an RSS feed &quot;stopped working&quot;, they meant the summaries in the feed had decreased from 175 to 125 characters. I could see the feed being requested by their system, could request the feed myself and see what to my eyes looked like a perfectly valid feed (and it was, just different to what they had received earlier), but the most I ever got out of them was that it &quot;wasn&#39;t working&quot;.</p>

		<p>I agree this phenomenon needs a good name.</p>

<p>Maybe the person was doing it right, but, wasn&#39;t using the same &#39;configuration details&#39; that you mentioned. They changed their configuration settings and now it works. Seems simple and obvious to me. Which of course means I&#39;m probably wrong.</p>

		<p>I experience &quot;it doesn&#39;t work&quot; all the time, it seems almost like a form of Confirmation bias, where they have a mental model of the system (that is not working when they use it &quot;correctly&quot;) so are just looking for others to confirm &quot;it is broken&quot; (like Google is down) verse they mis-understand how it&#39;s used, or what the expected results should be. They are not open to the idea, that their not following the instructions might be the cause of the issue, and also are not open to how such a mis-alignment might be resolved, thus do not frame the &quot;issue&quot; in a context that enable fast resolution of the difference of models. </p>
<p>The few issue reports you get that are truly descriptive, of expectations, steps, and known starting state, usually demonstrate your talking to a fellow tester/developer.</p>

		<p>@Dave Bacher &#8211; It&#39;s a well known fact, not just to IT world but to every other domain. Here are some 1st hand experiences from people I personally know and they said happened to them. My older brother is a electronic technician, with an experience that spans from &#39;70 to today. Half the time was called to repair the client TV/Radio/Stereo etc, the defect was not there, the electronic device was working perfectly. Most times was called back with the message: &quot;after 5 minutes you walked out the door the defect reappeared&quot;. One of my friends is also with 30+ years experience in his field, he is a plummer. Like my brother, half the times was called the pipe/valve/toilet bowl etc was working like a charm. Plenty of times same call: &quot;5 minutes after you left was not working again&quot;. Another friend is a car technician. Same deal -&gt; goes to client -&gt; car is working perfectly -&gt; leave -&gt; car is broken again within the same day. Needles to say I experienced this within IT in my 20+ years of dealing with computers, both in support and development. It&#39;s like the PC/TV/pipe/car has a life of its own, and once a very competent person is nearby realizes is futile to misbehave. I do believe this is something eventually the quantum mechanics will figure it out because definitely there is something more and our actions from a far does have reactions at levels we still don&#39;t understand or realize.</p>

		<p>@Steven Don: That&#39;s why most of the modern support ticket system have &quot;expected behavior&quot; field, that make them state clearly what they think is &quot;wrong&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Danny: My brother&#39;s computer cannot boot (no screen, no trace of POST action sound, no hardware beep, fans spinning). When we took it to computer shop, it works perfectly. After we take the computer back home, it booted successfully for a few months then fails with the same symptoms again. Then it works again after we took it to computer shop, no part is changed during that.</p>
<p>The technician is helpful enough to let us replace anything except the harddisk (power, RAM, motherboard, CPU, etc.) once at a time but the problem keeps recurring. When his computer dies again, we joke that &quot;There&#39;s nothing wrong in there, his computer just want to take a walk to the shop again&quot;.</p>

		<p>@cheong00: Sometimes there isn&#39;t any more to say about how it should work. A bug report for a hypthetical &quot;service&quot; command. If I type &quot;service httpd start&quot; then I expect it to start the httpd service. A shorter way of saying that is &quot;It should work correctly.&quot;</p>
<p>The hard part is always identifying the meaning of &quot;correct&quot; or even in my example, &quot;httpd&quot;. If the httpd service is aliased to nginx when it was apache last week, I can see how the bug reporter would think that was a bug while the developer would think it&#39;s correct.</p>
<p>This easily leads to both sides deciding the other is an idiot, since it&#39;s clear to the developer that this user didn&#39;t configure his nginx web server, while the user sees the obvious fact that it worked last week and doesn&#39;t work now, and doesn&#39;t realize an entirely different &quot;httpd&quot; is running. Double points if neither the dev working on the bug or the user realize someone else changed the httpd alias.</p>

		<p>Yeah, it&#39;s pretty familiar. The tester can reproduce a problem 100% of the time &#8211; until he calls the developer over, at which point the problem vanishes and is never seen again.</p>
<p>Of course, the opposite also happens&#8230; long-standing bugs that went unnoticed until the tester found them, at which point they start occurring all the time.</p>

		<p>@cheong00: that&#39;s different. Your case sounds more like a bad solder joint or something like that; the movement and vibration of taking it to the computer shop could be enough to &quot;fix&quot; it temporarily.</p>
<p>What @Danny and @Dave Bacher are talking about is the opposite; the gadget is not moved, instead the technician moves towards the gadget. The physical proximity of a knowledgeable person is the variable in these cases.</p>

<p>I had a similar problem once. Main symptom was an erratic KB, but only sometimes, and replacing the KB didn&#39;t help. Moving my PC to a grounded outlet (found out the one I had it plugged into was the ONLY ungrounded outlet in my apartment after plugging in a new GFI surge suppressor), and every problem I had went away like magic.</p>

<p>A crash, of any sort, should NEVER be As Designed. The program should log exceptions, but it should always gracefully handle them. Even if you HAVE to shut down because an exception places your app in an unknown state, you should always gracefully close (and provide whatever diagnostic details might be necessary to resolve the problem manually).</p>
<p>The only time a hard crash is acceptable is when it occurs in code you can&#39;t access. And even that&#39;s avoidable most of the time.</p>

		<p>@Zan Lynx&#39;: By quoting that, of course the unspoken part is the &quot;problem description&quot; field states the unhelpful &quot;it doesn&#39;t work&quot; text.</p>
<p>And btw, in your example of HTTPD unable to start, of course the &quot;expected behavior&quot; should be &quot;the web server start successfully after the command is executed&quot;, not something like &quot;It should work correctly.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course we know there should be something went wrong if you have to submit bug report, but if you don&#39;t let us know what went wrong, there&#39;s nothing we could do except calling them by phnoe.</p>

		<p>re @Anon</p>
<p>What exactly is the difference between &#39;shutting down because an exception places your app in an unknown state&#39; and &#39;crashing&#39;? &nbsp; I see none. &nbsp;What we call (application) crashing is simply a system-provided handler that shuts down an application because an app has placed it in an unknown state.</p>
<p>Are we merely talking about the distinction between displaying, say, a cloud of registers, and printing out &#39;Something unexpected happened but displaying this message is somehow friendlier&#39; ?</p>

<p>It&#39;s possible, however, imagine if the problem is something like rough running at idle &#8211; if the car&#39;s systems are in good working order, there&#39;s nothing the user can do with the car&#39;s controls that could cause that.

<p>The caller is responsible for handling the exception. The library should just return the PROPER exception. A segfault which shows that the pointer is invalid is perfectly fine, but</p>
<p>However, you should probably handle the case anyway, lest your library become known as &quot;that garbage that can&#39;t return a proper exception to the caller and instead brings down the entire process.&quot;</p>
<p>@dave</p>
<p>There&#39;s a MASSIVE UX difference between your application hard-crashing, and handling an exception with a friendly message to the user. For one thing, if your application hard-crashes, you&#39;re giving up the ability to log a lot of the information you might need to solve the problem.</p>

<p>There ARE things the user could do. First thing that comes to mind is that they could be resting a foot on the gas or brake, either of which could cause &#39;inexplicable&#39; issues. Someone new in the car might not habitually put their feet or hands on the same controls.</p>

		<p>I would say that this pattern happens because the user doesn&#39;t have a time machine. There is a high probability that the conversation will go as:</p>
<p> &quot;It doesn&#39;t work.&quot;</p>

<p>(on googling for a problem only to find your own unanswered question about it)</p>
<p>We had an amusing variation of this recently. Opened a support ticket for a problem we were experiencing with a certain piece of software. They also opened discussions with us by email. While they were working on it, we came up with a workaround, which we posted to the support ticket. After another week or so, in the email discussions they said they&#39;d found a potential solution &#8211; which turned out to be a verbatim quote of the workaround we&#39;d posted to the support ticket.</p>

		<p>@raymond</p>
<p>&quot;A valid memory range&quot; just means &quot;not a flat-out impossible pointer.&quot; &nbsp;Can I write to the first 8k of memory? 16k? 32k? 64k? No? Then a &#39;pointer&#39; that small should be outright rejected as impossible. Do I have a maximum theoretical limit on my pointer range? Then I should reject any pointer higher than that.</p>
<p>But you&#39;ve missed the part where I indicate that you should log the exception and gracefully shut down.</p>
<p>If you&#39;re writing a library, you should return an appropriate response. If the caller gives you the same bad pointer twice, after you&#39;ve told them you got an exception accessing it the first time, that&#39;s hardly your fault. But you should, the first time, say &quot;That&#39;s not right.&quot; Crashing inside your library without telling the caller is the equivalent of ripping the house down around you because someone asked for a pencil and you couldn&#39;t find one.</p>
<p>&quot;Crashing&quot; means your application just disappears, leaving a cryptic (to them) error that most users have *no hope* of debugging, possibly no hope of reproducing, and worst of all &#8211; no hope of fixing.</p>
<p>Logging it and shutting down (NOT just ignoring it) means your application disappears, but gives the user the opportunity to contact support with Useful information.</p>
<p>In short: I&#39;m not saying that you should eat the exception and continue as though nothing at all happened, nor am I saying that it is possible to validate literally every possible pointer.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>If you just crash on the invalid pointer, then the app will take its normal &quot;oh no, I crashed!&quot; measures, be that logging a stack trace, recording a crash dump, etc. Since you are a library, you don&#39;t know what logging system the app uses, so where will you log it? Into some custom log that only your library uses? Then the app author will say &quot;My users tell me that it crashes in this library, but it&#39;s not showing up in my crash logs.&quot; -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>I&#39;ve always termed this the &#39;white coat syndrome&#39;. It&#39;s a well known fact that seeing a white coat (a doctor&#39;s) causes one&#39;s blood pressure to increase. Similarly, when technical support is within 3m (as per Dave Bacher), whatever didn&#39;t work before will now work. I think that the physical presence of the technician causes the person to concentrate more on the task to be solved.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
