<p>One way to show that somebody is incompetent is to tell them that something they're doing is stupid, even when it's not what they're doing. Take for example <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/31/6909007.aspx#6921918"> this comment saying that it's stupid for copy and paste to use data objects which can allow code to execute</a>. Um, we were talking about drag and drop, not copy and paste. And in fact, the copy and paste functionality of console windows hasn't changed. You can still copy and paste with impunity.</p>
<p> Second example: "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/07/29/9851533.aspx#9852554">And yet, the feature I really want is never implemented: Rearranging the taskbar</a>." Except it isn't true. <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/windows7/Whats-new-with-the-Windows-7-taskbar"> Windows&nbsp;7 implemented it</a>. </p>
<p> Third example: "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/10/6648396.aspx#6728957">Or we could sideline the cmd.exe stuff and restart with a bash style interpreter</a>." I thought we did that and called it <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/powershell/"> PowerShell</a>. </p>
<p> Fourth example: "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/02/15/7703995.aspx#7735730">If the OS had its own thread and stack for displaying application errors which worked for _any_ application error (stack overflow included), then nobody would have to even think about writing such hacks</a>." Windows Vista already implemented your suggestion. </p>
<p> Fifth example: "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/11/26/6523907.aspx#6624411">There should be an API which will hide the registry accesses. I'm talking about things like registering a file extension</a>." Oh, you mean the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc144154.aspx"> Default Programs</a> API? </p>
<p> Actually, my examples sort of morphed into people asking for features which already exist. Oh well, I guess it wasn't a very good rant, then. </p>

		<p>Although I generally like your blog I must say that sometimes you have a tendency to express yourself a little harsh. Sometimes people just don&#39;t know about feature X or Y. Calling them &quot;incompetent&quot; is a little harsh; uneducated: maybe :-)</p>

<p>I&#39;m guessing the mysterious new &quot;conhost.exe&quot; process that runs for every console window handles console windows now and runs as a normal user process?</p>

		<p>&quot;Actually, my examples sort of morphed into people asking for features which already exist.&quot;</p>
<p>No doubt, this very post will end up the same way. Here&#39;s mine, though I&#39;m pretty sure it doesn&#39;t, in fact, exist yet: having a taskbar on every monitor with the tasks for that monitor. There&#39;s a 3rd-party solution for it that does a pretty good though not perfect job of it, UltraMon (feel free to remove that name if you think it&#39;s inappropriate), but with every new version of Windows, I keep checking the added-feature-list to see if native support for it has been implemented. Most of the people I know who work with multiple monitors find it indispensable and your statement that multiple monitors are popular at MS is no doubt true, so I find it rather surprising that this hasn&#39;t shown up on the feature list yet. Oh well, maybe in Windows 8.</p>

		<p>Powershell is not bash. It&#39;s not even bash-like. What makes the UNIX shell so very powerful is that all the rest of the stuff in /bin and /usr/bin was designed from the ground up to work with it&#8230; and that stuff is a pretty small amount of code, these days. All of Interix is pretty small. Why not just bundle it with ALL versions of Windows, so it&#39;s always there?</p>
<p>Look, Powershell is probably a pretty damn good re-implementation of DCL, but there&#39;s a reason that running the UNIX shell on VMS was always a hell of a lot more popular than running the VMS shell on UNIX. Yes, someone really did a DCL port to UNIX. Does that sound weird to you, too? Then why would you write something like &quot;I thought we did that and called it PowerShell?&quot;</p>

		<p>Alas, the way taskbar rearranging was implemented means it wasn&#39;t implemented for me, after all. You can only move groups of icons, not icons themselves. When I have five Explorer windows opened, I cannot rearrange them. I can only drag the five icons as a whole which I never want to do. So the complaining person might be correct after all&#8230;</p>

		<p>Where bash has /usr/bin et al., PowerShell has the .NET Framework (and any executable that might be lying around). I would say that&#39;s an improvement over bash.</p>

		<p>In my defense, my comment about rearranging the task bar was before Windows 7 came out, and so it was before I had access to it. And also for the record, I did search before posting it.</p>
<p>So, get a time machine and let me know that Windows 7 will have rearranging the task bar before I post that message. I was informed afterwards, and was happy to hear about it.</p>

		<p>&quot;One way to show that somebody is incompetent is to tell them that something they&#39;re doing is stupid, even when it&#39;s not what they&#39;re doing.&quot;</p>
<p>Taking this one step further, one way to show that somebody is incompetent is give an incorrect example when they say &quot;[fill in the above statement]&quot;. Powershell might be very nice, but to say that it&#39;s &quot;bash style&quot; shows a serious misunderstanding of bash, and Unix shells (e.g. bash, tcsh, zsh, ksh) in general. Powershell is nowhere near any of the Unix shells when it comes to interactive use. This is semi-understandable since the fast majority of Windows users don&#39;t use the command-line. But, those of us who do are immediately aware of Powershell&#39;s inferiority as an interactive command interpreter.</p>

		<p>If all the stuff in /bin and /usr/bin was designed to work together, why does ps have 18 pages of options (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/CGI/man-cgi?ps" rel="nofollow">unixhelp.ed.ac.uk/&#8230;/man-cgi</a>) when grep, sort, and cut should do everything you need?</p>

		<p>The rearranging of the taskbar that you speak of is only half the story. Take a Windows 7 taskbar that is set to &quot;Never combine&quot; taskbar buttons, open 3 folders in Explorer, try rearranging those 3 items in the taskbar within the group. In case I am mistaken and that IS indeed possible, please, someone enlighten me.</p>
<p>Also, IIRC the taskbar was introduced in Windows 95 and your response is &quot;Well, we (kinda) implemented it 15 years later. Stop complaining!&quot;.</p>

		<p>To all you guys complaining about how Powershell is not like the Unix shells you know and love &#8211; well, it is not a Unix shell! Powershell&#39;s did not have it as a goal to make Unix hackers job easier on Windows &#8211; it was to make Windows more manageable and administrable. And you can alias any existing commandlet in powershell and give it a two letter name to make your muscle memory work.</p>
<p>On that note, I am interested to hear what you mean when you say that it is not interactive?</p>

<p>A Unix one-liner, brilliant stuff. &nbsp;I too can write a one-line gem of a perl command, but good luck understanding it ever again. &nbsp;And you&#39;re not exaggerating one bit when you say its 30 lines to replicate that. &nbsp;The idea that the utils work together is a fantasy, realy, but thats entirely subjective. &nbsp;I mean, heck, I find that writing batch scripts isn&#39;t so bad, so I must be some kind of crazy.</p>

		<p>Isn&#39;t this what in politics and debate is called a &quot;straw man&quot; argument? &nbsp;&quot;Some people on the other side (from me) think we should do such-and-such. &nbsp;This is stupid, and here&#39;s why&quot;. &nbsp;Or &quot;My opponent advocates killing babies&quot;. &nbsp;You set up a straw man (that doesn&#39;t really exist) and then knock him down. &nbsp;Maybe this isn&#39;t exactly the same thing&#8230;</p>

		<p>So, what exactly is your problem? Your coelagues at Microsoft are as guilty as everyone else. How many MS products use undocumented Windows APIs *instead of* the documented ones, which are there since Server 2003? Let&#39;s start with the main offenders: Office, SQL Server, Hyper-V.</p>

		<p>Peter da Silva: @Marquess: That&#39;s why it takes 30-40 lines of PowerShell code to duplicate a typical UNIX one-liner?</p>
<p>Maybe you could tell us what the 30-40 lines of PowerShell (and the UNIX one-liner) *are*, and we can point out how awfully-written your PowerShell is. Just a suggestion.</p>
<p>The real reason UNIX is &quot;more powerful&quot; is: habit. You&#39;re used to working with it, and *nix users hate, hate, *hate* learning anything new. So if it&#39;s old and barely functional, you love it to death, and if it&#39;s new and significantly more powerful, you hate it.</p>
<p>For example, PowerShell can do things like, say, pipe non-text data around. That&#39;s extremely powerful, but if you talk to a *nix person, they&#39;ll just claim, &quot;yeah but nobody ever does that!&quot; (Hm, do you think they don&#39;t do that because their tool sucks for it?)</p>
<p>I&#39;m stereotyping here, of course. But so far it&#39;s been true of every *nix user I&#39;ve talked to for more than a few minutes. Sorry if it seems like a flame.</p>
<p>That all said, to say that the /bin tools were *designed* to work together&#8230; well, that&#39;s pretty delusional. They manage to most of the time, and some small groups of them were designed to work with others, but mostly it&#39;s hit-and-miss.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m with Peter da Silva and Jon Forrest. &nbsp;If you think Powershell is an answer to UNIX shells, then you&#39;re completely out of touch with today&#39;s UNIX-based developer community.</p>
<p>PowerShell is the prime example of Microsoft falling into &quot;Not Invented Here&quot; syndrome. &nbsp;PowerShell is, in fact, better than many of the UNIX shells at scripting. &nbsp;But for interactive use, its primary problem is that it *isn&#39;t* a UNIX shell.</p>
<p>The very existence of Cygwin should tell you something about how desperately people were hungering for a usable UNIX environment with a polished GUI. &nbsp;That need could&#39;ve been fulfilled by Windows. &nbsp;Instead, it ended up being fulfilled by Mac OS X.</p>
<p>Go to any web developer conference. &nbsp;75% Macs. &nbsp;Go to an academic Computer Science conference. &nbsp;50% Macs. &nbsp;These are not people who use Macs because they can&#39;t figure out how to use two mouse buttons. &nbsp;Microsoft is losing the war for &quot;developers, developers, developers.&quot; &nbsp;In the world of PHP, Ruby on Rails, Django, UNIX is king, and Mac OS is queen.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Interix was buried by the geniuses at Microsoft marketing (&quot;product management&quot;). &nbsp;First it was made available only for Windows Server. &nbsp;Then it was made available only for Vista Ultimate/Enterprise. &nbsp;Even in Windows 7 days, it&#39;s *still* restricted to the top two SKUs. &nbsp;Interix isn&#39;t a translation layer to Win32 &#8212; it is a full-fledged UNIX subsystem for NT.</p>
<p>There is, however, *one* division at Microsoft that still seems to be reaching out to the wider developer community, &nbsp;That&#39;s DevDiv. &nbsp;DLR, IronPython, IronRuby, F# (adapted from ML, a programming language popular in the academic PL community), JQuery Intellisense, making friends with the Mono project, etc. &nbsp;Some of these have been more successful than others &#8212; but at least they&#39;re still trying to broaden their appeal.</p>

		<p>Sixth example:</p>
<p>So people are going to be called out and all but called incompetent if they ask for a feature that Microsoft had implemented that RTM&#39;ed a week before (and months before general availability, of course)</p>
<p>Seventh example: pretending that PowerShell &quot;restarted&quot; anything. It&#39;s still very much an optional extra, not sidelining, but sidelined by, cmd.exe. And it&#39;s hardly Bash style. One of the biggest strengths of *nix shells is that they&#39;re so ubiquitous. They&#39;re not an additional tool that&#39;s hidden somewhere in a dark dusty corner of the OS, where only people who are specifically looking for it will ever find it. Unlike PowerShell.</p>
<p>@Neil: That depends on how you read it. Yes, Raymond is saying others accused MS of being incompetent. but he&#39;s also setting up a bit of an equivalence between &quot;accusing of incompetence&quot; and &quot;telling people that what they&#39;re doing is stupid, even when it&#39;s not what they&#39;re doing&quot;.</p>
<p>And then he&#39;s claiming that a lot of people are &quot;telling people that what they&#39;re doing is stupid, even when it&#39;s not what they&#39;re doing&quot;. Doesn&#39;t he imply that they&#39;re incompetent then?</p>
<p>(No, mathematically speaking he doesn&#39;t, of course, because =&gt; and &lt;=&gt; aren&#39;t quite the same thing. But if we relax our definitions a little bit, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so far off. Point is that Raymond is guilty of whatever it is he&#39;s accusing these commenters of. Call it incompetence, ignorance, arrogance or just having a bad day)</p>

		<p>@jalf &#8211; Can I borrow your time machine? How does something get to be ubiquitous, particularly when it is added long after the product was introduced into the marketplace? For PowerShell to be as ubiquitous as the *nix shells it would have to have been introduced 30+ years ago, after all bash was released in 1978!</p>
<p>If you look closely you will see that PowerShell is starting to be a requirement for many Microsoft server products, see SharePoint 2010, SQL 2008 and Exchange 2007, etc. This will drive it&#39;s ubiquity, at least on server platforms. As for the client, PowerShell is shipped as part of Windows 7.</p>
<p>So, let&#39;s have this conversation again in 10, 20 even 30 years from now and evaluate the ubiquity of PowerShell.</p>

		<p>PowerShell last I used it was nice as a cmd.exe replacement, apart from when I had to use cmd.exe anyway does things stupidly. Seriously who made the assumption that anything coming through standard output would be text (let alone Unicode text), if you try to redirect it to files it just mangles it.</p>
<p>I&#39;m sure PowerShell will be great in an environment where everything is designed to work with it, but I doubt this will ever be the case. So maybe it&#39;d be nice if it also played nice with standard command line programs.</p>

<p>You&#39;re moving goalposts. &nbsp;Apparently your version of the original post was &quot;any competent person between 1995 and Windows 7 would have instantly realized that rearranging the taskbar was of the utmost importance and made it their top priority&quot;.</p>
<p>The actual original post complained that Windows 7 did not implement rearranging the taskbar, when it was publically known and verifiable that Windows 7 did allow rearranging the taskbar. &nbsp;If he didn&#39;t feel like verifying it, he shouldn&#39;t have said anything. &nbsp;Instead, he made stuff up to complain about.</p>

<p>The fact that 3rd party apps were available to rearrange the taskbar should make you happy. Look MS is not monopolizing the moving of task bar items.</p>
<p>Bah.. Everyone complains when Microsoft adds a free browser to Windows, and then complains when Microsoft doesn&#39;t add a free &#39;do-something-i-specifically-want-and-can-get-a-3rd-party-tool-for&#39; program to Windows.</p>

		<p>But you really shouldn&#39;t have removed IColumnProvider. Lots of developers used it and lots of users used apps that used it without realising it. Can its replacement, the Property System show columsn for dynamic properties such as size and *for all file system objects* instead of just by particular file class/file type? Please please please bring back IColumnProvider.</p>

		<p>Neat :)</p>
<p>I was referred to with my comment regarding registering file extensions. I didn&#39;t know about that API but to my excuse that API is only available with Vista. Good to know, still doesn&#39;t help me with Windows&#39; up to XP ;)</p>
<p>Thanks though! Looks like a lot of new APIs got introduced with Vista. I reckon there&#39;s no chance of having a compatibility to older Windows linking that functions statically?</p>

		<p>All of your examples pale in comparison to the accusations, right up until the Windows XP release, that Windows was a wrapper for DOS and didn&#39;t have preemptive multitasking.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
