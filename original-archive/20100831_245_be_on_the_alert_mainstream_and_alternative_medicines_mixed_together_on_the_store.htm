<p>I was in the supermarket looking for cold medicine,  and as is my wont,  I like to read the fine print before choosing a product.  Most of the products listed their active ingredients in the form  <i>Active Ingredient: XYZ 150mg</i>.  But there were a few that said  <i>Active Ingredient: XYZ 6X</i>.</p>
<p>  What is this <i>6X</i>?  How much is 6X?  Six times what?  </p>
<p>  A closer look at the box reveals the word  <i><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homeopathy">Homeopathic</a></i>  unobtrusively written towards the bottom of the box.  The 6X notation means that the active ingredient's concentration is  one part in 10<sup>6</sup>, or one part in a million.  </p>
<p>  Suppose the dosage is one teaspoon.  That's about five milliliters, or about five grams of medicine.  One millionth of that is 5&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;10<sup>-6</sup> of a gram  or 0.005 milligrams.  By comparison,  non-homeopathic medicines contain 13mg of the same medicine per dose.  But that's okay, because practitioners of homeopathy believe that  a medicine becomes more powerful the more heavily it is diluted.  </p>
<p>  The Food and Drug Administration does not regulate homeopathic  medicines very much at all  <a href="http://www.fda.gov/fdac/features/096_home.html">  because they contain little or no active ingredients</a>.  </p>
<p>  Do practitioners of homeopathy not wash their hands?  After all, diluting the germs with water makes them stronger, right?  The more you wash, the more powerful they become!  </p>

<p>By the way, you&#39;ve just won a homeopathy supporters vs reasoning people flame on your blog. Well done!</p>

		<p>Reminds me of this Fark headline: &quot;Homeopathy no longer available from the British NHS. &#39;After all, by their own logic, the less funding they get, the more effective it will be&#39;.&quot;</p>

		<p>I always like to tell the story of an acquintance who nearly died (surprise hospical vacation!) of homeopathic &quot;medicine&quot;, because those white globules are made from bee wax, and since cheapness trumps quality, they just crush whole (hopefully deserted) bee nests when making them. This means that there are still dead bees inside. And said person was highly allergic to bee toxin.</p>

		<p>I live in Sweden, and, fortunately, homeopathic &quot;drugs&quot; are not sold here (at least not in mainstream stores), to the best of my knowledge. I wonder if it would even be legal to sell such products here&#8230;</p>

		<p>Although it is a bit too long, the video of The Great Randy explaining how Homoeopathy (claims to) work is quite fun: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWE1tH93G9U" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch</a>. I find the part where he explains how some guy sold a way to do this &#39;over the internet&#39; particularly amusing :)</p>

		<p>I use a homeopathic engine in my car. &nbsp;You fill the tank with water and the residual memory of gasoline allows the engine to work as normal. &nbsp;It&#39;s very cheap to run.</p>

		<p>Two quick comments:</p>
<p>1) Homeopathy is a huge deal in the UK because the NHS (their national health insurance) will actually pay for homeopathic treatments, and actually opened &quot;homeopathic hospitals&quot; (whatever those are.) I&#39;ve heard this is because the royal family is taken-in by the scam.</p>
<p>2) That Mitchell and Webb Look is the best variety show on TV, bar none. Every episode makes me laugh so hard I can&#39;t breathe. Season 1 is available on Netflix. And some episodes are on Hulu, but they may be premium content. Highly, highly recommended.</p>

		<p>David stole my thunder with his link to James Randi, above. But I have to repeat Randi&#39;s comment in his TED talk that one poor man died of an overdose when he forgot to take his pill.</p>

		<p>Many years ago, there was a website which offered homeopathic anti-virus protection for PCs. They had distilled all known viruses (at the time) down to two differing bits and would expose your computer to one of them selected at random. Too bad my old bookmark doesn&#39;t work anymore so I can&#39;t inoculate my current PC.</p>

		<p>@Auntie: By gosh, you&#39;re right. It didn&#39;t occur to me at the time, but all you have to do is *not* list the ingredients on your vials of homeopathic remedy! Quantum homeopathy! Genius!</p>
<p>One must admit that the scientific underpinnings of this approach are at least as valid as &quot;traditional&quot; homeopathy.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
