<p>The first time I saw the Seattle Symphony's <a href="http://www.seattlest.com/archives/2007/03/13/seattlest_yaks_with_cello_prodigy_joshua_roman.php"> new principal cellist</a> <a href="http://www.joshuaroman.net/"> Joshua Roman</a>, it was at a subscription performance of Mahler's Seventh Symphony in June 2006, shortly after the then-22-year-old took the principal's seat from the retiring Raymond Davis. We noticed that there was a new face in the orchestra, and wondered afterwards, "Who was that floppy-haired kid?" Well, we now know who that floppy-haired kid is, and he's taking Seattle by storm.</p>
<p> Our symphony group's seats this season are up close, and it's such a pleasure watching Joshua Roman play, seeing him check in with the other string principals periodically, clearly enjoying himself the entire time. </p>
<p> While flipping through the program during the intermission of John Lill's Beethoven piano concerto cycle, one of our group's members saw that the cellist was participating in a <a href="http://www.seattlesymphony.org/symphony/buy/single/production.aspx?id=4558"> performance of the Brahms Quintet</a>, and our nascent Joshua Roman groupie-dom kicked in. We ordered tickets straight away. </p>
<p> The recital opened with Christian Zacharias performing Schumann's <i>Kinderszenen</i> (a lovely little set of vignettes), followed by the string players performing Haydn's String Quartet Op.&nbsp;20, No.&nbsp;4, and concluded with their combined forces on the Brahms Quintet. It was great to see all the musicians playing with obvious enjoyment. The second violin has long rests in the Brahms, and Stephen Bryant just tucked his violin under his arm and smiled blissfully as he swayed to the music. (One thing I noticed is that Zacharias played with more rubato than the quartet was expecting, and things fell out of sync every so often in the first movement.) </p>
<p> We thought that perhaps we were the only people who were Joshua Roman groupie-wannabes, but no, we've got plenty of company. His first solo recital in Seattle was sold out, <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/classical/308022_roman18q.html"> with a line for tickets that led out the building and down the street</a>. Those that managed to score tickets <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/artsentertainment/2003625882_webcello20.html"> loved it</a>. Not a bad start. </p>
<p> But I saw him first. </p>
<p> <b>Nitpicker's corner</b> </p>
<p> I didn't literally see him first. It was a joke. </p>
<p> (Bonus: <a href="http://www.kuow.org/defaultProgram.asp?ID=12404"> Joshua Roman interview on KUOW last week</a>, begins at timecode 14:00.) </p>

		<p>I remember that Mahler 7, and I too was just astonished to see the confidence with which he was already leading the section and responding to the performance as it unfolded. I spoke to a member of the section the following week; he said he was wowed by the kid too, and nobody in the section seemed to resent being led by someone so young. Just amazing.</p>

		<p>&quot;Nitpicker&#8217;s corner&quot; gets funnier every day!</p>
<p>Nitpicker&#8217;s corner: rhetorical device, not intended to imply strictly monotonically increasing funniness.</p>

		<p>He&#8217;s indeed easy to notice. Another difficult to miss is the ZZ Top guy.</p>
<p>Did you see the triple concerto? Boy was it difficult to not be distracted by the solo cellist. Our seats are very close up (row C) and it was just too much.</p>

		<p>Dude, you should totally check out an anime (I know, I know&#8230;) called Nodame Cantabile, it&#8217;s all about aspiring conductors and cellists and orchestras and music and stuff. Plus the soundtrack is all classical music, and it&#8217;s funny as hell.</p>
<p>Try it, you won&#8217;t regret it.</p>

		<p>Larry,</p>
<p>I for one and very disappointed that a nitpicker&#8217;s corner has to exist on this blog. &nbsp;It only goes to show that there are too many stupid and pathetic slashdotters running around who would rather run amok with useless details than activitly contribute something worthwhile to the discussion.</p>

		<p>There always is the option of stepping in and &#8216;educating&#8217; nitpickers on Raymonds behalf.</p>
<p>But then of course the chaos of freedom without order will ensue.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
