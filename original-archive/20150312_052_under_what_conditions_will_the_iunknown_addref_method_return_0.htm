<p>A customer was debugging their application and discovered that for one of the objects they were using, the <code>IUnknown::<wbr>Add&shy;Ref</wbr></code> method returns 0. How is that possible? That would imply that the object's reference count was originally negative one?</p>
<p> The return value from <code>IUnknown::<wbr>Add&shy;Ref</wbr></code> is the object reference count by convention, but  </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> This value is intended to be used <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms691379(v=vs.85).aspx"> only for test purposes</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The return value is purely advisory and is not required to be accurate. </p>
<p> For example, if the object is a proxy, it will most likely return the reference count of the local proxy rather than the raw reference count of the original object. Conversely, if you have an object with outstanding proxies, the <code>IUnknown::<wbr>Add&shy;Ref</wbr></code> will count only one reference per proxy, even if the proxies themselves have reference counts greater than one. </p>
<p> The object the customer was using came from <code>MSHTML.DLL</code>, and it so happens that the implementation of <code>IUnknown::<wbr>Add&shy;Ref</wbr></code> used by that component always returns zero. It is technically within their rights to do so. </p>
<p> I don't know for sure, but I suspect this is done on purpose to avoid applications relying on the exact reference count. Applications are known to do dubious things, such as <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/ee416788(v=vs.100).aspx#What_do_the_return_values_from_the_Release_or_AddRef_methods_mean__"> call <code>IUnknown:&shy;Release</code> in a loop until it says the reference count is zero</a>. Making the objects return a value from <code>IUnknown::<wbr>Add&shy;Ref</wbr></code> that betrays no information about the object's true reference count may have been a defensive step to prevent applications from making any such dubious dependency. </p>
<p> If you install the debugging version of <code>MSHTML.DLL</code>, then the <code>IUnknown::<wbr>Add&shy;Ref</wbr></code> method will return the reference count. Which makes sense in its own way because the value is intended to be used only when debugging. </p>

		<p>Where/how/what is the debugging version of MSHTML.DLL obtained? I don&#39;t think I have ever heard of that before. A quick google search didn&#39;t show any info in the first few results.</p>

		<p>Ok. I have the subscription but have never worked with the checked builds of Windows. Way back when (before virtualization) I didn&#39;t have a separate machine to run them on, now I don&#39;t have that excuse.</p>
<p>General question about the debug builds, are they an all or nothing? Do I need to use the full debug build of windows, or are there DLLS (like MSHTML) that can be installed individually? Really need to explore this stuff.</p>

		<p>What exactly that it means that it can only be used for test purposes? Can it be used to test what is the new reference count? Apparently not.</p>
<p>I am wondering, since technically the value can be meaningless (as in the discussed implementation of IUnknown::Add&shy;Ref) or I guess even random, is there an actual use where this value would be helpful?</p>

		<p>I am reminded of this mathematical joke:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.math.psu.edu/tseng/profession.html">http://www.math.psu.edu/&#8230;/profession.html</a></p>
<p>A Mathematician, a Biologist and a Physicist are sitting in a street cafe watching people going in and coming out of the house on the other side of the street.</p>
<p>First they see two people going into the house. Time passes. After a while they notice three persons coming out of the house.</p>
<p> The Physicist: &quot;The measurement wasn&#39;t accurate.&quot;.</p>
<p> The Biologist: &quot;They have reproduced&quot;.</p>
<p> The Mathematician: &quot;If now exactly one person enters the house then it will be empty again.&quot;</p>

		<p>So you&#39;re saying that if my program relies on MSHTML&#39;s component&#39;s AddRef to return an accurate value, I will need to get the debug version of Windows and ship its MSHTML.DLL alongside my application?</p>

		<p>@Me, no, what he&#39;s saying is that you shouldn&#39;t rely on the AddRef count. You should be tracking your own references. When you call AddRef, you need to call Release when you&#39;re done with the component &#8211; for each instance of the component you created. You shouldn&#39;t blindly call Release, especially for a system level component. </p>

		<p>@Terry Denham: This is not a &quot;system level&quot; component &#8212; it&#39;s just the IE browser or part of, running in my process. I can probe and find the private m_dwRefCount if want to, so no need to play it rude.</p>
<p>IE team has such a high bugs-to-features ratio. Custom heap, custom COM, custom GC, custom compiler (?) &#8212; do they think they or as import as OS or Office or something.</p>
<p>They should start wiping from behind first, IMHO.</p>

		<p>@wqw</p>
<p>Terry had it right there.</p>
<p>IE, on Windows, is &#39;OS-level&#39;. You are almost never going to encounter a version of Windows without it.</p>
<p>Additionally, I&#39;ve encountered geometrically more bugs caused by third-party developers misusing IE than native to IE, so this is a case of &quot;don&#39;t throw stones.&quot;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
