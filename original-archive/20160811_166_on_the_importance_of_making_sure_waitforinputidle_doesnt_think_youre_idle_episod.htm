A customer had a program that was originally designed
back when DDE ruled the land,
and it continues to support DDE for (yup) backward
compatibility.
</p>
<p>
Today and tomorrow are going to deal with DDE issues,
but not because DDE is actually anything recommended.
Quite the contrary:
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20070226-00/?p=27863">
Please feel free to stop using DDE</a>.
DDE is so obsolete that when somebody has a DDE question,
it usually lands in the lap of some old-timer who starts
the answer with "Kids these days..."
and ends it with "I'm going to write a blog entry about this."
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the customer was making some changes to the program's
splash screen,
and one of the changes broke DDE.
"With my change,
launching a file from Explorer displays the dreaded
<i>There was a problem sending the command to the program</i>.
What should I be looking out for?"
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060621-17/?p=30793">
Recall that</a>
launching documents via DDE is done by
first looking for a DDE server and if none is found,
launching a server manually and trying again.
And the retry occurs after the manually-launched server
goes input idle;
in other words, after the shell launches the server,
the shell calls
<code>Wait&shy;For&shy;Input&shy;Idle</code>,
and then when that call returns,
the shell goes looking for the DDE server.
If it can't find the server the second time,
you get the
<i>There was a problem sending the command to the program</i>
error.
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20100325-00/?p=14493">
We saw earlier</a>
that the
<code>Wait&shy;For&shy;Input&shy;Idle</code>
function declares the process idle once any thread is
"waiting for user input with no input pending."
In the customer's case, the issue was not a background
thread that went idle,
but rather that their main UI thread was performing a
<code>Co&shy;Create&shy;Instance</code> call to a
local server.
Cross-process method calls
are performed by marshaling the request to the server,
then waiting for the server to return a response.
And in a single-threaded apartment,
COM pumps messages while waiting.
</p>
<p>
It is that COM message pump that was causing the process
to be marked idle.
</p>
<p>
The customer needs to get the DDE server window created
and ready to accept incoming commands before the program
does any cross-thread COM operations from a single-threaded
apartment.
</p>
<p>
Okay, that was basically a warm-up.
Next time, a different angle on failed DDE startup.</p>

		<p>Using cross process COM tends to go against the advice of not blocking on the UI thread.</p>

		<p>Violator: SSMS, but only if your disk is slow (because somebody else is hogging it). Good; this means I can ignore the message as natter since the file opens anyway.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
