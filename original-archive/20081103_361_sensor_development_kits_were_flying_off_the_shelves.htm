<p>After the <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC25/"> Sensor and Location Platform PDC presentation</a>, people were stopping by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e_x4Bp8jLnU"> the booth</a> and grabbing sensor hardware and development kits like they were candy. Then again, to geeks, this stuff <i>is</i> candy.</p>
<p> (And technically, they weren't flying off shelves. They were flying out of bins. Well, and technically they weren't flying either.) </p>
<p> Other notes from the last day of the 2008 PDC: </p>
<ul>
<li>     PDC content honcho     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mswanson/">     Mike Swanson</a>     announced that     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mswanson/archive/2008/11/01/pdc2008-session-and-keynote-recordings-are-now-published.aspx">     PDC 2008 sessions and keynotes are now up for download</a>,     and will be available indefinitely.     Available in Silverlight for live streaming, or     in iTunes format, WMV, high-quality WMV (this one includes     video of the speakers), and Zune for offline viewing.     In response, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nigel/">     Nigel Parker</a>     created the     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nigel/archive/2008/11/03/128-pdc-breakout-sessions-available-now.aspx">     PDC session firehose</a>. </li>
<li>Sometimes, when you make the sign too big,     nobody can see it.     Someone came up to me asking where the Azure booth was.     I pointed at the     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/stevecla01/archive/2008/10/30/bye-bye-pdc.aspx">     insanely huge banner</a>.     "Probably somewhere over there." </li>
<li>The reason why room 406A is on the third floor but you press&nbsp;2     to get there:     The room numbers at the convention center are numbered based on     room clusters.     The 100's in one cluster, the 400's are in another cluster,     <i>etc</i>.     The "4" in 406 doesn't mean fourth floor;     it means fourth cluster.     And why do you push&nbsp;2 to get to the third floor?     Because Level&nbsp;1 is a split level which occupies two floors.     Therefore, in the elevator, there are two buttons to get     to Level&nbsp;1, depending on whether you want the upper     half or lower half.     Cluster&nbsp;4 is on Level&nbsp;2, so the button for that is&nbsp;3. </li>
<li>     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vHV5ukFL0NU">     A video of carrots</a>.     If you had come to     <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC43/">     my PDC talk</a>, you'd understand.     (The carrot joke elicited a mild chuckle from the main room,     but I'm told that in the overflow room it totally killed.     I'm not sure what that says about people in the overflow room.     It really wasn't that great a joke, people.) </li>
<li>At Ask the Experts, I started out at one of the Windows&nbsp;7     tables, and we speculated as to what the most obscure technical     question would be.     One of my colleagues suggested that it would be a BitLocker question.     And what would you know, the very first person to come to our table     had a BitLocker question.     Later in the evening, I moved to another Windows&nbsp;7     table and posed the same question.     At the second table, we figured that the most obscure technical     question would be about     <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/shows/Going+Deep/Mark-Russinovich-Inside-Windows-7/">     the dispatcher spinlock</a>.     About fifteen minutes later, somebody stopped by with a question     about the dispatcher spinlock.     I decided to stop playing this game.     It was too much like a <i>Twilight Zone</i> episode. </li>
<li>One attendee was shy about speaking English     (not being a native speaker)     and came up with a clever solution:     The attendee walked up to our table, said,     "I have some questions, can you read them?"     and then opened a laptop computer where a Word document     awaited with the four questions already typed up in a large     font so everybody could read them.     We answered the questions, and everybody seemed pleasantly     surprised with how well this approach worked. </li>
<li>At the end of the conference the Channel&nbsp;9 folks held     a giveaway for their giant beanbags.     Like anybody would be able to take a giant beanbag home     on the airplane.     (Second prize: <i>Two</i> beanbags!) </li>
<li>     <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/james/">     James Senior</a>     has     <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/james/archive/2008/11/01/pdc-2008-in-stats.aspx">     the PDC by the numbers</a>.     I have trouble believing the number of bananas consumed,     though.     Twenty-five bananas in four days?     Perhaps we should start calling James <i>Monkey Boy</i>. </li>

		<p>Somebody should put together a DVD set with all the videos and supplements. &nbsp;I downloaded about 20 of the high def WMV files and all told they&#8217;re over 6 GB in size. &nbsp;Those were only the ones with interesting titles / abstracts in my area of expertise; there were quite a few more outside my normal scope that sounded interesting.</p>

		<p>I snagged a sensor kit the second they brought in the bin. &nbsp;Mostly for the accelerometer and USB-programmable microcontroller. &nbsp;Lots of possibilities there&#8211;way more interesting than making text bigger in direct sunlight (did anyone else think that would be distracting on, say, a day with patchy clouds, when your text keeps jumping around as you&#8217;re trying to read it?)</p>

		<p>I hung around the C9 lounge to see what people would do with their beanbag chairs. A few people just carried them out as-is over their shoulders. The folks who had to fly home unzipped the bottom of the chairs and poured the filling material into trash cans.</p>

		<p>When my friends and I were in Japan, we left some of our baggage in Kyoto Station, only realizing it when we were about thirty minutes from arriving at Tokyo Station. &nbsp;I used those last thirty minutes to write down a quick description of our bags and an explanation of what happened while referencing my electronic dictionary, and when we went to the lost and found station I basically just handed the sheet of paper to the attendant. &nbsp;It was much better than trusting on my memory to deliver me the right words at the right time. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t have that luxury in the followup discussion, but I think it was the best start we could have had to the conversation.</p>

		<p>&gt; &#8220;iTunes format&#8221;</p>
<p>This expression offends me. You probably meant &#8220;in a format compatible with the iPod&#8221;, which is what they use over at Channel 9 and is a bit more correct.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no such thing as &#8220;iTunes format&#8221;. In fact, the only thing that something resembling iTunes (QuickTime) helped to define is the container format. The audio and video codecs come from elsewhere. Moreover, I think (but I&#8217;m not sure) these files were generated without the help of any Apple software at all.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>That inaccuracy was on purpose. &#8220;iTunes format&#8221; = 2 words. &#8220;In a format compatible with the iPod&#8221; = 7 words, and out of balance with the other items in the list. Okay, maybe &#8220;iPod format&#8221; would have been better. I assumed the readers would be able to translate &#8220;iTunes format&#8221; into the appropriate long form. I was apparently once again badly mistaken. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I think iTunes format is perfectly descriptive. You import it into iTunes, after all. Then you can use iTunes to copy it to your iPod to view it on the go. Or watch it on your laptop using iTunes. Or use iTunes to sync it with your iPhone or AppleTV. It all revolves around iTunes.</p>
<p>Since it is a technical audience, &quot;QuickTime&quot; format would work, or, &quot;MPEG 4&quot; (though, people also call DivX/XviD (MPEG-4 ASP/SP, in AVI container) &quot;MPEG 4&quot;).</p>
<p>But &quot;iTunes format&quot; (QuickTime/Part 14/3GP containered h.264 / AAC) conveys it so much more succintly.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

<p>Which somehow does not work for me. Did I have to install this new feature only to be able to see the black rectangle instead of &quot;Install Silverlight&quot; prompt?</p>
<p>Sometimes I think Microsoft introduces new things only to maintain incompatibility with something (flv, in this case) that has already existed for a long time.</p>

		<p>I have downloaded it. Thanks :)</p>
<p>I have had to uninstall Silverlight. </p>
<p>On my low-end system (2GB RAM, 1.5Ghz Celeron, so now *that* low-end), I just can&#8217;t have IE/Firefox having a higher priority. </p>
<p>My system just crawls. Surley is every application considered itself important enough to do this, we&#8217;d be in a very bad position. </p>
<p>I did google it and found something about Multimedia Class Scheduler. Yes if it&#8217;s a full screen DVD or full screen game, then assume I am doing one thing. Otherwise don&#8217;t :) </p>

		<p>&gt;Would you pay $100 for a 10-DVD set of stuff you could download for free?</p>
<p>Given that some of us live in countries where downloading 10 DVDs worth would cost &gt; $100 anyway (if you could even manage it because of bandwidth caps as low as 1GB/month), I&#8217;d have to say &#8220;Yes&#8221;. Even ignoring the cost, the 10 DVDs would take nearly 8 years to download on a 1GB capped link.</p>

		<p>Never mind my earlier question about the sensor kits &#8211; sorry I asked.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
