<p>
Many times a customer creates a file mapping object and assigns
it a name that matches the name of the file it was created from.
Mind you, there needs to be some fiddling with the name because
backslashes are not allowed in object names (aside from the
<code>Local\</code> or
<code>Global\</code> prefix),
so typically people change backslashes to forward slashes,
resulting in file mappings named, for example
<code>C:/</code><code>path/</code><code>path/</code><code>path/</code><code>file.txt</code>.
</p>
<p>
Is this a problem?
</p>
<p>
First, let's put on our kernel-colored glasses.
</p>
<p>
From the kernel's standpoint, there's nothing wrong with this.
You can name your file mappings anything you want.
You can name them after the file they were created from.
You can name them after your cat.
You can give them a misleading name.
The kernel doesn't care,
as long as you give a legal name.
So sure, go ahead and name your file mapping after the file
it was created from.
</p>
<p>
Okay, let's take off our kernel-colored glasses and
look at the bigger picture.
</p>
<p>
Suppose you name your file mapping after the file it was created from.
And suppose somebody else does the same thing.
Now you have a name collision.
Your attempt to create a file mapping will succeed
but also report
<code>ERROR_</code><code>ALREADY_</code><code>EXISTS</code>,
to indicate that instead of creating a new file mapping,
the system gave you an existing one with that name.
</p>
<p>
The catch is that the file mapping the system gave you
may not be the one you want.
It may have been created with the wrong security attributes,
or created with the wrong page protection,
or created with the wrong size.
(And by "wrong" I mean
"with values that are different from what you expected.")
</p>
<p>
That's the thing about sharing a namespace with others:
If you give your objects too obvious a name,
somebody else may choose the same obvious name.
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20150410-00/?p=44263">
We've seen this before in another context</a>.
</p>
<p>
But let's step back again:
Why are you giving your file mappings names?
Do you really intent to share them?
Or are you just giving them names because it's nice to give
names to things?
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20141001-00/?p=43943">
You can name your car, and you can name your kernel objects,
but there is a qualitative difference between the two</a>.
</p>
<p>
If you don't intend the file mapping to be shared,
then don't give it a name.
Giving it a name means that you intend to share it,
and the name is how people can access the shared handle.
</p>
<p>
If you really do intend the file mapping to be shared,
say, with other instances of the same program,
then you should use a name that only your program uses.
For example, you could prefix a fixed GUID to the name,
so that all file mapping names used by your program have the
form
<code>{guid}-C:/</code><code>path/</code><code>path/</code><code>path/</code><code>file.txt</code>.
Since only your program uses that GUID,
it won't conflict with names used by other programs.
</p>
<p>
(You can think of prefixing the GUID to the mapping name
as a poor man's way of creating a namespace.)</p>

		<p>Also there&#8217;s the length issue where kernel object names are limited to 255 characters but file system paths can be up to (slightly less than) 32767 characters. If I needed something like that I would probably just use hexadecimal representation of dwVolumeSerialNumber and nFileIndex(Low|High) retrieved from BY_HANDLE_FILE_INFORMATION.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
