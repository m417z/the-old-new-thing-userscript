<p>
One of the ways people used to demonstrate the awfulness of
Windows 95 was that you could hang the system with this simple
two-instruction MS-DOS program:
</p>
<pre>
    cli
    jmp $
</pre>
<p>
The <code>cli</code> instruction disabled interrupts,
and the <code>jmp $</code> instruction merely jumped to itself.
This spun the CPU with interrupts disabled,
hanging the system.
There is no way to break out of the loop
because you told the CPU to stop listening to the outside world.
</p>
<p>
Why did Windows 95 let MS-DOS applications disable interrupts?
</p>
<p>
Compatibility, of course.
</p>
<p>
In principle, Windows 95 (and Windows 3.1) could have virtualized
the interrupt flag for MS-DOS programs.
If a virtual machine disabled interrupts, it would disable interrupts
only
for itself; other virtual machines would still have interrupts enabled,
and interrupts would still be enabled in the virtual machine manager.
Indeed, if the program was running in protected mode,
the interrupt flag <i>was</i>
virtualized.
There is a special case for code running in virtual 8086 mode.
Why the special exemption just for v86-mode?
</p>
<p>
There were a lot of MS-DOS drivers
which relied on timing loops and tight polling.
If you virtualized the interrupt,
then the virtual machine that disabled interrupts would have a messed-up
timing loop because its loop would be interrupted by other
virtual machines that were also running at the same time.
Similarly, the tight polling loop could miss an event because
the hardware gave you only a 10ms window to respond to the signal,
but the virtual machine got pre-empted for 55ms due to multi-tasking.
That would cause your scanner to return garbage data,
or your tape backup to fail,
or your CD-ROM burning software to create a coaster.
</p>
<p>
Windows 3.1 (and Windows 95) addressed this problem by disabling
multi-tasking when a virtual machine disabled interrupts.
Disabling interrupts allowed a virtual machine to prevent other
virtual machines from stealing CPU and messing up its hardware timing
and polling loops.
</p>
<p>
It was the general impression that end-users
would prefer to use
the hardware that they paid good money for,
and which was working just fine in MS-DOS.
(Back in these days, a low-end CD-ROM drive cost around $200.
I owned one such,
and the only driver it came with was an MS-DOS driver.)
</p>
<p>
Of course, Windows NT addresses this problem a different way:
It simply doesn't support MS-DOS drivers.
But in the early 1990's, a lot of hardware devices didn't have drivers
for Windows NT (and a lot of computers didn't meet Windows NT's
hardware requirements),
so your choices were limited.
</p>
<ul>
<li>Stick to MS-DOS and don't upgrade.
<li>Suck it up and run Windows 95.
<li>Use your external CD-ROM/Bernoulli/ZIP/tape drive as a doorstop.
</ul>

		<p>It still amazes me that Windows 95 achieved to run *inside* a virtual machine and *in userland* drivers that were designed to have total control of the machine. It had to made some compromises, and was less stable than it could be wished if you used legacy drivers, yes. But it worked most of the time, and it is an amazing feat!</p>

		<p>@Antonio: I agree. The tradeoffs that Microsoft made seem to have worked well: DOS and Win16 drivers and apps worked fine for the most part, and Win32 apps were introduced for the future. It&#39;s probably not too surprising that Windows 9x stayed popular for as long as it did (the more modest hardware requirements probably didn&#39;t hurt either.)</p>

		<p>To this day, I still don&#39;t touch the PC when I have occasion to burn a DVD until the process is complete. &nbsp;I was so traumatized by the 90&#39;s where any slight timing delay (caused by moving the mouse too much even!) would result in a coaster.</p>

		<p>Ah yes, the days when you had to defrag your disk before burning a CD. &nbsp;If the HD did too much seeking, it might be unable to stream enough data to the burner, and you&#39;d get a coaster.</p>

		<p>@JJJ: back then, I ran NT 4, and had a dedicated 650 MB partition to store the files, so I didn&#39;t have too much trouble running Word or Visual Basic while burning a CD. Having 32 MB of RAM, a decent amount at the time, didn&#39;t hurt, either. If Win95 was a fair trade off, NT 4 was rock solid. I had to look at Microsoft&#39;s hardware compatibility list before shopping for parts, true, but it was more than worth the trouble. Did I mention that my personal uptime record for a *desktop* computer is 111 days, with NT 4 SP 6a? And yes, it was before Patch Tuesdays were established.</p>

		<p>In 1995 Microsoft had $6,940,000,000 (almost 7 Billion) sitting in cash (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://www.microsoft.com/investor/reports/ar96/fh.htm">http://www.microsoft.com/&#8230;/fh.htm</a>). I realize we can&#39;t go back in time but I sometimes wonder about an alternative history where Microsoft spend some of their money dealing with problems like this. For example, Microsoft could have taken over the job of writing device drivers for hardware vendors, making sure the drivers were reliable and compatible with both the software and the hardware.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m not sure why this is (was) such a big deal. &nbsp;It&#39;s morally equivalent to the fact that a kernel-mode driver can do various bad things under modern Windows (and other OSs, for that matter). &nbsp;If you don&#39;t want problems to affect the whole system, you don&#39;t run code at that level.</p>

		<p>I personally look at al of this as the normal evolution of things applied to computers, things were simply different, I still remember waiting a long time before applying service packs, updates or even upgrading my OS. Nowadays we wait anxiously new versions, for new fixes, install them as soon and even ask for them. Things have simply changed&#8230;</p>

		<p>Also, the Pentium (and late model 486s) were the first that could hardware-virtualize these instructions. &nbsp;Before that, any attempt to software virtualize them would cause an exception to the virtual machine manager(aka kernel) every time.</p>

		<p>@MichaelQuinlan: Indeed, if MS had spent the money to help control the user experience to make it that much better, Windows could have dominated the late 90&#39;s market instead of being a pale shadow of Macintosh sales. &nbsp;Oh wait&#8230;</p>
<p>The reality is that you don&#39;t get to optimize on all axes simultaneously. &nbsp;MS worked very hard on enabling other companies to make hardware and software, including companies that took shortcuts at every possible opportunity, making stuff that worked on and off (and the &quot;on&quot; part was often thanks to people in MS like Raymond), but was 1/4 the price.</p>
<p>And guess who *thoroughly* won the PC wars.</p>
<p>Reliability is nice, but when it comes to wide spread market dominance, it consistently places third behind features and price. &nbsp;You need to be reliable *enough*, but after that you really have to watch the trade-off. &nbsp;After all, your customers pretty much assume 100% quality for anything they buy, so *actually* having the quality isn&#39;t a competitive advantage unless your competitors fall *too* far down the quality scale.</p>
<p>(And yes, I&#39;m a slightly embittered QA guy who talked too much to sales :-))</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve always wondered why Win9x didn&#39;t use VME. This makes sense, but I do have some &#8211; admittedly vague &#8211; memories of really timing sensitive stuff (like racing the beam and twiddling the palette for each line on the screen) didn&#39;t work too well under Win9x regardless. </p>

		<p>@Patrick: According to Wikipedia, VME wasn&#39;t publicly documented until the P6, which only launched in early 1995 (so really too late for any kind of testing for an OS releasing later that year!) Also, the number of people with the hardware required to use it would have been fairly small, meaning there would be a lot of coding for very little immediate benefit. I don&#39;t believe that I even had a Pentium-class computer until closer to 2000 if memory serves, as the initial Pentiums were pretty expensive.</p>

		<p>Exact dates are a bit fuzzy, but I got an AMD K6 1997 and ran Win95 on it &#8211; in fact it was kinda targeted at mixed 32/16 bit code. And K6 was a competitor to PMMX/PII, so clearly vanilla Pentium had been around for some time then. </p>
<p>AFAIK OS/2 Warp, which actually pre-dates Win95, used VME when available &#8211; when not, it defaulted to allowing DOS boxes to disable IF, but on machines that supported it set up some sort of watchdog that triggered when interrupts had been disabled for too long. But I only ran OS/2 on 486 so can&#39;t swear that this is correct; however, Wikipedia seems to agree with me: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS/2#DOS_compatibility">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/2</a></p>

		<p>@MichaelQuinlan: Would never ever happen. Among other reasons, so write drivers, MS would have to be given the specs and the interfaces of all the hardware, and hardware vendors guard every scrap of info about those with insane jealousy because&#8230; [Take your pick:]</p>
<p> &nbsp;A) &#8230;Their software and design gives them the edge over competition.</p>
<p> &nbsp;B) &#8230;They THINK their software and design gives them the edge over competition.</p>
<p> &nbsp;C) &#8230;Their hardware is miserable stinking pile of bugs that the driver has to constantly work around and they don&#39;t want anybody to find out.</p>
<p> &nbsp;D) &#8230;The only physical difference between Thingamafrob 200 and Thingamafrob 4000 Turbo is a flag in register 3 indicating whether the software should lock out all the features or not.</p>

		<p>An assembly loop can cause a computer to hang! &nbsp;Wow!</p>
<p>@MichaelQuinlan: &nbsp;For the drivers issue &#8212; although this is up for debate, I doubt that Microsoft would have wanted to, or been able to, write device drivers for ALL of the millions of devices that can be connected to a PC.</p>
<p>I believe there are already &quot;driver development kits&quot; and also some built-in drivers that do most of the work, requiring the vendor to write a filter driver or some such. &nbsp;(Don&#39;t quote me on this.) &nbsp;But yes, getting the interrupts correct on hardware drivers is very hard.</p>

		<p>@Villa &#8211; and anyone who&#39;s followed in-tree Linux driver development knows that every one of those reasons is still used now, when a Linux dev asks many hardware companies for enough documentation to write a driver, </p>

		<p>True :(</p>
<p>But I wonder… in the 90s and 2000s, the main argument against microkernels was that they are slow. Is this still an issue when it comes to things like filesystem drivers or network I/O?</p>
<p>Btw, the nicest way to get most Linux machines down is still :(){:|:&amp;};: (it can be mitigated with ulimit, but the default setup of most distros is unlimited). (Just tried %0|%0 on my Windows 10 VM, and it worked, too)</p>

		<p>Also I don&#39;t think it is a big problem that Win&#39;9x could be deadlocked by executing specific couple of machine opcodes. Its not security-centric OS, the only thing protected mode was used for &#8211; to provide satisfactory OS environment stability against software bugs, but not attacks. And I suspect cli was a reason of less than 1% of problems in this area.</p>
<p>And there were plenty ways to make Win&#39;9x down without knowing assembler. My favorite was Start/Run typing NULCON there and pressing Enter. Whole university lab could be BSODed in a minute with this trick.</p>

		<p>On susceptible systems, F0 0F C7 C8 was great for that. Even under Win9x which could be crashed in lots of other ways it had an advantage for prankters: Because of the way it hung, ATX poweroff didn&#39;t work. You had to force poweroff (by holding down the power button for 3-5s, if the system even supported it) or pull the plug.</p>

		<p>@Patrick Star: And I think this was because a SMI was used to handle the power off button, which after booting an ACPI capable OS became a SCI. &#8220;F00F&#8221; locked up the CPU completely so that even SMIs can&#8217;t be processed.</p>

		<p>It remind me a story about 90% of crashes and kernel panic are actually cause by the VGA drivers before Windows Vista require them to be digital signed.</p>
<p>x86_64 are more stable before they force those vendor to review and to rewrite their drivers.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
