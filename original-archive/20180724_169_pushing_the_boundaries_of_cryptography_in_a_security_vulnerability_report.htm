<p>
A security vulnerability report arrived that implied that
the finder had made an earth-shattering breakthrough in
cryptography.
Specifically, the finder claimed to have found an efficient
way to factor the large numbers used in RSA cryptography.
</p>
<p>
This would be a remarkable breakthrough if true,
but the description of the algorithm, while mathematically correct
(and I bothered to read through it all and understand it),
didn't actually produce an efficient algorithm.
It boiled down to trying to find a collision among
a population whose size is proportional to the smaller factor,
with an additional optimization to reduce the amount of calculation
to the square root of the population space.
(I believe it was this additional optimization that the finder
considered to be the groundbreaking discovery.)</p>
<p>
<p>
Now, a geometric reduction in complexity is a great thing,
but
it's minuscule compared to exponential growth.
</p>
<p>
In 2013, Web browsers required a minimum of RSA-2048,
which means that the collision space is around
2&sup1;&#x2070;&sup2;&#x2074;,
and the birthday paradox tells us that you'll need
to generate around 2&#x2075;&sup1;&sup2; items to have a 50% chance
of finding a collision.
Applying the groundbreaking discovery reduces the number
of items to 2&sup2;&#x2075;&#x2076;.
</p>
<p>
This is even worse than
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20131029-00/?p=2803">
enumerating all the GUIDs</a>.
At least there are only 2&sup1;&sup2;&#x2078; of those.
</p>
<p>
This algorithm for factoring an RSA-2048 number
would require storing
2&sup2;&#x2075;&#x2076; values.
That's the <i>square</i> of the number of GUIDs.
</p>
<p>
We calculated earlier that storing all the GUIDs on SSDs
would require 100 earth-sized planets.
Storing all the values required for this algorithm
to factor an RSA-2048 number would require, um, a lot more than that.
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way#Size_and_mass">
Current upper estimates for the mass of the Milky Way</a>
put it at
4.5 &times; 10&sup1;&sup2; solar masses,
or (rounding up) 10&sup1;&#x2079; earth masses.
If we need 100 earth masses to store
2&sup1;&sup2;&#x2078; 128-bit values,
then storing 2&sup2;&#x2075;&#x2076; 1024-bit values
will require around
2&sup1;&sup3;&sup2; &times; 100
&#x2245; 
10&#x2074;&sup1; earth masses
&#x2245; 
10&sup2;&sup2; Milky Way-sized galaxies.
</p>
<p>
This seems impractical.
</p>
<p>
The finder, however, disagreed with our analysis
and insisted that their trial runs with smaller values
indicated that the running time was linear in the exponent.
"I was able to factor numbers up to 64 bits in size,
with the largest taking less than a second."
</p>
<p>
We decided to take a tip from
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060529-03/?p=31043">
a number theorist who had to deal with factorization algorithms
submitted by crackpots</a> and suggested to the finder that they
use their advanced algorithm to factor one of the
root signing certificates.
</p>
<p>
The finder replied back,
"I know what you're trying to do, but I'm telling you that
I cannot run the algorithm on numbers that large on my laptop.
But you can certainly run it on one of your more powerful computers.
I have demonstrated that the algorithm is linear in the
key length, and my personal lack of access to supercomputers
does not invalidate that fact.
I have contacted the media about this discovery,
but fortunately for you, they don't seem to be interested, which gives
you more time to address the problem."
</p>
<p>
If the algorithm were truly linear in the exponent,
then going from 64-bit numbers to
2048-bit numbers would take only 32 times as long.
The 1-second run time would increase to just 32 seconds.
So let it run for a minute. Five minutes just to be sure.
Your laptop can certainly handle that.
</p>
<p>
But instead of replying, we decided to disengage.
Never wrestle with a pig.

		<p>&#8220;I cannot run the algorithm on numbers that large on my laptop.&#8221; &#8211; I guess that also means that their laptop is incapable of verifying any digital signatures generated by such certificates.

		<p>No; VERYIFYING digital signatures is not as hard a problem as factoring the large numbers used in cryptography.  It is kind of amazing that the product of two &#8220;sufficiently large&#8221; primes is so hard to factor, but it is.</p>

		<p>But factoring <i>was</i> easy, so this person claimed, if only they had a machine capable of dealing with such numbers. That&#8217;s the point I was trying to make.</p>
<p>I spent a long time lurking on sci.crypt in the past. I&#8217;m well aware of the levels of crack-pottery that is out there, thanks.</p>

		<p>Given the realities of trying to factor very large numbers, the finder would likely have much better success in obeying the #1 law of encryption &#8211; &#8220;Encryption is easy.  Key management is very hard.&#8221;  In today&#8217;s world, every programming framework has all of the latest methods built in.  One merely needs to call a few routines and, Bingo!  High quality encryption is yours.  The truly difficult part is managing keys.  Keys can be easily compromised by malware.  Easier yet, is the fact that humans are easily tricked.  Social engineering works very well within the arena of penetrating a system.</p>
<p>I give the finder credit for trying because we can learn quite a bit from our failures.  The finder would be better off trying to take the easier path.</p>

		<p>My general understanding of most crypto vulns at the moment is that they fall into several categories: Implementation mistakes, side channel attacks, and if you&#8217;re dependent on larger primes quantum computers as soon as they can figure out how to entangle more qbits to be useful (this gets stupid complicated quickly). The first two are patchable, the latter is something that is being worked on right now with a goal of getting a good and common solution in place long before quantum computers get to the point of being a problem. That said the line in the sand is usually what sort of computer you can afford to buy with a couple million dollars (e.g. what organized crime would have). You should always assume that governments can break any sort of crypto&#8230; they have the money and the resource to break it, or to execute the infamous knee-cap attack that works against almost every encryption scheme. Because people forget that they are the weakest link in the chain.</p>

		<p>My immediate thought upon reading the first sentence was &#8220;Wait, this is the plot to &#8216;Sneakers&#8217;.&#8221;  (I happened to watch it on Prime a couple of days ago)<br />
It also reminds me of a 3d algorithm I had brainstormed ages ago, before consumer-grade hardware acceleration. I would precalculate all possible triangles on the assumption/hope that rotation frames could be derived from some kind of simple equation to tell you which &#8220;cell&#8221; to hop to. I figured it would revolutionalize 3D rendering if it worked, but I didn&#8217;t even get to the algorithm because it took some crazy amount of (90s-era) memory to store them all; I optimized it to something like a third of that size, but it was still something like 100 MB, and I was still looking at the strong possibility of major computational expenses that probably wouldn&#8217;t even work.<br />
Those rabbit holes are so damn enticing that I can see where the finder is coming from, but you always have to listen at least a little to that voice of doubt telling you that reality is still there.</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
