<p>
The <code>XCOPY</code> command has a flag called <code>/V</code>,
which stands for <i>verify</i>.
Sort of.
</p>
<pre>
  /V           Verifies the size of each new file.
</pre>
<p>
First, the easy question:
What does this flag do?
</p>
<p>
Answer: If this flag is set,
then after a file is copied,
the <code>XCOPY</code> program
will verify that the source and destination files are the same size.
</p>
<p>
As you might surmise, this doesn't really get you much.
On top of that,
disk caching means that the file size it reads most likely did not
come from the hard drive.
It came from the disk cache.
So it's essentially verifying that RAM is not corrupted,
which is really not all that interesting.
</p>
<p>
But wait, why does this flag even exist,
seeing as it's so lame as to be useless?
</p>
<p>
The <code>XCOPY</code> command got the <code>/V</code> option
from the <code>COPY</code> command.
You can even find remnants of that command today:
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; VERIFY /?
Tells cmd.exe whether to verify that your files are written correctly to a
disk.

VERIFY [ON | OFF]

Type VERIFY without a parameter to display the current VERIFY setting.
C:\&gt; VERIFY
VERIFY is off.
</pre>
<p>
What does it mean to "verify that your files are written correctly
to a disk"?
</p>
<p>
What it means to <code>CMD.EXE</code>
is that after copying each file, it goes back and rereads both the
source and destination and performs a byte-for-byte comparison of the files.
If any bytes differ, it reports an error.
</p>
<p>
And in the presence of disk caches, this comparison
is largely useless,
since both the source and destination are most likely still in the
disk cache, so all this is doing is comparing two RAM buffers against
each other, which has nothing to do with whether the file got written
successfully to disk.
</p>
<p>
Okay, so why does <code>COPY</code> have this weird verify behavior?
</p>
<p>
All this rigamarole over "verifying" comes from MS-DOS.
Normally, when MS-DOS wrote to the disk, it issued command 8 (write)
to the device driver.
But if you did a
<code>VERIFY ON</code>, then MS-DOS would issue command 9 (write with
verify) instead.
Device drivers were expected to handle the "write with verify"
command by writing the data to the disk,
then reading the data back and comparing it to what should have been
written.
</p>
<p>
At the end of the day, it was up to the device driver to do the
verification.
All that <code>VERIFY ON</code> did was set a flag that eventually
made its way down to the device driver,
who was expected to do something.
</p>
<p>
Okay, now let's run the time machine forward again.
MS-DOS had this <code>VERIFY ON</code> thing.
But in the new I/O model, there is no "write and verify" command.
There's just "write".
So <code>CMD.EXE</code> fakes it by doing its own verification:
After copying a file, it reads it back.
And <code>XCOPY.EXE</code> fakes it by simply checking whether the
file sizes match.
Neither of these fake verifications really accomplish much
because of disk caching.
But the options are there for backward compatibility.</p>

		<p>One where if the disk cache buffers actually weren&#8217;t identical, and (x)copy said the file verified but then they really weren&#8217;t the same after flushing.</p>
<p>While rare, RAM bits can get flipped. So at least checking the cache buffers you do the best you can before they flush to media.</p>

		<p>IIRC, it is not just &#8216;device driver would compare&#8217; etc. &#8220;by writing the data to the disk, then reading the data back and comparing it to what should have been written. &#8221;</p>
<p>There&#8217;s special &#8216;verify&#8217; command that is handled by floppy disk controller, and thing it does is to read the track(actually, either whole track or N sectors) and calc checksum.<br />
Command code is D6, the actual data is not transferred to the RAM, CRC code is checked in FDC for each sector.</p>
<p>So, originally, what VERIFY ON does is to check if CRC of data in the sector corresponds to the CRC from sector header.</p>

		<p>Well, right. According to the sources of MS-DOS in public domain, VERIFY ON is translated into call #4 for int 13h, which is BIOS &#8216;verify&#8217; that directly throws verify command to the FDC.</p>

		<p>So in the event that xcopy was used to copy data between two disks (using /W)&#8230; the assumption is that the file size would be sufficient?</p>
<p>seems like floppy disk corruption would be the exact situation where byte-by-byte verification would benefit most.</p>

		<p>For once, a most disappointing telling of the story.</p>
<p>Was there a fly on the wall when the &#8220;new I/O&#8221; model was hashed out who could tell us why hardware verification was tossed off so lightly to the device driver?</p>
<p>How did the conversation go when the XCOPY developer decided to total subvert/redefine &#8220;verify&#8221; as used by the copy command (i.e. floppy CRC verification)?  Remember, the original XCOPY intent was to do exactly what copy did, only do it by batching as much I/O together as possible so to reduce floppy disk swaps&#8230;</p>
<p>And did the original software people who had suffered from bad media and realized they could build assistance into the operating system (/v, VERIFY) ever raise their voices when verification was gutted?</p>
<p>If the history could be assembled, it would make a good case study in project evolution / programming psychology / inter-group communication failures.</p>

		<p>The MS-DOS version of XCOPY used the MS-DOS &#8220;verify&#8221; command, which did whatever MS-DOS did. It&#8217;s the Win32 version of XCOPY that was stuck with a /V flag that didn&#8217;t have equivalent semantics in Win32.</p>

		<p>By the time of DOS 6.22, the verify wasn&#8217;t exactly useful. Most systems had sufficient memory to make a sizable disk cache which concealed some of these errors. </p>
<p>Now, if instead, one was back in the multitasking floppy only world of the PDP-11, verify was tremendously useful. The destination floppy might have damage and not record the file or the super long floppy cable might encounter noise. So DEC PIP had a verify option, CP/M PIP implemented the idea, and then DOS included equivalents to much of the CP/M feature set.</p>

		<p>In theory, the destination might allow write but not read; so xcopy /v would be a way to both copy the file and confirm read access on the destination, in a single command.</p>

		<p>Uhh, what&#8217;s &#8220;command 8&#8221; and &#8220;command 9&#8221;?  The only one I&#8217;m familiar with was AH=43h with AL=00 or 01 to control verify.  In any case the &#8220;write with verify&#8221; option was always rather optimistic, the most frequently-applied way to implement it was to ignore the flag.</p>

		<p>Btw, the &#8220;Set Features&#8221; (EFh) command of ATAPI command supports subcommand &#8220;Enable Write-Read-Verify&#8221; (0BH) (command reference section 7.47.10). When set to mode 00H, it&#8217;ll make the disk verify written location is readable after each write without additional burden to the system. If the read after write fails, the controller will report error to the system. So I think the verify option is still feasible on HDD today too.</p>
<p>Of cource the disk controller can lie and don&#8217;t do what it supposed to, but just like the controller can lie about what it does when you command it to do buffer flush, it doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t write feature rely on that when it&#8217;s needed.</p>

		<p>Almost forgot it, the command sets global state on disk hence will slow down write performance on disk with head on other application as well during the setting is effective. I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;ll have any performance problem on SSD.</p>
<p>Is there documentated way to enable this feature on my SSDs or it&#8217;s enabled by default now (I think on Win10 because SSDs are now becoming more common)?</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
