My father-in-law was planning on taking the train to the airport.
He heard that the train comes every ten minutes.
By his calculations, then,
he could catch the 7:50 train and be at the airport
by 7:55.
</p>
<p>
Reasoning:
Since the train comes every ten minutes,
then it must take five minutes to get to the airport,
and five minutes to come back.
</p>
<p>
Logic!
</p>
<p>
(If true, then it means that the train travels at around
170mph &#x2248; 270kph.)</p>

		<p>One of the large airlines used to have a flight from New York City to Chicago, and back, almost every half-hour during the daytime hours.  Now it&#8217;s every half-hour or hour.  The same principle must apply&#8230;.</p>

		<p>Your speed calculations assume boarding takes no time. It&#8217;s also an average speed. I think the train must have a regular top-speed twice or triple that to take both of these facts into account. Barf bags and seat straps not included.</p>

		<p>The word &#8220;the&#8221; is the trick with this ðŸ˜€</p>
<p>People using the word train to really refer to the train service.</p>
<p>A train servicing this route will come every ten minutes</p>
<p>Versus</p>
<p>The train servicing this route will come every ten minutes </p>
<p>The latter sounds ridiculous of course, but that&#8217;s the literal interpretation that the FiL has run with.</p>

		<p>With no other context, it *is* a logical conclusion.</p>
<p>However &#8230; you&#8217;d think someone who is old enough to be not only a &#8220;father&#8221;, but a &#8220;father-in-law&#8221; would *expect* other stops on the route!</p>

		<p>If only we had trains in the US that roll along at 170 mph.  The best we&#8217;ve got that&#8217;s in regular service is the Acela, and that tops out at roughly 140 mph, and only for part of the ride.</p>

		<p>My normal &#8220;I&#8217;ll believe when I see it filter&#8221; is still blocking most of the news about this, but&#8230;<br />
News about the Dallas to Houston &#8220;Bullet Train&#8221; is becoming more frequent.  The feds have picked a route and it&#8217;s now in the public comment phase:<br />
<a href="https://www.dallasnews.com/news/transportation/2018/01/16/dallas-open-house-will-publics-first-chance-weigh-high-speed-rail-proposal" rel="nofollow">https://www.dallasnews.com/news/transportation/2018/01/16/dallas-open-house-will-publics-first-chance-weigh-high-speed-rail-proposal</a><br />
What&#8217;s interesting about this is that someone thinks they can finance this without the government being involved.  Of course, whenever I hear them talk, I have that Simpson&#8217;s Monorail tune serenading my thoughts.</p>

		<p>You could indeed have trains that go at 170mph. The only question that you would have to ask would be how long the train would stay on the tracks. :-)</p>
<p>My suggestion is that trains should be outfitted with a flux capacitor. That way they would only have to go 88mph, and they could arrive at their destination before they leave!</p>

		<p>Trains in Japan and across Europe manage to travel faster than 170 mph on a daily basis.  Then again, Japan and countries in the EU have also invested a lot more money into railway infrastructure improvements compared to the US, which often results in straight, level, grade-separated, electrified track.  The Acela&#8217;s route has precious little such track, and it&#8217;s on those portions where they can really push it to 140 +.  Much of the track follows old-school tracks built for much slow trains, tracks that have tight curves and at-grade road crossings, which limit it&#8217;s top speed.</p>

		<p>Donâ€™t forget china. I believe they have the largest high speed railway network. Their bullet trains run between 250 and 350 km/h.</p>

		<p>170 mph isn&#8217;t all that fast&#8230; inter-city trains in Japan cruise at about 200 mph, and if you want to get to an airport quickly, the maglev connecting Shanghai airport to the city peaks at about 270 mph. And even that&#8217;s pretty slow compared to the prototype being trialed in Japan, which has been clocked at a ridiculous 370 mph.</p>

		<p>Yeah, our trains don&#8217;t have much trouble staying on track at nearly 200 mph (operating top speed for the TGV is 190 or 200Â mph depending on the route). In about 30 years of operation, there have been only a handful of trains derailing at high speed and no fatalities involving trains going at high speed (not having level crossing between roads and high-speed track sections helps a lot with that).</p>
<p>A whole-trip average speed of 170Â mph is not impossible on a multi-hour trip. It&#8217;s quite impossible on a 5-minute trip, though.</p>

		<p>You&#8217;re assuming the trains don&#8217;t need accel/brake distance, and like others said, passenger load/unload completed instantaneously.</p>
<p>Btw, maybe you think it&#8217;s bad staff, but IMO it&#8217;s just funny stuff. Personally I don&#8217;t mind people posting &#8220;things that I thought with faulty reasoning&#8221; to the blogs, provided no name explicitly given.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
