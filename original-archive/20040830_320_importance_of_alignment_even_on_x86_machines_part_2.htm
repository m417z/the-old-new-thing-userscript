<p>The various Interlocked functions (InterlockedIncrement, and so on) require that the variable being updated be properly aligned, even on x86, a platform where the CPU silently fixes unaligned memory access invisibly.</p>
<p> If you pass an unaligned pointer to one of the Interlocked functions, the operation will still succeed, but the result won't be atomic.  Another processor may see a partially-completed update. </p>
<p> This is a particularly insidious bug since it happens only on multiprocessor machines under very tight timing conditions. You will be hard-pressed to reproduce this in the laboratory. </p>
<p> (A commenter <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/08/27/221486.aspx#221771"> stole my thunder and remarked on it yesterday</a>.) </p>
<p> Moral of the story: Same as yesterday.  Mind your alignment. </p>

		<p>Actually, this is not entirely true.<br />
<br />Operations (such as Interlocked*) are using the lock# signal on the bus.<br />
<br />According to Intel&#8217;s documentation, IA-32 System programming guide, section 7.1.2.2:<br />
<br />&quot;The integrity of a bus lock is not affected by the alignment of the memory field. The LOCK<br />
<br />semantics are followed for as many bus cycles as necessary to update the entire operand.&quot;</p>
<p>In addition, for PERFORMANCE reasons:<br />
<br />&quot;&#8230; it is recommend that locked accesses be aligned on their natural boundaries for better<br />
<br />system performance:<br />
<br />• Any boundary for an 8-bit access (locked or otherwise).<br />
<br />• 16-bit boundary for locked word accesses.<br />
<br />• 32-bit boundary for locked doubleword access.<br />
<br />• 64-bit boundary for locked quadword access.<br />
<br />&quot;</p>

		<p>This may be true for the most recent IA-32 processors, but it certainly was NOT true in the past.  There have been very real bugs (even as far back as the 8088) where unaligned use of the LOCK instruction caused inconsistant results.<br /></p>

		<p>FYI, I checked an old Pentium Pro manual and it includes the same statement.</p>
<p>But one has to wonder whether it holds true on non-Intel x86 processors. I wouldn&#8217;t count on it&#8230;</p>

		<p>I wouldn&#8217;t worry about any current non-Intel x86 CPUs. The clones have to maintain a very high level of compatibility or else lots of software, particularly OS kernels, will break. This includes handling a page fault which causes the CPU to attempt invoke a fault handler from an interrupt vector that is on a non-resident page&#8230;.</p>
<p>Digging around a bit on Google Groups, however, I found an article that describes systems that don&#8217;t support unaligned locked transactions (<a target="_new" href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;selm=7ulma9%24sg%241%40nnrp1.deja.com" rel="nofollow">http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&#038;lr=&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;selm=7ulma9%24sg%241%40nnrp1.deja.com</a>). It seems that even if the CPU supports such transactions, older multiprocessor glue logic may not. The article also says that such systems aren&#8217;t very compatible in general, though.<br /></p>

<p>&gt; There have been very real bugs (even as far<br />
<br />&gt; back as the 8088) where unaligned use of the<br />
<br />&gt; LOCK instruction caused inconsistant<br />
<br />&gt; results. </p>
<p>Something is odd here.</p>
<p>The 8086 did 16-bit bus accesses and it&#8217;s easy to imagine how unaligned addresses might not mix well with the LOCK prefix.  (It&#8217;s also easy to imagine that Intel might have already considered and decided to make it work, so this guess is just a guess.)</p>
<p>The 8088 did 8-bit bus accesses so a 16-bit operand required 2 bus accesses.  There was no meaning to 16-bit alignment.</p>

<p>&gt; I wouldn&#8217;t worry about any current non-Intel<br />
<br />&gt; x86 CPUs.</p>
<p>Neither did one of my co-workers about 3 years ago.  His code accessed fields of .BMP structures as defined and unaligned.  I don&#8217;t remember if Windows CE recovered after killing the application, or if Windows CE hanged.  Anyway I tried to teach him about alignment and the memcpy() function.  It turned out that my boss had told him that all the fields were aligned and he shouldn&#8217;t worry about unaligned accesses.  Oops.</p>
<p>Personally I think it&#8217;s better if the hardware does handle unaligned operands automatically.  Applications don&#8217;t always get to specify the data layout, and graceful degradation of hardware performance is still tons faster than calling memcpy().</p>

<p>Well, they <em>are</em> clones, just not design clones. Whether you like it or not Intel still calls the shots on x86-32 behavior. AMD may manages to grab the wheel for x86-64, but only time will tell.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
