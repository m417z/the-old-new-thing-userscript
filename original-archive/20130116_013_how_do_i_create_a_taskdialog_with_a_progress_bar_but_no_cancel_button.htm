<p> "Is there a way to remove all the buttons from a Task Dialog?" </p>
<p> Um, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/03/08/546177.aspx"> users hate it when you give them a window that cannot be closed or cancelled</a>. What should the user do if the reticulation server stops responding? Shut down the computer? (Hey, at least shutting down the computer <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb394721.aspx"> will actually work</a>.) </p>
<p> "The process usually takes around two seconds, and we time out after ten. In the case of timeout, we replace the progress dialog with a failure dialog with the options Close and Retry. But for this dialog, we just want to show the progress bar so they know that we are doing something. We have not yet finalized the design. One design is to have a Cancel button on the progress dialog; another is to remove the option to Cancel. We're just investigating the possibility of the second option. We haven't committed to it yet." </p>
<p> You should leave the Cancel button enabled, and if the user clicks it, then go straight to the "timed out" dialog. Removing the Cancel button leaves the user trapped in a dialog box with no escape route. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: By an astonishing coincidence, a few weeks after this email exchange concluded, I happened to encounter the <i>Reticulating Splines</i> dialog, and it got stuck, and there was no Cancel button. The frustrated user who got trapped with a window that could not be closed or cancelled turned out to be <i>me</i>. </p>

		<p>Not to take away from the point of the article which is don&#39;t implement a brain dead UI. &nbsp;But if you are determined to frustrate your users, wouldn&#39;t it have been much easier just to implement a trivial dialog with just a progress bar rather than spend hours trying to figure out how to force a task dialog to do your bidding, then burn a tech support incident, wait for a response.</p>
<p>Now imagining how it went after Raymond responded, I can envision their programmer spelunking around with FindWindow and EnumChildWindows to find the control with the correct ID and calling ShowWindow on it. &nbsp;This will break in some future version of windows and then Raymond will have to implement a compatibility shim for the software. &nbsp;So Raymond can look forward to fixing things again in the future.</p>

		<p>Agree with the philosophy of not showing a dialog that can&#39;t be closed.</p>
<p>But if one doesn&#39;t want the Cancel button, why not just include a close button in the caption area?</p>
<p>Just because the UI has to remain usable, that doesn&#39;t mean it has to remain cluttered.</p>

		<p>Does it really matter if there was no cancel button? I mean, really, the cancel button on your dialog just brings me back to this page with the progress bar still stuck at the same location.</p>

		<p>Users also hate it when confronted with a progress bar that does not indicate how much progress is being made.</p>
<p>Judging by the screen shot showing a chunk of blue in the middle of the space allocated for the bar, this is one of those rotating-pattern things that fails to reassure me that anything other than the pattern-rotating thread is still alive.</p>

		<p>@dave yes but usually just showing generic progress is the best you can do as users also hate it when you initially predict 2 mins to completion then constantly recalculate how long till completion.</p>

		<p>Funny, that&#39;s pretty much how I feel about not being able to dismiss apps on my win8 slab, particularly the apps that have gotten stuck doing something and I can&#39;t re-spawn them (I&#39;m looking at <em>you</em> kindle!). &nbsp;I guess you are just old fashioned Raymond, its modern to feel trapped.</p>

		<p>I have my own Cancel button for programs that don&#39;t provide their own&#8230; &quot;End Process&quot;.</p>
<p>@dave @jk @john Windows actually cheats and provides progress bars where they don&#39;t know how long something will take, at one point. &nbsp;IIRC it&#39;s in service start/stop from the services snap-in. &nbsp;You&#39;ll see the progress bar fill up slowly and then pause near the end and slow down filling A LOT, IIRC. &nbsp;The dialog winks out as soon as the operation completes, even if the progress bar only just started filling.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve done something like that &quot;No Cancel Button&quot; deliberately. Two basic cases:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>The dialog box is monitoring a system process at a higher level privilege. In this case, the user doesn&#39;t have permission to alter the operation. The monitor can be closed (button &quot;Exit&quot;) but the operation will run in the background.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Cancelling the operation would leave the system in a wedged state for which the only option is to restart it anyway. In this case, I didn&#39;t implement cancel at all as there&#39;d be no point. I&#39;m aware of &quot;End Process&quot;. If you need to do that, you will need to restart the operation or go get your backups.</p>
</li>
</ol>

		<p>I wish more companies had someone to tell them this sort of thing. I&#39;ve encountered so many dialogs where force-killing the application was the only way out when something died (of course, catching an exception that stops the task but still leaving the dialog box up is a WTF in itself). The worst, though, is when there is a cancel button that does nothing or puts you in a situation with even less control. Often this seems to be when it tries to reverse the operation and either 1) that in itself takes a ridiculous amount of time and there is no cancel button on the backing-out or 2) the reason for the initial task failing also causes the backing-out to fail and there&#39;s still no cancel button.</p>

		<p>I use a C++ IDE (not VS) that likes to hang every once in a while with an animated progress bar that doesn&#39;t show real progress and a cancel button. &nbsp;Clicking cancel does nothing. &nbsp;Sometimes it makes things worse by locking up the entire UI. &nbsp;So I guess if you&#39;re going to provide a cancel button, make sure it can actually cancel operations in progress.</p>

		<p>The Adobe Flash plug-in installer has a progress bar that guesses (I&#39;m not sure how) the install operation is going to take. &nbsp;The progress bar smoothly fills up from 0% up to 100% as time goes on. &nbsp;If the installation finishes before the predicted time, it jumps from wherever it is to 100%. &nbsp;If the installation takes longer than predicted, it just halts at 99% until it finishes.</p>
<p>Frankly, I&#39;d rather have the rotating pattern than that, since the total duration can depend on so many unpredictable external factors.</p>

		<p>@Adam Rosenfield: And I&#39;d rather have one that advances irregularly with the steps than that.</p>
<p>The Windows XP installation had a &quot;time remaining&quot; that could be considered as a progress bar as it did no time measurement. Shaping that as a progress bar would work surprisingly well.</p>

		<p>@jon I think it&#39;s time to get over it. Users hate having to learn the difference between the left and right mouse buttons, users hate having to decide between yes and no when a dialog asks if they want to save their document, users hate having to get out of bed in the morning.</p>
<p>Where I work we&#39;ve had a custom app for years that launches on startup and presents the users with a grid of the applications that they have access to. Hmm&#8230;sounds familiar.</p>

<p>Well, if you have a concrete measure of progress (like size of file copied), just show that without making a time estimate. Of course, don&#39;t take too long figuring out the size. You could show a label showing what you <em>do</em> know, for open-ended tasks (like what file you are on, how many files have been copied so far), but be careful you don&#39;t update the label too often or you&#39;ll become I/O bound in the GUI.</p>

<p>Good example, but there is a more common one! Windows explorer green progress bar in the breadcrumb address bar, certainly in Windows Vista and 7&#8230; once it gets toward the end of the speed of travel decreases in halves. Before it often reaches the end, the task is completed, and the green bar shoots across filling the address bar, or, it times out and the same thing happens yet with a dialogue box.</p>
<p>Try putting a scratched DVD in or something or a very large folder with thousands of files in over a slow WAN link etc, you&#39;ll soon see it in action.</p>
<p>I am sure it is not just me that has noticed that in EVERY single movie out there the progress bar to &quot;launch the missiles&quot; or whatever goes smoothly from 0% to 100%, and also makes some sort of beeping or ticking noise along the way as well as when any sort of screen change or text is displayed.</p>

		<p>@Anonymous Coward</p>
<p>Maybe if the designer pleading for help was better at dialog design he or she wouldn&#39;t be trapped! How am I supposed to know what OK and Cancel do? Does &quot;OK&quot; mean &quot;OK I&#39;ll help you&quot; or does it mean &quot;It&#39;s OK that you&#39;re trapped&quot;?</p>
<p>Sheesh, I mean this is like UI design 101. If your dialogs have OK/Cancel buttons on them you can probably improve them. :-)</p>

		<p>@The MAZZTer: That&#39;s a consequence of the Service Control Manager API. The dialog assumes (because it has no prior knowledge) that a service will take 20 seconds to start or stop. Well-written services can (and should) call the SetServiceStatus function, passing a SERVICE_STATUS structure, to inform the SCM (which informs its caller) of how the start or stop action is progressing. It indicates with the dwCheckPoint member how far it has got, and uses the dwWaitTime member to indicate how much longer it is estimated to take.</p>
<p>The Services snap-in merely reports back what the service is telling the SCM. However, it often has already consumed a large percentage of the progress bar when the service starts to say &#39;er, that&#39;s going to take a bit longer actually&#8230;&#39; and can only fill the remaining portion more slowly. Rewinding the progress bar to reflect the new actual progress versus new expected duration is probably *more* confusing than slowing down.</p>

		<p>Thinking about it&#8230; We really need a kind of time-to-timeout progress bar</p>

		<p>This sounds like something that would appear on the Interface Hall of Shame.</p>
<p>I remember the Worms 2 progress bar didn&#39;t display real progress, just elapsed time, so if scenery generation took too long you would see it wrap around to zero again.</p>

<p>Windows 8 can already do that fairly easily; go to Folder Options, View tab, and check &#39;Restore previous folder at Windows log-on&#39;. &nbsp;So long as you have at least one Windows Explorer window open when you shut down, the next startup will show the Start screen and then immediately switch to the Desktop and re-open your Explorer window. &nbsp;I assume that this would also work if you set any other Desktop application to open on start up in the usual way, though I haven&#39;t tried it.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
