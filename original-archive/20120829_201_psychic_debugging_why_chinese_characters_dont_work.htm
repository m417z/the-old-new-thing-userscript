<p> Hooray for vague questions! "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/04/21/9999675.aspx">It appears to be useless</a>." </p>
<p> But there were enough tiny clues in the question that made it possible to make a psychic guess. </p>
<p> First of all, the parenthetical "Chinese and English" suggests that there are Chinese characters in the data being passed to the XYZ table-generating tool. </p>
<p> Second of all, one might make a guess that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/03/08/389527.aspx"> the file encoding is wrong</a>. Maybe the XYZ program <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/08/11/8847305.aspx"> expects the file to be in UTF-8 format</a>, but you're saving it in UTF-16 format. Maybe the XYZ program supports only ASCII data. </p>
<p> I never heard back, which could have meant that my psychic powers were right, or it could have meant that my psychic powers were wrong, but the person figured, "No point asking this guy, all he does is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/10/10173111.aspx"> make random guesses based on incomplete information</a>." </p>

		<p>&quot;No point asking this guy, all he does is make random guesses based on incomplete information.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s more or less what I say about a certain guy who tries psychic debugging but simply isn&#39;t good enough to do it.</p>

		<p>@Joshua The distinction lies in &#39;Why is he making random guesses on incomplete information?&#39;. Is it unavailable to him, or is he just ignoring it?</p>

		<p>For the end user it&#39;s sometimes impossible to figure out which seemingly unrelated bit of information holds the clue to the riddle, so cut him some slack. Also, if you really want to know if your advice works, it&#39;s best to initiate some kind of follow-up.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
