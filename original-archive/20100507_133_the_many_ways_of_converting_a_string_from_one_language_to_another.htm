<p>A customer asked, "I'm looking for a way to convert English characters to another language. For example, if the target language is Arabic and the string is the word Hello, I want it to convert to <nobr>H(Arabic)<wbr>e(Arabic)<wbr>l(Arabic)<wbr>l(Arabic)<wbr>o(Arabic)</wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></nobr>."</p>
<p> The question is still vague, even with the assistance of the example, since it's not clear what "H(Arabic)" means. </p>
<p> There are a variety of ways of converting a string from one language to another. Here are a few I was able to think of. </p>
<ul>
<li>Translation. For example, converting <i>cat</i> to German     would result in <i lang="de">Katze</i>.     Of course, there are many words with no good direct translation     and others which are ambiguous.     <i>Good-bye</i> is normally <i lang="de">Auf Wiedersehen</i>,     but if you're saying good-bye to someone on the telephone, then it's     <i lang="de">Auf Wiederh&ouml;ren</i>.     But at least in that case, even if you get it wrong, the     reader has some idea of what you meant.     Whereas <i>sort</i> could be translated as     <i lang="de">Art</i> (as in <i>What sort of apple is this?</i>)     or as <i lang="de">ordnen</i>     (as in <i>Sort these alphabetically</i>),     and if you get the wrong one,     the reader is completely baffled.     (Now, translation is clearly not what was intended here,     but I included it for completeness.) </li>
<li>     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kierans/archive/2008/12/15/by-popular-demand-transliteration-vs-translation.aspx">     Transliteration</a>.     This is an operation most commonly performed between scripts,     such as how the name of the capital of China     &#21271;&#20140;     becomes <i>Beijing</i> in English.     The great thing about transliteration systems is that you usually have     <a href="http://www.pinyin.info/romanization/compare/zhuyin.html">     many to choose from</a>.     For example, if you prefer Wade-Giles over Pinyin, then     the capital city would be spelled <i>Pei-Ching</i>.     Transliterating to non-alphabetic scripts can be quite a     challenge as well: Everyone is familiar with the story of     Coca-Cola in Chinese.     (<a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC52/">Learn more about Extended Linguistic Services</a> from     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kierans/archive/2008/10/30/what-s-new-for-you-in-windows-7-extended-linguistic-services.aspx">     Kieran Snyder, the long-distance linguist</a>.     I considered linking to specific articles until I realized that     I was basically linking to everything,     so here's     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/kierans/">     the main page</a>. Go nuts.) </li>
<li>Phoneticization.     This is similar to transliteration, but spells out the     sounds when you     cannot assume that the reader is familiar with any particular     transliteration system.     The capital of China would be phoneticized as     <a href="http://www.onlyagame.org/pastshows/2008/08/summer-games-preview-hanging-with-the-us-womens-softball-team-and-living-in-a-judo-house/#jvflv6">     <i>bay-jing</i></a>. </li>
</ul>
<p> As it turns out, the customer wasn't interested in any of these! </p>
<p> What the customer wanted was, "Take the word Hello and imagine how you would type it on a US-English keyboard. Now change the keyboard layout to Arabic and then press exactly the same keys. That's what I want." In other words, the customer wanted to see what the result would have been if you had told a blindfolded touch-typist to type <i>Hello</i>, but secretly replace the US-English keyboard with an Arabic one. </p>
<p> Wow, that's something that hadn't even occurred to me as a possibility. </p>
<p> Fortunately, Michael Kaplan was able to come to the rescue by pointing the customer to the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2005/08/20/454114.aspx"> Keyboard Convert Service</a>. </p>

		<p>If you just give a bunch of strings and words to a human translator, the results are not what you want. This is why translated UI in Windows are quite often botched. You need to give a context to the translator.</p>
<p>Though UI translation is a thankless job; what&#8217;s nice and short in English may become clunky in another language, especially when you have to invent a word equivalent to another English invented word. Take &quot;shortcut&quot; as an example. In Russian Windows 95 it used to be translated as &quot;ярлык&quot;, which is a bit archaic word, meaning &quot;trademark&quot; or &quot;label&quot;. Last I heard it&#8217;s now translated different way, though I never checked.</p>

		<p>Perhaps this was the same guy:</p>
<p>In The Bourne Identity, the name on Bourne&#8217;s Russian passport is written &quot;Foma Kiniaev&quot; in Latin letters and &quot;Aschf Lshtshfum&quot; (Ащьф Лштшфум) in Cyrillic letters. Apparently, the designers of the prop just typed the name in the Russian keyboard layout without actually translating it. The name was corrected in The Bourne Supremacy.</p>

		<p>Eric, that belief is so widespread among tattoo artists and their customers that a sizeable fraction of the material on</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://hanzismatter.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow">http://hanzismatter.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>is based on idiotic rules for trying to transliterate English to Han characters in this fashion. As with pyramid schemes or suction devices to increase your manhood these rules can&#8217;t work, but a lot of people don&#8217;t know that and unscrupulous individuals are happy to take their money.</p>

<p>Ain&#8217;t that the truth. One of the most hilarious examples I&#8217;ve seen was Solitaire in the Dutch version of Windows Mobile 5. The &quot;draw&quot; button was mistranslated as &quot;tekenen&quot;, which is draw as in &quot;draw a picture&quot;, not &quot;draw a card&quot;. :)</p>
<p>Which means that apparently the translator didn&#8217;t even know what application the strings were for.</p>

		<p>&quot;In other words, the customer wanted to see what the result would have been if you had told a blindfolded touch-typist to type Hello, but secretly replace the US-English keyboard with an Arabic one.&quot;</p>
<p>Upon reading this, I immediately began to worry that this customer thought they could solve their i18n problems by converting everything to English before storing it, and reversing the process when displaying it.</p>

		<p>This is how I create passwords that conform to domain policy of having a non-alphanumeric character: I pick a Hebrew word, and make sure it contain one of the letters (ץףת), which on a US-English keyboard would come out as (.,;) respectively.</p>
<p>Eric Lippert: Being the only person around who (kind of) understand how Chinese works, I find myself explaining this a lot. It doesn&#8217;t help that most people here are bi-linigual (Hebrew/English) or tri-lingual (Russian too), and all those languages have different scripts &#8211; but all are phonetic!</p>

		<p>Michael: &quot;I can&#8217;t imagine what use such a thing would be.&quot;</p>
<p>I could imagine someone trying to make their (web?) application accessible to an Arabic-speaking traveler who is borrowing a computer with a US-English keyboard but wants to write emails/IMs/twitters in his own language. Solution: remap the keyboard at the application level!</p>
<p>It is easy to point to problems with this strategy, but it is at least conceivable that someone would expect it to be a nice feature. (At least less stupid than thinking that you can translate texts character-for-character).</p>

<p>Well, since we know that Arabic reads right-to-left we can re-write that as</p>
<p>(Arabic)o(Arabic)l(Arabic)l(Arabic)e(Arabic)H</p>
<p>And now it&#8217;s clear: he&#8217;s trying to cast each letter to Arabic. &nbsp;Since this is just a static cast it makes sense that we&#8217;re just taking the position of the letter on the keyboard and switching keyboard layouts.</p>
<p>If he wanted to translate the letters, he obviously would have done: reinterpret_cast&lt;Arabic&gt;(H), reinterpret_cast&lt;Arabic&gt;(e), etc.</p>

		<p>@Alexandre Grigoriev: It is difficult when you don&#8217;t know context. That&#8217;s why the corporation I work for has QA testers that know the language and actually test the product itself, then write defects on every string that makes no sense.</p>
<p>(From the size of most databases, I think it might be all of them)</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also why it is good form to provide comments on the context to the translators.</p>

		<p>@grumpy:</p>
<p>Video game consoles are notoriously bad at this. Pretty much all of them associate display language qith a certain keyboard layout. If I decide I want to play a game in french, I&#8217;m stuck with an AZERTY keyboard. On the other hand, if I play in English, I don&#8217;t have accents (and a fair number of characters are on bizarre keys).</p>

		<p>I get questions like this one from customers occasionally. My favourite was a guy who wanted to build a device which would generate passwords in Roman characters (that is, A-Z) but would display them to users in their localized script. I didn&#8217;t understand what he meant, so I asked for clarification. He said that suppose the password generated was PANTS and the user locale is set to Chinese. We want to display the Chinese alphabet character for P, then the Chinese alphabet character for A&#8230; the guy actually believed that every other alphabet in the world was just a funny way of writing the 26 letter Roman alphabet. That Chinese *doesn&#8217;t actually have an alphabet* was a tremendous revelation to him. How does someone get to be an adult working full time on globally localizable software without learning this rather basic fact? I don&#8217;t know, but somehow it does happen.</p>

		<p>@Sven: and that&#8217;s why I dread any announcement that [software product I use] now supports [my native language].</p>
<p>For some reason, it never seems to occur to the developers that users might actually prefer the English, untranslated, version.</p>
<p>*Most* of the time, there is an option to change the language, yes, but it&#8217;s rarely easy to find, and sometimes, the option is not there at all (Games for Windows Live is a particularly horrible offender there &#8212; if anyone at Microsoft could be persuaded to go knock their heads against the wall a few times, I&#8217;d be much obliged)</p>

		<p>Alexandre: what&#8217;s wrong with translating shortcut as ярлык? &nbsp;There are plenty of repurposed archaic words in English, like console, daemon, cache. &nbsp;You&#8217;re right that certain phrases can end up significantly longer or mangled, but jargon tends to end up with a concise equivalent.</p>

		<p>One common property of official transliteration schemes is that their use causes the reader to gratingly mispronounce the words. I never understood how it is that the same learned people who bitch when people get it wrong, insist on having us use the official scheme instead of one more tailored to the reader&#8217;s language.</p>

		<p>Talking about UI translations, the Simplified Chinese version of Windows translates &quot;Logout&quot; to &quot;注銷&quot; (which means &quot;deregistering and throw it away&quot;) always makes me ponder a while before hitting that button.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Traditional Chinese version &quot;登出&quot; (which means &quot;registering out&quot;) makes better sense.</p>
<p>It leaves me wondering why both version have different wordings for the same thing.</p>

		<p>Since we&#8217;re talking about keyboards, I noticed that on Windows 7 my keyboard will sometimes switch to US English even though I only have Slovenian layout installed (specifically because I hate how some programs switch to the English layout when it&#8217;s available).</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t yet found out what causes this (it&#8217;s not Alt+Shift &#8211; it does nothing if the layout is Slovenian, but it will switch from English back to Slovenian if it got switched). I get this once or twice per month, though when it does happen, it usually happens several times. I don&#8217;t remember this happening on Vista, and it definitely didn&#8217;t happen on older versions of Windows. Any ideas?</p>

		<p>Games and remote control applications are a particularly evil case of keyboard scanning.</p>
<p>Whilst 99% of applications will honour the remapping of one keyboard to another (i.e. US or UK English to US Dvorak), others will not. Thus you end up with most applications working with one layout, and another using a different layout.</p>
<p>The best solution to this is to use a hardwired keyboard; remapping is a cheap but short term option. If you do have a hardwired keyboard and wish to play games (which are strongly QWERTY and WASD oriented) USB gaming keyboards like the Warrior King (circular keyboard, contains most frequently used keys) are very useful.</p>
<p>I can definitely believe that in very specific cases you might want to remind the user what keyboard they&#8217;re using.</p>

<p>On a mac.</p>
<p>Using bash.</p>

		<p>You might find this interesting: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005421.html" rel="nofollow">http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005421.html</a></p>
<p>It is a post from Language Log about &quot;lytdybr&quot;, which is the Russian word for diary, if typed on a US-English keyboard. The author noted that he had seen the term several times and thought it was an acronym he wasn&#8217;t familiar with.</p>
<p>There is also a follow-up here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005435.html" rel="nofollow">http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/005435.html</a></p>
<p>I hope this doesn&#8217;t get flagged as spam. :-/</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
