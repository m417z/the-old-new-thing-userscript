<p>I answered  <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/04/23/118893.aspx#144621">  this comment</a> directly, but it deserves reiteration with wider  visibility.</p>
<p>  If you don't #define UNICODE, you get ANSI by default.  </p>
<p>  If you want to see characters beyond the boring 7-bit ASCII,  make sure you are using a font that can display those characters.  </p>
<p>  I am assuming a level of competence where issues like this  go without saying, so that I can dig into the more advanced topics  without having to explain all the basics, but I have to accept that  people of all levels of programming experience read my stuff.  </p>
<p>  But the second part raises an advanced question:  How do you find a font that  can display the characters you want? What if the characters can come  from a source outside your control?  We'll look at this tomorrow.  </p>

		<p>Also what about &quot;#define _UNICODE&quot;?</p>

		<p>_UNICODE is for the C runtime&#8217;s TCHAR support, i.e. _tcscpy (&#8211;&gt; wcscpy vs strcpy).  This is distinct from UNICODE, which turns, say, CreateWindowEx into CreateWindowExW instead of CreateWindowExA.</p>

		<p>If one were to say just call the W versions of functions and structures explicitly, would there be a real reason to define UNICODE ? </p>
<p>Just curious, even though typing W all the time is a pain, it could allow a project to have a steady migration over to unicode.</p>

		<p>Yes you can switch over gradually by manually inserting W&#8217;s and L&#8217;s on a per-call basis.</p>

		<p>Where does Microsoft document this?</p>
<p>It seems like the first rule of _UNICODE is that you don&#8217;t talk about _UNICODE.  If you don&#8217;t know about it in the first place, it&#8217;s awfully hard to figure it all out from Microsoft&#8217;s documentation.</p>

		<p>??? If it&#8217;s a secret it&#8217;s a really badly kept one.  #1 hit for _UNICODE on MSDN is <a target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/vccore/html/_core_generic.2d.text_mappings_in_tchar..h.asp" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/vccore/html/_core_generic.2d.text_mappings_in_tchar" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/vccore/html/_core_generic.2d.text_mappings_in_tchar</a>..h.asp</p>

		<p>That’s the way from “I know there is a conditional named _UNICODE” to “I know what _UNICODE does”. Though, the inverse is also easy; the page about strcpy mentions both _UNICODE and _MBCS.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
