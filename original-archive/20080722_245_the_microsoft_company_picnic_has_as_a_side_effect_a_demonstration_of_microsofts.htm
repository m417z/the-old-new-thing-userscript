		<p>I guess one parents only speaks one language, but many can be multi-lingual.</p>
<p>It will be really interesting to see parents say the same scolding words using different languages at the same time :)</p>

		<p>Regarding the text at top, I think it is a overly convoluted management-speak, which Raymond hates so much that he created a link out of it :)</p>

		<p>I grew up in a very ethnically diverse neighborhood, then had the shock of going to a University in which the ethnic mix of the student population was &quot;only&quot; proportionate.</p>
<p>I spent the first two years wondering where all the caucasians came from!</p>
<p>Thankfully now that I&#8217;m at MS things are back to normal. :)</p>

		<p>&quot;I guess one parents only speaks one language, but many can be multi-lingual.&quot;</p>
<p>If the parents have different languages as their first language, typically what they&#8217;ll do is each speak their own native tongue to the child, thus the child grows up bilingual.</p>
<p>A friend of mine is French, and his wife is Australian and that&#8217;s what they do. The side-effect benefit is his wife is learning a lot more French now, too!</p>

		<p>The Microsoft Company Picnic is like The Bite of Seattle, only the trash is actually corralled instead of all over and separate from recyclables.</p>

<p>I hate texts that have non-underlined links. I must hunt them. If it&#8217;s a link, it should be underlined. If it&#8217;s not important, it shouldn&#8217;t be a link.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
