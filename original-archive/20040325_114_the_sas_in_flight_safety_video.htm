<p>Each time I see the  <a href="http://www.sas.se/">SAS</a> in-flight safety video,  I am amused by the story they tell about each of their "characters".</p>
<p>  The safety video features four groups of travellers,  a man and a young girl,  a retired couple,  a (very Scandinavian-looking) businesswoman,  and a (vaguely Hispanic) young man.  </p>
<p>  Each procedure is illustrated one of the four travelling  groups.  How to buckle your seat belt is illustrated by the man and young girl;  the girl can't figure out how the buckle works.  (Unbuckling is demonstrated by the retired gentleman.)  </p>
<p>  When it's time to turn off electronic devices,  a flight attendant politely asks the businesswoman to  put away her laptop computer.  </p>
<p>  When passengers are reminded that smoking is not permitted,  the single guy frustratedly puts his pack of cigarettes away.  </p>
<p>  The retired gentleman has to be reminded to return his seat  to the upright position.  </p>
<p>  The young girl takes a look at the flight safety summary card,  but holds it upside-down.  </p>
<p>  Okay, so what have we learned:  Young girls are unbelievably stupid.  I mean, sure maybe she's too young to read, but certainly  she should know how to hold the (pictographic) safety card  right-side up, no?  Watch out for those Hispanic guys, they want to smoke.  </p>
<p>  After landing, we see each of the travelling groups as they  get off the plane.  The retired couple light up with joy as they hug their adult children  who came to meet them at the airport.  The businesswoman meets her business partner with a friendly handshake.  Mom welcomes the man and daughter with hugs and kisses.  And the single guy just wanders off on his own.  </p>
<p>  He's probably looking for a smoking area.  </p>
<p>  The other thing I find amusing about the safety video is that  after it is completed in English, the video is played a second time  (heavily abbreviated) with Danish subtitles.  "Okay, those slow Americans had to get the long version.  Now here's the quick version for you clever Danes."  </p>

		<p>While we&#8217;re talking about SAS&#8230;</p>
<p>Why do they never have decent business class seats? Is it some kind of latent Scandinavian egalitarianism? (&quot;We&#8217;ll be happy to take more money from businessmen and movie stars but we absolutely refuse to give them special treatment, because all humans are equal&quot;) For puddle hops from Oslo to Heathrow it&#8217;s no big deal, but I would never fly SAS on long haul flights for this reason.</p>

		<p>Actually, the business class are a bit wider, and a small (really small) curtain is pulled so you cannot see from behind. But this is the same in most European short trips in small planes. I have actually travelled Lufthansa in short trips and small planes (without any special business seats), but Munich to Frankfurt in a 3-2-3 arrangement or Frankfurt to South America they have all the niceties.<br /></p>

		<p>Actually, I think you are viewing these videos from a very American perspective. Scandinavia doesn&#8217;t have the same history with racial struggle and interracial violence as America. Analyzing society in terms of race is not something we are used to. In fact, I can&#8217;t even think of a Swedish translation to Hispanic. Therefore, it is quite possible that the young man wasn&#8217;t put in the video as a token hispanic man but that his race was just a coincidence. The businesswoman however, thats another story&#8230;</p>

		<p>I had the misfortune of flying SAS while I was pregnant. I wasn&#8217;t able to eat any of the meals due to the odd fishies, and me not being sure of their mercury content. It wasn&#8217;t all bad, though&#8230; I did very much enjoy playing backgammon for 6 hours. Very smart of them.</p>

		<p>Even without the racial overtones to the Hispanic guy, I found it mildly noteworthy that the dodgy single guy got tagged for all the unpleasant bits.</p>

		<p>I think you&#8217;ll find that it&#8217;s not just Americans who may take advantage of the English version of the video.</p>

		<p>On a related note, the Al-Italia safety video is a hoot to watch.  The animated video has sounds effects for almost everything&#8211;the oxygen masks, clicking in the seat belt, un-reclining the seats&#8230;.And then you see the demonstration of the air sickness bag.</p>
<p>No, there&#8217;s no sound effect but you easily reach the enthymematic conclusion.  Actually, the first time I saw it, my friend and I were almost yelling at the screen as we saw the character lift the bag up to their mouth.</p>

		<p>Heh o&#8230; There are *very nice* biz seats on intercontinental SAS flights. Intra-European, it&#8217;s a bit varied due to different aircraft types (the A321 is good, MDs not so good). Intra-scandinavian, no biz class at all.</p>
<p>And you know, Scandinavians in general have very good knowledge of English, and as such, the danes already got the message the first time around. Subs added for hearing-impaired and elderly people.</p>
<p>The &quot;race-issue&quot; in the video is not an exercise in prejudice, more like an embracement of any type of people.</p>
<p>Although, I guess in the US, the airline would be sued to tatters&#8217;n&#8217;rags.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s interesting, I&#8217;ve recently flown with Travel Service (a small czech charter company) and their safety instruction video is in czech+english (interleaved, each topic is in czech first, then english, then next topic czech, etc.). In this video, the english version was shorter than the czech. Should that mean we are even less clever than those slow Americans? :-o<br />
<br />Well, I hope not, it is only similar to a similar situation on the airport, where all announcements were given in czech first, in style of &quot;Czech Airlines flight number 1234, Alitalia 4567 from Milano has landed, gate number 12&quot;, then in english only &quot;Czech Airlines 1234, Alitalia 4567&quot; &#8212; that&#8217;s all. Probably those not speaking czech either know from where all the flights come and which gate should they go to, or are not interested at all&#8230; :-)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
