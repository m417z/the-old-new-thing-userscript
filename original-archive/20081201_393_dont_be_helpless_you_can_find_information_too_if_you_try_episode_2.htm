<p>Commenter Joshua Blake wonders <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#529604"> why Word's status bar says "Word is preparing to background print the document"</a>, wondering whether there used to be other types of printing like foreground.</p>
<p> Well, first of all, this is a question about Office, something I explicitly deny any special knowledge of: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Topics I am not inclined to cover: [...] </p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft software that isn't Windows. (Exchange, Office, ...) </li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p> But I'm going to take this opportunity to teach you how to use information already available to you to answer this question yourself. </p>
<p> First, let's see what the Internet says about Word and background printing. A search for &lsaquo;Word background printing&rsaquo; turns up pages that tell you <a href="http://wordtips.vitalnews.com/Pages/T0642_Understanding_Background_Printing.html"> how to turn background printing on and off</a>. Well, that tells you right off the bat that there are other types of printing, and if you read the text of the page, it even tells you what happens if you turn off background printing: You can't do anything with the program while it is printing. </p>
<p> There you go, an explanation of the other type of printing. </p>

		<p>I remember doing a bit of foreground printing in DOS apps. &nbsp;You couldn&#8217;t do anything with the computer until printing was done. &nbsp;Windows came along with its multi-tasking and print spooler and made the world a lot more hectic place. ;-)</p>
<p>Still had to wait until the document finished spooling to use the application, though.</p>

		<p>Strange. &nbsp;It seems there is some kind of filter on MSDN blogs that prevents me from posting short comments; nothing nefarious, but it would be helpful if it spat out some indication of WHY the comment was rejected rather than just sending me back to the front page with no explanation. &nbsp;From now on, I guess I will have to stick a paragraph of Shakespeare in each comment to make sure it goes through.</p>

		<p>Seems like a rather useless feature that should be removed to stop Word from confusing the user with useless options. And then the message should be removed, too.</p>

		<p>Who says it hasn&#8217;t been removed? That item isn&#8217;t in the print options for Word 2007.</p>
<p>It probably had to be kept around for the sake of some military customer.</p>

		<p>Wow, what&#8217;s with Lev and Duke? &nbsp;This post isn&#8217;t about background printing at all, guys.</p>
<p>Anyway, I second the vote for Let Me Google That For You. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s the TinyURL version, slightly more innocuous-looking: &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://tinyurl.com/5wz4xc" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/5wz4xc</a></p>

		<p>&quot;That item isn&#8217;t in the print options for Word 2007.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s still there. Under Word Options, on the &quot;Advanced&quot; tab, in the &quot;Print&quot; section. There&#8217;s a &quot;Print in background&quot; checkbox.</p>
<p>Also, the help text says &quot;Printing in the background lets you continue to work while your document is printed. Turning this option on may slow down printing.&quot;</p>
<p>So aparently if you uncheck &quot;background printing&quot; the printing will happen faster, but you can&#8217;t do anything else while it&#8217;s going on.</p>

		<p>That option is misleading, just live &quot;allow quick/fast save&quot; or whatever it was called. It doesn&#8217;t do what you think it does.</p>

		<p>&quot;The ability to determine reasonable search patterns and identify meaninful search terms is a skiil&quot;&#8230;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry, but it&#8217;s not as if they had to come up with some sort of magic search term spell to get an answer, so I don&#8217;t agree with this at all.</p>
<p>Word background printing provides an answer, as does &#8216;what is word background printing&#8217;, even &#8216;background printing&#8217; with no reference to Word or MS comes up with an answer.</p>

		<p>Actually, I have found a number of search impaired individuals.</p>
<p>Even with Google *AND* Live, the couldn&#8217;t map the path out of a wet paper bag.</p>
<p>The ability to determine reasonable search patterns and identify meaninful search terms is a skiil, and I hate to say it Rayond, but in this case, you might have a bit of an elitist blind spot.</p>
<p>It isn&#8217;t always that people are lazy.</p>

		<p>Or, perhaps just input the text verbatim from the dialog into a search engine works wonders too &#8211; most people copy the text in their solutions for that reason.</p>
<p>And variations of the phrasing in case someone screwed up helps, too, to which use of language helps.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
