This isn't psychic debugging,
but it's the sort of dumb mistake everybody makes
and which you can't see when re-reading your code
because your brain shows you what you want to see,
not what's really there.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
I'm trying to respond to the <code>PSN_QUERYINITIALFOCUS</code>
notification, but it's not working. What am I doing wrong?</p>
<pre>
INT_PTR CALLBACK DlgProc(HWND hdlg, UINT uMsg,
                         WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
 switch (uMsg) {
 ...
 case WM_NOTIFY:
  switch (reinterpret_cast&lt;NMHDR*&gt;(lParam)-&gt;code) {
  ...
  case PSN_QUERYINITIALFOCUS:
   {
    PSHNOTIFY *ppsn = reinterpret_cast&lt;PSHNOTIFY*&gt;(lParam);
    SetWindowLongPtr(ppsn-&gt;hdr.hwndFrom, DWLP_MSGRESULT,
                    (LPARAM)GetDlgItem(ppsn-&gt;hdr.hwndFrom, IDC_MYCONTROL));
   }
   return TRUE;
  ...
  }
  break;
 }
 return FALSE;
}
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
You can stare at this code for ages and completely overlook
that the wrong window handle is being passed to <code>GetDlgItem</code>
and <code>SetWindowLongPtr</code>.
The <code>hwndFrom</code> of a <code>WM_NOTIFY</code> message is
the window that is generating the notification; in this case,
the <code>PSN_QUERYINITIALFOCUS</code> is generated from the
property sheet frame window.
But the result of a dialog message needs to be stored
in the extra bytes of the dialog that's
<strong>receiving</strong> the message, not the one that's
sending it.
And when you call <code>GetDlgItem</code>, the window manager
searches for the control among the children of the window you
pass as the first parameter&mdash;but here, <code>IDC_MYCONTROL</code>
is a child of the property sheet page, not the property sheet frame.
</p>
<p>
The correct code should read
</p>
<pre>
    SetWindowLongPtr(hdlg, DWLP_MSGRESULT,
                    (LPARAM)GetDlgItem(hdlg, IDC_MYCONTROL));
</pre>
<p>
This phenomenon of missing the obvious because your brain shows you
what you want to see (rather than what's actually there)
reminds me of a time
one of my colleagues called me into his office to help figure
out why one of his loops was iterating only once.
He called the function up on the screen and talked me through it.
"Okay, now the variables are set up for the loop, so
<code>while</code> we haven't found the entry, we grab the
next item from the list..."
</p>
<p>
I hesitatantly interrupted.
"Um, '<code>while</code>'?
The code says '<code>if</code>'."
</p>
<p>
"Oops. Um, nevermind. Nothing to see here. Move along now."
</p>
<p>
This is the same reason you want to have somebody else
proofread your writing.
Since you wrote it, your brain will show you what you meant to write,
not necessarily what you actually wrote.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve lost count of the number of times I&#8217;ve made a dumb coding mistake, only to find it (or have it pointed out to me) when I dragged someone else in to help me find the bug.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not even that I needed a second set of eyes sometimes &#8211; I just need to vocalize what I want the code to do and compare what I&#8217;m saying to what I&#8217;m seeing. Talking to yourself doesn&#8217;t always produce a coherent dialogue.</p>

		<p>In PHP a while ago I was working on a large OOP framework and in a class about halfway down the hierarchy, I did this:</p>
<p>public function __construct()</p>
<p>{</p>
<p> &nbsp; &#8230;.</p>
<p> &nbsp; parent::__costruct();</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>(In PHP the parent constructor is not implicitly called if a child has a constructor defined.)</p>
<p>The results were so odd that it took me several hours to find the cause, and I probably read over that code at least a dozen times.</p>
<p>I do find sometimes it helps to actually read the code aloud. &nbsp;For me at least, it seems to force my brain to acknowledge what&#8217;s actually *on* the screen and not what I had intended to put there.</p>

		<p>if() ; {</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>doesn&#8217;t tend to happen. This is one of several reasons why I prefer this bracing style, and avoid:</p>
<p>if()</p>
<p>&nbsp; blah;</p>
<p>Asking other people questions definitely helps. 90% of the time, when I go into a programming channel in IRC, I leave again without asking a question. The process of phrasing the question clearly, and stripping the problem down to a minimal case, finds my problem. In the remaining 10% of the time, either everyone is afk, or they don&#8217;t know the answer.</p>

		<p>This is one of the reasons that debugging at the assembly level is good &#8211; you can usually quickly spot errors in the source code (like using if (); or if instead of while) when you look at the disassembly.</p>
<p>Your brain can&#8217;t lie to you quite as easily when you move down to a lower level of abstraction :)</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
