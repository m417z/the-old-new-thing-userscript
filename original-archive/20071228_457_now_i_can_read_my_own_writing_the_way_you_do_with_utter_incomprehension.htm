		<p>Lacking social skills and a tolerance for idiocy is one thing. I can relate to that. It&#8217;s something totally different to post a blanket insult to everyone that reads your blog and/or your book. </p>

		<p>Ummmm, so your book is available in English and Japanese? &nbsp;Just checking because I&#8217;m not sure what you mean by your main book page. &nbsp;The Amazon page you link to lists no translations and the blog page you link to has an &#8220;Update: Now available in Japanese.&#8221; &nbsp;If there&#8217;s some other page or other editions available then I&#8217;m missing it.</p>

		<p>The truly interesting question is whether the Japanese translation was successful in translating your sense of humour. Many English natives seem to miss it in the English version, so it may have proved a challenge for translation also.</p>
<p>For the avoidance of doubt, this is intended to be a humorous wondering about the translatability of humour and not an insult to any party other than translators and their problems collectively. Translators who are offended please accept my humble apologies and laugh at the two to the power of three that I scored in my last foreign language test.</p>

		<p>Dear Hurt and Hurt As Well,</p>
<p>I take it both of you are old enough to should have learned by now that when something could be potentially interpreted as an insult, it probably shouldn&#8217;t be &#8211; assume good will and chuckle along.</p>
<p>Otherwise &#8211; assuming the intent was humour &#8211; you may end up coming across as socially inept &#8211; which is likely already suspected, making note of the reputation of this blog&#8217;s reader base. Even worse, you may end up coming across as that about-to-go-postal &quot;Ddddid you see my thtapler?!?!&quot; guy from &quot;Office Space&quot;, who obviously hasn&#8217;t discovered the brighter side of humanity since being a target of those &quot;let&#8217;s kick the geek in the face&quot; high school games we all probably have been targets of at some point in our teenage years.</p>
<p>Let me assure you that chances are quite high that Raymond Chen isn&#8217;t going to attempt to belittle his loyal blog readers by talking down to them and implying that they&#8217;re imbeciles &#8211; last time I checked, this wasn&#8217;t a public humiliation fetish blog.</p>
<p>So&#8230; may as well lighten up. No one will benefit more from it than yourself. You always have a choice as to how you interpret your environment &#8211; if you apply the glass-half-empty filter to your view of the world, than your queries will always return the same results. Makes sense, no?</p>
<p>Just chuckle. Life&#8217;s better-looking that way (and you probably are, too.) And if someone is indeed insulting you, nothing will annoy them more than the prospect that their insult didn&#8217;t reach their intended audience &#8211; which is exactly what will happen when you nod your head and smile ;]</p>
<p>&#8230;and in case you&#8217;re still confused, let me take this opportunity and quote a previous commentator &#8211;</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m a fish! Cover me in custard and call me Penny!&quot;</p>
<p>Happy Holidays and All That Jazz</p>

		<p>That spoof by the Reg is hilarious. I have felt like that on more than one occasion. I stay well clear of Win32 stuff, so when you go into depth on that, it&#8217;s indistinguisable fmo the spoof!</p>
<p>Jus a shame that there are those dumb enough to miss the humour, yet smart enough to figure out how to post a comment.</p>

		<p>You most certainly are insulting us! You&#8217;ve implied that you can read your blog with relative comprehension, while the rest of us can&#8217;t :)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
