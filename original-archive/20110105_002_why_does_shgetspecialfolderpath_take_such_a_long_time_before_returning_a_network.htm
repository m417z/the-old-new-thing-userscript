<p>A customer reported that their program was failing to start up because the call to <code>SHGet&shy;Special&shy;Folder&shy;Path(CSIDL_<wbr>PERSONAL)</wbr></code> was taking a long time and then eventually returning with <code>ERROR_<wbr>BAD_<wbr>NETPATH</wbr></wbr></code>. The account that was experiencing this problem had a redirected network profile, "but even if he's redirecting, why would we get the bad net path error? Does calling <code>SHGet&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code> actually touch the folder/network? If so, we should probably stop calling this function on the UI thread since network problems could cause our program to hang."</p>
<p> The <code>SHGet&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code> function will access the network if you pass the <code>CSIDL_<wbr>FLAG_<wbr>CREATE</wbr></wbr></code> flag, which says "Check if the folder is there, and if not, create it." </p>
<p> The customer had been passing the flag. "We'll remove it. As if our program is going to dictate the creation of the user profile directory." </p>
<p> The <code>CSIDL_<wbr>FLAG_<wbr>CREATE</wbr></wbr></code> flag has been implicated in some other unwanted behavior. For example, if you pass the <code>CSIDL_<wbr>FLAG_<wbr>CREATE</wbr></wbr></code> flag when asking for <code>CSIDL_<wbr>MYPICTURES</wbr></code>, this will create a <i>My Pictures</i> directory if there wasn't one before. Generally speaking, you shouldn't be creating these directories as side-effects of other actions. Corporate administrators may suppress creation of folders like <i>Pictures</i> and <i>Videos</i>, but that doesn't do much good if your program casually creates them as part of its startup. </p>
<p> Note that <code>SHGet&shy;Special&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code> and <code>CSIDL</code> values have been superseded by <code>SHGet&shy;Known&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code> and <code>KNOWN&shy;FOLDER&shy;ID</code>. The flag corresponding to <code>CSIDL_<wbr>FLAG_<wbr>CREATE</wbr></wbr></code> is <code>KF_<wbr>FLAG_<wbr>CREATE</wbr></wbr></code>. If you want to make things even faster, consider passing the <code>KF_<wbr>FLAG_<wbr>DONT_<wbr>VERIFY</wbr></wbr></wbr></code> flag (formerly known as <code>CSIDL_<wbr>FLAG_<wbr>DONT_<wbr>VERIFY</wbr></wbr></wbr></code>). </p>

		<p>So, why WAS it returning ERROR_BAD_NETPATH? &nbsp;Shouldn&#39;t it have still worked, even if it did access the network?</p>

		<p>Perhaps the computer was a laptop and wasn&#39;t connected to the corporate network at the time.</p>

		<p>So if you get a special folder to save your pictures in and it doesn&#39;t exist &#8211; where are you supposed to save the picture instead?</p>
<p>[Assume a picture-saving program that can&#39;t access UI conveniently; e.g. a game where you press printscreen but you can&#39;t pause the game to show a save as dialog].</p>

		<p>Dan: Reading between the lines, it looks like the user had redirected their profile folder to a network share that was offline. The function attempted to connect the share so that it could verify the folder existed (since they told it to do that), and timed-out.</p>
<p>If you told the function &quot;return the path *and* ensure the path exists&quot;, it has to actually check that the path exists before returning&#8211; otherwise the function would only be doing half of what you told it to do.</p>

		<p>@configurator: Perheps creates a folder in My Documents that matches your application name&#8230; I&#39;ve seen lots of online games that support screen captures do this.</p>
<p>Btw, nothing stops your from allowing users to set the path in &quot;Options&quot; screen&#8230;</p>

		<p>there is an issue with network paths in general. Windows explorer seems to be obtaining contents from network drives very quickly but if you try regular shell API (IShellFolder etc) in a program to enumerate remote items, then chances are it will take ages, at least the first time round (from then on it seems that there is some caching)</p>
<p>If there is any documentation about how to speedup network access in general, I wasn&#39;t able to find it. If you have any ideas please tell us where to find this kind of information</p>
<p>thanks</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
