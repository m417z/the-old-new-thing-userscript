<p>Just in the last month, I had to call a bank to reverse four erroneous "Account Maintenance Fees" across two different accounts. It appears that <a href="http://dilbert.com/strips/comic/2011-05-04/"> intentional billing errors</a> is the new business model for our struggling economy. (For the record, although I am responsible for maintaining these accounts, I did not open the accounts at the bank in question. My personal account is at a credit union.)</p>
<p> One of my friends remarked, "I got only two. They must not really be trying yet." </p>
<p> Many years ago, back when the dot-com bubble appeared unpoppable, a different friend of mine happened to meet somebody who sheepishly admitted that one of his previous jobs was at a what-we-can-euphemistically-call "adult online entertainment" site, where he was responsible for developing algorithms to determine which customers could safely be double- or even triple-billed. </p>

		<p>The &quot;adult entertainment&quot; double-billing algorithm has an additional component. The key isn&#39;t just locating &quot;victims&quot; to overcharge, but the fact that these charges has a description/company name/something the people at the bank could see that would make it very clear what kind of entertainment the customer was paying for. Thus it could be quite embarrasing to call the bank and fix, and many people would not bother for minor charges.</p>
<p>I have been told that this was/is a component in the scam were you get the first month free by verifying your age with a credit card, and subsequent months is a 10$ recurring fee or something (written in small print in the TOS of course). Ideally you&#39;d get a high conversion rate of people trialling your service becoming paying customers this way.</p>

		<p>I have an &quot;account transfer fee&quot; on a statement from an MD that needs to be removed. It appeares in the middle of several charges for various dates of service. It is a group practice, but I&#39;ve seen the same MD every time I&#39;ve been there for an appointment, so I have no idea what they think they are transferring.</p>

		<p>Hardly new; hardly limited times of economic difficulty.</p>
<p>An old dodge is to read obituary columns to find recently deceased people. &nbsp;Send their family a bill for pornographic materials delivered but not yet paid for. &nbsp;This worked pretty well for a certain scammer until they sent a bill to a widow of a blind man.</p>

		<p>It seems like these days company trust is limited, if you ask me. &nbsp;You never know what somebody will charge you. &nbsp;Look at the stuff from the airports these days, albeit that those sort, (and that&#39;s only sort of), make a little sense. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>I have a friend that works as a system admin for a healthcare provider. &nbsp;After installing some updates to one their systems, he wanted to double check that everything was working smoothly. &nbsp;He executed a search against the system for the test account, and pulled up something like &quot;Jim Testerson&quot; or some such. &nbsp;He scheduled some OB appointments, a mastectomy and some other stuff. &nbsp;Shortly thereafter, a healthy, albeit confused, *Mr.* Tester shows up at the office to inquire about his bill. &nbsp;This happened not once, but twice before any one really looked into it. After the second occurrence, the audit logs were checked and my friend was called into HR to discuss his &quot;unauthorized&quot; accesses to Mr. Testerson&#39;s account. &nbsp;Fortunately, he was able to explain how the mix-up occurred, and is still working there.</p>

		<p>I used to know a guy who ran a porn company and he said easily 50% of his time was spent on the phone arguing with credit card companies about people who&#39;d bought stuff and then (when the bill arrived) called up the credit card company to indignantly complain they hadn&#39;t &#8212; and definitely WOULDN&#39;T &#8212; buy things from a company like that&#8230;</p>
<p>The proportions of those men who either &quot;didn&#39;t want the wife seeing the bill&quot; or &quot;were really just after free porn&quot; wasn&#39;t clear.</p>

		<p>I signed up for a domain name from a certain registrar. Every couple months they signed me up for a new service (such as some kind of mobile website optimization thinger) and began charging me, without even notifying me. Then they wait two or three more months before sending me a statement to let me know I&#39;ve been charged. By that point they&#39;ve charged me $10 a month for four or five months without me knowing about it, and I had to manually cancel the subscription. This has actually happened twice for me. Of course, the $50 isn&#39;t really worth going to court. If they do this to most of their customers then they&#39;re making way more money on these bad subscriptions than on actual domain names.</p>
<p>I told them if it happens again I&#39;m calling my credit card company to block all future charges from them. It hasn&#39;t happened since.</p>

		<p>@KatieL: your friend who ran the porn company should consider:</p>
<p>a) using a nonoffensive merchant name when charging credit cards</p>
<p>b) it&#39;s entirely possible that many of these transactions were actually fraudulent; not all fraud is on the merchant end. &nbsp;Someone might have been using a card that wasn&#39;t theirs. &nbsp;This is fraud, even if the person charging the card is (say) the cardholder&#39;s teenage son.</p>
<p>@mott555: you shouldn&#39;t need to go to court to get your $50 back; it should suffice to call your credit card provider and say you did not authorize the transaction, and they should charge it back to the merchant. &nbsp;If enough people do this for a given merchant, then the merchant has to pay a higher percentage to the credit card provider.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
