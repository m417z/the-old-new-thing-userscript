		<p>A friend of mine once observed that babies are functions. It takes food as input and provides noise and smell as output.</p>

		<p>&quot;Markov model&quot; might be a more correct term, because it specifically precludes any memory other than the current state id. &nbsp;Although this instance is even more like purely combinational logic (no retained state at all).</p>
<p>In any case, watching the intelligence of young children unfold to slowly incorporate more and more knowledge and understanding of the world is definitely a win.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Babies are not special. But the difference is this is all they do, humans have more complex behavior: they aren&#8217;t simple functions, babies are. A least until they have completed bootstrapping and turn into people.</p>

		<p>I have used this behavior in the past to &#8216;reset&#8217; a baby. &nbsp;They have a stack of ~2 usually and you can overflow the stack easily. &nbsp;The usual reaction is to go back to a discovery state. &nbsp;So you can hand them two non related objects then point out something in the room. &nbsp;They will usually reset. &nbsp;Do not use to often as they will adapt :) &nbsp;Works pretty good with a fussy baby.</p>
<p>This usually works up until about age 3 and a half when they start forming more complex systems themselves. &nbsp;At which point the stack is MUCH larger.</p>
<p>Learned this from BOFH :)</p>

		<p>Discovered that behavior in my dog today as well.</p>
<p>One of the tricks I taught him was where I&#8217;d put some food on his snout, just behind the nose, and he&#8217;s to hold his position, until I command him to get it (but he&#8217;s got to get it before it hits the ground).</p>
<p>So lately I mix it up by giving him an intevening command (shake paw) with the food on his nose, then let him get it. He&#8217;s been doing the motion for awhile now, just I&#8217;ve been giving him explicit commands.</p>
<p>Today, food on nose, but he failed to respond at all. Like he&#8217;s crashed &#8211; didn&#8217;t respond at all. So I take the food off his nose, and gave him the command to eat, and he repeated the motions, followed by a quizzical look as he didn&#8217;t see what happened to the food nor had anything enter his mouth &#8211; he didn&#8217;t notice I took the food away.</p>
<p>Repeated again, worked flawlessly. Apparently found a bug :)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
