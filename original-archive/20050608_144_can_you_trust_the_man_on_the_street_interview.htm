<p>Occasionally, in a news story, the reporter will ask for comments or opinion from a passer-by (nicknamed "the man on the street"). <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/transcripts_051305_man.html"> Greg Packer has created a second career as that man</a>.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  In the last 10 years, he's been quoted at least a dozen times by the New York Post. He's been quoted at least 14 times by the Daily News, most recently just last week. He was quoted in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution two weeks ago. And Packer has been quoted or photographed at least 16 times on separate occasions by the Associated Press. ... </p>
<p> [H]e checks the newspapers for concerts, sports games, parades, book signings - anywhere media trucks might be camped out. Then, he requests time off from his job as a highway worker on Long Island and shows up early, scanning the crowd for reporters. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> It got so bad that the Associated Press issued an internal memo instructing reporters not to talk to the guy any more! </p>
<p> That story from <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org"> <i>On the Media</i></a> reminded me of a related incident back when the hype surrounding <i>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</i> was building. The <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/">New York Times</a> sent a reporter <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/library/film/051399phantom-tickets.html"> to cover the people who had been waiting in line for months</a>. The first person interviewed is Sangay Kumar, who claims to have flown in from Bombay just to see the movie. </p>
<p> A friend of mine read the article and started laughing. </p>
<p> Because my friend knows Mr. Kumar, who it turns out is not actually from Bombay. He's from Baltimore. He was just waiting in line with everybody else and saw a reporter coming and decided to put on a campy Indian accent and make up a nutty story. And the reporter bought it. </p>

		<p>But Sangay Kumar is also the name of the main &#8216;character&#8217; in the UK comedic interview show, &quot;The Kumars at Number 42&quot;&#8230; Was that really this guy&#8217;s real name?</p>

		<p>Hats off to Mr. Kumar!  I hope that if I&#8217;m ever approached for an interview I have the presence of mind to adlib something just as ridiculous (yet plausible enough to get published).</p>
<p>Also, I wish I had a job that let me take time off whenever there&#8217;s a media event in New York (does that guy ever show up for work?).  No wonder the economy is &#8216;soft&#8217;.</p>

		<p>mallard: Kumar&#8217;s a pretty common Indian name. </p>
<p>The Kumars at No. 42 team may well have chosen it for just that reason &#8212; an everyman name, like the British Smith or Jones surnames.</p>

<p>The host of &quot;The Kumars at Number 42&quot; is &quot;Sanjeev Kumar&quot; not Sangay, and his real name is Sanjeev Bhaskar.  In reality, he&#8217;s actually married to his on-screen grandmother.  And his on-screen father is originally from Cape Town, South Africa.</p>
<p>As a previous poster already stated, Kumar is a very popular Indian name.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
