<p>
A customer asked if there was a command-line tool for
managing Windows&nbsp;7 Libraries
so that they could create and deploy libraries across their
organization.
</p>
<p>
Not only is there such a tool, it even comes with source code.
</p>
<p>
The
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd940379">
Shell Library Command Line Sample</a>
shows how to manage Windows&nbsp;7 libraries programmatically
via the
<code>IShell&shy;Library</code> interface.
And it's actually a useful program on its own.
</p>
<pre>
Usage: shlib.exe SUBCOMMAND

Displays and modifies the attributes of Shell Libraries.

Supported commands:
  create      Creates a library at the specified path.
  info        Prints info about the given library.
  enum        Enumerates the folders in the library.
  setattrib   Modifies the attributes of the library.
  add         Adds the specified folder to the specified library.
  remove      Removes the specified folder from the library.
  setsaveloc  Sets the default save location of the library.
  resolve     Resolves the specified folder in the library.
  resolveall  Resolves all locations in the library in bulk.
  manage      Displays the Manage Library Dialog for the library.
</pre>
<p>
For example, to see all the folders that are part of your Documents
library, use the command
</p>
<pre>
shlib enum FOLDERID_DocumentsLibrary
</pre>
<p>
Each of the commands has further sub-options.
</p>
<pre>
Usage: create shlib.exe [OPTIONS] <library> [...]

Creates a library at the specified path.

Options:
 -create[:ARG]       Specifies that a new library should be created.
   &lt;none&gt;              Fail if the library already exists.
   overwrite           Overwrite any existing library.
   uniquename          Generate a unique name in case of conflict.

The library may be specified by a file system path,
or by a KNOWNFOLDERID (e.g. "FOLDERID_DocumentsLibrary").
</pre>
<p>
And the source code shows how to perform each of these actions
programmatically.
</p>
<p>
The <code>IShellLibrary</code> interface is also supported by
the
<a HREF="http://archive.msdn.microsoft.com/WindowsAPICodePack">
Windows API Code Pack for .NET</a>,
so you C# folks can use it too.
</p>
<p>
(One thing I noticed that is missing from the sample is a
<code>seticon</code> command.
Shouldn't be hard to implement.
You just call
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd391729">
<code>IShell&shy;Library::<wbr>Set&shy;Icon</code></a>.)</p>

		<p>My reaction was &quot;Oh cool, I can manage folder Libraries from the command line!&quot;</p>
<p>Because you know it does say &quot;Windows 7 Libraries&quot;, and one of the bullet points for Windows 7 new features was Libraries&#8230; they are prominently featured in Explorer too, near the top of the tree view on the left, if you managed not to hear about them at all&#8230;</p>

		<p>@The MAZZTer: Huh, somehow that entirely flew by me. &nbsp;I certainly noticed the Documents, Music, Pictures, and Videos (virtual?) directories, but I never noticed that their common parent directory was named Libraries.</p>

		<p>@Adam, Me too. I knew they were called libraries, but I use them so rarely that it&#39;s not at the forefront of my mind, so it&#39;s not the first thing I think of when I hear &quot;Library&quot;. At first I assumed it was some tool to examine libraries built against the Win7 SDK.</p>
<p>However, the actual meaning does make more sense</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
