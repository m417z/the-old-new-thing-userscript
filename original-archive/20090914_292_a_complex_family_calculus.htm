<p>I spent the other night at a relative's house, and I was woken the next morning by my young niece who politely asked me to make her breakfast. (Her technique for waking me up is to come in and call my name. If the door is closed, she pounds on the bedroom door and shouts, "Wake up! Wake up!" If I fail to open the door, she opens it herself. If the door is locked, she jiggles the handle until she forces the door open. I just leave the door open now. Making the best of a bad situation.)</p>
<p> Anyway, later that morning, the following conversation took place between my niece and an adult family member (which conversation I have taken the liberty of translating into English): </p>
<p> "Why did you wake up <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/04/27/9570320.aspx"> Uncle Raymond</a>?" </p>
<p> &mdash; <i>I wanted cereal for breakfast.</i> </p>
<p> "Why didn't you ask Mommy?" </p>
<p> &mdash; <i>Mommy was still sleeping.</i> </p>

<p>Most of the Chinese mothers wake up quite early&#8230;</p>

		<p>Answering question from tgrand from the linked page: In the past, women used to name their husband &quot;丈人&quot;. So using &quot;丈&quot; as suffix means &quot;the husband of ~&quot;.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why you see &quot;姑丈&quot; and &quot;姨丈&quot;.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think the calculus is so difficult. If you axiomatize it as:</p>
<p>If Mom is sleeping, don&#8217;t wake her up</p>
<p>Mom is an adult</p>
<p>Uncle Raymond is an adult</p>
<p>Adults can make cereal if they are not sleeping</p>
<p>Mom is sleeping.</p>
<p>Uncle Raymond is sleeping.</p>
<p>Put that into a Prolog program (or an inductive Prolog program), with goal &quot;Get Cereal&quot; and I think &nbsp;we can see what the answer will be :)</p>

		<p>@Boronx: in my house, when the kids get up, the adults get up. &nbsp;What, you want to leave those chaosbeasts to roam the house uninterrupted? &nbsp;That way lies pumpkin-seed-covered kitchen floors and partially disassembled laptop keyboards&#8230;</p>

		<p>In the past month, I&#8217;ve trained my kids (7,4,4) to go and turn on the TV with the sound almost off come or to snuggle with me but they have to let me sleep. &nbsp;The 7 yr old will tattle if anything bad happens.</p>
<p>It is glorious.</p>

		<p>Given that time has elapsed since then (a year and a half to two or more), what does your niece say about that incident now Raymond?</p>

		<p>What? She takes the time to call out your name? How delightfully polite!</p>
<p>At age four my daughter would come into the bedroom, walk up the bed, get her face about two inches from mine, pry open my nearest available eyelid, and ask &#8220;Are you awake?&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a hell of a way to get woken&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Jonathan Rascher</p>
<p>Thanks for writing the program, I understand Prolog concepts (having written a number of logic interpreters) but haven&#8217;t actually used it much &#8230;</p>
<p>If 2 year olds are finite state machines (Raymond&#8217;s earlier post) I guess 5 year olds have progressed at least to the level of prolog interpreters.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
