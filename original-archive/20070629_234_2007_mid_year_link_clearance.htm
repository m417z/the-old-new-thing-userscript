		<p>@A &quot;Mixed&quot; Blessing: I always found it amusing when certain game CDs I put in are categorized as &quot;music&quot;. At the time I thought, &quot;Well, I guess they just have a lot of music. But they have a lot of zip files, too, and exes. Shouldn&#8217;t it be an &#8216;application disk&#8217; or &#8216;archive disk&#8217;?&quot; (I didn&#8217;t know MS doesn&#8217;t have such a disk type) Now I actually know why. The CD in question has all of their music bare on the CD, while all the textures are in zips that are extracted to the HDD.</p>

		<p>That article on &quot;drop-shipping&quot; was very interesting. &nbsp;I got hit by one of those people a while back (selling a book on ebay/half.com). &nbsp;Like the James P. Burke, I was suspicious, but I couldn&#8217;t see how it was any sort of scam. &nbsp;I was also too lazy to do the digging necessary to figure it out.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>
<p>Also, &quot;Young Woman Drawing&quot; is awesome. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>The IT Crowd! &nbsp;I&#8217;ve heard that not only is production on the second season currently underway, but that there is also going to be a North American version of it ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944954/" rel="nofollow">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0944954/</a> ), with everyone but Moss recast with different actors.</p>

<p>Have you ever had a look on the german translations of your TechNet articles? They say the author would be a certain Raymond Chens&#8230;</p>

		<p>Three remarks on the Villers painting:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>About 40% of the canvas is taken by a four pane window.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The lower right glass pane is broken.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Through the broken glass, a couple on a terrace: the man&#8217;s period clothing and posture make him resemble a penguin.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
