The
<code>Is&shy;Text&shy;Unicode</code> function tries to guess
the encoding of a block of memory purporting to contain text,
but it can only say "Looks like Unicode" or
"Doesn't look like Unicode",
and there
<a HREF"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/03/24/95235.aspx">
some notorious examples</a> of
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/04/17/2158334.aspx">
where it guesses wrong</a>.
</p>
<p>
A more flexible alternative is
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ie/aa740985%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">
<code>IMulti&shy;Language2::<wbr>Detect&shy;Code&shy;page&shy;In&shy;IStream</code></a>

<code>IMulti&shy;Language2::<wbr>Detect&shy;Input&shy;Code&shy;page</code></a>.
Not only can these methods detect a much larger range of code pages,
they also can report multiple code pages,
each with a corresponding confidence level.
</p>
<p>
Here's a Little Program that takes the function out for a spin.
(Remember, Little Programs do little to no error checking.)
</p>

 return

                       L".htm", -1, TRUE) == CSTR_EQUAL ||

}

 CComPtr&lt;IStream&gt; spstm;

 CoCreateInstance(CLSID_CMultiLanguage, NULL,
     CLSCTX_ALL, IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;spml));

 DetectEncodingInfo info[10];
 INT cInfo = ARRAYSIZE(info);

 DWORD dwFlag = IsHtmlFile(argv[1]) ? MLDETECTCP_HTML
                                    : MLDETECTCP_NONE;
 HRESULT hr = spml-&gt;DetectCodepageInIStream(
     dwFlag, 0, spstm, info, &amp;cInfo);
 if (hr == S_OK) {
  for (int i = 0; i &lt; cInfo; i++) {
   wprintf(L"info[%d].nLangID = %d\n", i, info[i].nLangID);
   wprintf(L"info[%d].nCodePage = %d\n", i, info[i].nCodePage);
   wprintf(L"info[%d].nDocPercent = %d\n", i, info[i].nDocPercent);
   wprintf(L"info[%d].nConfidence = %d\n", i, info[i].nConfidence);
  }
 } else {
  wprintf(L"Cannot determine the encoding (error: 0x%08x)\n", hr);
 }
 return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
Run the program with a file name as the command line argument,
and the program will report all the detected code pages.
</p>
<p>
One thing that may not be obvious is that the program passes
the
<code>MLDETECTCP_<wbr>HTML</code> flag if the file extension
is <code>.htm</code> or <code>.html</code>.
That is a hint to the detector that it shouldn't get faked
out by text like <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> and think it
found an English word.
</p>
<p>
Here's the output of the program when run on its own source code:
</p>
<pre>
info[0].nLangID = 9
info[0].nCodePage = 20127
info[0].nDocPercent = 100
info[0].nConfidence = 83
info[1].nLangID = -1
info[1].nCodePage = 65001
info[1].nDocPercent = -1
info[1].nConfidence = -1
</pre>
<p>
This says that its first guess is that the text is in
language 9, which is
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd318693(v=vs.85).aspx">
<code>LANG_<wbr>ENGLISH</code></a>,
code page 20127,
which is
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd317756(v=vs.85).aspx">
US-ASCII</a>,
That text occupies 100% of the file, and the confidence level is 83.
</p>
<p>
The second guess is that the text is in code page
65001,
which is UTF-8,
but the confidence level for that is low.
</p>
<p>
The language-guessing part of the function is not very
sophisticated.
For a higher-quality algorithm for guessing
what language some text is in,
use
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd319066%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">
Extended Linguistic Services</a>.
I won't bother writing a sample application
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd319110%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">
because MSDN already contains one</a>.</p>

		<p>Why should the confidence for UTF-8 ever be lower than for ASCII?</p>
<p>Remember that one of the design-criteria for UTF-8 was that all ASCII data is also valid UTF-8 data, without changing a single bit.</p>

		<p>Deduplicator: If I had to guess I&#39;d say because it doesn&#39;t contain any characters that are outside the US-ASCII range. &nbsp;As Raymond notes &quot;that text occupies 100% of the file&quot;. &nbsp;If there were characters that were outside the range of 7-bit ASCII I would assume the confidence would be higher.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>If a file consists entirely of 7-bit ASCII, you still don&#39;t have perfect confidence that it is UTF-8. Perfect confidence would mean that you could change 41 to C3 85 to convert a capital A to a capital &Aring;. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@Deduplicator It&#39;s likely designed to go for the simplest case first. It does indicate that it could be UTF-8 but without any characters that must be UTF-8 there&#39;s no way for it to be sure. So it goes for the simpler case of US-ASCII and includes UTF-8 as a possibility.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m actually surprised it only reports those two encodings &#8212; it&#39;d match a lot of code pages, and given it&#39;s program code, so there&#39;s a lot of non-text, I&#39;d think it&#39;d match a lot of code pages.</p>

		<p>@Dave Bacher: 7-bit ASCII is the standard that most other OEM codepages extended from, so it makes sense to only report the parent codepage instead of spamming the results with all the theoretical possibilities.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
