		<p>Word warp, eh? Sounds about right.</p>
<p>The Unix vi, for example, doesn&#8217;t impose this sort of limitation, but then it also doesn&#8217;t let you pretend that wrapped portions of the same line are separate lines, with the arrow keys&#8230;</p>

		<p>Yeah..true that vi doesn&#8217;t seem to have that option..though i&#8217;m very much on  the lookout for it and hoping it&#8217;s hidden out there somewhere&#8230;any ideas?</p>

		<p>yeah i hate that too. I often switch between word wrap and non-wrap mode when coding certain things.</p>
<p>Another little glitch that i have found is that right after you save a file and you have not typed anything into notepad, it resets the position display on the status bar to 1,1 but the cursor is not at 1,1. However, when you start typing its fine.</p>

		<p>The worst Notepad issue, I believe found in NT4, 2000 and XP, occurs when Word Wrap is on. The cursor moves to a random point in the document after you press Ctrl+S and resume typing.</p>

		<p>I have found the same problem Jason Spiro did.  Through some fiddling on XP, I found that pressing CTRL+S adjusts word-wrapped lines so they fit better, and that action moves the cursor.  However, the edit control is not repainted.  Only on a refresh does one see where the cursor is.</p>
<p>Is it possible to fix this problem?  Quite funny considering win9x doesn&#8217;t have this problem&#8230;</p>

		<p>Wow, I was wondering why the Status Bar link was &quot;always&quot; grayed out in Notepad (I normally use word wrapping).</p>
<p>The moving cursor &quot;feature&quot; is annoying (if the cursor moves for me after saving, it usually moves three characters back), as is the screen repainting problem.  I&#8217;ve gotten into the habit of Alt-Tabbing or tapping the Windows key immediately after saving to force Notepad to refresh.</p>
<p>I have been use Notepad a lot recently (cover letters for job applications), so these issues have been especially annoying.  /me runs off and downloads another text editor&#8230;</p>
<p>As for the vi thing, I&#8217;ve noticed the same problem on emacs as well.  I can&#8217;t get to the end of the wrapped line by hitting the down arrow to get to the next portion of the wrapped line, I have to go to the next line and move to the end of the line.</p>

		<p>Just use metapad (<a href="http://www.liquidninja.com/metapad/" rel="nofollow">http://www.liquidninja.com/metapad/</a>), it&#8217;s much better than Notepad and takes up just about the same resources. I even replaced notepad.exe with it.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
