<p>Carlos wonders why the Windows 95 shell was prototyped as 16-bit code running on the still-under-development 32-bit kernel, USER, and GDI <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/20/10040074.aspx#10040323"> as opposed to being prototyped as fully 32-bit code on Windows NT</a>.</p>
<p> There were a number of reasons, some good, some bad. </p>
<p> One reason was that the Windows&nbsp;95 shell was being developed by the Windows&nbsp;95 team, which was an outgrowth of the Windows&nbsp;3.1 team. That meant that they had Windows&nbsp;3.1-class hardware. And the hardware requirements of Windows&nbsp;NT were significantly higher than the hardware requirements of Windows&nbsp;3.1. Here's a table for comparison: </p>

<p> The Windows&nbsp;3.1 team adhered to the principle that the team members' machines, as a general rule,  were as powerful as the recommended hardware requirements. If you asked really nicely, you were permitted to exceed that, but not by too much, with one <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/08/14/54640.aspx"> notable exception</a>. Think of it as performance <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/08/02/10191834.aspx"> dogfood</a>. If Windows was unusable on the stated recommended hardware requirements, the entire team felt it because that's what they were running. (When Windows&nbsp;95 shipped, my primary machine was a 486/DX50 with 8MB of RAM. My test machine was a 386 with 4MB of RAM. The combined computing power and storage capacity of all the machines in my office is now exceeded by your cell phone.) </p>
<p> Okay, so you just finished Windows&nbsp;3.1, and all of the team members currently have 4MB machines, with a few lucky people that have a whopping 8MB of RAM. If you decided to do your prototype work on Windows&nbsp;NT, that would mean tripling the amount of memory in most of the computers just to meet the <i>minimum</i> requirements for Windows&nbsp;NT. And you can't say that "Well, you would have had to pay for all that RAM anyway," because look at that chart: Windows&nbsp;95's <i>final</i> hardware requirements were still lower than Windows&nbsp;NT's minimum! </p>
<p> Spending all that money to upgrade the computers for something that was just a temporary situation anyway seemed like a bad way of spending your hardware budget. </p>
<p> From the software development side, prototyping the new shell on Windows&nbsp;NT was not practical because Windows&nbsp;95 introduced a whole bunch of new features to Win32, features which didn't exist in Windows&nbsp;NT. Part of the goal of the prototype was to exercise these new features, things we take for granted nowadays like <code>Register&shy;Class&shy;Ex</code> and <code>WM_<wbr>MOVING</wbr></code> and the Close button in the upper right corner. Those features didn't exist in Windows&nbsp;NT; if you wanted to develop the prototype on Windows&nbsp;NT, somebody would have had to port them and build a special "throwaway" version of Windows&nbsp;NT for the Windows&nbsp;95 team to use. That means devoting some people to learning a whole new code base and development environment (and buying lots more hardware) to add features that they had no intention of shipping. </p>
<p> It was much more cost-effective to do the prototyping of the Windows&nbsp;95 shell <i>on Windows&nbsp;95</i>. You could see if a design led to poor performance and deal with it before things went too far in the wrong direction. You could use those fancy new functions in kernel, USER, and GDI, which is great because that meant that you would start finding bugs in those fancy new functions, you would start finding design flaws in those fancy new functions. If the shell team needed a new feature from the window manager or the kernel, they could just ask for it, and then they could start using it and file bugs when it didn't work the way they wanted. All the effort was for real. Nothing was being thrown away except for the stuff inside <code>#ifdef WIN16</code> blocks, which was kept to a minimum. </p>
<p> All through the shell prototyping effort, the code was compiled both with and without <code>#define WIN16</code>, and as the kernel team worked on supporting 32-bit processes, they had this program sitting there waiting to go that they could try out. And not some dorky <i>Hello world</i> program but a real program that does interesting things. (They couldn't use any of the Windows&nbsp;NT built-in programs because those were Unicode-based, and Windows&nbsp;95 didn't support Unicode.) </p>
<p> Maybe those were bad reasons, but that was the thinking. </p>

		<p>And then the NT folks got jealous so we got the Shell Desktop Update for Windows NT 3.51, which later became Windows NT4 and brought much of the two systems (9x/NT) together as the baby steps towards the merged consumer/professional codebase that MS would work towards with XP.</p>

		<p>@BC_Programmer: I tend to think of Windows 2000 as THE merged consumer/professional database. Look at the features it introduced to NT that were already in 9x. ACPI. Plug and Play. Support for &gt;8GB system partion. FAT32. USB. Failsafe mode. Also, it was the first NT system that was secure by default and not just ‚Äûsecur-able‚Äù (NT4 gave Everyone full control over Program Files!).</p>

<p>Considering that FreeCell from NT 3.? works under Win32s, I&#39;m surprised it didn&#39;t work on Win95.</p>

		<p>The practice of developers having under-powered or at recommended spec machines used to be quite common; at one place that I worked for a while, developers received hand-me-downs from the other departments. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In order to compensate for the fact that it could take hours or days to compile, we had build servers and you just commandeered a build server for a couple minutes to build and test your software. &nbsp;The actual editing part (laying out Windows/screens, etc.) doesn&#39;t really need ultra-fast computers, if the projects are modular enough.</p>
<p>That having been said, the &quot;scale it up&quot; combined with truncation in various spots in Windows 32 CP/M edition &#8212; often caused by third party code that wasn&#39;t Microsoft&#39;s fault &#8212; led to all sorts of interesting problems when you needed Win32 code to work on both NT and 95. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Also, on a performance note, on lower end machines, try replacing whatever virus scanner is installed with MSSE. &nbsp;Just did that for the 3rd machine that was brought to me with performance issues in the last week, and all 3 (people&#39;s personal machines) have had marked improvements. &nbsp;In this last case, it was taking between 5.5 and 6 hours (I was only checking every 30 minutes) to get from the Windows login screen to the desktop. &nbsp;After removing the other virus scanner (a 2011 edition of a &quot;use-at-home&quot; license of a major commercial product), and installing MSSE, it&#39;s 12 seconds. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>That practice can back-fire though &#8211; I remember a bug in Windows we encountered that only occurred with multiple monitors. When we reported it the &quot;explanation&quot; was that the team in question only had single monitor systems!</p>

		<p>&gt; When Windows 95 shipped, my primary machine was a 486/DX50 with 8MB of RAM</p>
<p>Stunned. I remember being aghast in Sept &#39;95 when I was given a new machine with only 8MB of RAM running W95. Everyone knew you really needed 16MB. I&#39;m amazed the dev team were able to ship something while running sub-par hardware.</p>

		<p>@rbirkby: I agree. I&#39;ve first used Win95 on my 386 with 4MB of RAM, and it wasn&#39;t anything pleasant &#8212; it took several minutes to get to the desktop, and that&#39;s without counting the DOS boot. It was easy enough to convince it not to boot right away, though, but stop at the DOS command line, so you could use your DOS stuff as usual and start it with win.com when you wanted to use Windows programs.</p>
<p>I remember how I followed a walkthrough in a computer magazine that taught you how to change win.com to return to the DOS prompt instead of staying at the &quot;It&#39;s safe to shut down your computer now&quot; screen. With the previously mentioned DOS prompt trick, it let you use Win95 like Win 3.1 worked, starting and quitting from the graphical shell at will. We&#39;ve definitely come a long way since then &#8212; I don&#39;t want to drop back to a pure command-line interface ever since WinXP.</p>

<p>My testing in VMs indicated that 17mb was the smallest amount at which it did not page.</p>
<p>Considering I was able to run Word 2000 on a Win95 box with 16mb comfortably (Excel had a little trouble) indicates that paging is not really a good indicator.</p>

		<p>I remember a horror story from a team that did not follow the rule of developers using recommended hardware requirements (or maybe they did, but it was a server product, and two-CPU systems were already common is servers):</p>
<p>The test team reported a hang, where the system would not ever do anything. Many testers could reproduce it, but none of the developers had this bug. After investigation, it turned out the system created a &quot;thread pool&quot; of size (cpu-count &#8211; 1). And no developer had a single-CPU system to find the problem.</p>

		<p>The first computer I owned at home (before that I had used Windows at my school since WfW 3.0 and NT 3.1) was a Pentium MMX, 16 MB EDO RAM, 1 GB Quantum Fireball HDD, Cirrus Logic graphics with 1 MB memory and sound card capable of 16-bit sampling. Windows 95 and Office 95 flew on it, until I installed the Desktop Update years later which made it grindingly slow. I wish the Shell team still did &quot;Desktop Updates&quot; though. Plenty of things in Vista/7&#39;s shells need fixing. The shell is really the most poorly done component of NT 6.x (tons of removed and broken features thanks to Longhorn I think).</p>
<p>Btw I love such nostalgia inducing posts. But no mention of the NewShell CTPs for NT and why they were created? Wasn&#39;t NewShell whisked away from the NT team to Brad Silverberg&#39;s team?</p>

		<p>I think those were excellent reasons, and I think I&#39;m willing to go one step further, although that clearly wasn&#39;t doable back then&#8230;</p>
<p>If you are developing desktop software right now, your developers should test on ten year old hardware. (Still test on modern hardware though.)</p>

		<p>@Csaboka:</p>
<p>There was also the cool trick of replacing vmm32.vxd or krnl386.exe (or something like that) with command.com. That would give you a command line were the Windows drivers (notably long file names and cache) would already be running.</p>

		<p>At my first employer i didn&#39;t have large enough disk to compile the whole source code, I had to copy obj-files from other team members.</p>
<p>Thankfully that company doesn&#39;t exist any more. Now I work on the fastest computer money can buy, updated about twice a year. And boy am i more productive (with raided ssds, 3x monitors, &#8230;).</p>

		<p>The first machine I used Win95 on was a 486DX4-100, with 8MB RAM.</p>
<p>Then one of the memory sticks failed and it wouldn&#39;t boot. It appears that Win95 had to use a different (kernel/HAL/whatever) on low memory machines.</p>
<p>After reinstalling, the system worked fine. I even opened to .AVI files at the same time (!!!) to demonstrate how smoothly everything ran.</p>

		<p>Windows 95 may have needed 17MB to avoid paging, but a bare Windows 95 would start up in 4MB without continually paging. (Once you started adding useful stuff such as networking or running applications you needed 8MB).</p>
<p>I guess my Windows 95 has acquired crap on it, because I currently only have 34MB of 128MB free physical memory.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
