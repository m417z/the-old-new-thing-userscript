<p>
The <code>Is&shy;Window&shy;Unicode</code> function
reports whether the current window procedure expects
Unicode window messages.
What specifically does this mean?
</p>
<p>
It means that messages like
<code>WM_</code><code>CHAR</code> will report
characters as Unicode code units rather than as
ANSI code units.
</p>
<p>
Okay, so what determines whether a window procedure
receives Unicode messages?
</p>
<p>
When a window is created, its initial window procedure
comes from the class registration.
If the class was registered with <code>Register&shy;Class[Ex]W</code>,
then it is a Unicode window procedure;
otherwise it was registered with <code>Register&shy;Class[Ex]A</code>
and is an ANSI window procedure.
</p>
<p>
If a window is subclassed with a function pointer,
then the new window procedure is Unicode if it was
set with
<code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Long&shy;PtrW(GWLP_</code><code>WNDPROC)</code>
and ANSI if it was set with
<code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Long&shy;PtrA(GWLP_</code><code>WNDPROC)</code>.
</p>
<p>
As we saw some time ago,
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20031201-00/?p=41673">
<code>Get&shy;Window&shy;Long&shy;Ptr(GWLP_</code><code>WNDPROC)</code>
returns a thunk</a>
if you use the ANSI version but the current window procedure is Unicode,
or vice versa.
Suppose the window procedure is Unicode and you call
<code>Get&shy;Window&shy;Long&shy;PtrA(GWLP_</code><code>WNDPROC)</code>.
This will return you a thunk,
and if you later set that thunk back as the window procedure with
<code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Long&shy;PtrA(GWLP_</code><code>WNDPROC)</code>,
then the original Unicode window procedure is restored,
and the window is a Unicode window again.
</p>
<p>
Note that calling
<code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Long&shy;PtrA(GWLP_</code><code>WNDPROC)</code>
can result in a window procedure that is Unicode.
</p>
<p>
As a window message travels from one window procedure
to another window procedure (via <code>Call&shy;Window&shy;Proc</code>),
the character set may flip between Unicode and ANSI.
The <code>Is&shy;Window&shy;Unicode</code> function tells you only
about the window's current window procedure.</p>

		<p>These two statements seem contradictory:</p>
<p>&gt; If a window is subclassed with a function pointer, then the new window procedure is Unicode if it was set with Set­Window­Long­PtrW(GWLP_WNDPROC) and ANSI if it was set with Set­Window­Long­PtrA(GWLP_WNDPROC). </p>
<p>&gt; Note that calling Set­Window­Long­PtrA(GWLP_WNDPROC) can result in a window procedure that is Unicode. </p>
<p>Under what conditions will SetWindowLongPtrA(GWLP_WNDPROC) give you a Unicode window procedure?</p>

		<p>Note carefully: If a window is subclassed with <u>a function pointer</u>&hellip; The next paragraph talks about what happens if you subclass it with a thunk, which is the case that you are asking about.</p>

		<p>The one thing that I keep wondering, especially with:<br />
&#8220;It means that messages like WM_CHAR will report characters as Unicode code units rather than as ANSI code units. &#8221;<br />
Does this mean that codepoints from the supplementary planes can be sent using surrogates?<br />
The reason why I ask this is because the documentation isn&#8217;t exactly the clearest, but it does state that WM_CHAR uses UTF-16, which implies surrogates, and that there isn&#8217;t a one to one mapping between keys pressed and messages generated. But then explicitly states that WM_UNICHAR can handle supplementary plane codepoints.<br />
I just find this a little unclear about whether supplementary plane codepoints/surrogates can be used in a Unicode window without Windows itself not liking it. I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the major problem for this is developers just ignoring surrogates though.</p>

		<p>WM_CHAR is interpreted by the window procedure so It depends on the window procedure how it interprets it. I think the question is really only relevant for an Edit control so if you are really interested my suggestion is to code up an example and send it a surrogate pair in two sequential WM_CHAR messages. :-) Documentation will get you only so far.</p>

		<p>The issue with &#8220;Documentation will get you only so far&#8221; is that there is such a thing as undocumented behaviour. In general, if something isn&#8217;t in the documentation or public API, it is easier to err on the side of caution and assume that something is undocumented.<br />
And this leads to the problem with samples when you are working with potentially undocumented behaviour. It may work, and then it will keep working until it doesn&#8217;t.<br />
Of course, I could be overthinking this, and UTF-16 really does mean UTF-16. But if you have trouble picking out some subtleties in the documentation, especially if you have some kind of disorder that makes this harder (Asperger&#8217;s for example) then your only option is to ask.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
