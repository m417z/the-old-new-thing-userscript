<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/04/01/9988477.aspx"> The function <code>Enum&shy;Claw</code></a>, documented as returning "the child or the parent of the window", was a joke, but there's a function whose behavior is just as confusing as the joke function <code>Enum&shy;Claw</code>: <code>Get&shy;Parent</code>.</p>
<p> The <code>Get&shy;Parent</code> function returns the parent window, or owner window, or possibly neither. All that's left is for it to be a floor wax and it'll have everything covered. </p>
<p> The idea behind <code>Get&shy;Parent</code> is that it returns the parent window. Only child windows have parents, so what happens if you pass something that isn't a child window? Well, we shouldn't let a parameter go to waste, right? So let's have it return the <i>owner window</i> if you pass in a top-level window. But wait, we're not going to return the owner window for all top-level windows, just for top-level windows which have the <code>WS_POPUP</code> style. </p>
<p> This last bit regarding the <code>WS_POPUP</code> style is a leftover from Windows&nbsp;1.0, where there was a distinction made between "tiled windows" and "popup windows." Popup windows could overlap, whereas tiled windows could not, and the function was only interested in windows that can overlap. Of course, now that all windows can overlap, the rejection of tiled windows is just a compatibility remnant. </p>
<p> Anyway, the algorithm for <code>Get&shy;Parent</code> goes like this: </p>
<ul>
<li>If the window is a child window, then return the parent window. </li>
<li>Else, the window is a top-level window.     If <code>WS_POPUP</code> style is set, and the window has an owner,     then return the owner. </li>
<li>Else, return <code>NULL</code>. </li>
</ul>
<p> Here it is in tabular form, since I've discovered that people like tables: </p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="black" style="border-collapse: collapse" cellpadding="3">
<tr>
<th colspan="2" rowspan="2"><code>Get&shy;Parent</code> return values</th>
<th colspan="2"><code>WS_CHILD</code></th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Set</th>
<th>Clear</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<th rowspan="2"><code>WS_POPUP</code></th>
<th>Set</th>
<td>N/A</td>
<td>Owner</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<th>Clear</th>
<td>Parent</td>
<td><code>NULL</code></td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> The upper left entry of the table (corresponding to <code>WS_CHILD</code> and <code>WS_POPUP</code> both set) is left as N/A because that combination of styles is illegal. </p>
<p> Fortunately, you don't have to deal with all the craziness of the <code>Get&shy;Parent</code> function. There are ways to get the parent or owner separately and explicitly without having to deal with <code>Get&shy;Parent</code>'s quirks. </p>
<ul>
<li>To get the parent window, call <code>GetAncestor(hwnd, GA_PARENT)</code>. </li>
<li>To get the owner window, call <code>GetWindow(hwnd, GW_OWNER)</code>. </li>
</ul>
<p> Compatibility requirements prevent <code>Get&shy;Parent</code> from ever going away, but that doesn't mean you are forced to continue using it. Use one of the less confusing alternatives. That's why they're there. </p>

		<p>It would be nice if MSDN marked legacy functions with links to recommended replacement functions.</p>
<p>IIRC they only show a similar warning for deprecated functions.</p>
<p>@Karellen According to MSDN GetAncestor concerns itself with parent relationships while GetWindow has all other relationships such as z-order and owner. &nbsp;Of course then GetAncestor has a GetParent-style GA_ROOTOWNER to walk the parent/owner chain.</p>
<p>They both were introduced in Windows 2000 and both live in user32.dll so I guess your question is quite valid, except for the fact that it would violate the &quot;if it ain&#39;t broke, don&#39;t fix it&quot; rule of coding. &nbsp;But yeah I too would be interested in hearing why they weren&#39;t ORIGINALLY one function.</p>
<p>Only difference I can see is that GetAncestor&#39;s documentation seems to indicate it will always succeed, when GetWindow may not. &nbsp;But then again you might try calling GetAncestor with the desktop HWND or with an invalid flag or HWND passed in or something, so it&#39;s got to fail somehow.</p>

		<p>@Karellen: &nbsp;Probably a case of two different people/teams implementing the same functionality at the same time. &nbsp;GetWindow() does have a GW_OWNER flag, though no GW_PARENT flag. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t matter anyway. &nbsp;The function exists, programs use it, and thus it can never be removed. &nbsp;But at least you&#39;ll still be able to run Lotus 1-2-3 in 2045.</p>

		<p>There is still a distinction between WS_OVERLAPPED and WS_POPUP. A WS_POPUP transits its activation to its owner so the title bar shows active.</p>

<p>It&#39;s not just Windows 1.0.</p>
<p>GetWindow wasn&#39;t added until Win32 IIRC. Not really sure which version because the MSDN claims it was Windows 2000, but it also claims that CreateFile was Windows 2000.</p>
<p>So you can&#39;t guarantee that it was available in the initial versions of Win32, so that means that there could have been a need for GetParent during the NT 3/Windows 95 era. The other thing to remember was that the Win32 API was designed so you could easily compile 16 bit applications for the new Win32 with very few changes. So this allowed for less breakage. Since you can&#39;t guarantee that these programs are not in use even now, then they have to be kept in. So it isn&#39;t just Windows 1.0.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>GetWindow has been around since Windows 1.0. MSDN doesn&#39;t cover Windows versions prior to Windows 2000 any more, so anything introduced prior to Windows 2000 is usually just marked &quot;Windows 2000&quot;. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Glen, presumably because Windows 2.0 was compatible with 1.0. Then, 3.0 was compatible with 2. Of course, 95 had to be fully compatible with 3.1. And XP had to be compatible with 95.</p>
<p>And so it goes.</p>
<p>All the way down at the bottom we have 8 core CPUs booting up in 16-bit real mode so that they can run BIOS boot code written in 1995, and we have monstrously powerful GPU cards carrying 2GB of RAM that pretend to be 1MB VGA cards and implement INT 13.</p>

<blockquote><p>
  and we have monstrously powerful GPU cards carrying 2GB of RAM that pretend to be 1MB VGA cards and implement INT 13.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, VGA is also the last GPU hardware interface standard, and so, the only thing we can really rely on. VESA BIOS Extensions are just a software hack.</p>
<p>BTW, VGA has 256 kB of memory, not 1 MB. :)</p>

<p>The problem here is that if GetParent was removed/changed in the transition between 16 bit and 32 bit Windows, we would have had two problems. First, as you can tell with all of the extra definitions in the headers, Win32 was designed so that a 16 bit application could get compiled for 32 bit Windows with as few changes as possible. So that would mean that in that transition GetParent would have stayed in.</p>
<p>Otherwise how many people would have made it clear in the 3.11 to 95 transition, &quot;don&#39;t upgrade Windows, it breaks programs&quot;.</p>
<p>For 64 bit Windows, it was designed to be the same as Win32, so it isn&#39;t a surprise that it is in there.</p>
<p>But shockingly, I have seen GetParent used recently, even in the post Vista times. Since it is actively used even now, are you suggesting to break those applications?</p>

		<p>-_-; I&#39;m doing this too often recently. I forgot something.</p>
<p>There is even at least one sample of GetParent being used in the MSDN. <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh298366(v=VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/hh298366(v=VS.85).aspx</a></p>
<p>So you would also be breaking apps which followed a sample, and is that good?</p>
<p>Oh, and I&#39;m also sure that someone will mention some Windows components like CAPICOM that didn&#39;t make it through the 32/64 bit transition. For these you will most likely find that there is a proper replacement, like CNG in place.</p>

		<p>Crescens2k: Otherwise how many people would have made it clear in the 3.11 to 95 transition, &quot;don&#39;t upgrade Windows, it breaks programs&quot;. How could it break 32bit programs, they didn&#39;t exist yet. 16bit apps would run just as good as before, no change. The problem would be lazy software companies that can&#39;t handle changing a few lines of code to compile for 32bit. They could say &quot;don&#39;t upgrade from 3.11 to 95, we are too lazy to port our application to 32bit&quot;, but that doesn&#39;t make _any_ sense.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Apparently, in your world, the way to encourage developers to port their code from 16-bit Windows to 32-bit Windows is to make it harder. In my experience, if you make something harder, people are <span style="text-decoration:underline;">less</span> willing to do it, rather than <span style="text-decoration:underline;">more</span>. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Well, I think Raymond summed up what I was thinking perfectly. So I&#39;ll just add two little things.</p>
<p>First, Win32s released during 1994. Fully 32 bit subset of the Win32 API for Windows 3.1x.</p>
<p>Secondly, Windows NT 3.1, released in 1993. Windows NT has always been a 32 bit protected mode operating system.</p>
<p>So 32 bit applications did exist before Windows 95.</p>
<p>Also, how could they break 32 bit apps, well you see, they have the 16 bit application, it runs in a certain way. If you build it for 32 bit Windows and it doesn&#39;t run in the same way then isn&#39;t it broken?</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
