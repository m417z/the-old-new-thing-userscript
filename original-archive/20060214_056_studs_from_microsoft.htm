<p><a href="http://www.sellsbrothers.com/news/showTopic.aspx?ixTopic=1789"> Chris Sells reminded me of the <i>Studs from Microsoft</i> sketch</a> (<a href="http://mentor.creighton.edu/coolstuff/Images/Movies/Sample%20Movies/MISC/STUDS.AVI">direct link to video</a>), a parody of the dating game show <i><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0220939/">Studs</a></i>, as performed by the now-defunct local sketch comedy program <i> <a href="http://www.king5.com/promotion/almostlive/"> Almost Live!</a></i> And yes, in that sketch is Bill Nye at the midpoint of his rise to stardom. Between his careers as Boeing mechanical engineer and nationally-recognized "<a href="http://www.billnye.com/">Science Guy</a>", he was on <i>Almost Live!</i>, performing both comedy and <a href="http://www.king5.com/perl/common/video/wmPlayer.pl?title=www.king5.com/almostlive/ki_almostlive_billnye.wmv"> science demonstrations</a>.</p>
<p> The program had quite an enthusiastic following in its day. If you were new to the area, sooner or later one of your friends would sit you down and force you to watch a half hour of sketches. It was a crash course in local geography and culture, with jokes about Ballard, Mercer Island, Renton, and Lynnwood flying left and right. (The <a href="http://www.king5.com/perl/common/video/wmPlayer.pl?title=www.king5.com/almostlive/ki_almostlive_ballarddriving.wmv"> Ballard Driving Academy</a> is perhaps their greatest accomplishment.) </p>
<p> I noted earlier that one of its recurring sketches <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/02/25/380351.aspx"> influenced a feedback tool included in the betas of Windows&nbsp;XP</a>. I stole their "A or B" sketch for my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/20/135842.aspx"> Coffee machine or assault weapon?</a> quiz (though you'll have to imagine the "ding"s). </p>
<p> One of my favorite sketches was the game show parody <i>Pike or Pine?</i>, wherein contestants were given descriptions of businesses or other landmarks, and they had to say whether the location in question was on Pike Street or Pine Street. The two streets run parallel and nobody, not even people who spent their entire lives in Seattle, can remember what is on Pike and what is on Pine. </p>

		<p>Almost Live! was shown in Los Angeles at some ungodly hour in the morning when I was a kid. I remember watching Billy Kwan (my favorite), The Lame List, and the John Report.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s nearly 3 years since I left Seattle, and I found the Pine/Pike issue easy to resolve. It helps to identify PiNe as the Northern street of the pair. The rest is a trivial exercise left for the reader.</p>

		<p>Yes, I stumbled on the piNe mnemonic, too. &nbsp;But that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that it&#8217;s impossible to remember what business is on which street.</p>
<p>Where&#8217;s the good Indian restaurant? &nbsp;Pike or Pine. &nbsp;Where&#8217;s the QFC? &nbsp;Pike or Pine. &nbsp;Where&#8217;s the Egyptian? &nbsp;Pike or Pine.</p>
<p>They are more like a geographical probability function than discrete streets.<br /></p>

		<p>You&#8217;ll probably also find that non-locals are more likely to get this sort of thing correct. If you grow up somwhere you just learn your way around in manner somewhat akin to osmosis. When you first move somewhere is when you learn the names of streets etc&#8230;</p>

		<p>&quot;The Worst Girlfriend In The World&quot; and the &quot;Lame List&quot; were always my favorites. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t watch a lot of Almost Live, though, as I lived in Snohomish which is far enough north that Seattle people don&#8217;t consider it the &quot;Seattle Area&quot; anymore and it was never mentioned. &nbsp;Too bad.</p>
<p>In fact, I generally find that if you&#8217;re north of about Kirkland, Seattle/Tacoma people generally assume you live on a farm, raise goats, and have 4 broken cars in your front yard.</p>

		<p>Part of the humor of the Pike/Pine show was the guy who got all the questions right about the gay clubs&#8230;</p>

		<p>Proof the internet is lame: I can&#8217;t find any &quot;Mind Your Manners with Billy Quan&quot; videos online.</p>
<p>Remember kids, be like Billy! Behave yourself!</p>
<p>And, apparently, beat up John Keister at every opportunity.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
