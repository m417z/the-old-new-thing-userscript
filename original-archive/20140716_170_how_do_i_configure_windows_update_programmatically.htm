<p>
First of all, normal programs shouldn't be messing with Windows Update
configuration.
That's something the user (or the user's administrator) decides.
If you're an IT administrator, then you can
<a HREF="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc720539%28v=ws.10%29.aspx">
use Group Policy
to configure Windows Update</a>
on your network.
</p>
<p>
But maybe you're a special case where the above remarks don't apply.
Say you're a data center and all the systems are running inside
of virtual machines and you don't want them installing updates
or rebooting without your permission,
so you want to run a script when you set up the image to disable
updates.
</p>
<p>
You can use the <code>Microsoft.<wbr>Update.<wbr>Auto&shy;Update</code>
object,
known to native code as
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa385821%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">
<code>IAutomatic&shy;Updates</code></a>.
Here's a script that prints your current update settings:
</p>
<pre>
var AU = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.Update.AutoUpdate");
var Settings = AU.Settings;
WScript.StdOut.WriteLine(Settings.NotificationLevel);
</pre>
<p>
The notification levels are documented as
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa385806%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">
<code>Automatic&shy;Updates&shy;Notification&shy;Level</code></a>.
If you want to change the notification level, you can update the
level in the Settings object, and then save it.
</p>
<pre>
var AU = new ActiveXObject("Microsoft.Update.AutoUpdate");
var Settings = AU.Settings;
Settings.NotificationLevel = 1; // aunlDisabled
Settings.Save();
</pre>
<p>
All the various settings are documented in MSDN,
though you have to dig through
<code>IAutomatic&shy;Updates&shy;Settings</code>,
<code>IAutomatic&shy;Updates&shy;Settings2</code>,
and
<code>IAutomatic&shy;Updates&shy;Settings3</code>
to find them all.</p>

		<p>This would have been more useful about twenty years ago when we were looking at a case where windows updates didn&#39;t work right. We had got so far as managing to take apart MSBA to find out how it works. Basically we would have ended up with a duplicate of WSUS installed on a laptop.</p>

<p>Huh. &nbsp;All of them have the same OS requirements. &nbsp;I kinda wonder now why they were split into multiple interfaces.</p>

		<p>The Windows Update Agent API can be very useful as well. <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa387099(v=vs.85).aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/aa387099(v=vs.85).aspx</a></p>
<p>I had to use it once to implement a copy of the Windows Update wizard for a Windows 7 Embedded industrial controller &#8211; the existing Wizard didn&#39;t work with the specific look and feel of the controller.</p>

		<p>@The MAZZTer: I seem to recall an older post by Raymond (though I&#39;m unable to find it at the moment) saying that at some point, Microsoft updated the documentation to remove references to older versions of Windows in the &quot;Minimum Supported Client&quot; / &quot;Minimum Supported Server&quot; version documentation. &nbsp;If the versions listed were older than some particular versions, then the minimum versions would be bumped up.</p>
<p>Right now, that minimum minimum version looks like Windows XP / Windows Server 2003. &nbsp;So all of the functions that really first became available in Windows 3.1, 95, 2000, etc. are documented as first being available in XP / Server 2003. &nbsp;For example, CreateFile has clearly been around for a very long time, but MSDN says its minimum supported versions are XP / Server 2003.</p>

		<p>@Adam Rosenfield &#8211; the important part is the word &quot;supported&quot;. That statement is meant to describe what versions of the operating system you can call Microsoft support and expected to receive assistance with, not a historical timeline of the functions introduction.</p>

		<p>@Bryan Porter &#8211; I don&#39;t think that&#39;s what &quot;supported&quot; refers to. Because the minimum supported client version from the IAutomaticUpdatesSettings interface documentation is listed as &quot;Windows 2000 Professional with SP3 [desktop apps only]&quot; here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa385822%28v=vs.85%29.aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/aa385822%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a></p>
<p>And Windows 2000 has been unsupported for a while according to the Support Lifecycle Product Database: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/lifecycle/search/default.aspx?sort=PN&amp;alpha=Microsoft+Windows+2000&amp;Filter=FilterNO">support.microsoft.com/&#8230;/default.aspx</a></p>

<p>a) That&#39;s what it refers to.</p>

<p>Err.. clarification:</p>
<p>a) It refers to the minimum supported operating system for that function. When the article is updated, only supported operating systems are included in the section.</p>

		<p>Hey, how useful and timely!</p>

		<p>Nitpick on the nitpick: While you can indeed set this at install time, scripting it can have its uses.</p>
<p>For instance, you could image your server with updates enabled, allow it to update automatically and then, once up to date (Is there an API to check that?) turn off automatic updates &#8230; </p>

		<p>@Malcolm: Nitpick on the nitpick on the nitpick. &nbsp;If you have Active Directory you can have two OUs for servers with a different GPO on each. &nbsp;One for build with updates enabled, the other for production with updates disabled, and just include &quot;move to production OU&quot; as the last step in your build documentation.</p>

<p>The word &quot;supported&quot; is ambiguous. &nbsp;&quot;Supports&quot; is commonly used to indicated that something works with or is used by something else, e.g., &quot;Product X supports unicode&quot;. &nbsp;If you say &quot;Minimum supported version is Windows XP&quot; it could be interpreted as &quot;Does not work with versions prior to XP&quot; which may or may not be true.</p>

		<p>It has been widely accepted that the meaning of &quot;supported&quot; for the MSDN is really really unlucky. When you need to work with an really old, officially unsupported version of Windows you cannot deduce which functions are available and which aren&#39;t.</p>
<p>Shouldn&#39;t be too difficult to use a different method to mark support and unsupported Windows&#39; ?</p>
<p>On topic: Anyone messing with Windows Update usually ends up breaking it (local company IT, I&#39;m looking at you, and it ain&#39;t with pretty blue eyes)</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Even if the marking is left at &quot;Windows 2000&quot;, the rest of the documentation won&#39;t be. For example, VirtualLock changed behavior and the docs were updated with &quot;On Windows NT 3.1, this API behaves like X. Starting in Windows NT 4, it behaves like Y.&quot;. Once Windows NT 3.1 fell out of support, the first sentence was eligible for deletion to avoid cluttering up the documentation with information that is obsolete. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@MAZZTer</p>
<p>&#39;Remarks: The IAutomaticUpdatesSettings2 interface may require you to update the Windows Update Agent (WUA). For more information, see Updating Windows Update Agent.&#39;</p>
<p>They&#39;re different interfaces because it&#39;s functionality added in new versions of Windows Update, but even older OSes got newer versions of Windows Update over time.</p>

provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
