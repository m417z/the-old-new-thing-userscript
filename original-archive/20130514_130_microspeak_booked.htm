<p>Remember, the term Microspeak is not <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/04/10/10292051.aspx"> tightly scoped to</a> mean jargon used only at Microsoft. It's jargon used at Microsoft <i>more often than in general usage</i>. Today, it's a term that you really need to master if you want to talk with others about project planning.</p>
<p> To <i>book</i> a feature is to commit to implementing the feature, including assigning resources to get it done. This means finding designers to design the feature, developers to implement it, and testers to test it, as well as (the hardest part) finding time in the schedule to do it. The resource that is in shortest supply is usually time, since there is no way to create more of it. </p>
<p> More generally, a resource is booked when it is committed to doing something. This is a natural extension of the concept of booking a room in a hotel or a seat on a train. </p>
<p> Here are some citations. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We will be using the Widget framework that Bob is booked to finish in July. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> There are no resources booked for enhancing the Widget framework this release cycle. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The Widget team knows that we need this feature from them, but they haven't booked it yet, so we need to develop a fallback plan. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The term is in general use, but for some reason, Microspeak uses it almost exclusively to describe the commitment to completing a particular piece of work by a particular date. Instead of saying that the work is <i>committed</i> or <i>scheduled</i> or <i>confirmed</i>, we say that it is <i>booked</i>. (If you use one of the other words, people may ask for clarification. For example, if you say that it is <i>committed</i>, some people might think you mean that the change has already been submitted to the source code repository.) </p>
<p> Curiously the antonym of <i>booked</i> is not <i>unbooked</i>. If a feature has no resources assigned to it, the preferred term is <i>unfunded</i>. </p>

		<p>Neat. As is usual in the parlance of our times, the word is also employed to mean the complete opposite of a commitment: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Book%20It&amp;defid=3664707" rel="nofollow">http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php</a></p>

		<p>@Raymond, Given your long career at Microsoft (spanning from at least the mid-1990&#39;s), I wonder what your basis is for making statements such as &quot;It&#39;s jargon used at Microsoft more often than in general usage.&quot; I&#39;m curious how you know that some of these terms aren&#39;t widely used at other large corporations&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
