<p>Several years ago, I had the pleasure of working in the office next to Danny, a phenomenally talented fellow, not just a stellar programmer but also an accomplished pianist, singer, video game restorer, and skier. I remember when he was working on DirectSound3D, we would sometimes put our heads together to nail the formulas for effects such as Doppler shifts. Particularly satisfying was when we attacked the problem from two directions and arrived at what initially seemed like different answers, but after some algebraic manipulation turned out to be the same thing. When you can solve a problem in two totally different ways and get the same answer, you can be pretty confident that you got it right.</p>
<p> One of the sounds he used during testing was Nirvana's <i>Smells Like Teen Spirit</i>. I remember a bug was filed that went something like "If you position the listener like so and put the sound source over there, start playing <i>Smells Like Teen Spirit</i>, then move the sound source along this path here, then when it reaches that point right there, the music comes out distorted." Danny's initial response was, "Kurt would have wanted it that way." </p>
<p> And then he set to fixing the bug. </p>
<p> In related news, <a href="http://www.paulanka.com/">Paul Anka</a>, the man who <a href="http://www.paulanka.com/html/about/faq.php"> wrote the theme to <i>The Tonight Show with Johnny Carson</i>, the words to Frank Sinatra's <i>My Way</i></a>, and over 900 other songs, has turned the tables on all the singers who covered his songs by <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4755657"> covering landmark rock music songs</a>. Including Nirvana's <i>Smells Like Teen Spirit</i>. [<a href="http://www.npr.org/dmg/dmg.php?mediaURL=/me/20050718_me_teenspirit&amp;mediaType=WM">WM</a>] [<a href="http://www.npr.org/dmg/dmg.php?mediaURL=/me/20050718_me_teenspirit&amp;mediaType=RM">Real</a>] And this time you can understand the words. </p>
<p> A colleague of mine pointed out that Paul Anka didn't write the music to <i>My Way</i>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The funny thing is how <a href="http://www.paulanka.com/html/about/faq.php"> in your link</a> they admit it, and at the same time shamelessly ignore it, calling it a 'seminal composition':  </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> <b> What was the story behind the writing of 'My Way' and was it written specifically for Frank Sinatra? </b>  </p>
<p> Paul first heard the French song, <i> <a href="http://media.virginmega.fr/PreviewStreams/UMI_00731458602620_01_009_32.wma"> Comme D'habitude</a></i>, in the summer of 1967 when he was in Europe. <strong>Although it had different lyrics and a much different feel</strong>, Paul instantly <strong>connected with the melody</strong>. After running into Frank Sinatra, in Florida, who mentioned retiring sometime soon, he asked Paul when was he going to write something for him... so Paul, determined to do just that, returned to New York, sat down at the piano at 1 a.m. <strong>and wrote the song</strong>. Five hours later, this <strong>seminal composition</strong> <a href="http://www.secondhandsongs.com/song/6466.html"> was finished</a> and was sent to Sinatra. ... </p>

		<p>Here, in Ottawa, Ontario (not Ottawa, Illinois, or Ottawa, Ohio), which was Paul Anka&#8217;s home town, if you meet a woman who&#8217;s name is Diana, you&#8217;ve got a pretty good idea of how old she is. . .    and how shallow her parents were.</p>

		<p>For yet another take on &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit,&quot; check out the San Francisco band Smash-Up Derby (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.smashupderby.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.smashupderby.com/</a>).  They combined the music of &quot;Teen Spirit&quot; with the lyrics of Michael Jackson&#8217;s &quot;Billie Jean&quot; and got&#8230;well, you&#8217;ll just have to download the MP3 and hear for yourself.</p>

		<p>Funny, it still sounds pretty distorted to me&#8230;</p>
<p>Btw, what does a &quot;video game restorer&quot; actually do?</p>

		<p>That Paul Anka version is amazing.

<p>Re: Danny, I enjoyed his piano playing the few times I heard it. And I&#8217;m pretty sure that was his Tempest machine I played for hours on end&#8230;.<br /></p>

		<p>Another piece of interesting fact about My Way is that David Bowie was actually the first who lay his hands on the french original working on the English cover.  But Paul Anka somehow showed up in the picture and grabbed the rights on the piece for free.  Anyway the end of the story is Bowie got really vexed about that and wrote Life On Mars (a great piece) in a new melody based on the exact same chords.

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
