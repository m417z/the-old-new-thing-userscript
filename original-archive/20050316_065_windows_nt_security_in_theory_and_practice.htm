		<p>I&#8217;d like to add a vote for &quot;Programming Windows Security&quot; by Keith Brown. Keith explains both old and new stuff very well.</p>
<p>Keith&#8217;s new security book for .NET developers can be found in Wiki form at <a target="_new" href="http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook/HomePage.html" rel="nofollow">http://pluralsight.com/wiki/default.aspx/Keith.GuideBook/HomePage.html</a>.</p>

		<p>so many nice nuggets on msdn that have been lost over the years.  Recently I installed the MSDN that came with VC4.x and was so surprised at how many good articles that are out there (similar to the ones Rudeiger have written about)</p>

		<p>Raymond Chen pointed out an older, but still very good, set of security articles for the Windows platform called Windows NT Security in Theory and Practice. Although these were published in 1995, I have always found them to be a good resource dealing with the CORE security aspects of the Windows system. If you want a nuts-and-bolts approach to the security driving Windows, this is the resource for you. Of course due to its age, it won&#8217;t be covering the newer stuff in the server platform. A lot has changed in Srv03 and should be considered when reviewing this content. Here&#8217;s a tip for you. There is a LOT of other interesting security resources to read about at the save level on MSDN. In other words, check out the other articles on the left hand TOC NAV side. You will find many of those resources interesting to read&#8230;.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
