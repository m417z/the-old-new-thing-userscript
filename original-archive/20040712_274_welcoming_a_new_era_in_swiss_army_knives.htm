<p><a href="http://www.victorinox.com">Victorinox</a>,  the company authorized to make  so-called  <a href="http://www.victorinoxswissarmy.com/">  Swiss Army</a> merchandise,  has run into a bit of a problem:  Is there anything else  you could possibly think of putting on a pocketknife  for an outdoorsman?  And even if you did, there's  no room for it.  The pocketknife has already reached  the point where it's too unwieldy to carry around in  your pocket any more.</p>
<p>  So they decided to think outside the box.  </p>
<p>  First, they let go of the "must fit in your pocket" concept.  Welcome the  <a href="http://www.swissknifeshop.co.uk/swisschamp_xxlt.html">  Victorinox Swiss Champ XXLT</a>.  Check out the picture of the knife in its display box.  The knife is as thick as it is long!  </p>
<p>  Second, they let go of the whole  "things for the outdoorsman" concept.  Now you can get the  <a href="http://www.victorinox.com/newsite/en/produkte/produktdetails/swissmemory/swissmemory.htm">  Swiss Army Knife USB Drive</a>  and the  <a href="http://www.victorinox.com/newsite/en/produkte/produktdetails/1-7725-T/1-7725-T.htm">  Swiss Army Knife CyberTool</a>.  </p>
<p>  Swiss Army Knife.  For the geek in your life.  Embrace it.  </p>

		<p>Heh, my favourite is:</p>
<p><a target="_new" href="http://www.swissknifeshop.co.uk/swissmemory.html#airtravel" rel="nofollow">http://www.swissknifeshop.co.uk/swissmemory.html#airtravel</a></p>
<p>The USB &quot;Air Travel&quot; edition. Basically, it&#8217;s the same as the USB Knife, except without anything sharp or pointy. IOW, it&#8217;s just a USB storage thing, in a bulkier package.</p>

		<p>When I lost my previous Swiss Army knife a couple years ago, I bought a Cybertool. It&#8217;s about as large a knife as I&#8217;d want, but it fits in my pocket OK, and you can work on most computers without any other tools. It&#8217;s not quite as nice as a full toolkit, but it&#8217;s a lot smaller, and more likely to be with you when you need it.</p>

		<p>I second James B.&#8217;s comment. My co-workers bought me the Cybertool for my birthday/Xmas in 1999 and it&#8217;s been with me ever since. It&#8217;s in my pocket right now. Admittedly, I use the pen knife the most, but I&#8217;ve had occasion to use the screwdrivers and the pen is somewhat useful in a pinch, it&#8217;s thinness makes it difficult to write more than a short note.</p>

		<p>Regarding the air travel edition, I like how it claims the lack of sharp implements is to allow &quot;safe carry&quot; on an aeroplane. I&#8217;d assumed this was actually to get around restrictions on the carrying of sharp objects on aircraft you don&#8217;t own yourself, but maybe it is because people become clumsy with the lower air pressure?<br /></p>

		<p>I gave up on Swiss Army for tools; once you go Leatherman you never go back.</p>
<p><a target="_new" href="http://www.leatherman.com/products/tools/wave/default.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.leatherman.com/products/tools/wave/default.asp</a></p>
<p>It is a thing of beauty.  They solved the fit-in-pocket issue by shipping it with a belt-holster thingie.  You can open the blades with one hand without having to open the whole thing up (like other leatherman models).  And you can ply things.  The only complaint I have is it is a little difficult to get the phillips screw driver out.  I have worn this every day since I bought it (except when I fly).</p>
<p>I have a Swiss Army watch that I really like though.</p>

		<p>I busted out laughing when I saw that the XXLT has a &quot;pharmaceutical spatula&quot;.</p>
<p>Didn&#8217;t that used to be called a &quot;coke spoon&quot;?</p>
<p>p.s. The Crocodile Dundee quote is:</p>
<p>&quot;That&#8217;s not a knife. THAT&#8217;S a knife!&quot;</p>

		<p>I agree with the Leatherman comment- they&#8217;re fantastic. They&#8217;re very well made and the knives are better than anything I&#8217;ve seen on a Victorinox knife. And the pliers are probably the most useful addition- I use them far more than the blade.</p>

		<p>Valorie got me a Leatherman Juice XE6 a couple of years ago as a b&#8217;day present, I love that thing.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t carry it around with me because it&#8217;s too bulky but&#8230;<br /></p>

		<p>I also must echo the support for the Swiss Army CyberTool.  I&#8217;ve had one for a few years now and its utility is legendary within my group of friends.  Between repairing a laptop LCD panel with it (which required the Torx bits that the Leatherman doesn&#8217;t have) and it being the only corkscrew and bottle opener at my best friend&#8217;s wedding (the caterer needed to be shot) &#8230; it&#8217;s got quite a history.</p>
<p>The tools that I get the most use out of on it are the screwdriver, the bottle opener, the corkscrew and the pen.  I wouldn&#8217;t have worn a Leatherman to the wedding &#8230; the simple fact that I can carry the CyberTool in my pocket ensures that I have it with me.  It&#8217;s been a lifesaver over and over.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s worth rememering that Victorinox is not the only purveyor of Swiss Army merchandise. There&#8217;s also Wenger, who I think make better knives.  Details at:</p>

		<p>My CyberTool is on the way! I lost my older swiss army knife recently when I accidently left it in my laptop bag. Airport security took it (EVENTUALLY &#8211; I got through a major city&#8217;s airport w/ it no problem &#8211; they snagged it on the return trip).</p>
<p>Good timing on this blog entry! Thanks!!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
