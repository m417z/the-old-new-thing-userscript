<p>Defense in depth is about protecting against threats that are already being protected against, just in case the existing protection fails. This is why there is not merely a lock on your safety deposit box, but also a lock on the door to the safety deposit box room, and then a lock on the doors of the bank itself. This is why you wear your seat belt even though the car is equipped with air bags. This is why <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/16/8398400.aspx"> factories have multiple safety systems</a>. It's why, when you put away a gun, you set the safety <i>and</i> remove the ammunition <i>and</i> lock the gun case.</p>
<p> An insistent anonymous commenter <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/31/6909007.aspx#6970295"> refused to believe in this principle</a> and couldn't distinguish between <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/12/31/6909007.aspx#6980588"> the absence of a known security vulnerability and the potential for one</a>, believing that security is a boolean value, that you're either secure or you're insecure, and that if two systems are identical except that the second system has an additional safety check, this is proof that the first system must have been insecure. </p>
<p> As I described in the comments to the article, there is the potential for bad things to happen if a COM data object is allowed into the process. Even though the CSRSS process never calls any of the potentially dangerous functions in a dangerous way, the potential for some other flaw to result in dangerous behavior creates enough risk that the trade-off tipped toward removing the <i>potential</i> for problems, even though the potential is currently (and hopefully will always remain) unrealized. </p>
<p> Remember that one of the guidelines of security is that the more valuable the target, the more effort you put into securing it. In this case, CSRSS runs with System security privileges, which is even higher than Administrator. You want to erect a lot of barriers for this puppy. </p>
<p> It's like a hospital that has the rule "No cell phones allowed in hospital rooms because they may interfere with the equipment." The staff instruct you to leave your phone outside, but you insist that your phone does not pose a problem because it's turned off, and besides, it doesn't use the same radio frequency as the monitoring equipment. Tough. Defense in depth. Even if it's turned off, even if uses a different radio frequency, they won't let it into the room. </p>
<p> The same thing is true with data objects. CSRSS is careful to extract only the information it needs, but that's like walking into a hospital room with a cell phone whose antenna has been switched off. Sure, the antenna is off, but somebody might bump into you and accidentally turn it on, or there may be some software flaw in the phone that causes it to turn on spontaneously. Sure, you might argue that those failures aren't your fault, so you shouldn't be blamed for them, but try telling that to the person whose monitoring equipment failed to notify the hospital staff of an irregular heartbeat. </p>
<p> People who study security vulnerabilities have quite a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/msdnmag/issues/07/11/ExploitingCrashes/"> wide array of tricks available to them once they find even the tiniest crack</a>. Even something as simple as a null pointer fault (in itself just a denial of service and not a source of pwnage) can be combined with other techniques and become <a href="http://www.uninformed.org/?v=4&amp;a=5&amp;t=txt"> a full-fledged exploit</a>. </p>
<p> For example, even though your cell phone antenna is off, its Bluetooth transceiver may still be on, and somebody might be able to hack into your Bluetooth headset and convince it to tell the cell phone, "Hey, I'd like to make a call. Please turn on your antenna." Even though this is a security flaw in the Bluetooth headset, it was used as a stepping stone into hacking your cell phone. </p>
<p> There's also the possibility that you simply forgot that you had set a text message for delayed delivery, causing the phone to turn on its antenna when the delivery time is reached. Oops. You messed up, and now somebody is intensive care. </p>
<p> As of this writing, there is no known exploit for drag and drop into console windows, but since drag and drop uses highly extensible technology (namely COM and data objects), the possibility that one of those extension points may be used as an attack vector was deemed too great a risk compared to the benefit of the feature. The anonymous commenter concludes, </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Now if this is not a security hole, then either Csrss doesn't execute code in OLE objects it receives, or it doesn't accept any OLE objects received, or isn't able to receive OLE objects at all. Which one is it? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> CSRSS does not execute untrusted code in OLE objects it receives, but the fact that OLE objects are in the CSRSS process at all give the security folks the heebie-jeebies. Although there is no known security hole, there is great <i>potential</i> for a security hole, and that's the reason for removing the potentially dangerous code from CSRSS even though it is (in theory) never executed. </p>
<p> I bet you'd be nervous if somebody pointed a loaded gun at you even though the safety is engaged. </p>

		<p>Actually, there is an even more important argument that is missed here.</p>
<p>You are defending against active attackers who have copies of your system to test their attacks against. &nbsp;Thus, even if an attack does not exist today, an attack will exist tomorrow if there is any possibility of a hole. &nbsp;This is the fundamental problem with defence. &nbsp;It costs way more to defend against all possible attacks than it costs the attacker to find the one opening in the defences and exploit it.</p>
<p>The only possibly good thing about this is that the defences get better over time through sheer Darwinian evolution, developing defences against all the attacks that have worked in the past.</p>

<p>Even if your brothers turned theirs off, the area is probably overrun with cell phones being carried by other people (including the staff).</p>

<p>This might be nitpicking, but air bags are actually more dangerous to your health if you are not wearing seat belts. They are supposed to be used together: one keeps your body fastened to the car, the other protects your head (which can&#8217;t be as conveniently secured).</p>

		<p>Raymond, Stephen Eilert</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re in a crash, and not using a seat belt, here is what happens. First, you are thrown against the steering wheel. Then the airbag propane cylinder ignites and your head is thrown back; your face is burned with hot gasses. This assuming that the crash speed was not too high to just throw you out the window.</p>

		<p>Slightly off-topic:</p>
<p>Many gun&#8217;s safeties cannot be engaged UNLESS they&#8217;re loaded (a standard 1911 comes to mind). Many guns have no manual safety (Glock, Kahr). Most gun cases (the ones the gun comes in from the factory) do not have locks. It would have been better if you just presented the four rules of safe gun-handling for a gun-related analogy:</p>
<ol>
<li>Handle every gun as if it&#8217;s loaded.</li>
<li>
<p>Never point a gun at anything you don&#8217;t want to destroy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Know your target and what&#8217;s beyond it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keep your finger out of the trigger guard until you&#8217;ve made the conscious decision to fire.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>To make a mistake that leads to injury, you must break at least two of those rules and they are a perfect example of layered security (safety).</p>

		<blockquote><p>

<p>Sure, extra layers of defense are a good thing, but there&#8217;s also such a thing as too much protection. Adding extra protection also adds extra complexity and thus an associated extra risk for security problems. There is a point at which adding extra protection actually decreases security.</p>

<p>Only about 100 kids shoot themselves accidentally in a given year (most of the others are suicides or gangbangers if you&#8217;re interested). Honestly, a loaded, uncased gun is perfectly okay, so long as it&#8217;s sitting in a safe somewhere. Dunno of the guy you responded does that or not.</p>

		<p>&quot;I wonder what crappy monitors were being used!!&quot;</p>
<p>Monitors are looking at very small signals &#8211; small enough that noise is a severe issue. Also, those small signals have to travel through some long wires.</p>
<p>Also, if you&#8217;re deep within the bowels of a hospital with lots of shielding, your phone is probably transmitting close to maximum power.</p>
<p>And adding shielding is an option, if you don&#8217;t mind paying an extra 10 grand or more because it has to go through certification. If you change the electronics, you have to prove that there are acceptable workarounds for failure. E.g., if you have an alarm, there had better be a way to check that the alarm went off &#8211; if it means adding a microphone and having the monitor listen, so be it. And yes, that was an option to verify the alarm worked.</p>

		<p>So no cellphones, but i can walk in with a battery attached by wire to a pencil and tap that pencil to the other end of the battery.</p>
<p>This security is not deep enough. No cellphones should read: no transmitters.</p>

		<p>Most hospitals use pagers, and many are starting to use VOIP phones over WiFi, but in reality cellphones (Blackberries) are just too useful to get rid of.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s actually quite rare for cellphones to interfere with important equipment, and it&#8217;s impossible for everybody to turn theirs off (a patient brought in unconscious will not turn off the one in her purse) but the policy is there because it&#8217;s better to be safe than sorry. Odds are that a patient or visitor leaving their cellphone on will not prevent as many deaths as the interference will cause.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that sometimes interference will be caused from just being on, sometimes it will be from ringing (call initiation), and sometimes from being on a call.</p>

		<p>Re: Guns</p>
<p>For some owners, ready-to-go guns *ARE* security.</p>
<p>Definately a bad example of a good concept.</p>

		<p>THe problem with cellphones in a hospital is that GSM phones emit strong short pulses, as opposed to CDMA phones, which use spread spectrum and frequency hopping.</p>
<p>Many people heard a result of GSM interference on their analog equipment. Often, certain VOIP phones start buzzing, immediately before someone nearby gets a call on a GSM phone.</p>

<p>LOL, I was expecting to read &quot;Maybe&quot; at the end of the sentence. Great quote.</p>

		<p>In this one true thing,</p>
<p>In any system that is inherently secure enough to be free from the effects of external attack; there will be a proportionate loss of utility and ease of use for any that desire to access them.</p>
<p>In any human engineered security system, another human being will eventually be capable of reverse engineered and thus overcoming its security&#8230;</p>
<p>Or perhaps I’m just NUTS ;-)</p>

		<p>If it is possible to overcome the security system by reverse engineering then it is not a good security system. Any security that based on the secrecy of the algorithm is not much better than no security at all.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
