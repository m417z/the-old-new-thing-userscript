<p>Yes, I'm talking about Christmas gifts (or "winter solstice gifts" if you prefer) in July. I'm one of those people for whom buying Christmas gifts is a brain-wracking ordeal, and I'm always on the lookout all year round for the "perfect gift".</p>
<p> Last Christmas, a friend of mine gave me a micro-fiber lens-cleaning cloth that comes in a pouch you can attach to a keychain. <a href="http://www.eyeglass.com/products-accessories-cloths.html"> Example&nbsp;1</a>. <a href="http://www.17photo.com/product.asp?id=HMFCS"> Example&nbsp;2</a>. (I have no affiliation with those two sites; I just hunted around looking for a picture.) Best gift ever. I use it several times a day. </p>
<p> My keychain has only four things on it: The aforementioned cleaning cloth, a USB thumb drive, my car key, and my house key. And I could do without the thumb drive and car key most days. But don't take away my cleaning cloth. </p>

		<p>Do you not need a bike key on the Microsoft campus, Raymond? Or do you have a combination lock?</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t keep an unlocked bike long here in Cambridge!</p>

		<p>hmmm&#8230; &nbsp;I may need to get one of those for myself!</p>
<p>What I really need, though, is one of those extendable key chain thingys you all have for your card keys. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And I lost a locked bike in Cambridge. &nbsp;Having a lock doesn&#8217;t mean much there.</p>

		<p>Speaking of locks not meaning much; NYC has the same problem: &nbsp;see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbklkFuFk-4&amp;search=stealing%20bike%20nyc" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbklkFuFk-4&#038;search=stealing%20bike%20nyc</a></p>
<p>One &quot;concerned citizen&quot; actually offered some advice to a guy cutting through a bike chain, without ever asking if the bike was his&#8230;</p>

		<p>Anthony: In theory, Raymond could just carry his bike up to his office and leave it there all day. To go to another building he could take a shuttle or walk, never needing his bike to move around campus.</p>

		<p>Neat-o. &nbsp;I could use those for my sunglasses. :) </p>
<p>That said, as a geek who used to neglect my thumb-drive, I have to point you to what I&#8217;ve done with mine. &nbsp;I can&#8217;t live without my thumb drive anymore&#8230; &nbsp;See <a href="http://www.kickingdragon.com/2006/05/25/usb-drive-madness/" target=_new rel=nofollow rel="nofollow">http://www.kickingdragon.com/2006/05/25/usb-drive-madness/</a>.</p>

		<p>You should get an LED keychain flashlight, it comes in handy often.</p>

		<p>Great idea! I could definitely use one of those.</p>
<p>Are they fairly easy to clean after they have been used for a while and pick up dust, dirt, oils, etc?</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t have the micro cleaning cloth, but I do instead have a little LED torch. It&#8217;s probably the most useful &#163;5 I&#8217;ve spent.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
