<p>This past weekend I fell into tickets to a  <a href="http://www.seattle-thunderbirds.com/newsnotes/0204/022804.htm">  Seattle Thunderbirds game</a>.  (The  <a href="http://www.seattle-thunderbirds.com/">Seattle Thunderbirds</a>  belong to the "U.S. Division" of the otherwise-Canadian  <a href="http://www.whl.ca/">Western Hockey League</a>, one of the  three Major Junior Leagues.)</p>
<p>  I hadn't been to a hockey game since my college days.  It was quite enjoyable and I may very well do it again.  </p>
<p>  On the message board, the various groups in attendance  were recognized.  In addition to the usual things  like "Fred's 9th Birthday" and "Company X", there  was the curious juxtaposition of  "David's Bachelor Party" and  "XYZ Church".  I hope they weren't seated next to each other.  </p>
<p>  I was there with a bunch of seventh graders  and their parents because the middle school choir performed  the Canadian and U.S. national anthems.  I had forgotten that to seventh graders,  the world is one giant social event, just with  different background noise.  In this case, it was a big social event with  hockey noise in the background.  They were chatting away, waving to their friends,  changing seats, calling each other on their  cell phones, writing notes to each other...  </p>
<p>  To give you an idea of the tenor of play,  I refer you to the  <a href="http://www.whl.ca/stats/official-game-report.php?game_id=27534">  game report</a>:  Under "Seattle Penalties", observe that in the second period,  player number 28 was assessed a  two-minute roughing penalty which expired at 3:13.  Now look down a little bit more:  At 3:23, the same player  was assessed a Checking from Behind penalty.  I watched this happen.  When his penalty expired, the player dashed out of the penalty  box straight for an opposing player and walloped him.  And then was promptly sent back off the ice.  </p>
<p>  Ah, minor league hockey.  "We may not play very well, but we make up for it with really  aggressive tactics."  </p>
<p>  And yes multiple fights broke out,  to my disappointment (but to the delight of the crowd,  it appears).  As we left, I overheard one seventh grader say to her  friend, "It was fun, but there wasn't enough fighting."  </p>

		<p>The violence has always been my issue with minor league hockey too&#8230; I go to see good hockey, not see some guy get so angry three refs have to strip him from the waist up and hold him down on the ice to cool him down.</p>
<p>Of course, Seattle is pretty close to Vancouver&#8230; you could always go take in a major league game instead.  :)</p>

		<p>In the major league games that I&#8217;ve been to, a possible statement after a game is &quot;I went to a hockey game and a fight broke out&quot;.</p>
<p>In the few Thunderbirds games that I&#8217;ve been to, a more accurate statement is &quot;I went to a fight and a hockey game broke out&quot;.  In the first game I went to, the first period lasted a bit over an hour due to all the fights.</p>

		<p>No kidding &#8212; if the NHL wants to get tough about its fighting policy, it should have it banned / heavily penalized in the minors.  Just make all minor league fights a game misconduct&#8230;  no suspension, no changing the game rules.  There will still be fighting, but it will be much more contemplated.</p>
<p>And about Vancity&#8230;  it&#8217;s 3 hours plus sitting for an hour or two at Blaine.  Then the ride home with the hope that US Customs doesn&#8217;t tear through your vehicle.  Oh, and Vancouver always sells out, so expect to pay some serious jack to get in.</p>

		<p>GeekyChick invited Lynn and I to a Florida Panthers game tonight. My only gripe with the game was that I think it needed more violence. We only saw one good fight during the entire game! I&#8217;m surprised that isn&#8217;t against the rules in hockey!</p>

		<p>Okay, so VC may not be a hop skip and jump away, but I know several people who have done day (or 1 day/1 night) trips from Austin to Dallas (3 hours) to watch NHL games, so it&#8217;s not totally crazy.  :)</p>
<p>As for price, I may have been a bit spoiled&#8230; living in St. Louis, if you bought early enough, you could get the cheap seats for $15 per ticket, and they&#8217;re really not bad seats at all.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
