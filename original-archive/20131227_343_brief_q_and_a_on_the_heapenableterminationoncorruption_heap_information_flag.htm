<p><b>Question</b>: What type of heaps are controlled by the <code>Heap&shy;Enable&shy;Termination&shy;On&shy;Corruption</code> flag?</p>
<p> <b>Answer</b>: Any user-mode heap created by the <code>Heap&shy;Create</code> function. This includes the process heap (<code>Get&shy;Process&shy;Heap</code>) but <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/01/30/10389330.aspx"> not the managed heap</a>. Some components use <code>Heap&shy;Create</code> under the hood. If so, then those heaps would also be affected. </p>
<p> <b>Question</b>: What versions of Windows support <code>Heap&shy;Enable&shy;Termination&shy;On&shy;Corruption</code>? </p>
<p> <b>Answer</b>: The flag was introduced in Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008. It is also available on Windows XP Service Pack 3. In table form: </p>
<table border="1" bordercolor="black" cellpadding="3" style="border-collapse: collapse; border: solid .75pt black; text-align: center">

<th>Server</th>

<tr>
<th valign="top">     Available<br>     <font size="+3" face="Arial Unicode MS">&#9786;</font>     </th>

<td valign="top">     <br>     Windows Server 2008<br>     Windows Server 2008 R2<br>     ...<br>     </td>
</tr>
</table>
<p> <b>Question</b>: For operating systems that support it, under what conditions will  termination on corruption be enabled? </p>
<p> <b>Answer</b>: </p>
<ol>
<li>For all 64-bit processes. </li>
<li>For all 32-bit processes whose executable sets the     <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/fcc1zstk.aspx">     subsystem major version</a>     to 6 or higher in the image header. </li>
<li>If you call     <code>Heap&shy;Set&shy;Information</code> with the     <code>Heap&shy;Enable&shy;Termination&shy;On&shy;Corruption</code>     parameter. </li>
</ol>
<p> <b>Question</b>: What is the effect of setting the subsystem major version in a DLL? Will that control whether termination on corruption is enabled for any heaps created by my DLL? </p>
<p> <b>Answer</b>: No. For the purpose of rule&nbsp;2 above, it is the major subsystem of the executable that decides whether termination on corruption. The major subsystem of any DLLs loaded by the process have no effect. This is consistent with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/08/24/10199218.aspx"> other process decisions</a>. </p>
<p> <b>Question</b>: Can I enable termination on corruption for some heaps but not others? </p>
<p> <b>Answer</b>: No. Turning on termination on corruption turns it on for <i>all</i> heaps in the process. </p>
<p> <b>Question</b>: Can I disable termination on corruption after it has been enabled? </p>
<p> <b>Answer</b>: No. It is a one-way door. </p>

		<p>@John: In that vein, I believe that I shall use  for recommended practices and  for deprecated practices as well!</p>
<p>Regarding this function, I&#39;m glad that Windows XP/2003 simply ignore this flag and don&#39;t blow up if you use it (they don&#39;t honour it, but if you&#39;re using this you should probably be version-checking already.)</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t mean to nitpick but &quot;Windows Server 2003 R2&quot; is missing from the table. There is also a typo: It reads &quot;Windows Server 2000&quot;. There is no such OS, although there are the various server editions of &quot;Windows 2000&quot; and Windows NT x.</p>

		<p>Hmmm, I just noticed that the Unicode THUMBS UP and THUMBS DOWN glyphs didn&#39;t show up in my post. Normally I would point to a Michael Kaplan blog entry about this but sadly his blog is no more [Unicode WHITE FROWNING FACE (U+2639)]!</p>

		<p>I guess I&#39;ve been assuming that Windows Server 2003 R2 is programatically like Windows Server 2003. Only encountered it after having preped for supporting Windows Server 2008 though.</p>
<p>There are some version checks for NT version &gt;= 6 to see if some APIs exist and one to try to figure out which version of the package manager to run but otherwise the support was done without version checks so I guess I won&#39;t find out.</p>
<p>The package manager check is to install some components of IIS only if the base component is already installed (to avoid surprises). It turns out we depend on an obscure subcomponent not installed by default anymore and auto-installing that subcomponent keeps our support costs down without opening up unexpected attack channels.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
