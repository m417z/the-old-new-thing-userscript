		<p>Yes, you are absolutely right! &nbsp;And they offer plaques with the cover page of the patent application on it as well. &nbsp;I know this from personal experience.</p>
<p>This is so similar to &#8216;vanity publishing&#8217; that I think they prey on the inventors. &nbsp;Of course, that brings up the whole &#8216;invention support&#8217; industry (&#8216;let us shop your patent to major companies&#8217; etc) that most regulators and such warn are useless.</p>

		<p>You get the same kind of junk when you start a non-profit association. Yeah sure, I will buy a fax for my new non-profit association when we don&#8217;t even have a regular room to meet in.</p>

		<p>Best part of that first link is that his patent wasn&#8217;t granted (or even not granted) when he wrote the post. It was given the final rejection this past June as being obvious.</p>

		<p>&quot;You get the same kind of junk when you start a non-profit association.&quot;</p>
<p>Or when you register a for-profit corporation :)</p>
<p>I also registered a trademark, and have received numerous scam mail asking for payments of $2000 (+ or &#8211; any number of your choice) to be registered in some kind of international business catalog. The letters aren&#8217;t even clever &#8212; they&#8217;re littered with grammatical and spelling errors, and don&#8217;t even offer to send you a copy of the catalog. You&#8217;re just promised that you&#8217;ll be added to some kind of online database.</p>

		<p>Great, something to look forward too. &nbsp;I have to go to the Post Office to get my mail since I live so far out in the sticks. &nbsp;I tend to not get there as often as I should. &nbsp;Can&#8217;t wait for them to start scolding me more for having an over stuffed box&#8230;.. Maybe it would be better if the patent is not approved&#8230;.</p>

		<p>Similar thing happened when I was in a car accident one time. &nbsp;The very next day I had mail from a lawyer. &nbsp;The day after that I had letters from dozens more lawyers, body shops, and chiropractors. &nbsp;Some included a copy of the police report (I guess to make me think it was something official and not an advertisement?).</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m curious aren&#8217;t there also numerous &quot;offers&quot; from patent trolls and other sleazy types to buy the patent so they can add it to their portfolio?</p>

		<p>Yes, so true!</p>
<p>I actually applied for a patent and then left the company (on good terms) a couple years later. I had totally forgotten about it when I got an offer for a framed copy of the patent, and realized what it was. So I called the company and told them about it, and they actually sent me the patent-bonus even though I didn&#8217;t work there anymore. I miss that company!</p>

		<p>&quot;I was there because my wife had just delivered our brand new baby boy: Beckett Ethan Chambers (his initial spell his name, just like his 3 older brothers).&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s just one step away from naming your child with a recursive acronym :-)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
