<p>A customer observed that if they use Explorer to view the timestamp on a file, it is not always in agreement with the value shown if they run a plain <code>DIR</code> in a command prompt. They are sometimes off by an hour. Why is that?</p>
<p> Whenever you hear the phrase "off by an hour" you should immediately think "Daylight Saving Time". </p>
<p> The formatting of file timestamps shown by Explorer <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/query/ff394358"> has changed over time</a>. The most recent algorithm (at the time of this writing) is to use the time zone that was in effect at your current location at the time the timestamp was created. For example, a file created at noon in June 22 will show its timestamp as noon, even if you view it in the middle of December. That's because Explorer says, "Well, on June 22, Daylight Saving Time was not in effect, even though it's in effect now, so I will interpret that time zone as if Daylight Saving Time were not active." (Hey, Raymond, didn't you get that backward? Answer: The customer who asked this question is in New Zealand.)&sup1; </p>
<p> The old-style function for converting a UTC timestamp into a local timestmap is <code>File&shy;Time&shy;To&shy;Local&shy;File&shy;Time</code>. The documentation for that function points you at the sequence of operations you need to perform if you want to use the time zone of the timestamp instead of the current time zone. </p>
<p> Explorer switched to using the time zone of the timestamp, but the command processor continues using the old-style conversion. </p>
<p> Why doesn't the command processor get with the program? </p>
<p> Well, for one thing, the people who decide what Explorer does are not the same people who decide what the command processor does. (The Explorer folks can certainly make suggestions, but they can't force the command processor to do anything.) It's like asking why Taco Bell puts the men's room on the left, but Pizza Hut puts it on the right. </p>
<p> The command processor is an old and cranky program. The command processor yells at Explorer to get off his lawn. The command processor gets upset when his Internet connection flakes out while he's watching <i>Matlock</i> online. The command processor doesn't care about your fancy-pants <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb762250"> localized file names</a>; it shows the raw file system names. The command processor has hundreds of thousands of scripts, and there's no way of knowing how many of them depend on the exact way it formats dates. </p>
<p> You may be able to wheedle the command processor into making some changes for you, but you'd better have a really good reason, and he's going to be really grumpy about it. The command processor was once cajoled into changing its date format to four-digit years back in the late 20th century, and he did it only because everybody insisted that it was <i>soooooooo important</i>. But he was so grumpy about it, he had an option to go back. </p>
<p> &sup1; Actually, that's not true. The customer who asked the question was in Texas, but I moved him to New Zealand for the purpose of the story. People in the Southern Hemisphere always have to put up with us Northerners assuming that summer starts in June, so I figured I'd turn the tables for once. </p>

<p>I don&#39;t think this analogy quite fits because those things are two separate entities (though I guess they share an owner along with KFC). &nbsp;Command and Explorer may be considered to be two separate entities internal to Microsoft, but externally they both ship as part of the same product. &nbsp;I understand the concerns for backward compatibility, but outside of that it would seem desirable for a product to have internal consistency.</p>

		<p>@Grzechooo</p>
<p>As the article says, it&#39;s kept the same for compatibility reasons rather than lack of development.</p>
<p>In any case, there are much better ways to do, for example, scripting &#8211; WSH has existed since win95, and powershell since 2006</p>

		<p>So what this shows is there are some parts of Windows where MS cares about backward compatibility to such extremes that it halts significant progress on things like the cmd processor. Many parts are never updated. And there are also components where MS just throws backward compatibility out of the window constantly under the name of &quot;progress&quot;.</p>

		<p>And yet, in the DOS days, file timestamps were stored in local time, so it would never have been an issue, and noon on June 22nd would always be noon on June 22nd. Actually, isn&#39;t this still true on Fat32? Does that mean that when reading a directory from a Fat32 volume, the kernel converts the timestamps (stored on disk in local time) from local to UTC in anticipation of it being interpreted the way Explorer does it? Or are timestamps no longer in local time on disk?</p>

		<p>@xpclient: Arguably the push to Powershell is about throwing backwards compatibility out in the name of progress. The only real difference is that it&#39;s a minimum impact option to leave cmd.exe in there too. The same cannot be said of the GUI, where all new features would somehow also need to be shoehorned into the &quot;old UI&quot; if it were left as an option (or it would be a fairly useless option)</p>

		<p>Why haven&#39;t both cmd and explorer always worked the new way?</p>
<p>I feel it&#39;s the <em>only</em> correct way. If the file was created at noon, display the file creation time to be noon.</p>

<p>We&#39;re just conditioned to think of midnight as &quot;0:00&quot; rather than as &quot;point halfway between sunset and sunrise&quot;. If sunrise is at 0:00, then midnight is at or around 16:00, and what&#39;s the problem?</p>

<p>&#8230; you use a lookup table that was updated yearly by the vendor. &nbsp;Arbitrary yearly changes in when DST starts/stops don&#39;t even rate in time processing WTFery.</p>

		<p>If you show all times with the current timezone offset, you only need to know the current rule for DST, and there&#39;s never any ambiguity as to when two times are.</p>
<p>If you show all times with the offset that was in effect at that time, you need a database of all DST transition times ever, and there can be confusion as to when certain times actually happened.</p>
<p>Besides, it&#39;s really displaying what the time was in the current timezone at that moment &#8212; it&#39;s not showing what the local time was when the file was actually modified (which is what FAT stores).</p>
<p>It&#39;s not hard to understand why they kept the old, simple algorithm for cmd.exe.</p>

		<p>Or, you could pick a country like Israel* or Brazil, where DST switch dates are decided yearly by politicians.</p>
<p>* Actually, Israel switched to a complex yet predictable schedule in 2007, so one can know whether a certain date had DST or not. Still, for dates before that&#8230;</p>

		<p>Actually, NZ is a good example for another reason &#8211; being 12 hours ahead of UTC normally, we become *13* hours ahead during Daylight Savings. So don&#39;t assume that timezone offsets cannot exceed +/-12:00&#8230;</p>

		<p>&quot;Also, the old non-standard AM/PM-system can go &gt;12, but the 24h system cannot go &gt;24.&quot;</p>
<p>The Japanese seem to be able to do this. If you look at TV listings, you can often find times &gt;24.</p>

		<p>@Neal: This isn&#39;t really an answer to your question but, at least on Windows 7, the dates shown by the dir command are affected by the regional format settings in the control panel. It will show 2-digit years if the date format is M/d/yy, regardless of whether the /4 option is used.</p>

		<p>&quot;You could also argue it&#39;s in the interest of the parent company to arrange their bathrooms in the same orientation in their properties.&quot;</p>
<p>Come on, now. &nbsp;They&#39;re different buildings with different layouts; who cares where the bathroom is? &nbsp;It&#39;s got a freaking sign on it. &nbsp;File times are serious business.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
