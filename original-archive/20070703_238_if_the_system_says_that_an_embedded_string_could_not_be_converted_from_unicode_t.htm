<p>It's probably trying to tell you that an embedded string could not be converted from Unicode to ANSI.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> One of our programs is throwing the exception "Type could not be marshaled because an embedded string could not be converted from Unicode to ANSI." It happens only if we use the Chinese version of the program. Why are we getting this exception? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I may be going out on a limb here, but I bet it's because an embedded string could not be converted from Unicode to ANSI. </p>
<p> Unicode is big. Bigger than any ANSI code page. No matter what ANSI code page you pick, there will be Unicode characters that cannot be expressed in it. (And no, you can't set your ANSI code page to UTF-8. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/"> Michael Kaplan</a> discussed it <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2006/10/11/816996.aspx"> last October</a>, and before that, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2006/07/14/665714.aspx"> last July</a>, and before that, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2006/07/04/656051.aspx#656102"> a week and a half previous (still July)</a>, and before that, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2005/02/06/368081.aspx#368495"> two years ago February</a>. I think Michael might need to change the subtitle of his blog to "Explaining why the ANSI code page can't be UTF-8 since 2005".) </p>
<p> In particular, if you grab some Chinese characters and try to map them to <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/sbcs/1252.htm"> the ANSI code page on an English system</a>, they definitely won't map successfully. </p>
<p> The real question, though, is why you're using ANSI in the first place. Get with the program, it's 2007 already. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2006/10/24/867880.aspx"> As Michael Kaplan noted</a>, it's all Unicode all the time from now on. In that same article from Michael, he also does the necessary psychic debugging for the root cause: The <code>DllImport</code> declaration did not specify a <code>CharSet</code>, so you get the default, which is <code>CharSet.Ansi</code>! </p>
<p> Change your character set to <code>CharSet.Unicode</code> and you'll be all set. </p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe you, sir, are a native English speaker and think that those other funny characters aren&#8217;t that important, but the rest of the world doesn&#8217;t think so. I remember times when someone in Hungary (like me) couldn&#8217;t use French town names, for example, correctly, because France is in Western Europe and Hungary is in Central Europe. I think having double size for all strings is pretty much worth it if it means people can use their native language everywhere.</p>
<p>Plus, if you&#8217;re that worried about size, UTF-8 is still there. If all you have is English text, there won&#8217;t be any difference in the size.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know about marshaling or understand the situation here, but&#8230;</p>
<p>Should this create an exception? Sounds like an overkill to me. I mean, it&#8217;s obvious that you cannot map any Unicode string to any ANSI code page. Why not just map non-existent characters to character 255 and maybe return a warning some way.</p>
<p>Assume you got an exception from your browser or word processor just because current font didn&#8217;t have a few of the character glyphs for the document you are trying to open&#8230;</p>

<p>The exception is there for the software engineer to deal with, not the end user. &nbsp;If the system did what you suggest, and the engineer did not fix the bug that ANSI APIs are being called instead of Unicode APIs, here&#8217;s what might happen: users start getting characters in their text mangled because Chinese characters do not map to ANSI chars so they get mapped to 255. &nbsp;When the mapping is reversed,the 255&#8217;s get mapped to some nonsensical character, and the user&#8217;s text is garbage.</p>
<p>Either way, throw an exception or translate to some dummy character, it&#8217;s still a bug.</p>
<p>Sometimes you&#8217;ll see text from a non-english codepage displayed with &#8216;?&#8217; characters. (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&amp;item_id=FontFAQ_Display#b0551258" rel="nofollow">http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&#038;item_id=FontFAQ_Display#b0551258</a>). That&#8217;s the program trying to display text that&#8217;s in a codepage it doesn&#8217;t understand. &nbsp;It&#8217;s bad enough when the program doesn&#8217;t know how to display the text, but you&#8217;d better believe that a user would not want that transformation done in a way that causes the original text to actually be lost.</p>

		<p>Burak,</p>
<p>There is a number of reasons why an exception is appropriate here:</p>
<p>* Your proposal silently corrupts the data. The caller has no way to detect that the data has been corrupted, and so may end up writing the corrupted data to backing store in place of the correct data.</p>
<p>* An exception allows the caller to trap the condition and handle it in some appropriate manner. If your program is a character encoding converter, it&#8217;d probably be appropriate to tell the user &#8220;Sorry; this data can&#8217;t be represented in that encoding.&#8221;</p>
<p>* In this particular case, I&#8217;m assuming that since we&#8217;re talking about &#8220;the Chinese language version of the app&#8221; this text is going to be displayed in the UI somehow. Turning every character into ANSI codepoint 255 is hardly useful behavior, since the text will be unreadable.</p>

<p>I entirely agree.</p>
<p>I have had this unpleasant conversation too many times to remember. It is more difficult than you may imagine to convince a customer of the values of Unicode.</p>
<p>I wish non-Unicode support would be pulled in a future version of Windows. Or at the very least display a big dialog at execution time warning the user that the 20th century has ended and it&#8217;s time to move on to Unicode.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
