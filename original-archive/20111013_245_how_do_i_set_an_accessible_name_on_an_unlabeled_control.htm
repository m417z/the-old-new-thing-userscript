<p>A customer asked for advice on accessibility. This was great news, because it meant that somebody <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/08/16/702526.aspx"> actually cared about accessibility</a>!</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We have a property sheet page that contains an unlabeled list view. The list view is not labeled because its meaning is implied by its placement on the dialog. This works great as long as you can see the screen, but we also need to associate an accessible name to the list view so that screen readers know what it is. We tried <code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Text</code> on the list view, but accessibility didn't pick it up. How do I set the accessibility name on the control? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Place a static control immediately ahead of the list view in the z-order. If you don't want the static control to be visible, mark it as <code>NOT WS_<wbr>VISIBLE</wbr></code> in the dialog template. </p>
<p> This is another manifestation of the trick we learned some time ago of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/06/02/8568490.aspx"> using a hidden static control with an accelerator in order to associate the accelerator key with an unlabeled control</a>. In this case, the hidden static control isn't there to provide an accelerator; <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/06/02/8568490.aspx#8569550"> it's there to provide an accessible name</a>. </p>

		<p>Maybe the blog software&#39;s accessibility isn&#39;t that great?</p>
<p>Should I really leave a question mark as a forward pointer to the next article? :)</p>

		<p>First off, I have no clue about the subject so I could be totally wrong&#8230;</p>
<p>Isn&#39;t this kind of an implementation dependent hack? Why should a screen reader read hidden controls?</p>
<p>Imagine a &quot;dynamic&quot; dialog with lots of controls, where only the visibility / layout of the controls are dynamically adapted but the hidden controls always exist. I&#39;m sure such applications exist. Would the screen reader software read out all the controls the user should not see?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>The screen reader isn&#39;t reading the hidden control; it&#39;s reading the <code>accName</code> property from the visible control, which MSAA retrieves from the hidden control. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>@Me: If you read the linked-to articles, you&#39;d know that the screen reader software would ignore controls that are disabled (i.e. controls that have the WS_DISABLED style).</p>

		<p>@Me: I think it makes perfect sense:</p>
<p>If a control&#39;s label comes from the preceding label, then it should apply in all cases. If the label is not meant to be displayed, then just make it invisible.</p>

		<p>In VB you can set different values for z-order and tab order. Why should it be related?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
