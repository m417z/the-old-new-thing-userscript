<p>For concreteness, let's assume that you are using 437 as your OEM code page (which as we all know <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/29/457483.aspx"> is not actually provided by the OEM</a>) and 1252 as your ANSI code page (which as we all known is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/31/144893.aspx"> not actually the product of the American National Standards Institute</a>).</p>
<p> You can use Alt+0154 to type a <a href="http://www.fileformat.info/info/unicode/char/0161/index.htm"> Latin small letter&nbsp;s with caron</a> because position 154 in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/sbcs/1252.mspx"> code page&nbsp;1252</a> is the Latin small letter&nbsp;s with caron. On the other hand, lowercase r with caron does not exist in code page&nbsp;1252, nor does it exist in <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/oem/437.htm"> code page&nbsp;437</a>, so if you want to type that character, you're out of luck. The Alt+nnn sequence lets you type characters from the OEM code page, and Alt+0nnn lets you type characters from the ANSI code page, but if the character you want is in neither of them, then those sequences aren't going to help you. </p>
<p> (As an experiment, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/12/10009451.aspx"> I didn't write any motivating discussion</a>. It's actually easier for me because coming up with a narrative to accompany a dry technical article is hard work. If I don't have to do it, so much the better for me.) </p>

		<p>I had VS2008 open when I read this, and just out of pure stupidity I typed Alt+0154 as a variable name and it totally accepts it. I suppose it should since it&#8217;s a valid character, but I didn&#8217;t expect that.</p>

		<p>So that&#8217;s where the leading zero comes from. Of course, this raises the question: How do I enter arbitrary Unicode characters? (BMP would suffice for now)</p>
<p>In unrelated news: Most modern language standards allow Unicode characters in identifiers. Ada 2005 defines the constant Ï€ in one of its libraries, for example.</p>
<p>pcooper is right. Where&#8217;s your control group?</p>

		<p>Apparently there is a registry key which enables Unicode values to be entered using Alt sequences, although I could not get it to work in Windows 7 (perhaps things have changed, or maybe it needs a restart which I did not try):</p>

		<p>@Bahbar: you seem to be confusing &quot;standard&quot; and &quot;portable&quot;.</p>
<p>The source character set for C++ is implementation defined. &nbsp;But if you want portability you should only use characters from the &quot;basic source character set&quot;, a list of most of the characters that can be encoded with ASCII.</p>
<p>Note that the basic source character set is not a character encoding; it&#8217;s just a list of characters. &nbsp;So it&#8217;s not a subset of ASCII, which is an encoding.</p>
<p>&lt;/pedantry&gt;</p>

<p>The difference between having a story or motivating discussion to accompany a dry technical article just happens to be the difference between a blog post and an MSDN documentation page. The reason I read these posts is for the fusion, though I totally get the apprehension of doing so.</p>

		<p>Supplimentary note: If you want to type characters in other range, you may install &quot;Chinese (Unicode)&quot; input method and use it instead. (Not sure if such input method is available in other languages&#8230;)</p>

		<p>Hrm&#8230; that would be really mean is to use one of the many lookalike characters from unicode in a variable name&#8230; people will never figure out why their code won&#8217;t compile. Copy-and-paste works, but no one knows why typing it out doesn&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>I think the set up for this story is completely unbelievable.</p>
<p>As for the variable names with Czechian accents, this is perfectly possible in VB. In C too, it should be doable even when the compiler borks, simply by letting your editor read and write variable names in a special encoding, or by piping your source through a similar filter before compile.</p>

		<p>@Bahbar &#8211; Standard C allows certain ranges of &quot;universal character names&quot; (i.e. unicode characters) to appear in identifiers, and there is a paragraph that &nbsp;strongly implies that a definite mapping must exist from characters present in the source character set to universal character names. A brief skim of the C++ standard shows it seems to have the same language. [actually, it&#8217;s more explicit on the point that a mapping must exist] &#8211; see Annex E for what characters are allowed.</p>
<p>@Neil &quot;Interestingly Character Map&#8217;s &quot;Characters to copy&quot; field allows you to type Alt+0345 for Å™.&quot; &#8211; yeah, that seems to be a RichEdit feature. Wordpad does the same thing.</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
