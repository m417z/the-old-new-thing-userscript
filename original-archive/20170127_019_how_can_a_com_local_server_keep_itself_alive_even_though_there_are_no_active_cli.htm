<p>
Suppose you have a COM local server,
which means that the COM object is provided by a
process different from the clients.
And suppose you have a method which triggers some sort of
background operation,
and the rule for your object is that even if all references
to the object are released, the background operation
must still run to completion.
(This is the model followed by Windows Runtime objects,
for example.
An asynchronous operation will continue to run independently
of the object which initiated the operation.)
</p>
<p>
The question, then, is how to communicate to the COM infrastructure
that you are still doing work and the server should not be
shut down just because there are no outstanding references to it.
</p>
<p>
Assuming the object is MTA-threaded or free-threaded,
the recommendation for out-of-process servers is to use
<code>Co&shy;Add&shy;Ref&shy;Server&shy;Process</code>
and
<code>Co&shy;Release&shy;Server&shy;Process</code>
to manage their process lifetime.
In particular,
<code>Co&shy;Release&shy;Server&shy;Process</code>
will automatically call
<code>Co&shy;Suspend&shy;Class&shy;Objects</code>
when the process reference count reaches zero,
thereby avoiding the race condition where one thread
drops the reference count to zero, and before it can
call
<code>Co&shy;Suspend&shy;Class&shy;Objects</code>,
another thread sneaks in and creates an object.
</p>

I'm not the subject matter expert here, so I'll leave
you with some fascinating reading on the subject.

		<p>We ran into a similar but more insidious problem? A COM local server hands out references to an object(A) which in turn can create in-proc objects and hand out references to those (B). If the client process then releases the main object(A) the server process shuts down even though it is still hosting the subobject B.</p>
<p>Ideally the server process would call CoAddRefServerProcess for every loaded COM DLL that isn&#8217;t ready to be freed, but I never figured out how CoFreeUnusedLibrariesEx enumerates the DLLs.</p>

		<p>I suspect the tall narrow formatting may have more to do with the screen sizes that were common 20 years ago! It looks perfectly fine at 640&#215;480 or 800&#215;600. There&#8217;s also the widely-held belief that it&#8217;s easier to scan shorter lines, e.g. <a href="http://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability" rel="nofollow">http://baymard.com/blog/line-length-readability</a>, <a href="http://practicaltypography.com/line-length.html" rel="nofollow">http://practicaltypography.com/line-length.html</a>, or <a href="http://www.webstyleguide.com/wsg2/type/lines.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.webstyleguide.com/wsg2/type/lines.html</a> which is of a similar era (ironically, it doesn&#8217;t limit the text width!) The articles are about 50-55 characters per line. We&#8217;ve just got used to ludicrously wide layouts due to web pages that pay no attention to page width, particularly on widescreen monitors.</p>
<p>Developers are probably more used to very wide layouts. I&#8217;m struggling to keep my juniors within the width that renders without wrapping in GitLab&#8217;s Merge Request view with both sidebars open, on a widescreen 1920&#215;1080 monitor (about 120 columns).</p>

		<p>The term &#8220;magazine&#8221; is used for a reason. MSJ existed as a physical dead-tree artifact, whose articles had the typical narrow column typesetting.</p>
<p>I guess you could say that the online archives are skeumorphic.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s pretty cool that COM has been solid and stable enough that a 20-year-old article is still authoritative.</p>

		<p>SI: That&#8217;s a scenario you can get with OLE linking to embeddings. It is solved in that case by insisting that object B offers a way to obtain the IOleContainer interface on A, so that its clients can call LockContainer.</p>

		<p>You are my hero.  Thank you for posting this for me and the five other people still interested in COM development.</p>
<p>I am actually working on a distributed algorithm research project using DCOM and was considering an approach to trick out remote COM servers on their internal client count in order to exert some control over their startup/shutdown process &#8211; rather than implement them (and register them) as full Windows services.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
