<p>In Microspeak, a feature <i>lights up</i> if it becomes available in an application when run on an operating system that supports it.</p>
<p> The idea is that you write your application to run on, say, Windows versions <var>N</var> and <nobr><var>N</var> + 1</nobr>. There is a new feature in Windows version <nobr><var>N</var> + 1</nobr>, and new functionality in the application when the code detects that the underlying Windows feature is availble. </p>
<p> Here are a few citations: </p>

<p> The idea is that the program takes advantage of new Windows features when running on new versions of Windows. if run on older versions of Windows without those features, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/14/131881.aspx"> nothing happens</a>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Inside the product group, discussion about "lighting up" often takes the form of deciding how much new hotness will be automatically applied to old applications and how much needs to be explicitly opted in. Applying new features to old applications makes the old applications and the new feature more valuable because the user sees the feature everywhere, as opposed to working only in new applications designed to take advantage of it. On the other hand, applying them automatically to old applications creates a compatibility risk, because the application may observe a behavior that hadn't occurred before, and it may begin behaving erratically as a result. </p>

		<p>I believe that you can also use &quot;leverage&quot; when talking about blackmail (which, I suppose marketing might be a subset of).</p>

		<p>Much of the MSDN library has been &quot;un-lighted up&quot;. &nbsp;From <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.datatable(v=vs.110).aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/system.data.datatable(v=vs.110).aspx</a>, the left-side links like &quot;DataTable Methods&quot; and &quot;DataTable Properties&quot; results in &quot;Content Not Found&quot;. &nbsp;And from <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand(v=vs.110).aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand(v=vs.110).aspx</a>, the left-side links like &quot;SqlCommand Methods&quot; five the same &quot;Content Not Found&quot;. &nbsp;I don&#39;t know who to report this to since I don&#39;t have a contract.</p>
<p>Is this a valid use of &quot;light up&quot;? &nbsp;Maybe the MSDN library has been &quot;lighted on fire&quot;! &nbsp;:-) &nbsp;Maybe all of .NET 4.5 has been torched.</p>

		<p>So, as @DWalker mentions, a feature sometimes &quot;goes dark,&quot; though I imagine this is rare. &nbsp;Removing features is changing the rules while the game is in progress. &nbsp;But is &quot;goes dark&quot; the correct verb to describe this?</p>

		<p>@Beldantazar, Data Table Methods from that link still gives Content Not Found; Data Table Properties works. &nbsp;SQL Command Methods still gives Content Not Found. &nbsp;Maybe we are supposed to read and set Properties, but not use Methods!</p>
<p>When MS moved Help content and class definitions from locally-installed to &quot;on the Intertubes&quot;, it is a real productivity killer when the links are not &quot;Lighted Up&quot;. &nbsp;(Obligatory on-topic reference.)</p>

		<p>@DWalker: The documentation for those classes can be found for .NET Framework 4 and below (click on &quot;Other versions&quot;: the URLs are <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.datatable_methods(v=vs.100).aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/system.data.datatable_methods(v=vs.100).aspx</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand_methods(v=vs.100).aspx">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/system.data.sqlclient.sqlcommand_methods(v=vs.100).aspx</a> respectively), so it was probably an oversight when they deployed the updated information. I doubt that these classes have changed that much since 4.0. It&#39;s a little annoying, I agree, but nothing show-stopping IMO.</p>

		<p>@ErikF: &nbsp;Nothing show-stopping? &nbsp;The links are working today, after not working for three days (maybe longer). &nbsp;But missing documentation for .NET framework 4.5 really IS pretty serious. &nbsp;I don&#39;t have prior knowledge, like you apparently do, that these classes have not changed much since 4.0. &nbsp;(If there are no improvements in .NET, then why is there a new version??? &nbsp;Surely some classes have been enhanced, but without the documentation, *I can&#39;t tell which classes have changed and which ones are the same*.)</p>
<p>Glad to see that the documentation is lighted up again. &nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>Thanks.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
