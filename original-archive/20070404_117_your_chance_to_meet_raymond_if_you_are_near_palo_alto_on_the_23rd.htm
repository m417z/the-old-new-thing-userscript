<p>There's been a slight change in plans. I will be in Palo Alto on April 23rd <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/03/26/1949083.aspx"> rather than April 20th</a>. Not that anybody is affected by this beyond the folks at Microsoft's Silicon Valley Campus, since nobody else took me up on my offer. I guess I'm not as popular as I thought.</p>
<p> <b>Update 13-Apr-2007</b>: Here's my schedule for April 23rd when I'm down San Jose way. </p>

<p> Now the term "presentation" is a bit of an overstatement. It's really just me telling a bunch of stories, but instead of sitting at a table with a bunch of people, I'll be standing in front of a room. Same stories, different audio system. I'll have a number of stories prepared, but I'm hoping some of the chatter will inspire other stories. (I won't do a coding presentation because, I mean really, a presentation on Win32 programming topics is bo-ring.) </p>
<p> Extremely limited guest seating&mdash;we're talking one or two people&mdash;may be available at the Apple chat. The other appearances are closed-door. Dinner plans have yet to be settled, but I suspect that's your better bet. Contact me directly for details (if you haven't already). </p>

		<p>I guess one reason some people may have been hesitant to go and meet Raymond is that he comes across as this intolerant and slightly arrogant programming guru on his blog. I am sure he&#8217;s a nice guy in real life, but people often assume that a guy behaves in real life as he does on his blog.</p>
<p>It happened to me quite a few times. People see me being highly vocal on forums and blogs and think I talk a lot in real life. They are always puzzled to find that I am a very quiet type &#8211; and rarely open my mouth when there&#8217;s a social conversation going on :-)</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  &gt; intolerant and arrogant ?
</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know how to put this correctly, but I think that people can feel that way about someone who is just being rational. You see, in software there are few opportunities for personal preference. Solution A is either better or worse than Solution B. And some people feel offended if they propose the bad solution, and another person has the better solution. But when you talk about software, you talk about the code, not the person. Not everyone can handle that kind of conversation.</p>

		<p>Do yourselves a favor. &nbsp;He is actually really nice. &nbsp;He smiles a lot, likes to joke, and is very relaxed and amiable.</p>
<p>Over email, he is terse, but I think the reason for that is that his email output (and probably other forums like it) is so vast. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And I suspect he gets tired of people who call themselves professional software developers but can&#8217;t even be bothered to do minimal investigation (e.g. What did GetLastError() return? &nbsp;Or what did google say?) when they run up against a problem.</p>
<p>I am with him there&#8230;</p>

		<p>You have plenty of fans around Palo Alto. &nbsp;The problem is, they all work at companies who are direct competitors with Microsoft, and going to hang out and talk shop with their leading Win32 guru may be a cause for concern for the higher ups.</p>

		<p>First, I&#8217;ve met Raymond, and even eaten and drank with him. Raymond rules!</p>
<p>You will be a better person for having met him. Members of the opposite sex will find you attractive (or the same sex, if that&#8217;s your preference). People will start taking you more seriously at executive presentations (&quot;You know Raymond Chen?!!!&quot;). You might learn to knit, or speak Swedish. Intelligence can be so contagious with Raymond.</p>
<p>All I can say is, go meet him. Also Raymond &#8212; looks like you got a world tour going, so milk it baby.</p>

		<p>Sorry to hear no one took you up on your offer but, as a wise man once said, &quot;You didn&#8217;t get a response because your previous message was poorly-phrased, or it was sent to the wrong group, or nobody recognized the question as something they could help with, or any of a number of possible reasons. Re-sending it is not going to fix that.&quot; =)</p>
<p>Seriously, I&#8217;d love to meet you and perhaps even get my copy of The Old New Thing signed, but I don&#8217;t work for Apple, Microsoft, or Google so I don&#8217;t see how than can happen.</p>
<p>Hence no response.</p>
<p>Have a great trip!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
