A customer asked a question,
but as is often the case,
the question was much more telling than the answer.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
We have an Internet Explorer plug-in which calls
<code>Exit&shy;Process</code>
to force Internet Explorer to exit.
We found that when we do this, our plug-in does not receive a
<code>DLL_<wbr>PROCESS_<wbr>DETACH</code> notification.
What could be preventing our plug-in from receiving the
<code>DLL_<wbr>PROCESS_<wbr>DETACH</code> notification?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As we saw some time ago when we looked at
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/05/03/2383346.aspx">
the way processes shut down</a>
(plus
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/01/22/9951750.aspx">
an important follow-up</a>
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/10/07/10221348.aspx">
or two</a>),
all a process has to do to thwart proper delivery of
<code>DLL_<wbr>PROCESS_<wbr>DETACH</code> notifications is to do something
untoward during shutdown, at which point the kernel
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/06/8461730.aspx">
just gives up and calls <code>Terminate&shy;Process</code></a>.
</p>
<p>
But like I said, the answer is much less interesting than the question.
What if the user had an unsaved email message at the time you decided
to exit Internet Explorer?
Recall that
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/12/02/9931183.aspx">
plug-ins are a guest in the host process; don't go changing the carpet</a>.
When we asked the customer why they were exiting Internet Explorer from
their plug-in, we received the explanation,
"The reason I am calling <code>Exit&shy;Process</code>
is that I do not know another good way to exit Internet Explorer
from a plug-in."
</p>
<p>
In this case, the guest is doing far more than just changing
the carpet.
The guest called in a
<a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B0045HCJGC/?tag=tholneth-20">
demolition company</a>!
</p>
<p>
"Why did you call the demolition company to destroy my house?"<br>
"I couldn't think of a good way to destroy your house."
</p>
<p>
The point isn't that it's bad to use a telephone call to hire a demolition
company to destroy somebody's house and that you should use some other
method to contact them (like, say, a text message).
The point is that
<i>it's bad to destroy somebody else's house in the first place</i>.
</p>
<p>
Upon further investigation, the customer was writing a test
for their plug-in.
They open Internet Explorer and navigate to a page that uses
the plug-in.
When they are satisfied that the plug-in operated correctly,
they want to exit the copy of Internet Explorer in order to conclude
the test.
</p>
<p>
If you want to destroy a house, then destroy your own house.
Call
<code>Co&shy;Create&shy;Instance(<wbr>CLSID_<wbr>Internet&shy;Explorer)</code>
to build a house,
navigate to your test page with
<code>IWeb&shy;Browser2::<wbr>Navigate</code>,
and when you're done, you can destroy the house with
<code>IWeb&shy;Browser2::<wbr>Quit()</code>.
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa752127.aspx">
There is sample code to do exactly this in the documentation for
the <code>IWeb&shy;Browser2</code> interface</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
The <code>IWeb&shy;Browser2</code> interface is scriptable.
</p>
<pre>
var ie = new ActiveXObject("InternetExplorer.Application");
ie.Visible = true;
ie.Navigate("http://www.microsoft.com/");
WScript.Sleep(5000); // five seconds, say
ie.Quit();
</pre>

		<p>Ahh, IWebÂ­Browser2. &nbsp;Such an amazingly full and complete interface around a complex object. &nbsp;Very useful in so many instances. &nbsp;But so full of edge cases (depending in part on the version of IE installed) without viable workarounds or solutions that it&#39;s almost infeasible for real production applications.</p>
<p>Granted, it&#39;s much, much better now than it was about 4-5 years ago.</p>

		<p>@Timothy: Easy. You paste over the first few bytes of TerminateProcess with a jmp to a stub function that creates a new event and waits for it.*</p>
<p>Your plugin and the hosted webpage can communicate back to the host, so you don&#39;t necessarily have to wait an arbitrary five seconds. You can also do your tests and signal the host that you want to quit. (I&#39;m sure Raymond knows this, but I thought it was worth pointing out.)</p>
<p>* That was tongue in cheek. The only reasonable way I know to guard against foreign code calling TerminateProcess is to make sure it runs in a separate process.</p>

		<p>@Nick: it&#39;s like any interface: if it has behaviour you don&#39;t like, you have to identify and code around that. I&#39;ve written a wrapper later accordingly. Now I can use that layer to automate IE from script, with few if any nasty surprises!</p>

		<p>I was instantly reminded of the incident where a demolition crane operator was asked &quot;why did you just demolish #20?&quot; &quot;Because I have a work order here to demolish &#8230; uh &#8230; #21&#8230; whoops.&quot;</p>
<p>Then there was the computer equivalent, in which our servers+storage team tried to improve lousy mail server performance by installing a new mail server &#8230; which reformatted the chunk of SAN which held the entire Medical School&#39;s existing mail server. Apparently &quot;it&#39;s OK, we can reinstall from the tape backup from 3 days ago sometime tomorrow&quot; wasn&#39;t enough to get them off the hook, either.</p>
<p>The house analogy also reminded me of a phone call on TV from someone&#39;s houseguest, with running water in the background: &quot;uhh, where&#39;s the water shutoff valve in your house?&quot; In the vein of some of the &#39;local problem, global solution&#39; tales Raymond has shared, I can imagine a lot of these people using the main water shutoff to get their kids/siblings/guests out of the bathroom faster&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
