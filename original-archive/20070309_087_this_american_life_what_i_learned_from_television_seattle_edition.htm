<p>Ira Glass paid another visit to Seattle (here's <a href="http://www.kuow.org/programs/weekday.asp?Archive=03-07"> an appearance on local public radio station KUOW</a>), this time for a live taping of an episode of his radio show <a href="http://www.thisamericanlife.org/"><i>This American Life</i></a> titled "What I Learned From Television." He also took the opportunity to introduce another auditoriumful of people to the <a href="http://www.sho.com/site/thisamericanlife/"> same-named television program premiering March 22nd</a>. I myself was skeptical of the idea of transitioning <i>TAL</i> to television, but the clips we saw were absolutely gorgeous. Footage of people's shoes? Interviewing pre-teens in a field of waist-high grass? It sounds crazy, but it works and, more importantly, remains true to the spirit of the radio show. Storytelling at its finest.</p>
<p> After an introductory story (adorably animated) on the power of the television camera, even an imaginary one, the show proceeded with its three (four) acts. First, the sleepy-voiced <a href="http://www.barclayagency.com/rakoff.html"> David Rakoff</a> is given the task of watching 29 hours of television (not all at once). This may not sound like that difficult a task, but it's a real challenge for someone who stopped watching television decades ago, back when <i>Candid Camera</i> was what passed for reality television. Would he even understand <a href="http://www.mtv.com/ontv/dyn/sweet_16/series.jhtml"> <i>My Super Sweet 16</i></a>? </p>
<p> Second came Alexa Junge who told stories about life as a sitcom writer. Hers was the weakest of the three acts; hopefully she will improve with time. Besides, she was up against David Rakoff and... </p>
<p> ... <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dan_Savage">Dan Savage</a>. It needs to be one of the fundamental rules of show business: Never be the act that goes on stage after Dan Savage. Whereas Chicago lays claim to Ira Glass, Seattle has Dan Savage to call its own. He tells us that he fears that the Disney program <a href="http://psc.disney.go.com/disneychannel/suitelife/"> <i>The Suite Life of Zack &amp; Cody</i></a> is corrupting his eight-year-old son. And when he explains why, you sort of end up agreeing with him. Furthermore, since it's Dan Savage, you somehow take it in stride when the story manages to involve a policeman with no pants chained to a tree. </p>
<p> (What about the parenthesized fourth act? That's a for-the-live-audience-only fourth act wherein Ira Glass and Chris Wilcha talk about and show us clips from the television show. No moron he, Ira inserts the bonus act between Alexa Junge and Dan Savage.) </p>
<p> One thing that stood out, at least to me, is how much more aware of the mechanics of radio taping Ira is. When he flubs a line, he just backs up to the start of the sentence and says it again, knowing that the flub can be removed in the editing room. The other guests didn't know this (or forgot in their nervousness), and when they got stuck on a word, they struggled with it instead of just starting over. Dan Savage was called back to record a <i>pick-up</i>; this is radio and film jargon for going back and recording new dialog/shooting new footage to be inserted into what was already taped. In Dan's case, he had to mentally rewind to the middle of his story and explain to the radio audience what "just happened" on stage. </p>
<p> As Ira read the credits, David Rakoff walked quietly up to the microphone, and as soon as I heard, "WBEZ management oversight..." I knew what was going to happen. What was funny was that David repeated the line live. On the studio version of the show, they just re-run the tape from earlier in the show, but in a live show, there is no time to cue up the tape. David had to re-create his line and make it sound as if it was an insert. </p>
<p> Here are reports from the <a href="http://moonlightambulette.blogspot.com/2007/02/this-american-strife.html"> New York show</a> (<a href="http://www.skankyourart.com/2007/02/this-american-life-on-tour-and-on.html">and another</a>), the <a href="http://whokilledthemixtape.blogspot.com/2007/02/this-is-what-its-like-this-is-what-its.html"> Boston show</a>, and the <a href="http://emohawk.blogspot.com/2007/02/this-american-lifelive.html"> Minneapolis show</a>. The live performances of "What I Learned From Television" will be edited together and aired on the March&nbsp;17 episode of <i>TAL</i>. Who knows how much of the Seattle version will make the final cut. </p>
<p> I believe Ira and crew are in Los Angeles next week. If you have tickets, here's my advice to you: <i>Buy your kite before the show</i>. Ira will show off various fundraising items on stage, and the line at the table after the show will be <i>insane</i>. Do yourself a favor and buy the kite when there is no line. I wish somebody had told me this. </p>

		<p>I agree that Alexa Junge was the weak link, and also that the line &#8212; more like &quot;mob&quot; &#8212; around the concession table was indeed insane. &nbsp;If someone had yelled &quot;Fire!&quot; just after the show ended, we&#8217;d all have suffocated.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;ll be interesting to hear which &quot;WBZE management oversight by&#8230;&quot; line makes the cut for the radio show. In Chicago, where I saw the live TAL show last Thursday, Sarah Vowell delivered a line (much like you describe) from her reading.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m waiting with eager anticipation for the television show. It looks <em>so</em> <em>damned</em> <em>good</em>. Once I saw &quot;the desk&quot;, I was sold.</p>

		<p>With Dan Savage ? What&#8217;s next, invite Anne Coulter on ? Scraping the bottom of the barrel, it would seem, for the entertainment value. Heck, the show bored me to pieces and was thankfully quickly dropped from our local NPR affiliate. (Unsure if it&#8217;ll air video on PBS now..)</p>
<p>At least &#8220;Wait Wait&#8221; gets a supreme court justice for a guest.</p>

		<p>Somebody told me that she heard that watching My Super Sweet 16 was like watching a trainwreck; you can tell it&#8217;s going to be a horrible disaster well before it happens, but it cannot be stopped and you just can&#8217;t turn away.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
