<p>The <code>WM_SETFONT</code> message tells a control which font you would like the control to use for its text. This message is a convention, not a rule. For example, our <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx"> scratch program</a> doesn't pay attention to the <code>WM_SETFONT</code> message. If somebody sends it a <code>WM_SETFONT</code>, nothing happens. The scratch program just ignores the caller and uses whatever font it wants.</p>
<p> Although supporting the <code>WM_SETFONT</code> message is optional, if you do choose to support it, you would be well-served to adhere to the following convention: The <code>WM_SETFONT</code> message does not alter font ownership. In other words, whoever was responsible for destroying the font before the <code>WM_SETFONT</code> message is sent is still responsible for destroying it after the message is sent. </p>
<p> Corollary: If you tell somebody to use a specific font, don't destroy the font while they're still using it, because they're counting on you to keep the font valid. </p>
<p> Example: The dialog manager creates the dialog box font and sends the <code>WM_SETFONT</code> message to each control to tell it what font it should use. The dialog manager keeps the font valid until the dialog box is destroyed, at which point the font is destroyed as well. </p>
<p> But what font does a control use before it receives a <code>WM_SETFONT</code> message? Whatever font it wants. Some controls have particular ideas about the font they will use by default; the list view, for example, uses the icon label font. In those cases, it is the control's responsibility to destroy that default font when the control is destroyed. This is true even if the parent window creates another font and sends a <code>WM_SETFONT</code> to change to that font. There are now two fonts involved: the original default font (which is the control's responsibility to destroy) and the font set by <code>WM_SETFONT</code> (which is the parent's responsibility to destroy). </p>
<p> Now this may all sound complicated, but remember the basic rule: The <code>WM_SETFONT</code> message does not change who is responsible for destroying a font. Let's look at that scenario again, but take out the <code>WM_SETFONT</code> message. (I've crossed it out below.) A control creates a default font. The parent window creates another font. <strike>The parent window sends the <code>WM_SETFONT</code> message to the control.</strike> </p>
<p> Now, without that crossed-out sentence, the ownership rules are crystal clear. The control is responsible for destroying the default font it created, and the parent is responsible for destroying its own font. </p>
<p> The same principle applies to the <code>WM_GETFONT</code> message. You can send <code>WM_SETFONT</code> and <code>WM_GETFONT</code> messages all day long; it has no effect on who is responsible for destroying the font at the end of the day. </p>

		<p>This is the most boring post I have ever read from this site. But, I will keep what it says in mind the next time I fondle the hand massage. &nbsp;I mean, handle the font message!! &nbsp;</p>

		<p>This sound like an excellent example for your hypothetical &#8216;What would happen in the reverse case?&#8217; scenarios.</p>
<p>If the parent was sharing a font between many children and the control decided to delete it when it was destroyed the result would be UI mayhem!</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
