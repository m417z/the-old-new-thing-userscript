<p>This morning I saw a screening of <a href="http://www.wordplaythemovie.com/"><i>Wordplay</i></a>, a documentary on crossword puzzles featuring <a href="http://www.crosswordtournament.com/articles/ct0398.htm"> Will Shortz</a>. If you're a crossword puzzler, this movie is a must-see. In addition to Will, there are plenty of other rock stars of the crossword puzzle subculture who play major roles: <a href="http://www.crosswordtournament.com/1997/art01.html"> Merl Reagle</a>, <a href="http://www.crosswordtournament.com/2004/photos/christensen/0026.htm"> Trip Payne</a>, and <a href="http://ennienyc.livejournal.com/">Ellen Ripstein</a>. (I was particularly amused by <a href="http://ennienyc.livejournal.com/87210.html"> this entry</a>. Hey, if you're not going to appreciate Ellen Ripstein's autograph, give it to somebody who will!)</p>
<p> The audience loved this movie, laughing so hard in places that it drowned out the dialogue. (And gasping in horror when... well, you'll have to watch the movie to find out.) Crowd-pleasing one-liners (paraphrased): </p>
<ul>
<li>Getting Merl Reagle to compose a Tuesday puzzle     is like getting Barry Bonds to play on your Little League team.     &mdash;&nbsp;Daniel Okrent reacts to seeing Merl Reagle's     byline on a Tuesday puzzle.     (Monday puzzles are easiest, with the difficulty increasing     as the week progresses.) </li>
<li>I had a boyfriend who would put me down, but I would just     come back with, "Oh yeah? And what are <i>you</i> the best     in America at?"     &mdash;&nbsp;Ellen Ripstein, 2001 American Crossword Puzzle     Tournament champion. </li>
<li>"I hate, hate, hate, hate, hate you. Sincerely..."     &mdash;&nbsp;Will Shortz reads a letter from a frustrated     puzzle solver. </li>
</ul>
<p> As a recovering crossword-aholic myself, I found myself using the on-screen clues to race against Al Sanders as he himself raced the clock to solve a New York Times crossword. Although I'm no crossword slouch, I'm no match for Al Sanders. </p>
<p> Wholeheartedly recommended. </p>

		<p>For those who enjoy crosswords enough to do 5-10 per day, I recommend trying the Crossword Tournament hosted by Will Shortz (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.crosswordtournament.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.crosswordtournament.com</a>). If you only do 1 or 2 per day, it may still be fun, but don&#8217;t kid yourself &#8212; you&#8217;ll probably not make it into the top 300.</p>
<p>The joke about Ellen Ripstein is that she&#8217;s known as the Susan Lucci of crossword puzzles. Susan Lucci is a soap opera star who had been nominated for an Emmy award something like 18 years in a row before winning. Ellen finished in the top 5 at the tournament every year since 1983. When Susan finally won an Emmy in 1999 we knew Ellen was due for a win, and she came through in 2001.</p>
<p>And for the record, I would have to say Merl Reagle is my favorite crossword constructor.</p>

		<p>Will Shortz is a pale imitation of Eugene. T. Maleska, unfit to sharpen his pencil.</p>
<div CLASS=post>[<i>To<br />
each his own. Many years ago, I got a book of Maleska crosswords and<br />
hated them. Governor of Alaska in 1960? Opera singers from the 1900&#8217;s?<br />
Booooooring! It was the Shortz school that made crossword puzzles fun<br />
again. Merl Reagle discusses this <a href="http://siff.hollywoodreviews.com/interviews/merl_reagle_on_wordplay_and_cr.phtml" rel="nofollow">in this interview</a>: &#8220;There are two kinds of solvers in the country: People who solve crosswords as a <u>test</u> and people who solve crosswords as a <u>game</u>.<br />
Now, the people who solve crosswords as a test like the<br />
vocabulary-building ones. &#8230; Unfortunately, they can&#8217;t solve the<br />
&#8216;tricky&#8217; ones. The people who solve crosswords as a game can solve the<br />
ones that are a test, they just don&#8217;t like them.&#8221; Thanks to Ellen<br />

		<p>I agree wholeheartedly with Raymond&#8217;s response to RevMike. &nbsp;I love puzzles of the Will Shortz era. &nbsp;In college, in the early 80&#8217;s, I used to refer to Eugene. T. Maleska as &quot;the most hated man on the Eastern seaboard,&quot; &nbsp;I was so frustrated, I thought everyone must have felt the same way.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
