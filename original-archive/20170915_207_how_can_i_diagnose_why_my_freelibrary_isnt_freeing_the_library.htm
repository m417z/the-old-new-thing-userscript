<p>
A customer had some code that called
<code>Free&shy;Library</code>,
and they expected the library to be freed,
but it wasn't happening.
They suspect that there was an unmatched
call to <code>Load&shy;Library</code>
and was wondering if there were any diagnostic
tools that would help them find it.
</p>
<p>
Application Verifier to the rescue.
</p>
<p>
Application Verifier maintains a history of module loads
and unloads,
and you can use
<a HREF="https://docs.microsoft.com/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/-avrf">
the
<code>!avrf -dlls</code></a>
debugger extension to view that log.
For each module that is loaded and unloaded,
it records a stack trace of the <code>Load&shy;Library</code>
and
<code>Free&shy;Library</code>.
</p>
<p>
The customer reported back that this debugger extension
found the problem.
Their code used the
<code>HKEY_</code><code>PERFORMANCE_</code><code>DATA</code>
registry key to read some performance counters,
and opening the performance counter
was triggering an additional DLL load.</p>

		<p>Two stories in a row where the customer came back and followed up the case with a &#8220;we found the problem&#8221;. Most times, Raymond, you will say &#8220;we never heard back from the customer&#8221; in response to a comment asking about it.</p>
<p>Is it more typical to hear back from the customer or not?</p>

		<p>Usually we don&#8217;t hear back. I&#8217;m giving the benefit of the doubt and assuming that the follow-up was filtered out by the customer liaison (don&#8217;t need to bother the product team) rather than because the customer never followed up.</p>

		<p>&#8220;opening the performance counter was triggering an additional DLL load&#8221; sounds like an OS bug but I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s Raymond&#8217;s intention.</p>

		<p>Um, no, that&#8217;s the design. You open a performance counter. The system needs to load the DLL that provides the performance counter. Otherwise where will it get the performance counter from? Just make up values at random?</p>

		<p>Joking: Just load the MissingPerfCounterShim that always returns -1 (e.g. off-scale low or counter missing)</p>

		<p>But that doesn&#8217;t explain why they particularly needed the library to be freed at that time in the first place&#8230;</p>

		<p>They didn&#8217;t <u>need</u> it to be freed, but they were <u>expecting</u> it to be freed since they couldn&#8217;t think of a reason why it should still be loaded. But now they understand that their expectations were incorrect.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
