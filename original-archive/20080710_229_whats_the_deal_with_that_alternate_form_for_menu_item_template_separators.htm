We saw last time</a>
that you can specify a separator in a menu item template
by specifying zero for everything,
even though technically you're supposed to pass
<code>MFT_SEPARATOR</code> for the flags.
What's the deal with that alternate
form for menu item template separators?
</p>
<p>
This goes back to the early days of the
<code>InsertMenu</code> function
(and its friends like
<code>AppendMenu</code> and <code>ModifyMenu</code>).
<a HREF="http://memory-alpha.org/en/wiki/Miri_(episode)">
In the Before Time</a>,
the way you specified a separator was to add a null pointer.
Not a null string (a string with no characters, consisting only
of the null terminator),
but an actual null pointer.
</p>
<pre>
AppendMenu(hmenu, MF_STRING, 0, NULL);
</pre>
<p>
The recommended way of adding a separator is, of course,
to use <code>MF_SEPARATOR</code>,
but this old-fashioned method is still supported for
backward compatibility.
The alternate form of the menu item template for separators
is just a throwback to the days when this "old style" of
adding a separator was in fact the only style.</p>

		<p>Thanks for the insight in Windows history.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m looking for a way to draw a bitmap on the side of a menu, like classic menu start. But although I found some source code, it used MFC. Also I didn&#8217;t see any mention of an rtl mode. Should the bitmap be drawn on the right side in rtl mode? Does anyone have any hints/clues/pointers on how to do this in plain win32/win64?</p>

		<p>Interestingly enough, I was working on a program 2 months ago that had both the NULL pointer and that MF_SEPARATOR in use in different areas of the program.</p>
<p>This comes as no surprise as I was probably the 4th or 5th person over the past 8 years hired on a contract basis to modify this program for its owner.</p>

		<p>Wasn&#8217;t there something where a single minus character (&quot;-&quot;) was also treated as a separator? &nbsp;Or was that purely a resource designer translation? &nbsp;Or am I just getting confused?</p>

		<p>IIRC the resource designer automatically sets the MF_SEPARATOR flag when you enter &quot;-&quot; as caption.</p>
<p>There are other GUI libraries (e.g., Borland&#8217;s VCL) that do not want to bother the poor programmer with menu flags at all, and where using &quot;-&quot; as caption is the only way to get a separator.</p>

		<p>The Wine menu code takes care of the null string ptr resulting in MF_SEPARATOR, but doesn&#8217;t do the same for &quot;-&quot;, so (assuming Wine is an accurate re-implementation) I guess as &quot;some body&quot; said, either the resource editor does the mapping, or you&#8217;re using a custom menu control that does&#8217;t come from user32.</p>
<p>Wine code here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://source.winehq.org/source/dlls/user32/menu.c#L1995" rel="nofollow">http://source.winehq.org/source/dlls/user32/menu.c#L1995</a></p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
