<p>If you happen to catch me, say by stopping by my office if you happen to work at Microsoft, I'd be happy to sign your copy of my book. (There's no need to set up a formal <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/01/23/1514672.aspx#1515867"> book signing appearance in building&nbsp;9</a>; just stop by my office any time.) One of the things you don't realize <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/01/24/359498.aspx"> as a fan waiting in line at a book signing</a> is that when you get to the front of the line, you have to tell the author what to write.</p>
<p> It's obvious once you think about it. The author doesn't know anything about you. You're just one person out of hundreds they're going to sign for today. How should they know what to write? </p>
<p> So don't make <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2007/01/06/1420754.aspx"> the same mistake Michael Kaplan did</a>. (I'm just teasing, Michael!) When you stop by to ask me to sign your copy of the book, give me some idea what you want me to write. I'm happy to do it, but you have to give me something to work with. </p>
<p> In other book news: The publishers are working on getting the bonus chapters onto <a href="http://www.awprofessional.com/title/0321440307"> the book web site</a>. Your patience is appreciated. And I'm seeing book reviews coming from all over, like <a href="http://hostit1.connectria.com/twduff/home.nsf/d6plinks/TDUF-6XEL8Z"> this one from Tom Duff</a> (who even posted the review to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321440307?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tholneth-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321440307"> the book's Amazon page</a>), and <a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/stratdev/archives/2007/01/the_old_new_thi.html"> a surprise one from Martin Heller</a>. (The surprise that Martin Heller wrote a review of my book at all, not that the review is full of surprises. I don't know if that makes sense.) </p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Puckdropper, could you tell us why you wish to work at Microsoft?&quot;</p>
<p>Raymond Chen works here. &nbsp;I&#8217;d like to be able to stop by his office and get my book signed.</p>
<p>&quot;Oh, and since you&#8217;re already here why can&#8217;t you do that now?&quot;</p>
<p>He&#8217;ll probably accuse me of not reading the full text of his blog before commenting/taking action.</p>
<p>&quot;I appreciate the honesty, what position were you looking at again?&quot;</p>
<p>Well, you know a temporary position would be great. &nbsp;You know, long enough to speak with Raymond and convince him I&#8217;m a real employee so he&#8217;ll sign my book.</p>
<p>(Just a note: &nbsp;I&#8217;m only quoting the part that inspired such a silly interview in the first place. &nbsp;I wouldn&#8217;t actually do this.)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve seen dozens, perhaps hundreds, of authors sign books while managing a couple very large book stores. &nbsp;Usually the author just signs his name, unless the person handing him the book speaks up in time, haha. &nbsp;Biggest signings: Tom Landry &amp; Anne Rice (on different occasions).</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think you have quite grasped the nature of the implicit contract between author and book owner when it comes to book signings. By signing the book you are personalizing that book for the owner, if you require the owner to tell you what to write you have quite considerably diluted that personalization.</p>

		<p>Yep &#8211; I&#8217;m with Andrew, and the others who use humour to make the same point. Sure, a fan can ask for a name for the dedication (&quot;for Trudy&quot;) but anything more is putting words into your mouth (&quot;for my good friend Trudy&quot; if they&#8217;re a stranger, &quot;thank you for buying&quot; if you are not thankful).</p>
<p>They can&#8217;t ask you to misrepresent yourself. They can *suggest*, but as Andrew points out, even that dilutes it. The very idea of suggesting to an author what to write in their book is anathema, unless you actually ASK them to edit it&#8230;</p>
<p>If someone signed a book and put an in-joke quip that you suggested, that&#8217;s them recording your humour for you. They may as well get their secretary to do it and get you to sign it.</p>
<p>Most authors just ask &quot;who should I make it out to?&quot; Some don&#8217;t even do that (it makes for trouble if you get the name wrong). From that they either write boilerplate (a thanks for buying, one of a short list of jokes relevant to the book they sign, or just &quot;For [recipient]. [author]&quot;), or they ad-lib.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
