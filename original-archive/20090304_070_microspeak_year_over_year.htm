<p> In economics, the attributive adjective <i>year-over-year</i> means <i>compared to the same time last year</i>. Examples: "Year-over-year sales show a marked improvement." "Expenses continue to fall year over year." (The hyphens disappear when the adjective is used predicatively.) </p>
<p> I have only one citation, but it appears that the term has broadened its meaning inside Microsoft and is now merely a synonym for <i>annual</i> or <i>year after year</i>. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> We hold decision-makers accountable year over year for carrying out their plan. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> There is no obvious <i>compared to the same time last year</i> going on here. It's not like you are 15% more accountable this year than you were last year. Rather, the sentence merely says that reviewing how well the decision-makers are carrying out the plan takes place every year. (It may not be clear from the sentence above that that's what the sentence means, but it's clearer in the context of the entire document from which the sentence was extracted.) </p>

		<p>Sometimes, I want to be a CEO just so I can put policies in place that forbid this kind of misuse of phrases.</p>
<p>Or should I say, I continue to on-look my growth potential to leverage my language plan for employee verbiage redundancy scenarios.</p>

		<p>Microsoft have recently pushed out an update for &quot;inbox printer drivers&quot;:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;961118&amp;sd=rss&amp;spid=3198" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/default.aspx?scid=kb;en-us;961118&#038;sd=rss&#038;spid=3198</a></p>
<p>Which confused me no end. &nbsp;Is that a print queue implemented as a mail account? &nbsp;Or a printer driver that prints to a document and emails it somewhere? &nbsp;Or what?</p>
<p>I eventually realised they meant &quot;in-box printer drivers&quot;, i.e. those that ship with Windows.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if this is Microspeak or idiocy.</p>

		<p>I saw that &quot;inbox printer drivers&quot; update today and was also confused by it. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not quite the same, but it reminded me of &quot;crunchies&quot;: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Does-Not-Compute-Crunchies,-Virtual-Returns,--More.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://thedailywtf.com/Articles/Does-Not-Compute-Crunchies,-Virtual-Returns,&#8211;More.aspx</a></p>

		<p>In-box vs inbox looks like a result of over-eager proofreading drones at Microsoft. I mean, those guys, who un-abbreviate all trivial abbreviations, following some rigid set of rules. Such as explaining what TCP/IP is.</p>

		<p>I think I must be fed up with the Labour party here in the UK (democrats). I thought that use of this idiom was a left wing statement of political affiliation.</p>

		<p>Or, the word &quot;annually&quot; comes to mind for things done year after year&#8230;</p>
<p>And that inbox printer driver thing&#8230; ugh. What&#8217;s wrong with &quot;shipped printer drivers&quot; or &quot;included printer drivers&quot;?</p>

		<p>Do you want to impress or confuse clients or Vice versa?&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;use Techno vocabulary.. It can be called the &quot;Buzzword&quot; writing method. It is simple. There are three columns of words involved, as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Balanced &nbsp;0. Management &nbsp; &nbsp;0. contingency</li>
<li>
<p>total &nbsp; &nbsp; 1. Organization &nbsp;1.Hardware(or SW)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>integrated 2. reciprocal &nbsp; 2. projection</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>compatible 3. monitored &nbsp; &nbsp;3. time-frame</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>synchronized &nbsp;4. digital &nbsp; 4. concept</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>optimal &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 5. modular &nbsp; 5. programming</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>responsive &nbsp; &nbsp;6. transitional &nbsp; 6. mobility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>functional &nbsp; &nbsp;7. Incremental &nbsp; 7. capability</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>parallel &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8. third-gen &nbsp; 8. flexibility</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>systemized &nbsp; &nbsp;9. policy &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;9. options</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Just select any three-digit number; then use the corresponding Buzzwords from the above grid, e.g., 257: &quot;integrated modular capability&quot;. Don&#8217;t worry if it doesn&#8217;t make sense to you; it won&#8217;t mean anything to anyone else either, but they&#8217;ll think you&#8217;re just smarter than they are so they won&#8217;t say anything!! ..</p>
<p>You can propose &quot;systemized reciprocal options&quot; (929) to achieve &quot;optimal transitional flexibility&quot; (568), so that we can think of an &quot;integrated monitored projection&quot; &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;..and your boss will probably promote you or your customer will be blown away with your technological superiority !</p>

		<p>&quot;year-over-year&quot;: so how does that differ from &quot;year-on-year&quot;?</p>
<p>&quot;inbox printer driver&quot;: If it hadn&#8217;t been for laonianren&#8217;s comment (above) I&#8217;d still be thinking that this was some kind of bizarre model-name. So how can any driver be &quot;inbox&quot; after you hava had an OOBE? Surely everything &quot;inbox&quot; is still uninstalled and discarded when all the rest is &quot;out-of-the-box&quot;? We used to have a perfectly good word for Out-Of-The-Box-Experience: we used the word &quot;install&quot;.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, I&#8217;d like to meet the guy who coined OOBE. What was he smoking at the time that phrase/acronym was invented? (Full-disclosure: it might not be a happy meeting &#8212; see the first comment.)</p>
<p>All this reminds me of the most devastating critique of a book I ever read, which went something like: &quot;She&#8217;s a sociologist, so she never uses two words when she can make do with five.&quot;</p>

		<p>The first thing I thought of was how my XP shipped with a driver for damn near everything common.</p>
<p>That really is what is important. People like it when their stuff works and they don&#8217;t like it when their stuff doesn&#8217;t work.</p>

<p>Maybe I&#8217;m granting wit where none existed, but I always assumed that the initialism was meant to be somewhat tongue in cheek, at least by its originator, if not necessarily by the hoi-polloi.</p>
<p>Before the Out-Of-Box Experience, there was the Out-Of-Body Experience, occasionally abbreviated to OOBE.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s entirely irrelevant that OOBE is sometimes correlated with a near-death experience.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
