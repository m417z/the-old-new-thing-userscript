There are two popular
ways of measuring how widespread a problem is:
You can look at
the number of times the problem occurs,
and you can look at the number of users
it happens to.
</p>
<p>
Back in the late 1990's, I remember a presentation from a
product team on things they learned from their telemetry.
One of the most important things gathered from telemetry
was deciding which bugs were most important to fix.
(<a HREF="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.10.windowsconfidential.aspx">Related reading</a>.)
</p>
<p>
The presenter displayed a chart of the most frequent
failures,
and for the purpose of discussion focused
on one of them.
The failures were plotted on a distribution curve,
where the height of the curve showed the number of times
an individual computer encountered it.
And although the total number of failures was high,
the distribution curve revealed that pretty much all
of the failures were coming from a single computer.
The problem wasn't so much that the feature wasn't working
for a lot of people;
rather, the feature was working great for everybody,
except this one poor guy where the feature never worked at all.
</p>
<p>
Why wasn't the feature working for that guy?
Who knows.
Maybe his hard drive is corrupted.
Maybe he has a computer virus.
But whatever is wrong,
it's affecting just one person.
(And since telemetry is gathered anonymously,
we have no way of contacting him to find out.
This was before we had a way of
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/12/407562.aspx">
asking people to leave their phone number so we
could call them back with further questions</a>.)
</p>
<p>
In a similar way,
one user complaining 10,000 times is worth far less
than 10,000 users complaining once each.
(And psychologically, one user complaining 10,000 times
is actually worth less than one user complaining once,
because one user who complains 10,000 times starts
to sound like a crackpot.)
And a corporation with 10,000 employees can say
"This affects all of my 10,000 users,"
and they effectively cast 10,000 votes.
</p>
<p>
But you have to be careful you don't give too much
weight to the corporations who can cast 10,000 votes
at once.
</p>
<p>
Windows&nbsp;95 came with an email client
known as Windows Messaging.
That was the thing that ran if you double-clicked
the Inbox icon on your desktop.
This component was developed by the Exchange team,
and sometimes I would send them feedback saying
"When I use your program to read my MSN mail,
XYZ happens,
but that doesn't really make
sense for MSN."
And the Exchange folks dismissed the feedback
by saying,
"But Australian Telecom loves it!"
</p>
<p>
Apparently,
Australian Telecom
(now known as Telestra)
was a large
install base for Windows Messaging,
with tens of thousands of employees.
That meant that when they had
some feedback, it carried the weight of 10,000 users.
</p>
<p>
I didn't have the heart to tell them,
"That's so cute.
You know who your largest customer will be once Windows&nbsp;95 ships?
MSN, with 250,000 users."</p>

		<p>Its name at the time was also &#8220;Telecom Australia&#8221;, hence Telstra (The name makes much more sense in that context).</p>
<p>If Telstra managed to amass so many votes, I wonder what another Australian government department, who we were told used to proclaim they had the largest WAN in the southern hemisphere for a while (May still be true; it&#8217;s huge), what they managed to get changed.</p>

		<p>I was actually there at the dawn of the third age of mankind, but I merely used Eudora with the email account supplied by my ISP, not MSN or similar services. Later I switched to Outlook Express.</p>
<p>(I also remember installing Windows 95 on my 386 just in time to catch GoldenEye in a movie theater.)</p>

		<p>I also used Eudora with my ISP&#8217;s mail account.<br />
After I helped the ISP debug the problem they were having with the Win95 sockets layer. All of their other users were using Trumpet Winsock, because Win95 was still in beta and I was the only subscriber they had who was crazy enough to use it.<br />
But even I wasn&#8217;t crazy enough to use it on a 386. I had a 486SX.</p>

		<p>Sure, but that was before I used a computer for anything serious, so it wasn&#8217;t like I had to make a cost-benefit analysis. I only had a 386, and it was Windows 95 of all things, with the fancy new desktop and whatnot, so&#8230; But yes, I do remember it being slowish.</p>
<p>(A couple of years earlier, I&#8217;d also upgraded from MS-DOS 3.3 to 5.0 on my IBM PC XT clone running at 4.77 MHz with 512 KB of RAM; was also advised that such an upgrade didn&#8217;t make much sense, but it was DOS 5.0 and it did work without any issues that I can recall.)</p>

		<p>The joke here is that the 486SX was the downmarket, pin-compatible version of the 486, with almost no redeeming qualities whatsoever. And because it was pin-compatible, it only had a 24-bit address bus, so system memory maxed out at 16 MB. It may as well have been a 386.</p>

		<p>And I screwed up the punchline. The machine I first used Win95 on was a Cyrix 486SLC, not a 486SX. The SX was actually more or less usable.</p>

		<p>If we&#8217;re talking about the same thing, Windows 95 actually came with something called &#8220;Exchange&#8221; (I think named InfoCenter in Beta) which was a combined Email, fax, and CompuServe client. IE 4 (I think) introduced Internet Mail (and News) which evolved into Outlook Express, Windows Mail, and Windows Live Mail. I don&#8217;t remember whether Exchange and MSIMN ever coexisted.</p>

		<p>And by the time I was able to run that messenger app it was crashware (yes literally it destabilized the machine it was running on). Putting back the version from the Install CD would fix the machine but break messenger (protocol change?). We finally ended up with this procedure that would block the component from reinstalling itself (*not* like the Windows 10 allegations &#8212; we&#8217;re pretty sure it was merely the artifact of updates set to auto-approve simply not comprehending we&#8217;re repeatedly uninstalling this one).</p>

		<p>&gt;In a similar way, one user complaining 10,000 times is worth far less than 10,000 users complaining once each</p>
<p>It can depend on who the user is. Some special snowflakes have the ear of important people and you can get sucked into working round what ever the problem is on their windows install (which can&#8217;t be rebuilt or blamed) just so that they disappear.</p>
<p>A lot of problems only appear when you reach a critical mass of users. I&#8217;ve seen it happen so many times and you can usually predict the carnage when someone goes from a really small test rollout to instantly rolling out to all users.</p>

		<p>It was Telecom Australia. My first employer and I and a hundred other people were employed by them when they were 5 days old (5th July 1976). The Post Master General department was broken up and made companies &#8211; the Australian Telecommunications Commission trading as Telecom Australian and a sister organisation trading as Australia Post.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
