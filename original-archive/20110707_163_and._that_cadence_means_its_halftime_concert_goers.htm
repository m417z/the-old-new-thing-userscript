<p>In college, one of my classmates (who is now the conductor of an orchestra, so I guess that whole music thing worked out for him) coined the term <i>halftime</i> to refer to a resounding cadence in the first half of a piece, the type of cadence that might fool an inattentive or unseasoned listener into thinking that the piece is over, when in fact it's just getting started. We're not talking about a false ending, which is comparatively easy to find, but rather a "big finish" when we're nowhere near the finish.</p>
<p> <i>Also sprach Zarathustra</i> has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KxDio1m1C9s#t=8m10"> big halftime cadence</a>, complete with a reprise of the opening fanfare, at the end of <i>Der Genesende</i>. This was the piece that inspired the coinage of the term. </p>
<p> <i>Rhapsody on a Theme by Paganini</i> has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9Z-HCq5EeU#t=6m30s"> quiet halftime cadence</a> (echoing a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z9Z-HCq5EeU#t=6m05s"> big <i>Dies Irae</i> just a few seconds earier)</a> in variation XX. </p>
<p> Schubert's <i>Trout Quintet</i> has a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cZDsQVsEmEg#t=3m"> halftime cadence in the precise center of the final movement</a>. Warning listeners about it <a href="http://www.talkclassical.com/8641-fun-ironic-endings-cadenzas.html#post92652"> doesn't help</a>. </p>
<p> The first movement of <i>Mahler's Second Symphony</i> has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d6idPaGqvV8#t=15m35s"> a massive halftime cadence</a>. (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvWQeLep7QE#t=8m20s">Super sideburns version</a>.) The piece closed Gerard Schwarz's final concert (for nitpickers: Schwarz's final regular-season concert as music director of the Seattle Symphony), and when the halftime cadence was reached, I heard scattered applause through the hall. Which told me a few things. </p>
<ul>
<li>The people who attended that concert were not     regular concert-goers.     Another cue was that people were far more nattily-dressed     than your average Seattle Symphony crowd,     and we were in the third tier!     (Now, I don't normally sit in the third tier,     so who knows, maybe the third-tier crowd is the dress-up crowd.) </li>
<li>The people who applauded under the mistaken impression that     the piece was over were in for a big disappointment,     since there was another hour to go! </li>
</ul>
<p> Can you come up with other examples of <i>halftime</i>? </p>

		<p>Haydn&#39;s farewell symphony has a major head-fake in the first movement. It builds to the point of, &quot;We are expecting the conclusion to start any second now&quot; only to have an interlude (in Eb?) which comes out of no-where before the recapitulation. After a minute or so, it returns to where the Duke must have expected it to go.</p>
<p>Interesting fact &#8212; if you remove that section, the piece fits into the golden ratio. It is a brilliant way to say, &quot;We&#39;ve been here too long&quot;&#8230;</p>

		<p>The Paganini is an interesting case because the piece itself has a 3-part structure reminiscent of a piano concerto, but it is through-composed. So the &quot;halftime cadence&quot; you mention (at the end of variation 10) could be considered to come at the end of the &quot;first movement&quot;. &nbsp;What I think is funny is that the whole piece ends on a cadence that seems like a halftime cadence &#8212; there&#39;s a big orchestra buildup, but the actual ending is two quiet piano chords.</p>

		<p>@C. Allen-Poole: What do you mean, &quot;the piece fits into the golden ratio&quot;? &nbsp;The golden ratio is a geometric term for describing rectangles; what does that have to do with music, which is basically one-dimensional?</p>

		<p>I suppose the moment that most immediately comes to mind, the huge repeated dominant chord in the last movement of Tchaikovsky&#39;s 5th, comes under your definition of false ending? It usually gets quite a few applauds.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s not quite the same, but a few people have thought that &quot;Into the Woods&quot; (Stephen Sondheim) is over when it&#39;s only halfway through. The first half of it tells the stories that you&#39;re familiar with, then the second half does something different, so don&#39;t leave the theatre (or turn off the DVD) until you&#39;re sure that it&#39;s really the end!</p>

		<p>@Adam: reminds me of the joke&#8211;you might be a music major when &#8230; you trick your friends with deceptive cadences.</p>
<p>I almost thought Raymond was going to write about this, but I see now that these are, in fact, (probably) full cadences.</p>

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
