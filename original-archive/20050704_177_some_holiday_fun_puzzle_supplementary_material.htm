<p> In case my friend got stuck, she could call me and ask for a hint. The original plan was that I would charge her a dare in order to get a hint, but it turns out I was too nice a guy to make her do any of the following things, but here's the list anyway: </p>
<ul>
<li>Scream "I love you, Seattle!" at a street corner </li>
<li>Skip across the street </li>
<li>Walk sideways </li>
<li>Caress a lamppost </li>
<li>Dance </li>
<li>Sing the national anthem (any country) [typo fixed 7/6] </li>
<li>Ask for directions to where you are </li>
<li>Recite six lines from a favorite book or poem </li>
<li>Wave and shout hello to a traffic light </li>
</ul>

		<p>I agree qwerty, how dare he post something on this blog not directly related to technology.  We all know that a well developed human is solely dedicated to one thing and one thing only, he really shouldn&#8217;t branch out and form those friendship things, nor should he have any interest outside of writing/debugging code 24/7, anything less is disgraceful.  I am so glad you pointed out his failing in adding entries to his blog that satisfy you, as we all know that is the charter of this blog.  I would suggest you revolt and start your own blog where you share your acerbic wit with the rest of the world, but then again it is always easier to wait for someone else to do something you don&#8217;t like and then harass them,  or better yet blame them for something they are not even involved in, so carry on.</p>

		<p>     &quot;In the spirit of togetherness, how about helping the incompetent IE devs to patch<br />
<br />     their monopolistic crap, instead of these stupid puzzles?&quot;</p>
<p>Then can we move on to helping incompetent FireFox and Mozilla programmers with patching their own crap?  </p>
<p>Or hadn&#8217;t you heard that something Microsoft certainly *doesn&#8217;t* have a monopoly on are security holes.</p>
<p>Being a developer is a *job*.  Meaning that sometimes you go home and eat or sleep or do your own thing *whether or not* the rest of the world approves of your hobbies.  This blog is one such hobby.  </p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t like it, go away.  Satisfaction is NOT guaranteed.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
