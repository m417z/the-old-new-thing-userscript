		<p>This is sort of like how various products that depict good-looking women using them never actually come with said women.</p>

		<p>@BC_Programmer: not really, that would only apply if I sold you a Good-Looking Woman Premium Starter Kit with an image of a good-looking woman and the good-looking woman wasn&#39;t included. I&#39;ll leave it up to your imagination as to what such a kit might contain if not the woman. (Of course, if I actually sold such a kit I might not include the word &quot;premium&quot;, as it suggests the woman will be out of your league. I&#39;d use &quot;accessibility&quot; instead.)</p>
<p>This is more like those auctions that sell an empty box for an expensive piece of hardware, except those usually include a prominent disclaimer that it&#39;s only the box being sold and not the Xbox/Batmobile/earthquake generator itself. There are enough inattentive people that such auctions usually rack up the price of the original item anyway.</p>

		<p>This is a act of fraud on Microsoft&#39;s part. It is time to get the government to shut down the crooks and seize control of the company on grounds of immense fraud.</p>

		<p>@King Reggin- you&#39;ve fallen for another &quot;exploiting the inattentive&quot; trap, this is not sold by Microsoft. It&#39;s actually sold by &quot;Sharp&quot; which I&#39;m pretty sure is not Sharp Electronics, so there&#39;s &quot;inattentive trap&quot; #3.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Although it is sold by &quot;Sharp&quot;, the product appears to be manufactured by <a href="http://www.ctadigital.com/item.asp?item=2924" rel="nofollow">CTA Digital</a>, whoever that is. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>It&#39;s probably more like the cake mix boxes that show a gorgeous, professionally-decorated chocolate cake, but when you try to bake it it looks more like bricks. Sad to say, this has happened to me too often to count. :-(</p>

		<p>I see this in stores quite a bit with things like MP3 player cases whose packaging tries its hardest to imply the presence of an actual MP3 player inside.</p>

		<p>The Nintendo Wii has a few of these. I know of a couple people that received &quot;Wii Fit Starter Kits&quot; as gifts when the giver thought it included the Wii Fit as well.</p>

		<p>I like how there&#39;s a &#39;the-old-new-thing&#39; tag on the link to Amazon, as if Raymond expects people to buy the kit even after having been warned.</p>

<p>Well, it&#39;s better than my efforts, which looked sort of okay, but tasted like a brick.</p>

		<p>That is because the quality of what comes in a cake mix is comparable to a brick. &nbsp;Making a cake from scratch hardly takes any longer than throwing the mix together and the results are so much better, I don&#39;t understand why anyone would use a mix.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
