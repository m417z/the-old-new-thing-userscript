<p>This weekend is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/05/08/592352.aspx"> Opening Day of the Seattle boating season</a>. Even if you don't own a boat, you can enjoy the warmer weather and <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/getaways/313860_shorttrips03.html"> rent a canoe</a> and <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/getaways/217951_arboretumpaddle31.html"> paddle around the Arboretum</a>. (Don't do it on Opening Day, though.)</p>
<p> Here's <a href="http://www.nwoc.com/rental/arb_detail/index.htm"> a nice map</a> courtesy of the <a href="http://www.nwoc.com/"> Northwest Outdoor Center</a>. Pay heed to avoid the green section marked <i>Caution</i>. I made a wrong turn and ended up in the Caution area, and I found myself slogging through very shallow water. </p>
<p> Assuming you avoid the shallows, it's a very pleasant experience. Commune with the ducks and other birds. Pull over at one of the beaches and take a lunch break (assuming you remembered to pack lunch). Wave at the cars stuck on the 520 bridge. </p>

		<p>&#8220;I am Elmer J. Fudd, millionaire. I own a mansion und a yacht.&#8221;</p>
<p>For all the yacht clubs for the various dot-com millionaires, is there still a public launch for folks bringing their own canoes/kayaks in to town ? &#8216;Round here, we usually have to sneak it in the water before the park police come..</p>

		<p>Looks interesting, but how noisy is it? It looks like you are never far from a major road (except perhaps east of Duck Island).</p>
<p>Also, what are the bits of road that seem to disappear into the water (north and west of Duck Island) &#8211; is this some experimental ramp for amphibious vehicles?</p>
<div class=post>[<i>It&#8217;s not that noisy, actually, unless you&#8217;re right up against the highway. And those are <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_Route_520_%28Washington%29#Ghost_ramps" rel="nofollow">ghost ramps</a>. -Raymond</i>]</div>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
