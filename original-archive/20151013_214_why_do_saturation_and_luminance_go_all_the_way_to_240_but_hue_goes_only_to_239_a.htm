<p>
If you open the
<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms646375">
common Color Picker dialog</a>,
the custom color picker lets you specify the color
in one of three ways.</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphically, by clicking a color in the rainbow
    and using the slider to change the brightness.
</li>
<li>Numerically by specifying Hue, Saturation, and Luminance.
</li>
<li>Numerically by specifying Red, Green, and Blue.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
Let's look at the Red, Green, and Blue values first.
Theoretically, color channels are expressed as floating point values
between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive).
In Windows, it is common to change the scale to integers
0 to 255 (inclusive),
since that corresponds to the color values in a 24-bit color space.
This is the color space you've probably spent a good amount
of time dealing with,
since it corresponds to the <code>RGB</code> macro in <code>wingdi.h</code>,
the <code>COLORREF</code> data type,
and the way colors are typically expressed in CSS:
<code>#RRGGBB</code>.
</p>
<p>
The Hue, Saturation, and Luminance is a bit tricker.
The theoretical range for Hue is an angle,
normalized to be greater than or equal to
0&deg; and strictly less than 360&deg;.
The upper value of the range is not reached because Hue is cyclical,
so a value of 360&deg; is equivalent to 0&deg;.
On the other hand, Saturation and Luminance are floating point
values between 0.0 and 1.0 (inclusive).
</p>
<p>
In Windows, the Hue, Saturation, and Luminance ranges are rescaled
so that they go from 0 to 240.
Hue is endpoint-exclusive (because 360&deg; = 0&deg;)
whereas Saturation and Luminance are endpoint-inclusive
(because 1.0 is achievable).
</p>
<p>
Okay, but why rescaled to 240?
Why not rescale to 255?
</p>
<p>
The Hue value works out best when the range can be equally divided
into 12 segments,
because the important points of the Hue occur every 30&deg;.
The highest multiple of 12 that is still less than 256 is 252,
but 240 makes for prettier values.

Saturation and Luminance could have gone up to 255,
but I guess they used 240 out of solidarity.
The original code was written in the 1980's
for a now-defunct program called <i>Chart</i>,
and it has been carried forward ever since.

		<p>Yeah, and the math is wrong forever. Take a color, convert to HSL, add 20 to hue, and convert back. It&#39;s brightness changed. I tried repeatedly to find the correct math only to learn in the end what they say about RGB only having 55% of the gamut true. Still looking for an approximate solution to correct L to make white colors compatible with black. The logarithmic curve involved in L makes it really hard.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: &nbsp;You&#39;ll find the LAB color space much more useful for that. &nbsp;I assume you are attempting to find a &quot;brightness&quot; value that is representative of how the human eye sees color. &nbsp;The L value in HSL is pretty useless for that, as full blue (0,0,255) is shown as having an L of 1.0 but is quite dark. &nbsp;You can convert from RGB to XYZ, and then XYZ to LAB. &nbsp;The Lab &quot;L&quot; value is a much truer representation of &quot;brightness&quot;.</p>

		<p>Alternatively, RGB are all in the range [0, 255] (or [0.0, 1.0], depending on scaling), whereas H is in the range [0, 240) (or [0, 360) ) and SL are in the range [0, 240] (or [0.0, 1.0] ).</p>

		<p>@Ben Sorry, you&#39;re right. &nbsp;But the problem is that red (255,0,0), green (0,255,0) and blue (0,0,255) all have L=50%, even though to the eye green is much brighter than blue or red.</p>
<p>If you are trying to write code that determines whether the given color is &quot;dark&quot; or &quot;bright&quot; so it can decide whether to display text on top of it in black or white, you need to use LAB color space.</p>

		<p>@boogaloo Well, the &quot;L&quot; component (something labeled B for Brightness) in HSL is not relative luminance, it is just luminance with each color treated the same.</p>
<p>This is why we have LAB and XYZ :)</p>

		<p>Presumably, Hue was scaled to 240 so it would fit into 1 byte &#8211; it made a difference in the 1980&#39;s. The later-developed CSS HSL color standard uses the much more logical ([0..359], [0-100%], [0-100%]).</p>
<p>It&#39;s probably a coincidence, but Ars Technica just published an article about the crazy CSS color names: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2015/10/tomato-versus-ff6347-the-tragicomic-history-of-css-color-names">arstechnica.com/&#8230;/tomato-versus-ff6347-the-tragicomic-history-of-css-color-names</a></p>

		<p>@Alex: for those uses, a weighted average is enough. In the research done while developing the NTSC color television standard (which for compatibility reasons added a color subcarrier on top of a black and white signal, and thus needed to establish a correspondence between them), they decided to define Y (luminance) as 0.33*R + 0.55*G + 0.11*B (note that this assumes green is perceived brighter than red, and red than blue). and I find that a quite sensible choice. Next time, apply that formula to your RGB value, and compare to 128. If you need to make integer arithmetic, take into account that 0.11 = 1/9, so 0.55*G = 5 * (G / 9).</p>
<p>Basing a luminance-correct HSL system on that formula is much more complicated, and maybe isn&#39;t worth the effort.</p>

		<p>The nice thing about 240 is that it&#39;s the largest “highly composite number” that fits in a single byte. &nbsp;Divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 12, 15, 16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 48, 60, 80, and 120.</p>

		<p>240, well, it&#39;s one brighter, isn&#39;t it? It&#39;s not 239. You see, most blokes, you know, will be displaying at 239. You&#39;re on 239 here, all the way up, all the way up, all the way up, you&#39;re on 239 on your colour picker. Where can you go from there? Where? Nowhere. Exactly. What we do is, if we need that extra push over the cliff, you know what we do? Put it up to 240.</p>

		<p>Am I the only one who finds it amusing that the color picker has remained virtually unchanged since the 1980&#39;s? It even retains the anachronistic &quot;Color|Solid&quot; caption on the preview box from when dithering was the norm.</p>
<p>And this quote from the MSDN page is precious: &quot;The actual number of colors displayed is determined by the display driver. For example, a VGA driver displays 48 colors, and a monochrome display driver displays only 16.&quot;</p>
<p>According to Wikipedia (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_Chart">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Microsoft_Chart</a>) Chart actually predates Windows, being the charting program to accompany Excel&#39;s DOS-based precursor, Multiplan.</p>

		<p>Thanks, that adds some logic to the color picker dialog&#8230; I never really liked that dialog anyway.</p>
<p>I remember that up to some Windows version (I think I saw it in Windows 2000 the last time), if you had specific font / metric settings of the user interface, you could only enter 2 numbers into the textboxes, because the last didn&#39;t fit in anymore, and the textboxes were somehow not limited to 3 characters inside it, but more to the width of the entered text. It sounds so weird, I wouldn&#39;t believe it myself anymore, but I&#39;m sure I tried to enter 255 every so often into the R, G or B fields, and only 25 was possible&#8230;</p>

		<p>DWalker: Color is hard, period.</p>
<p>Currently the closest model we have to human color vision is CIECAM02. Look up the Wikipedia article and marvel at the complexity. :-)</p>

		<p>@Dan, the highly composite thing is what stuck out to me. If I had actually thought about the problem I would have decided divisibility by 6 was the key factor. But when I saw 240 my thought was basically &quot;that number has a ton of factors &#8211; I bet it has to do with that&quot; and went on to read the explanation.</p>

		<p>I have too found it somewhat strange/amusing that the Windows Colour Picker hasn&#39;t changed for ages.</p>

		<p>Am I allowed to say on this blog that the Mac color picker has always been far better than Windows&#39;? The Windows one has barely changed since Windows 98 (I think the &quot;Color|Solid&quot; stuff was implemented later), while the Mac one, even in Mac OS 9, had a much nicer range of preset colors and a more logical HSL color selector. </p>
<p>This is a problem Microsoft tends to have in all its software &#8211; most features are kept nicely polished from one version to the next, but some bits are just left to age ungracefully, retaining the same antiquated UI and limited options (and sometimes even bugs) version after version.</p>

		<p>@Aaron: As far as I know, the Windows Colour Picker hasn&#39;t changed at all since (at least) Windows 95. I don&#39;t know about Windows 3.1.</p>

		<p>[I think it dates back to Windows 3.1. But there&#39;s a fancy new color picker that nobody uses. -Raymond]</p>
<p>Looks similar to the colour picker in Windows 10 for high contrast theme colours (which is pretty much completely useless, because it only lets you choose between around 20 predefined colours and doesn&#39;t even have an option for choosing a custom colour).</p>

<p>At least it follows Windows Ten theme in general: From bad to broken.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
