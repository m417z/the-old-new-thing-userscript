<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/02/12/7626236.aspx"> The way to get me to show up at your conference is to invite me</a>. The folks who run the <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/index.html"> Reflections|Projections 2009 conference</a> figured that out. I will be there on Friday the 16th for the job fair in the Siebel Atrium, and my talk <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/speakers/chen.html"> <i>How Microsoft is Different from School</i></a> is scheduled for Saturday morning at 11:15. Attendance is free, but that's not much consolation seeing as you first have to <i>get there</i>.</p>
<p> It's always a weird situation I find myself in when I'm invited to give a talk at a conference, because if I give a talk on the stuff I usually write about, you'll get something like a one-hour discussion of the finer points of programming scrollbars. (A talk not even I would attend.) As a result, conference talks always take me a bit "out of my element", forcing me to pick some topic I don't usually talk about which still fits in with the overall tone of the other talks. </p>
<p> Reflections|Projections is particularly scary for me, because, I mean, look at the other speakers: <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/speakers/ohanian.html"> The co-founder of reddit</a>. <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/speakers/tsuk.html"> Principal Architect for webOS</a>. <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/speakers/gregori.html"> Author of the Robot Vision Toolkit</a>. And the topics: <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/speakers/karra.html"> Cloud computing</a>, <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/speakers/chang.html"> Google Chrome</a>, <a href="http://www.acm.uiuc.edu/conference/2009/speakers/fitz_sussman.html"> the myth of the genius programmer</a>. These people do big things, and these topics are big topics. </p>
<p> On the other hand, I do small things. </p>
<p> It took me a while to find a topic, and then once I found it, I had to do a bunch of research because, well, it's been a long time since I was in school. I interviewed a bunch of colleagues who came to Microsoft directly out of school within the past two years to steal^H^H^H^H^Hdraw upon their experiences and then put the stories together into a talk. If you think about it, for this subject matter, I'm going to be a total poser! </p>
<p> We'll see how that goes. </p>
<p> (Actually, it's not <i>total</i> poser-tude, since I do have personal knowledge of how things are done at Microsoft. The provocative title is just a hook.) </p>

		<p>I, for one, actually look forward to seeing the video of this presentation. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve been out of school for over a decade and so it will be interesting to see both what recent graduates had as their experience in school today, along with the environment that exists at MS today. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t think that to be &quot;poser-ish&quot; at all. &nbsp;I think a lot of visitors to this blog would find that interesting. &nbsp;Although, it would be great if you could start out your presentation with some pre-emptive snarky comment!!</p>

		<p>I gave a talk there a couple of years ago. It&#8217;s very laid back, and the expectations are low. Students are used to lectures from their professors, after all.</p>
<p>The student organizers spent the evenings playing video games and chair racing with Randall Munroe of xkcd fame. Then, I got to see Randall and Jeffrey Ullman toss logic puzzles back and forth at dinner. Good times.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m surprised Microsoft doesn&#8217;t foot the bill for at least some of these talks you&#8217;re asked to give. It seems like a few paid working days plus travel costs (a pitance for them, really) is a good bargain for going out and talking about the company in a good light.</p>
<p>Yes, while I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re providing a good and honest service to the people at the lecture, it&#8217;s also a nice big advertisement for Microsoft and it&#8217;s products. Unless, of course, you&#8217;re telling everyone to boycott MS and go work for Apple.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Principle Architect for webOS&#8217; links to the same person as &#8216;myth of the genius programmer&#8217; (which, unless it&#8217;s a mistake, implies it&#8217;s not a myth).</p>
<p>Also, popularity doesn&#8217;t mean someone is doing something &#8216;big&#8217;; it just means a lot of people like it; this is generally trivial to achieve and not really interesting (at least to me).</p>

<p>Some time ago a lady in our support dept couldn&#8217;t answer one of our customers questions, she passed it onto me, cc&#8217;ing in the customer, she said in the email &quot;Hi Tim, I have this poser for you&#8230;&lt;snip the custs question&gt;&quot;</p>
<p>The customer took great offense, he thought that our support lady was very dis-respectful and after some angry exchanges, our support lady was horrified to realise that the cust thought she had called him a &quot;poseur&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
