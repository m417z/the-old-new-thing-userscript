<p>It sounds like a scene from the movie <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0088846/"> <i>Brazil</i></a>, but in fact it's the law.</p>
<p> Let's rewind a bit. The introduction is a bit technical, but I'll try to keep it short. </p>
<p> There is a legal filing known as a <i>habeas petition</i> and another known as a <i>petition for review</i>. There are rules regarding what each one covers and the deadlines for filing them. Prior to 2005, there was no deadline for habeas petitions, but you had to file your petition for review within 30 days of whatever it was the government did that you wanted to object to. In 2005, Congress passed (and the President signed) a law which recategorizes what the two types of filings covered, and many claims that had fallen under the habeas petition have been reclassified as requiring a petition for review instead. </p>
<p> This change in the rules creates a gap in coverage because Congress forgot to include a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grandfather_clause"> grandfather clause</a> (or, for computer geeks, a "smooth migration plan"): What if, at the time the new law took effect, the thing you want to complain about was reclassified as requiring a petition for review, but it took place more than 30 days ago? You wake up one morning and somebody tells you, "Hey, there's a new law today. You just lost your right to respond." </p>
<p> What you do, then, is file a lawsuit challenging the new rules. And then two years later, the Third Circuit Court hears your case and rules that, yes, you're right, the law that Congress passed is unconstitutional (a violation of Section&nbsp;9, Clause&nbsp;2, known commonly as the <i>Suspension Clause</i>) because it denied you the opportunity to file a claim. </p>
<p> And now here's the weird part. </p>
<p> Instead of saying, "And therefore we strike down this part of the law as unconstitutional," the court says "And therefore we will retroactively rewrite the law so it is constitutional again (saving Congress and the President the trouble of having to do it themselves), and oh lookie here, <a href="http://3dcir.blogspot.com/2007/09/kolkevich-real-id-had-hidden-deadline.html"> according to this new law we just made up, you did have a constitutionally guaranteed opportunity to file your petition, but it expired two years ago</a>." </p>
<p> In other words, what you should have done in 2005 was hire a psychic, who would then instruct you to spend thousands of dollars hiring an attorney to draft and file a petition which, according to the law, <i>you were legally barred from filing</i>, in anticipation of the courts (two years later) rewriting the law in order to make that filing legal again. And then when you file your petition, you have to convince the court to accept it, explaining that <i>yes, I know that I cannot legally file this petition, but a psychic told me to do it</i>. </p>
<p> You can <a href="http://caselaw.findlaw.com/data2/circs/3rd/062624p.pdf"> read the court's decision yourself</a>. (Despite the connotations associated with the term <i>legalese</i>, court decisions are actually quite readable. You just have to skip over the complicated footnotes.) </p>

		<p>I&#8217;m sure this will come up again, but isn&#8217;t this new law just as &quot;in violation of the Constitution&quot; as the old one was? I&#8217;m pretty sure the legal system isn&#8217;t suppose to presume telepathy.</p>

		<p>Um, actually, that grace period approach is fairly commonplace in law &#8211; back in 1996, when Congress placed a one-year limit on prison inmates seeking collateral review of their convictions/sentences (a so-called Section 2254 habeas petition / Section 2255 motion), courts everywhere decided &#8211; a few years later &#8211; that you have one year since the enactment to file the petition, even though it might look barred at the time because you were convicted a long time before 1996&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>And sometimes when they did an extreme rewrite (there&#8217;s a case a few years ago when the Ninth Circuit interpreted &quot;not less than 7 days&quot; to be &quot;not more than 7 days&quot;), they did refuse to apply the interpretation to the parties in the case to be &quot;fair&quot;.</p>

		<p>And what it really means is that when congress says &#8220;As of 90 days from now, you have 30 days to file your petition&#8221; your lawyer better get the petition in sometime in the next 90 days. &nbsp; When congress passes laws they don&#8217;t usually go into effect for months.</p>

		<p>I just read the opinion in full. To be fair, the guy didn&#8217;t need a psychic, just a competent attorney.</p>
<p>The court held that although the act doesn&#8217;t say so explicitly, he could have applied for review during the first month after passage of the bill, given that all new deportees also only have a month to file their appeal. It&#8217;s a little unfair in that it suddenly puts attorneys under pressure to handle all their back deportees as well as any that walk in the door, but it&#8217;s not beyond the bounds of reason.</p>
<p>On the other hand, this is US immigration law, where &#8216;beyond the bounds of reason&#8217; is an everyday occurrence. Sigh.</p>

		<p>Reading the full decision is enlightening. The law changed to allow 30 days to appeal under a new procedure. The person in this case waited a year to appeal under the old procedure that allowed unlimited time.</p>
<p>Both old and new methods were apparently made unavailable to him by the law change.</p>
<p>So the court said that anyone who&#8217;d tried to follow the new law would be allowed to do so, giving him 30 days from the new law to do so.</p>
<p>No sign of a need for a psychic here: just notice the rule change and try to comply as best you can instead of completely ignoring it.</p>
<p>I am glad that, unlike a certain alternative OS vendor, Microsoft instead has the practice of trying to keep the old rules valid for a very long time for those who write programs that rely on them. This reflects a reality different from this immigration case: a program once distributed can&#8217;t rewrite itself to follow the new rules.</p>

		<p>[Okay, you follow it as best you can, but how do you convince the court to accept your filing which the new law says you aren&#8217;t allowed to file? -Raymond]</p>
<p>It appears that you get them to accept it the same way he did, but within the 30 day window of the enactment of the law, instead of waiting over a year to do so. &nbsp;The way I read the opinion, if he had filed suit, or appeal, or whatever it was that he actually filed, within the 30 days, the court would have allowed him to file his appeal of his deportation.</p>

		<p>English is a tricky language. &quot;The law&quot;, is that the collection of rules, or a reference to single individual rule ? &quot;The law which recategorizes&#8230;&quot; definitely is the latter.</p>
<p>The problem is with Raymond&#8217;s statement &quot;it&#8217;s the law&quot;. That seems to apply to the set of rules. You see, under the whole set of rules (including &quot;constitutional&quot; rules that trump others) the right to file a petition ends either 30 days after the action or 30 days after the new 2005 rule.</p>
<p>Hence, we can now reparse the statement. You should file a petition, even though the (regular) law says you can&#8217;t, because the (constitutional) law says you can.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s really not different from MSDN documentation. You can&#8217;t take indiviudal statements in isolation. E.g. there&#8217;s the general notion that NULL pointers can cause an AV, you don&#8217;t spell that out everywhere.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
