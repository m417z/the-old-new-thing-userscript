<p>Every so often, somebody will spam all the Microsoft blogs with a survey or a plea for a job or some other boilerplate message. Don't think you're fooling anyone. It's not like each blogger lives in a separate world and never talks to anyone else. In reality, we exchange information quite freely and even occasionally get together&mdash;usually under the aegis of our <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/betsya/"> overworked leader Betsy</a>&mdash;for an <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/alexbarn/archive/2005/04/13/407995.aspx"> informal face-to-face</a> (usually <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/10/11/479588.aspx"> lubricated with beer</a>).</p>
<p> Which reminds me: That April get-together was held at <a href="http://www.fadoirishpub.com/fado_directions.php?city=seattle"> Fad&oacute; Seattle</a>, and at some point during the evening, I excused myself and went into the main part of the pub. I headed for what appeared to be a promising hallway, but which instead was merely a large wall covered in thematic decorations. I scanned the wall for a few seconds, then someone walking past said to me, "It's over there, through that room, on your left." </p>
<p> I found it intriguing that the gentleman knew exactly what I was looking for based on the fact that I was staring at a wall at the edge of a bar near the kitchen entrance. </p>

		<p>As a &quot;reader&quot; of the Microsoft Blogs I find it amusing that many of you are guilty of becoming “spammers.” When Microsoft has a new press release “too many” of your own employee’s simply repost the exact same article, with no further comments, no supplemental links, but more importantly the topic is outside their purview.</p>
<p>But what frustrates me; is that it makes my RSS-Reader go crazy over nothing!<br /></p>

<p>Here in Ireland, we&#8217;re never looking at the wall of a pub unless we&#8217;re looking for the bathroom or the bar, and since the bar is usually easier to find&#8230; =)</p>

		<p>Too bad you do not get to talk the ones that censor their comments, I posted several comments to the Expert Zone blog and none of them ever showed up, last one today was noting that Ctrl+Enter in IE does not always add www. and .com, it adds the national domains for localized IE.</p>

<p>This is something Windows XP absolutely *needed*. &quot;It looks like you are staring at the Start Menu. Are you looking for &#8216;All Programs&#8217;?&quot; It would&#8217;ve improved user-paperclip relationships substantially.</p>

		<p>+1 to Starfish.</p>
<p>I can <em>never</em> find &#8216;All Programs&#8217; in XP. I&#8217;ve come to think of it as an eye floater. (You know, those thingies that keep moving with your eyes so you can never focus on them, however hard you try.)</p>

		<p>I think he knew what you were looking for because everyone does the exact same thing.</p>
<p>I know EXACTLY what you did, because I&#8217;ve done it myself.  The first time I ever went to Fado&#8217;s, I was on a first date.  I excused myself, and to exactly the same spot&#8230; realized nothing was there, and when on exploring.  Luckily the girl never saw this&#8230;</p>

		<p>Microsoft Bloggers talk to each other?  In bars?  Get lost when looking for the &#8216;Rest Rooms&#8217;.  I thought you were all robots with built in GPS services.  Only needing a lube of WD40 from IT support when things get sticky.  REAL people with vocal chords.  Fabulous!<br /></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
