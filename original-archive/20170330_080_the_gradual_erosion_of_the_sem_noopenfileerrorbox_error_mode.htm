<p>
The <code>SEM_<wbr>NO&shy;OPEN&shy;FILE&shy;ERROR&shy;BOX</code> flag
has a long history.
</p>
<p>
It goes back to 16-bit Windows and
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170327-00/?p=95835">
the way modules were loaded from floppy disks</a>.
If the loader could not find the file it needed,
it prompted you to insert the disk and gave
you the option to retry or cancel.
The
<code>SEM_<wbr>NO&shy;OPEN&shy;FILE&shy;ERROR&shy;BOX</code> flag
lets you disable the prompt and force the system to act
as if you had selected <i>Cancel</i>.
</p>
<p>
The 16-bit kernel also exported a function called
<code>Open&shy;File</code> that lets you access the
routine in the module loader that tries to open a file
and prompts for retries if the file isn't found.
Therefore, the
<code>SEM_<wbr>NO&shy;OPEN&shy;FILE&shy;ERROR&shy;BOX</code> flag
controlled the <code>Open&shy;File</code> function, too.
</p>
<p>
Forward to 32-bit Windows NT.
The Windows NT module loader doesn't work anything at all
like the 16-bit module loader.
Memory management is page-based rather than segment based.
Images are memory-mapped and operate on page faults
rather than being manually loaded from the disk
and operating on segment faults (or worse,
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20120622-00/?p=7303">
segment reload thunks</a>).
</p>
<p>
This means that the old model of prompting the user to reinsert
the floppy disk makes no sense.
There is never any prompting for failed module loads.
The
<code>SEM_<wbr>NO&shy;OPEN&shy;FILE&shy;ERROR&shy;BOX</code> flag
has no effect for modules,
which means that you won't see any error boxes from
<code>Load&shy;Library</code> on Windows NT.
(On Windows 95, if the DLL you
were trying to load had a chain of dependencies
that led to a missing 16-bit DLL,
then you still got the error box from the 16-bit loader.)
</p>
<p>
This means that today,
the
<code>SEM_<wbr>NO&shy;OPEN&shy;FILE&shy;ERROR&shy;BOX</code> flag
has no effect.
</p>
<p>
Well, almost.
</p>
<p>
Remember that <code>Open&shy;File</code> function?
The one that let you open a file using the same retry
logic as the 16-bit module loader?
The function was ported to 32-bit Windows,
but of course it doesn't actually use the 16-bit module
loader.
It just replicates the behavior of the 16-bit module loader.
</p>
<p>
Including the error prompt if the file cannot be found.
</p>
<p>
So that's where we are today.
The
<code>SEM_<wbr>NO&shy;OPEN&shy;FILE&shy;ERROR&shy;BOX</code> flag
has been eroded away.
The only place that still respects the flag is the old
<code>Open&shy;File</code> function,
a function you probably didn't even realize existed,
and
which exists only for backward compatibility with 16-bit programs.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
I submitted a documentation change request to MSDN to clarify this.
We'll see which happens first: This article gets posted
or the MSDN change request gets processed.</p>

		<p>AFAIK this is still required when you access unmounted drives (ejected CDs, card readers, etc). Without it, you&#8217;ll see &#8216;hard error&#8217; message box with dreaded &#8216;No disk in drive&#8217; &#8211; Abort, Retry, Ignore. No?</p>

		<p>From the way OpenFile() is documented, I think you have to pass OF_PROMPT to show a dialog with &#8220;retry&#8221; and &#8220;cancel&#8221; only.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
