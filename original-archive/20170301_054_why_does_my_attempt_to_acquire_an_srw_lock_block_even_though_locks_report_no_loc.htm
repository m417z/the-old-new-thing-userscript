A customer asked for some help debugging a problem with their application:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="m"><p>
We have an application that
synchronizes access to resources
by using
SRW locks
rather than critical sections.
We have traced execution in the debugger
up to the point at which we're about to call
<code>Acquire&shy;SRWLock&shy;Shared</code>.
Trying to step over the call in WinDbg sends
the program into Running mode.
Breaking back into the debugger and using the
<code>!locks</code> command
reports "no locks", confirming that
that there are no deadlocks on the lock.
But why is
<code>Acquire&shy;SRWLock&shy;Shared</code>
not returning?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The debugger's
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/windows/hardware/ff563985(v=vs.85).aspx">
<code>!locks</code> command</a>
reports on critical section objects.
Says so right on the tin:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
The <b>!locks</b>
extension in Ntsdexts.dll displays a list of critical sections associated with the current process.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
It does not have any insight into SRW locks or any other synchronization objects.
</p>
<p>
The program is entering Running mode when you try to step over the call
to <code>Acquire&shy;SRWLock&shy;Shared</code> because the
call is blocking,
presumably because another thread has acquired the SRW lock
in exclusive mode and has yet to release that lock.
(Other possibilities are that the acquirer of the exclusive
SRW lock released it incorrectly,
or that the SRW lock is corrupted.)
</p>
<p>
There are no built-in diagnostics for SRW locks.
These locks retain no diagnostic information;
that's what makes them slim.
If you need to debug your program's use of SRW locks,
you can wrap the SRW lock functions inside your
own helper functions that record additional diagnostic
information.
Or you can use Application Verifier,
which is basically the same thing,
just that the diagnostic information is recorded
by Application Verifier.
Or you can add additional logging to your program
to try to reconstruct the history of the SRW lock
to find out who acquired it exclusively
and failed to release it properly.</p>

		<p>Naming is so important.  It doesn&#8217;t say that it reports on critical section objects &#8220;on the tin&#8221;, but on the instruction leaflet that&#8217;s packed inside the tin.  The tin is labeled &#8220;!locks&#8221;. </p>
<p>Hindsight says that the name should not have been !locks, but !critical or !critsections, or something.  Where&#8217;s that time machine?</p>

		<p>Did SRW locks exist when windbg was first written? MSDN has the minimum supported client for InitializeSRWLock listed as Vista, but that might not be accurate (since everything before Vista is not supported).</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve checked the Windows SDK v5.0 WinBase.h does not have InitializeSRWLock() defined. The first existence is on v6.0A.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
