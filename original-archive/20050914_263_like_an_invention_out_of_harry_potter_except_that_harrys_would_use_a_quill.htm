<p>When I heard <a href="http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p1/program/artikel.asp?ProgramID=406&amp;Nyheter=1&amp;artikel=679694"> this story from Swedish Radio</a>, it struck me as the sort of object that would exist in the imaginary world of Harry Potter. Raymond's bad translation follows:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  <b>Pen can help dyslexics</b> </p>
<p> With today's cheaper and cheaper microelectronics, it becomes possible for young inventors to produce new products without a lot of resources. A new idea for a smart-pen for speech synthesis and voice recognition is an example of this. </p>
<p> The pen intended primarily for dyslexics has been produced by Johan Str&ouml;mbom, a student at the <a href="http://www.chalmers.se/"> Chalmers University of Technology</a>. It is a pen which produces speech from writing, and which converts your speech into text, explains Johan Str&ouml;mbom. </p>
<p> "One can read in text from a piece of paper, which is then heard in a headset, also one can speak text into the headset and have it written out," says Johan Str&ouml;mbom. </p>
<p> He was inspired to invent the pen by his mother who teaches dyslexics. The pen has been nominated for an inventor's prize at the <a href="http://www.tekniskamassan.se/"> Technical Fair</a> in October. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Of course, the Harry Potter version would be a quill instead of a pen, and it wouldn't need a headset. Or batteries. </p>
<p> Voice recognition also has a lot of promise for people other than dyslexics. Imagine if you could take a voice recording and send it through a recognizer to produce a transcript. I can read Swedish and German much better than I can listen to it, and having a transcript of a news report as it happens would improve my understanding tremendously. </p>

		<p>I have trouble buying that&#8230; I mean Microsoft&#8217;s Speech recognition lags on my 2.8Ghz machine with 1GB of RAM, what chance will it have on whatever processor they can fit inside a pen body? Not to mention the entire scanner that reads text in (from the page? or as it&#8217;s written?). </p>
<p>I would also like to add that it is not very functional if you think about it. I mean you&#8217;re sitting in the library writing up some essay and the pen is talking to you? RI&#8211;GH&#8211;T that won&#8217;t be annoying at all will it. </p>
<p>One thing dyslexics don&#8217;t want is to stand out in a crowd (in relation to writing). If you are going to get a pen that talks to you, why not just get a giant red stick that glues to your head that reads: &quot;I&#8217;m stupid&quot;? </p>
<p>Not that I&#8217;m saying speech recognition isn&#8217;t extremely helpful while proof-reading stuff in Microsoft Word (dyslexic or otherwise).</p>

		<p>Manip: That&#8217;s not a very big problem &#8211; just use a headset&#8230; a little mini-jack plug shouldn&#8217;t be impossible to add to a pen.</p>

<p>It is in swedish but it has an picture of the pen. </p>
<p>It uses a headset so it is safe to use in the library for reading, maybe not to have it write for you&#8230; ;) </p>

		<p>Well the headset is a good idea&#8230; Having &#8216;ISpell&#8217; down the side &#8211; not such a great idea&#8230; </p>
<p>I was considering it and I see another problem, dyslexics can&#8217;t learn to read because they have an under-formed area of the brain where they &#8216;understand&#8217; sounds of words. If you use the pen instead of practising, this area of the brain will remain under-developed and in fact the pen will only make things worse, not better. </p>
<p>Really the only cure to dyslexia is not magic pens, it&#8217;s not coloured card, it&#8217;s not psychical activity &lt;shudder&gt; it is good old fashioned practise. Instead of taking dyslexic kids and side tracking them with crazy ideas that don&#8217;t work you could have them read a lot more than their &#8216;normal&#8217; peers and write a lot more too. </p>
<p>Writing won&#8217;t improve much without help but reading, by just reading will improve all on its own.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
