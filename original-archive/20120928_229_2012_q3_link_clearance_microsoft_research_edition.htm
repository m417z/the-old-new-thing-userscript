<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: I received a scam email purportedly from <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/yesprimeminister/index.shtml"> Sir Humphrey Appleby</a>, secretary to the Prime Minister. I could tell it was a fake because the message was comprehensible. </p>

<p> I had the good fortune of seeing an early version of this paper. The thing that jumped out at me was the hard drive failure information: </p>
<ul>
<li>The probability of a failure in the first 5 days of uptime     is 1 in 470. </li>
<li>Once you've had one failure, the probability of a second failure     is 1 in 3.4. </li>
<li>Once you've had two failures, the probability of a third failure     is 1 in 1.9. </li>
</ul>
<p> Translation: That hard drive failure you experienced? It was no fluke. Once you experience your first hard drive failure, the odds of a second one increase by a factor of <i>over 100</i>. </p>
<p> What's more, that second failure is highly likely (86%) to occur within the next ten days, and almost certainly (99%) within the next thirty. </p>
<p> Conclusion: When you get a hard drive failure, <i>replace the drive immediately</i>. </p>

		<p>So Raymond (indirectly) blogged on WER after all. After intercepting WER messages when able to controlled-reproduce a crash, I found the dumps I was able to extract completely useless, even when having exact versions with PDB files for loading into a debugger.</p>
<p>However, the paper contained enough ideas that I should be able to make a local equivalent that harvests the crash data that I actually need (unfortunately I&#39;ll have to depend on crash-hardening a routine within the process to be able to submit data, now that&#39;s some trick).</p>

		<p>Why would you use the process to report on itself? All the crashed program needs to do is launch a new program to collect the info then sit around and wait.</p>

		<p>Running hardware at their rated frequency is also bad. By underclocking the stability rises significantly.</p>

		<p>The hardware failure paper confirms many things I have learned over the years: that overclocking is *bad*; that when a machine fails, it will fall again; that &quot;mature&quot; machines (i.e., those that are neither too new or too old) are far more reliable; that cheap hardware, typically found in white-box computers, is far less reliable; and that typical lifespan for a 24/7 machine is about 6-7 years (in fact, I use that figure when planning the build and upgrade of my main work machine). But the result that points that laptops are more reliable has caught me off-guard: it doesn&#39;t relate to my experience.</p>

		<p>My current PC was bought in idea to be used intensively ~15h/day, with very little days off during the course of a year. Initially I did RAID0 with it&#39;s 2 HDD in order to have a good performance. One year later started to experience a lot of bad sectors, every day at start the CHKDSK was running, finding more and more files with cross references in sectors, more and more files were recovered with bad data and so on. Then the noises started to be more and more loud and also on BIOS start the RAID self-check marked one HDD red (as opposite to green as it always been). Few days passed working with it red and in one morning disaster strikes. No booting of my &quot;beloved&quot; Micro$oft OS.</p>
<p>So, got the HDD&#39;s out, put them into another PC, ran a low level factory format &#8211; you know, the one that HDD manufacturer provides via it&#39;s tools &#8211; and re-installed back to the PC. But this time I said &quot;no more RAID, let them be separate C: and D: drives&quot;.</p>
<p>And today is 4 years since that day, doing work/games on the same PC and on the same HDD&#39;s.</p>
<p>Morale of the story &#8211; I maybe just broke the law of &quot;Once you&#39;ve had one failure, the probability of a second failure is 1 in 3.4.&quot;&lt;/quote&gt;.</p>
<p>Or maybe this happened before the article was queued by Ray and the law is in effect after so I should fast replace those HDD when next failure occur (Conclusion: When you get a hard drive failure, replace the drive immediately.)&lt;/quote&gt;.</p>

		<p>@Danny &quot;I maybe just broke the law of &quot;Once you&#39;ve had one failure, the probability of a second failure is 1 in 3.4&quot;</p>
<p>Winning the lottery doesn&#39;t break the law that you&#39;ll win 1 in 4-million plays. It just means you were lucky.</p>
<p>Your single instance of your drive working is great for you, but Microsoft&#39;s 1:3.4 number comes from statistics on millions of machines, not single anecdotal examples.</p>

		<p>@Matt</p>
<p>My previous work PC was a P2 350 MHz from 1997. It has 512 MB SDRAM and runs XP SP3. Today. And has the same 3 HHD of 4GB, 8GB and 10 GB for like 10 years. It&#39;s still in use by my 6 yo son. And while it does not sit 15 hours /day like current work one it still does 4-5 hours /day. Every day.</p>
<p>How&#39;s that for a luck?:P</p>

		<p>@Danny Yes and there are people who win the lottery after playing only once in their whole life. Statistics may seem unintuitive sometimes, but it works&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Danny &#8212; One would think that consumer hard drives could easily be used with hardware RAID. They don&#39;t work because the microcode delays responding to some re-tryable errors for too long (defined by the RAID chip), and RAID starts recovery mode before the drive is ready for the next command. &nbsp;There is a command RAID can send the drive to disable extended retry, but most don&#39;t and many drives ignore it anyway.</p>
<p>The (much) higher priced RAID version of a drive ships with this timeout disabled, and longer burn-in/testing at the factory. &nbsp;The margin on the RAID drive is excellent for manufactures, and impossible for most consumers to swallow.</p>
<p>If you want raid, do it in software.</p>
<p>PS: Your &#39;low level&#39; format almost certainly wasn&#39;t. &nbsp;I&#39;ve yet to see a drive which doesn&#39;t keeps the bad track/relocation tables, nor test marked sectors for recovery, nor even reorganize the bad track accounting so every possible alternate track can be assigned. &nbsp;But you did clear the file system&#39;s list of bad sectors!</p>
<p>@voo &#8212; Danny wasn&#39;t playing the odds; he changed the rules of the game (by not using RAID hardware with consumer drives) to give him much better odds. &nbsp;(Just like James T. Kirk at Starfleet Academy.)</p>

		<p>I just got the weirdest Nigerian spam e-mail I have ever seen, in my inbox. &nbsp;It was a long dissertation from someone saying they are sorry that I had sent money repeatedly to &quot;my representative/intermediary&quot; without receiving anything in return. &nbsp;The sender is sorry about that, but he no longer trusts &quot;my representative&quot;. &nbsp;If I want to complete the transaction, I must work only with the sender of the e-mail and not with &quot;my representative&quot; any more, and to keep the details secret (of course). &nbsp;If I don&#39;t follow those instructions, I will not see any of the money that I have already paid so many fees to receive.</p>
<p>There was a long discussion of betrayals, and lots of talk about honesty. &nbsp;It was quite surreal.</p>
<p>I suppose the audience for this message is the VERY small, select group of people who have gone through this once and are truly wondering why they have not yet seen their money, and are stsill willing to hope. &nbsp;If they follow the instructions in this message, they will be rewarded, of course!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
