<p>Today is Microsoft's annual Company Meeting.</p>
<p> Back in August, the Real Estate and Facilities department sent a message to our group of buildings to inform us that the locker rooms would be closed "due to the filming of an upcoming corporate initiative." </p>
<p> Speculation swirled as to what sort of "upcoming corporate initiative" would require filming in a locker room. The Company Meeting was only a month away, and I suggested that Steve Ballmer might be <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/01/12/9946851.aspx"> filming a (shudder) parody</a> of the Old Spice Guy commercial. </p>
<p> Picking up the ball, one of my colleagues wrote the proposed script for this parody: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Hello developers. How are you? Fantastic. </p>
<p> Does your CEO look like me? Yes. </p>
<p> Can he code like me? Yes. </p>
<p> Should you be using Windows 7? I don't know. </p>
<p> Do you like the feel of productivity? Do you want an operating system that can stream your favorite movies while you tweet about the interesting article you're currently reading on Wikipedia? Of course you do. </p>
<p> SWANDIVE into the best user experience of your life! </p>
<p> So should you be using Windows 7? You tell me. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Here's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uLTIowBF0kE"> the commercial being parodied</a>, and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=owGykVbfgUE"> the first commercial in the series</a>. </p>

		<p>Nah, its a parody of the classic Coke commercial, starring billg as the the little boy and Steve Ballmer as Mean Joe Greene.</p>

		<p>I just threw up in my mouth. &nbsp;Twice. &nbsp;Once for the thought of Ballmer in another commercial parody (&quot;Except in Nebraska!&quot;) and again for the terrible proposed script. &nbsp;But I guess somebody who is (apparently) mesmerized by the extremely lame Microspeak lingo would probably find the script absolutely hilarious. &nbsp;I understand different companies have their own corporate culture, but sheesh.</p>

		<p>You got me thinking of the &quot;Studs from Microsoft&quot; video that was a multimedia sample in the MSDN CDs way back when.</p>
<p>I googled it and, lo, Raymond is the 6th result in the list: blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/02/14/531800.aspx</p>
<p>(But it&#39;s #1 in bing&#8230;)</p>

<p>Two favorites, which should be watched in order:</p>

		<p>I always wonder&#8230; Does Microsoft even need commercials at all?</p>
<p>Maybe in the new markets&#8230; but honestly speaking. Anyone in any of the developed countries believe someone in there doesn&#39;t know Microsoft / Windows, or believe commercials will make more people buy Windows 7?</p>
<p>I believe for most people (especially those who just begin to use computer), Windows (current version) is the default.</p>

<p>Sure they do. &nbsp;They&#39;re trying to sell Windows 7 upgrades to frustrated Vista users and persuade new adopters that Windows (which has a very poor reputation for usability/viruses/security) is as user-friendly as OSX, which is perceived as &quot;just working&quot;. &nbsp;Remember &quot;I&#39;m a Mac; I&#39;m a PC&quot; &#8212; that&#39;s what they&#39;re combatting. &nbsp;Now, neither of those reputations are really justifiable, but thats the perception among the general population do exist. &nbsp;The Windows 7 ads in the UK are all about usability.</p>

		<p>Raymond, you should tell your friend he forgot the most important line of the commercial: &quot;I&#39;m on a horse!&quot;</p>

		<p>Gah. I just envisioned Ballmer trying to do one of those Halo Reach videos. I think it was the one entitled &quot;Birth of a Spartan&quot; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://halo.wikia.com/wiki/Birth_of_a_Spartan" rel="nofollow">halo.wikia.com/&#8230;/Birth_of_a_Spartan</a>).</p>
<p>The fact that both it and the Old Spice one would feature a semi-naked Ballmer *shudder*. Where&#39;s the eye and mind bleach? I&#39;m having nightmares tonight. And tomorrow, as I gotta ask what that filming was.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
