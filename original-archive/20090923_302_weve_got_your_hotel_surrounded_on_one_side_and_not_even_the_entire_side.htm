<p> They all lie in the same direction and subtend a total of twelve degrees of arc. This is a sense of the word "surround" I was previously unfamiliar with. </p>

		<p>Yes, and when you read a comma-separated list of items, and one of them is &quot;Safeco Park&quot;, and the next one is &quot;home of baseball&#8217;s Seattle Mariners&quot;, you naturally expect a new and different item to come next. &nbsp;The same is true for &quot;Qwest Field&quot;. &nbsp;Most writers use semicolons to delimit a list when they need to put commas in some of the items. &nbsp;Oh well, maybe we programmers are too picky.</p>

		<p>Just thought it possible that you might want to use a map service which seems more likely to work &#8220;out of the box&#8221; for more of your readers in the future.</p>
<p>As for sending feedback to Bing, I&#8217;m not sure it will help. I wrote a mini rant about why on the subject, but it&#8217;s the sort of completely offtopic and self-indulgent tripe that I hate when others post that sort of thing. I deleted it to save myself some embarrassment.</p>

		<p>Raymond, Karellen knows (as all open source programmers do!) that all Microsoft products are made by a single person. So he figures if he complains to you, you can just let him know next time you see him in the cafeteria.</p>
<p>(Seriously, open source fans. When you find a flaw in, say, the Python interpreter, do you immediately go off and find Linus Torvalds to complain to? I&#8217;ve always wondered that.)</p>

		<p>Sorry, I wasn&#8217;t meaning to scold or complain to you, I was just trying to make an observation. The &quot;FWIW&quot; was meant to indicate that if my observation was something you happened to care about, there&#8217;s at least one alternative which doesn&#8217;t do that, but that if it wasn&#8217;t then, you know, whatever dude.</p>
<p>My attempts to explain this were unreadably wordy, and also felt either too defensive or passive-aggressive, so I just deleted them and hoped that you&#8217;d magically psychically take it in exactly the way it was intended. What hopelessly optimistic wishful thinking, huh? I really should have learned better by now&#8230;</p>

		<p>I knew beforehand a large percentage of comments were going to be about the map embedding.</p>
<p>In any case it&#8217;d be good if you made the IFRAME 900 pixels wide or so, since it needs that in order to avoid the horizontal scrollbar.</p>
<p>Otherwise the Bing map things works really, really well, even if the (closeable) left box and the heading are jarring.</p>
<p>As usual with contemporary Microsoft products, the problems are hardly technical and more a matter of design and reputation.</p>

		<p>Surrounded? These places are barely even nearby! A mall is surrounded by parking even if there are gaps in the parking lots; you could claim a peninsula is surrounded by water. No aspect of the word &#8216;surrounded&#8217; applies to this situation.</p>

		<p>To complain more about the map, it doesn&#8217;t seem to work at all in for me, potentially because I&#8217;m in Australia (it just defaults to that). Tried in numerous browsers.</p>
<p>To go back on topic:</p>
<p>I also think that using the word &#8216;Such as&#8217; allows them to not provide full details of the entire surrounds. Though I agree with the general sentiment.</p>

		<p>To me, &quot;surrounding&quot; when used in this context just means &quot;within walking distance.&quot;</p>
<p>Here, you&#8217;d need to be willing to walk across Lake Washington. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t think many people are up for that. &nbsp;But if they wait 40 years, they can take the light rail!</p>

		<p>Hey, you found that one guy who uses Konqueror! (And he reads Microsoft developer blogs with it!?)</p>
<p>but seriously, I thought that Bing page was a bitmap screenshot, you could have embedded that instead. &nbsp;I&#8217;m just noticing now with all these comments that it&#8217;s an actual page I can interact with. &nbsp;And now it makes a lot more sense to me why there is an large &#8216;Explore Canada&#8217; ad taking half of the left side &#8211; I was wondering why you were talking about Canada!</p>

		<p>Actually I got the same error message. I use rekonq, which uses webkit, but in Akregator it&#8217;s displayed using KHTML, so there is actually more than one person using KHTML :)</p>
<p>As an aside, I think that it&#8217;s not so unexpected that the guy using konqueror would be reading this blog. I can&#8217;t speak for anyone else, but I personally find this blog very interesting, even though I don&#8217;t personally use Microsoft products myself, because the topics discussed are usually not specific to MS but rather are applicable in some way to other pieces of software (e.g., supporting legacy code, design decisions, etc&#8230;).</p>

		<p>Bonus points for using &quot;subtend&quot; in a sentence.</p>
<p>Otherwise, I agree with Gabe &#8212; even if they were in a full circle they&#8217;re sufficiently distant (across two bridges even) to make the claim of being surrounded dubious at best.</p>

		<p>Interesting: this usage must have spread from &quot;in the surrounding area&quot; &#8211; but it feels adverbial. &nbsp;By the way, it&#8217;s more like 10&#176;, or 20 minutes on a clock face.</p>

		<p>IA qualifying phrases like &#8216;such as&#8217; implies that further attractions around the hotel that are not mentioned. Not mentioned attractions could be on other sides of the hotel. &nbsp;That doesn&#8217;t make Raymonds observations any less entertaining, very funny. &nbsp;I would not have &#8216;seen&#8217; the possibilities that Raymond saw.</p>
<p>Do vague qualifiers like &#8216;such as&#8217;, &#8216;maybe&#8217;, &#8216;sometimes&#8217;, &#8216;possibly&#8217; exist in the software code languages? &nbsp;What if software coders could use ambiguity in coding? &nbsp;Maybe they can&#8230;..</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Of course, there are attractions on the other sides and much closer, too, like the bowling alley and the Costco. In software, the qualifier &#8220;MAY&#8221; &#8211; must be capitalized &#8211; indicates amgibuity. (My favorite qualifier is &#8220;up to X or more&#8221;.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>&quot;Actually, Opera has the same problem.&quot;</p>
<p>Which problem are you referring to? It can&#8217;t display the map, or it only has one user?</p>
<p>Karellen: Google Maps doesn&#8217;t work for me using IE8 so I guess he&#8217;ll have to use Yahoo next time.</p>

		<p>Perhaps they don&#8217;t understand the definition of &#8216;surrounded&#8217;, but you have clearly misunderstood the definition of marketing and confused it with some other word that connotes accuracy.</p>

		<p>@Raymond:</p>
<p>The last time you linked to a Microsoft map site, it wasn&#8217;t embedded, and therefor wasn&#8217;t a big giant &quot;your browser is probably not worthy&quot; sign in the middle of this blog.</p>
<p>For the record, Opera 10 works fine (it&#8217;s very snappy even) with the Bing map site, even though there is a big giant &quot;you&#8217;re not worthy&quot; sign here.</p>
<p>Its a shame that Opera doesn&#8217;t get the respect it does. Its #1 in quite a few countries.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
