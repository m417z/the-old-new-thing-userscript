I ordered some tickets online and
was sent to a Web page which displayed the
tickets (with bar codes and stuff),
with instructions to print them out.
</p>
<p>
The Web page also had this big warning on it:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
IT IS UNLAWFUL TO REPRODUCE THIS TICKET IN ANY FORM.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Um, this is a print-at-home ticket.
The entire reason for its existence is to be
reproduced in printed form.
</p>
<p>
I printed it anyway.
</p>
<p>
Nobody arrested me.</p>

		<p>@Boris, I don&#8217;t think that is what the warning means.  By printing the ticket, you ARE reproducing the ticket (onto paper, from the electronic bit form).</p>

		<p>Ok, I searched for Raymond&#8217;s sentence and it seems to be standard boilerplate, which is often accompanied by a note saying that the issuer can refuse entry to any candidate-holder if they detect multiple attempts at scanning the same ticket. The issue is obviously reproduction with the intent to steal entry; that&#8217;s not the same as printing a hardcopy for yourself while keeping it on your smartphone as backup. (I&#8217;m not a legal expert, so if someone has more detailed knowledge of the issues involved, please feel free to comment.)</p>

		<p>@Boris: some events require a paper ticket and do not allow the use of e-tickets for entry.  I attended one such concert last summer.  I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the same legal boilerplate were on the ticket.  The only &#8220;legal&#8221; recourse in such cases would be a will-call window or mailing paper tickets (not that it stopped the thousands of attendees at the concert from printing them out).</p>

		<p>By trying to use it more than once. I would argue that you&#8217;re only producing the ticket by printing it out, not reproducing it, and even if you print out multiple copies and store one on your smartphone as PDF, that&#8217;s just the nature of the electronic ticket — it&#8217;s polymorphic. None of that counts as reproduction.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a classic, paper-only ticket has only one form and instance, so any attempt to make a copy would be unauthorized, but with electronic tickets, reproduction would have to be defined as an attempt at using it more than once.</p>

		<p>But those are explicitly contrasted with a clearly defined, expected way of perusing that content. What is explicitly forbidden here and what is the right way of doing it?</p>
<p>I can usually choose to get the QR code scanned via iPhone or a hardcopy. The same goes for electronic plane tickets.</p>

		<p>Also, it&#8217;s a false analogy. Reproducing content on CDs or DVDs can lead to not buying the same content in multiple formats, or even the same format when the content is made available to people who haven&#8217;t spent money on it. Reproducing an electronic ticket merely gives you more paper or files, with no added value (in terms of entry) for yourself or others.</p>

		<p>This makes no sense. If you have an electronic ticket, and you use it, whether electronically or a print out, that ticket is redeemed. It is impossible for anyone to further use another copy. So, there&#8217;s no need to ban trying to use it more than once. It&#8217;s like banning eating a McDonald&#8217;s sandwich more than once.</p>

		<p>I sure wish that those ticket images had an option to &#8220;print without ads&#8221; (as do American Airlines boarding passes).  Every time I print those things, I believe HP&#8217;s stock ticks up a notch.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s called &#8220;Print to PDF&#8221; or &#8220;Save to PDF&#8221; in your browser&#8217;s print menu. Then you open the PDF, and print to the printer with the &#8220;Print this view&#8221; instead of whole page. Also turn off &#8220;fit to page&#8221; scaling.</p>

		<p>Meh, that&#8217;s overcomplicated. Just use adblock or F12 to delete the ad in the browser before printing. (Unless they generate a PDF, in which case you can still cover it up, you just have to use something like PDFEscape.)</p>

		<p>I know! They want you to keep the browser open. And when you go to the place requiring the ticket, you &#8220;remote desktop&#8221; to your desktop on your phone and show it. Maybe it&#8217;s better to order the ticket on your phone next time. [/joke]</p>

		<p>The point is you&#8217;re not reproducing the ticket by merely showing it on screen, much like you can photo $10 bill on a table with your phone camera and you&#8217;re not reproducing money. </p>
<p>On the other hand, if you save the page on disk you could be reproducing it, but the generated ticket page itself is produced by the ticketing company&#8217;s server so you&#8217;re not reproducing it.</p>
<p>===<br />
I found that word choice &#8220;reproduce&#8221; here interesting too. Since &#8220;produce&#8221; can mean just to &#8220;bring forward something to somebody&#8221; and &#8220;reproduce&#8221; can mean &#8220;show something again&#8221;,  maybe it means you cannot show the same ticket twice to the staffs. :P</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a similar conflict between the GNU General Public License and installers that won&#8217;t proceed when you refuse to accept the licensing terms.</p>
<p>GPLv2: &#8220;You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.&#8221;</p>
<p>GPLv3: &#8220;You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or run a copy of the Program.&#8221;</p>
<p>If the installer followed the terms of the license, a user should be able to decline the license and install (and use) the software anyways.</p>
<p>(For context, the GPL grants additional rights, saying that you may redistribute the software as long as you provide a copy of the source code. If you reject the license then copyright law prohibits redistribution but you can still use the software yourself.)</p>

<p>Receiving, installing and running the GPL-licensed compiler without accepting the GPL is left as an exercise for the reader.</p>

		<p>&gt; How am I supposed to print my print-at-home tickets if I can’t reproduce them?</p>
<p>How, it&#8217;s easy-peasy. You can produce them (i.e. print them) in the first place, you just are not allowed to re-produce them (i.e. print them again).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
