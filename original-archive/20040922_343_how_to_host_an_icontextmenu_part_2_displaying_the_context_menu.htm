                                    pt.x, pt.y, hwnd, NULL);
        if (iCmd &gt; 0) {
          CMINVOKECOMMANDINFOEX info = { 0 };
          info.cbSize = sizeof(info);
          info.fMask = CMIC_MASK_UNICODE;
          info.hwnd = hwnd;
          info.lpVerb  = MAKEINTRESOURCEA(iCmd - SCRATCH_QCM_FIRST);
          info.lpVerbW = MAKEINTRESOURCEW(iCmd - SCRATCH_QCM_FIRST);

          pcm-&gt;InvokeCommand((LPCMINVOKECOMMANDINFO)&amp;info);
        }</font>
      }
      DestroyMenu(hmenu);
    }
    pcm-&gt;Release();
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
The first change addresses the first issue brought up in the
<a HREF="/oldnewthing/archive/2004/09/21/232369.aspx">
discussion of the WM_CONTEXTMENU message</a>
and fixes the HANDLE_WM_CONTEXTMENU message.
</p>
<p>
The second change addresses the second issue, and that's the
special handling of keyboard-invoked context menus.
When we receive a keyboard-invoked context menu, we move it to
the (0, 0) position of our client area.  This keeps the context
menu displayed in a vaguely sane position.
(If we were a container with objects, it would have been better
to display the context menu over the selected sub-object.)
</p>
<p>
The third change actually does what we're talking about:
Displaying the context menu to the user, collecting the result,
and acting on it.
</p>
<p>
You are certainly familiar with
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/resources/menus/menureference/menufunctions/trackpopupmenuex.asp">
the TrackPopupMenuEx function</a>.
Here we use the TPS_RETURNCMD flag to indicate that the item the
user selected should be returned by the function instead of being
posted as a WM_COMMAND to our window.
</p>
<p>
This highlights the importance of the fact that
SCRATCH_QCM_FIRST is 1 and not zero.
If it were zero, then we wouldn't be able to distinguish
between the user selecting item zero and the user cancelling the menu.
</p>
<p>
Once we are confident that the user has selected an item
from the menu, we fill out a
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/structures/cminvokecommandinfoex.asp">
CMINVOKECOMMANDEX structure</a>,
specifying the user's selection in the two verb fields and
indicating the invocation point via the ptInvoke member.
</p>
<p>
Note that when you invoke a command by menu ID, you must
specify the <strong>offset</strong> of the menu item
relative to the starting point passed to
IContextMenu::QueryContextMenu.
That's why we subtracted SCRATCH_QCM_FIRST.
</p>
<p>
When you run this program, you may notice that some things
don't quite work.  Most obviously, the Open With and Send To submenus
don't work, but there are more subtle bugs too.
We'll address them over the next few days.</p>

		<p>Raymond, did Explorer on 95/NT4 ever QI a context menu shell extension for IContextMenu2? In my own work, I&#8217;ve never seen a QI for that interface. (Modern OSes use IContextMenu3 so it&#8217;s a moot point now, but I&#8217;m still curious.)</p>

		<p>Yes you would see IContextMenu2 even on Win95 but only in certain situations (such as the Find menu). Even today you will see IContextMenu2 but only in certain situations.</p>

		<p>Enjoying this series so far Raymond &#8211; please make sure you give us some info on the flags like CMF_NOVERBS. I&#8217;ve been trying to work out what that really means and when it should be set for years!<br /></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
