<p> "Oh no," the gentleman replied. "They won't let me stay there. Too expensive." </p>

		<p>Well, it&#8217;s not too surprising, since nowdays since the same companies own a wide range of brands. For example, the parent of Club Med is also runs Motel 6. Add this along to the fact that the corporate owner might be required to reemburse franchise owners for some of the expenses make it pretty reasonable.</p>

		<p>Interesting &#8211; on the one hand is the argument  that since software costs nothing to copy, MS can use its own software for nothing. But on the other paw is the idea of intellectual property, which says that (say) the Office team should be paying the OS team for the right to use the OS. Especially after the legal settlements that make them totally separate divisions :)</p>
<p>I recall that for quite some time many of Microsoft&#8217;s websites were running on the cheapest workable solution&#8230; Apache. has that changed, I wonder?<br /></p>

		<p>Um, I think the recollection that microsoft.com ran on apache is mistaken. it has always ran on windows&#8230; the front end to the front end load balancing is outsourced to akamai, a leading company in this area (google also uses them). therefore to some whois-type utilities it looks like apache because that is what akamai were using.</p>
<p>there&#8217;s a whitepaper on ms.com giving an overview of the architecture that you might want to read to straighten out your &quot;recollection&quot; :-)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
