<p>One thing nobody has called out in my <a href="http://microsoftjobsblog.com/blog/raymond-chen/"> tribute to the Bill Gates Tiger Beat photo</a>, either because it was too subtle or too obvious, is that the photo is actually a mirror image.</p>
<p> The arrangement of furniture in the room was not correct: The big table was on the wrong side of the room. It was also too heavy to move around, so we cheated. We staged the entire picture as a mirror image, flipping the Windows screen shot. And then back in the virtual darkroom, <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/shows/WM_IN/Ariel-Stallings-Microspotting-the-Empire/"> Ariel</a> flipped the photo to put the furniture on the correct side of the photo. </p>
<p> Here are the clues in the photo: </p>
<ul>
<li>The <i>SONY</i> logo on the monitor. </li>
<li>The <i>Multiscan G500</i> and <i>Trinitron</i> branding on the monitor. </li>
<li>The <i>Microsoft</i> logos on the binder on the table. </li>
<li>The arrows on the recycle bin propping open the door. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Chatter</b>: The day after I put this article into the queue (which makes it visible to Microsoft employees), somebody <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/07/26/10436961.aspx#10437643"> posted a comment pointing it out</a>. Coincidence? You decide. </p>

		<p>The recycle bind is blurry at the size the image is shown in your page, but the monitor is clearly visible. And then I didn&#39;t notice it!</p>
<p>In other words, I&#39;m amazed that your article queue averages to three months, which means you have about 60-70 articles already written. Great work!</p>

		<p>Did there used to be a higher-res version of the photo? &nbsp;The photo on the linked page as well as this copy I found on Flickr <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://c2.staticflickr.com/4/3356/3213320169_33911c356f_z.jpg">c2.staticflickr.com/&#8230;/3213320169_33911c356f_z.jpg</a> are pretty low-res and require a very sharp eagle eye to notice those clues of the mirroring.</p>

		<p>There is a third possibility, as to why no one noticed&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
