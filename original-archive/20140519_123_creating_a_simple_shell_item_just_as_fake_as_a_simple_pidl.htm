Creating a simple pidl:
For the times you care enough to send the very fake</a>:
Instead of
creating a simple pidl,
we'll create a simple shell item.
</p>
<p>
The idea is the same.
We build a file system bind context containing the information about
the fake file,
and we pass that bind context to the
<code>SH&shy;Create&shy;Shell&shy;Item</code> function.
</p>
<p>
Take
that program that creates a simple pidl
and make these changes:
</p>
<pre>
HRESULT <font COLOR=blue>CreateSimpleShellItemFromPath</font>(
 _In_ const WIN32_FIND_DATAW *pfd,
 _In_ PCWSTR pszPath,
 <font COLOR=blue>_In_ REFIID riid, _Outptr_ void **ppv</font>)
{
 *<font COLOR=blue>ppv</font> = nullptr;
 CComPtr&lt;IBindCtx&gt; spbc;
 HRESULT hr = CreateFileSysBindCtx(pfd, &amp;spbc);
 if (SUCCEEDED(hr)) {
  hr = <font COLOR=blue>SHCreateItemFromParsingName</font>(pszPath, spbc, <font COLOR=blue>riid, ppv</font>);
 }
 return hr;
}

void DoStuffWith(_In_ <font COLOR=blue>IShellItem2 *psi2</font>)
{
 // Print the file name
 <font COLOR=blue>PCWSTR pszName;</font>
 if (<font COLOR=blue>SUCCEEDED(psi2-&gt;GetDisplayName(
         SIGDN_DESKTOPABSOLUTEPARSING,
         &amp;pszName</font>)) {
  wprintf(L"Path is \"%ls\"\n", <font COLOR=blue>pszName</font>);
  <font COLOR=blue>CoTaskMemFree(pszName);</font>
 }

 // Print the file size
 <font COLOR=blue>ULONGLONG ullSize;</font>
 if (SUCCEEDED(<font COLOR=blue>psi2-&gt;GetUInt64(</font>PKEY_Size, <font COLOR=blue>&amp;ullSize</font>))) {
  wprintf(L"Size is %I64u\n", <font COLOR=blue>ullSize</font>);
 }
}

int __cdecl wmain(int argc, PWSTR argv[])
{
 <a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/20/135841.aspx">CCoInitialize</a> init;
 if (SUCCEEDED(init)) {
  WIN32_FIND_DATAW fd = {};
  fd.dwFileAttributes = FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL;
  fd.nFileSizeLow = 42;
  <font COLOR=blue>CComPtr&lt;IShellItem2&gt; spsi2;</font>
  if (SUCCEEDED(<font COLOR=blue>CreateSimpleShellItemFromPath</font>(&amp;fd,
                L"Q:\\Whatever.txt", <font COLOR=blue>IID_PPV_ARGS(&amp;spsi2)</font>))) {
   DoStuffWith(<font COLOR=blue>spsi2</font>);
  }
 }
 return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
Instead of creating a simple pidl,
we create a simple shell item
and then extract the same information from it it as before,
just doing it the
<code>IShell&shy;Item</code> way.</p>

		<p>9 hours later and still no comments &#8211; I guess creating fake shell items just isn&#39;t a great conversation starter.</p>

		<p>I would expect that there&#39;s not much to be said about this version that wasn&#39;t already said about the pidl version. But Raymond&#39;s correct too; certainly most of the Win32 stuff is over my head so I just try to understand it as best I can, but usually have nothing to contribute by way of comment.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
