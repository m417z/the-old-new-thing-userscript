		<p>Kip: maybe he was in a meeting?</p>
<p>Or, maybe some other new employee stole his private parking space on the same day? ;-)</p>
<p>And, still the same day, somebody stole his limo so he had to rent a Lexus and therefore didn&#8217;t care much about the damages since his Platina Hertz card, or whatever, takes care of such issues.</p>
<p>(Woho, build is completed&#8230; back to that console)</p>

		<p>So Lexus has been around since about 1989 and BillG wouldn&#8217;t be driving a car at any other MS site, so there must be about 100,000 possible suspects at the Redmond campus between 1989 and now.</p>
<p>Personally I reckon it was Raymond :)</p>

		<p>Unfortunately it&#8217;s not clear what alarm has been set off. Is it the building&#8217;s security alarm? How was it triggered? The story would have been so much better if we knew what got this hapless n00b into this predicament.</p>

		<p>AJ: Bill&#8217;s Friend, Warren, drives a Lincoln. &nbsp;Your point is that rich people should drive more expensive cars than Lexi?</p>
<hr />
<p>A great quote once from a WSJ article (&quot;In Tough Times for CEOs, They Head to Warren Buffett&#8217;s Table,&quot; by Monica Langley):</p>
<p>After paying $35 in cash for the two dinners, Mr. Buffett prepared to drive his fellow billionaire [Gates] back tot eh airport. &nbsp;But his first new car in 10 years, a Lincoln Town Car whose license plate says &quot;THRIFTY,&quot; wouldn&#8217;t start. &nbsp;Mr. Gates says despite their best efforts, neither he nor Mr. Buffett could unlock the steering wheel. &nbsp;So the two richest men in the U.S. were stranded in the Gorat&#8217;s parking lot, until the called a taxi to pick them up.</p>
<hr />
<p>I had dinner once at that Gorat&#8217;s a few years ago, just a few tables away from Mr. Gates and Mr. Buffett. &nbsp;Their personal modesty is one thing that impressed me.</p>

		<p>A few years back when I was on an internship at a company here in the Vancouver, BC area we had to head down to Seattle for some field testing of a product. It was only my third day at work. We rented a car from the airport and drove down to Seattle, doing some testing along the way. Since we had a lot of work to do, we ended up staying up till around midnight. The next morning I was a bit groggy when were going to leave the motel. I was pulling out of the parking spot, and noticed the one next to me was free, so I swung out a little wide and&#8230;. slammed the front passenger side right in to a concrete pillar in the adjacent spot. I managed to rip up the fender pretty good, but fortunately the car was still drivable. The company had insurance so it wasn&#8217;t a big deal and my coworker and my HR rep promised to keep it a secret but of course it wasn&#8217;t long till the word got out and I was known as &quot;the intern who crashed the car&quot;.</p>

		<p>I seem to recall that during whatever election year it was that Ross Perot first ran for president (1992 I think) it was revealed that he still drove a 1983 Chevy Nova. So, just because you&#8217;re rich doesn&#8217;t mean you drive the best car in the world &#8211; geeks in particular are known for having lackluster automobiles and preferring to spend their money elsewhere.</p>

		<p>Of course if he had dented Bill Gates&#8217; Porsche 959, he may not have been so forgiving. :) &nbsp;I applaud his good sense in driving a Lexus. &nbsp;Dollar for dollar, there&#8217;s no better car. &nbsp;But he is also a bit of a car guy as well. &nbsp;I believe he has around a dozen or two fairly pricey automobiles? &nbsp;Nothing like Jay Leno crazy, but nothing so thrifty as Warren Buffet either. &nbsp;Still, I salute Bill for not getting into the super-yacht pissing match between Paul Allen and Larry Ellison and for not buying a 767 party plane like Brin and Page. &nbsp;Instead, he has put his billions toward some very worthy causes.</p>

		<p>Bill Gates driving a Lexus is correct, as of three months ago. I was driving to work one morning down the 520, looked at a Lexus SUV passing me in the carpool lane, and it was Bill and (I&#8217;m assuming) his kids. I thought that was pretty cool that the richest dad in the world drives his kids around :)</p>

		<p>So I&#8217;m interested to hear who that was, if only for the reason that I&#8217;m pretty sure it didn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>I was an intern at MS in the summer of 2004, and that exact story was told to us at orientation as part of the set of standard corporate &#8220;feel-good&#8221; videos. &nbsp;As I was a graduating intern, I got to go to Gates&#8217; house at the end of the summer for a BBQ and Q&amp;A. &nbsp;While most of the other interns asked fairly boring questions like &#8220;where do you think software is going,&#8221; etc, I retold that story to Bill and asked if it was true. &nbsp;He said it was definitely *un*-true; and seemed to find it amusing that they were regaling new employees with it. &nbsp;He did say that at one point he backed into someone else&#8217;s car though.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>I worked with the subject of this story for many years. It&#8217;s possible that over time, details have been embellished to the point where it isn&#8217;t factually true any more. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>This reminds me of a story from a company where I used to work. &nbsp;One of the perks was that we could borrow the company cars for personal use as long as they weren&#8217;t needed for business. &nbsp;One day, one of my colleagues borrowed one and crashed it&#8230;and then it turned out that he didn&#8217;t have a valid driving license!</p>

		<p>Are you sure the mail was really from Gates? It seems almost obvious to me that it was a prank mail from somebody who spotted the note on the car&#8217;s windshield and took it away. Maybe it was the owner of the car himself, and he decided to let it pass but played a little joke instead.</p>

		<p>Poor guy lost his job over that fender-bender. He was in the marketing department and Bill figured that anyone that honest would never succeed there.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
