<p>
One of the challenges of developing Windows&nbsp;8 for ARM devices
is that, well, for a long time,
there were no Windows ARM devices to test on,
which made it more difficult to verify that the designs were suitable
and that performance was acceptable.
Eventually, the devices started to materialize,
and it became possible to run Windows on the ARM devices to see
how well things actually worked.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, the devices that initially
showed up were not the final "ready for market" devices.
After all, the hardware companies were busy developing the devices
at the same time the Windows team was developing the software
to run on them.
</p>
<p>
One of the problems in the earlier builds of the devices
was that the power management drivers and firmware were not very reliable.
The devices would sometimes drop into low-power mode even
though they were in active use,
or they would shut off the touch sensor due to inactivity and
be slow to power it back on when the user touched the screen.
These are the sorts of glitches you expect from something that
is still under development.
</p>
<p>
One of the tricks we used to isolate these firmware and driver
glitches was to apply a configuration we nicknamed the
<i>speed of light</i>.
In this configuration,
all the power management features were disabled,
and the machine ran at full power all the time,
never shutting off <i>anything</i>.
The idea here is that the speed of light was the absolute
maximum performance you could get from the device,
in the same way that in physics, the speed of light is the
absolute maximum speed at which an object can travel.
</p>
<p>
Now, in practice, the speed of light performance would
not be achieved,
but it at least let us know when a performance problem
could be blamed on hardware (and therefore could be improved
by future iterations of hardware),
or whether it was fundamentally a software issue.
For example, if calculations took too long under the
speed of light configuration,
then you knew that you had no choice but to
do some software optimization of the calculations
because you're already pushing the hardware to the maximum.
The hardware isn't going to save you.
</p>
<p>
I was amused by one piece of email that was sent to the performance
team regarding the speed of light configuration.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
Hi, I followed the instructions to set up the speed of light
configuration,
and I found that it crashes after about ten to thirty minutes
of continuous use.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The speed of light configuration is totally unsupported.
Since all the power management safeguards were disabled,
the thermal sensor that said "Whoa, I'm running really hot!
Could you drop to low power for a while?"
was being ignored.
A common side effect of the speed of light configuration was
random crashes due to overheating.
</p>
<p>
Such are the dangers of travelling at the speed of light.</p>

		<p>MIPS was also a target architecture for Windows NT, albeit briefly.  There was also the Intel i860, which was used for testing the HAL layer in Windows NT but never saw a formal release.  Not to mention the Alpha AXP architecture, which NT supported for awhile, as well as the PowerPC architecture.  And of course there was Itanium, though that wasn&#8217;t a RISC architecture in the least.</p>
<p>Windows CE supported several RISC architectures, including ARM.  Not going to bother listing them here, but Wikipedia&#8217;s got most of them covered.</p>

		<p>Theres a book called Showstopper. (ISBN: 978-0029356715) its a very good read and covers the development of Windows NT.</p>
<p>IIRC they initially targetted Intel RISC chips (i840 and i960) and avoided x86 so that platform specific stuff didn&#8217;t creep in.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s a terrible book. It tries to tell the story of the development of NT, and that story would be void without technical details. The author tries to explain to a general public the complex concepts of modern OS architecture, concepts which he clearly doesn&#8217;t understand. I doubt it will be easy to read for non &#8220;computer people&#8221;, and its lack of concretion is certainly unsatisfying for engineers and computer historians.</p>

		<p>I know exactly what you mean. But it is a good read anyways, because you get to know some of the key people in the development of NT better.</p>
<p>For myself, I soved the problem by reading the first edition of &#8220;Inside Windows NT&#8221; (H. Custer, Microsoft Press, 1992) alongside. It provides the technical detail where &#8220;Showstopper!&#8221; falls short.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m kind of amazed the speed of light setting ignored thermal warnings. Oh well. If it had actually made it to release it would have been the thing I would set on a server.</p>

		<p>The response to thermal warnings is putting the processor in a lower consumption mode. Which relies on power management drivers. So, when you don&#8217;t trust power management, you can&#8217;t afford to switch power modes, and you are unable to respond to thermal warnings.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: I&#8217;m not surprised in the slightest.  The point of &#8220;speed of light&#8221; modify is to run the machine as fast as possible for debugging purposes.  The typical response to a warning from a thermal sensor is to throttle down the CPU in an attempt to lower the thermal load.  If &#8220;speed of light&#8221; were to throttle the CPU in response to those warnings, then what would be the point of it in the first place?</p>

		<p>Harking back to the &#8220;You&#8217;re not debugging hard enough&#8221; story from earlier in the week.  Frying hardware from software (which I did once, a very long time ago) is a sign that you are trying hard enough.  There&#8217;s a reason why the first, top-level test that you do has traditionally been called a &#8220;smoke test&#8221;.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: if I could emphasize &#8220;for debugging purposes, I would, but I&#8217;m limited by the text input box for comments.  Frying hardware is an occasional consequence of debugging, and it&#8217;s a risk you take should you ignore those warnings.  It&#8217;s also a damned good reason why it should NOT be used in production, including for servers.  I suspect that &#8220;speed of light&#8221; was intended for, and primarily used for, short-term debugging.</p>

		<p>It wasn&#8217;t even for debugging purposes. It was for performance evaluation. You enabled the speed of light configuration, ran your scenario, and then turned it off. You then checked whether your scenario had acceptable performance. If not, then you had to go fix it in software because you know that the hardware is already giving you all it got.</p>

		<p>I remember during early development of Windows phones, our solution to the overheating problems. You would get two cans of soda from the fridge, set one on the desk, set the phone on top of that, and set the other on top of the phone. You were then good for an hour or so.</p>
<p>We probably had the only liquid-cooled phones on the planet.</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
