<p>I had another undeletable Outlook folder, and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/10/17/481810.aspx"> all my tricks for cajoling Outlook into letting me delete it failed</a>. I already deleted all the items in it, emptied it of offline items, deleted all the failures from my Sync Issues folder, but still I couldn't delete the folder.</p>
<p> But I came up with a new trick. </p>
<p> I moved the folder out of its normal location and made it a direct child of "Mailbox". As a result, it was no longer part of the list of synchronzized folders. I synchronized one more time, and then Outlook let me delete the folder. </p>
<p> As I noted before, I don't know if this'll work for you, but it's another trick you can add to your bag. </p>
<p> (And I still have three folders that I can't delete, despite trying both this trick and the previous one.) </p>

		<p>I know little about Outlook, but I&#8217;ve seen extensions causing all sorts of folder issues &#8211; have you tried safe mode (outlook /safe)?</p>

		<p>This is one of the reasons I keep a VPC image around with the final version of Exchange 5.0 client from Outlook 97 SR-2. &nbsp;It has no problems deleting anything. &nbsp;Also it lets you move multiple folders around in an explorer like folder list view. &nbsp;For some reason these features were removed within Outlook.</p>

		<p>whenever I&#8217;ve had a folder Outlook won&#8217;t let me delete, I&#8217;ve been able to do so with Outlook Web Access. Could try that.</p>

		<p>I have an unrenameable Outlook folder. Once upon a time, many years ago, Exchange dogfood had a little amnesia, and decided my Drafts folder was a regular mail folder, noticed I didn&#8217;t have a folder for drafts, so created a new folder which of course had to be called Drafts1. This setup has survived server moves and upgrades. I left the regular folder in place hoping, oh, I don&#8217;t know, maybe one day some fairy godmother would come along and restore the canonical state of affairs.</p>
<p>But even if I move the regular folder &quot;Drafts&quot; to trash (which I can), it won&#8217;t let me rename Drafts1 because, you know, you can&#8217;t delete or rename a special folder. Even if it doesn&#8217;t have the right name.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a little oddity that I have no problem living with.</p>

		<p>David: If it even annoys you a little, you can run: &quot;outlook.exe /resetfoldernames&quot; which will (unsurprisingly enough), reset all the special folder names to the originals.</p>

<p>Funny, like if there was ever a way to rename them in the first place?!?</p>

		<p>There is a way to rename Outlook&#8217;s special folders. &nbsp;When installing the English language pack on a client, it even changes the folder names for that user on servers that it can access. &nbsp;(I don&#8217;t know what happens if a server isn&#8217;t accessible at the time the language pack is installed.)</p>

		<p>We just recently had a hell of a time setting up a front-end Exchange server for OWA. We don&#8217;t have an SSL certificate yet (don&#8217;t ask, the beaurocracy here is ridiculous), so we had forms based authentication disabled. It would not let us login even from the front-end server, though we could log in to the backend server fine. After a couple weeks of messing with it, someone had the bright idea of turning on forms based authentication even though it&#8217;s only for use with SSL, and viola, it works like a charm.</p>
<p>Now we can wait a year to get approval for the SSL certificate through the chain of command, and see if that breaks anything new. :P</p>

		<p>Igor, the outlook.exe /resetfoldernames option is specifically to fix localisation issues.</p>
<p>For instance if I use a Dutch version of Outlook and I connect to my Exchange mailbox for the first time, it will create Dutch folder names as it should. But if someone sends me an e-mail before I have ever connected, the folders will be created using the language of Exchange, usually English.</p>
<p>In this case /resetfoldernames would allow me to recreate them in Dutch.</p>

		<p>I have to say, the &quot;eat your own dogfood&quot; ethos in MS is one of the things that really impresses me.</p>

		<p>OWA is much better at deleting errant folders than Outlook.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
