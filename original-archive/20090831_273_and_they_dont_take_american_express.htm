		<p>Isn&#8217;t that scenario a part of the reason why Elon Musk is today a multimillionaire and reasonably famous software entrepreneur?</p>

		<p>Enough places take credit cards that you can&#8217;t count on random people to have cash anymore. I make an effort to keep $20 in my wallet just in case, but if I didn&#8217;t I would be walking around cashless most of the time.</p>

		<p>Many places here don&#8217;t take credit cards, but pretty much *everywhere* accepts EFTPOS cards (debit cards). &nbsp;It&#8217;s a very rare day when I have more than $1 (in 10c/20c pieces) in my wallet.</p>

		<p>It always really annoys me when I&#8217;m in line behind one of those people who want to pay for thing by card. It just takes *so long* and holds everything up.</p>
<p>Plus if you want to pay by debit/credit card in a small shop, there&#8217;ll probably be a charge, or at least a minimum spend.</p>
<p>The whole business just seems like a major hassle to me for anything less than maybe &#163;50, so I really don&#8217;t understand how anybody can not carry cash on them.</p>

		<p>Most places have a Point-of-sale terminal that is no slower to process a card that the cashier is to make change. I use a card as much as possible so as to be able to track my purchases</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
