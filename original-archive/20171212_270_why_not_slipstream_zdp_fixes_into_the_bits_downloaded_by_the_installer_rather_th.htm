In a comment on my discussion of ZDP fixes,
cheong00 wonders
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20160809-00/?p=94045#comment-1259615">
why the ZDP isn't just slipstreamed into the bits downloaded by the
installer</a>.
That way, when you install, you get the latest version right away
and not have to wait for a separate patching step.
</p>
<p>
There are multiple steps of installing, and they may take place
at different times.
</p>
<ol>
<li>When you download the installer itself.</li>
<li>When you run the installer to obtain bits.</li>
<li>When you install those bits.</li>
<li>When you boot up with those bits.</li>
</ol>
<p>
The interesting period for the purpose of this discussion
is the time between the steps 2 and 4.
If that time period is very short, then the bits obtained by the
installer contain all the latest fixes, and the search for a ZDP
in step&nbsp;4 comes back with "You're up to date. No worries."
</p>
<p>
The problem comes when the time period between steps 2 and 4
is very long.
</p>
<p>
For example, you buy a packaged product from the store.
(Yes, you can still get packaged product for Windows.
Dunno if they are still available in stores.
Or if stores even still exist.)
Who knows how long that box has been sitting on the shelf,
or in a warehouse before that?
</p>
<p>
An even more extreme case of this is
the computer with Windows preinstalled.
Computer manufacturers typically require several months
of lead time before a computer finally hits store shelves.
They need that time not just to run their own acceptance
testing on the latest version of Windows.
That time also is incorporated into each computer that is manufactured:
After the operating system is installed
and the computer passes quality assurance,
it is packed onto a cargo ship for a long, slow trip
across the ocean.
And then it arrives in a warehouse and gets moved to
another warehouse, and then it sits in that other warehouse
for several weeks before it goes out to a store,
and then it sits in the store for several weeks before somebody
buys it.
(This entire process is known in the jargon as the <i>channel</i>.)
</p>
<p>
This means that the copy of Windows on the computer
you just bought is typically several months out of date
even before you even turn it on.
</p>
<p>
That is the scenario that the ZDP is designed for,
and which I sort of put forth as the scenario in question
in the original article:
You unpack a computer from its box, turn it on,
and
<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Out-of-box_experience">
OOBE</a>
runs and checks if there are any updates
that came out since the bits were originally obtained.
</p>
<p>
So going back to the original question:
Yes indeed, the installer downloads the latest bits,
including any ZDP fixes.
But the problem is that at the time the installer downloads
those bits,
there may not be a ZDP yet.</p>

		<p>It depends on the size of the patches involved.</p>
<p>If the size is large, when installing over metered connection (say, in places where people still using modems. And even in small places like Hong Kong, there are some rural area that no ISP bother to provide broadband/fiber network and people living there is forced to use cellular data to surf the internet) I think most such people won&#8217;t mind waiting longer (say 20-30 minutes) to start install in order to save some bandwidth.</p>

		<p>What happens when you don&#8217;t have an internet connection during the initial setup? Is the OOBE ZDP deferred to the first time you get a connection? Which may mean you don&#8217;t get the &#8220;play-around&#8221; week mentioned in the other ZDP post, even if it is a critical fix.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
