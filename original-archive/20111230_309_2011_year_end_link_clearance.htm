For when going to Costco is just too much work to get your     rotisserie chicken entertainment.     (Psst, Canada. If you're out of ideas, you can take MTV.     We're not using it.)

This is clear if <i>A</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>B</i> are finite sets,     but the infinite case is much trickier. </li>

"When I used the word SLURM, I didn't mean the obscene     word SLURM" (note: not actually an obscene word, yet),     "I was referring to my great-grandfather Ronald Slurm."     Yeah, right.

		<p>Mathematically it&#39;s appealing to have a TV channel which is infinite and without discontinuities.</p>
<p>The fireplace channel seems to come quite close to this, especially if it&#39;s a gas fireplace. &nbsp;A wood fireplace would occasionally need more wood added, which would add a minor discontinuity.</p>
<p>The fish tank channel has some minor inherent discontinuities: feed the fish, remove dead fish, add new live fish, etc.</p>
<p>The sunset channel and the rotisserie chicken channel worry me, though, because sunsets and roasting a chicken have an inherent finite timespan. &nbsp;What happens when the sun is set, or the chickens are cooked?</p>

		<p>Wow something like ShapeCatcher should be built into the Windows Character Map. Windows has a lesser used shape recognition API, why not use it.</p>
<p>&quot;The Evolution of Sorting&quot; should be titled &quot;The Regression in Sorting&quot; as the evil Windows Vista/7/8 STILL DON&#39;T LET YOU DISABLE AUTO SORT/REFRESH (always on sort state) AND AUTO ARRANGE in Explorer forcing your files to get scattered on copy-paste and jump on rename or new item creation. No amount of ranting, feedback or begging will make MS fix it: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/windowsdeveloperpreviewgeneral/thread/27314d0a-9c70-4b79-93e7-23fe60e7e374" rel="nofollow">social.msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/27314d0a-9c70-4b79-93e7-23fe60e7e374</a> . It is probably the single most annoying usability problem in Explorer. Whatever team worked on Vista/7 Explorer shell have no understanding of usability or was probably a bunch of interns fooling around with the file manager. They should have been fired right after Vista but are probably busy sticking a Ribbon in Windows 8 Explorer.</p>

		<p>Regarding the scam investigation, one of the scammers in question is set to go on trial soon, presumably for a similar scam. His lawyer filed a motion to be relieved as counsel last week, though, so there could be more delays. I&#39;m guessing that the guy scammed his own lawyer so now the lawyer doesn&#39;t want to have to defend him anymore.</p>

		<p>You can get a shortcut for un-hiding file extensions by installing StExBar or just write your own script that toggles the reg key to show/hide extensions and stick in the background context menu by editing the registry.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
