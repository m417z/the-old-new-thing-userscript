		<p>&quot;Surstr√∂mming is even classified as hazardous material by some airlines.&quot;</p>
<p>Ironically, when airlines banned Surstr√∂mming from planes back in 2006 the producers of the &quot;delicacy&quot; called the decision &quot;culturally illiterate&quot; and said &quot;It is a myth that the tinned fish can explode.&quot; </p>

		<p>I imagine that the only effect it can have on the supply of the ice cream is positive.</p>

		<p>This is a catastrophe! Imagine how you must cut down on your snaps consumption! I think that the reason for surstr√∂ming is to get an GOOD excuse drinking lot of snaps.</p>
<p>BTW &#8211; it actually tastes good if you close your nostrils before consumting :)</p>
<p>I don&#39;t think the can will explode by itself. It was the heat that made it explode.</p>
<p>For &quot;normal&quot; consumption you must observe two rules:</p>
<p>1. Don&#39;t open indoor</p>
<p>2. Open the can below water to take the pressure with the can is punctured</p>

		<p>Rumours are that the European Union will no longer allow production and sale of surstr√∂mming. The water in Botniska Viken is so polluted that pepople who eat surstr√∂mming regularly could be seriously poisoned. I have friends who invite to a surstr√∂mming-party once a year, and if the rumours are true, we may have to stock cans for the next umpteen years. I hope someone will develop a remote-controlled can-opening robot before the pressure in the cans build up to dangerous levels.</p>

		<p>My parents introduced me to lots of Norwegian foods (wonderful stuff like lefse, rosettes and krumkake!) but conveniently &quot;forgot&quot; about lutefisk. Now I know why. At least lutefisk can be classified as &quot;somewhat edible&quot; compared to surstr√∂mming :-)</p>

		<p>Okay, so surstr√∂mming, I kind of understand. &nbsp;Oh, we don&#39;t have enough salt in this batch. &nbsp;Huh, it&#39;s not killing us when we eat it. &nbsp;Hey, it saves precious salt!</p>
<p>Rotten shark is yet another food that I don&#39;t understand how humanity ever got around to eating. &nbsp;Wow, this shark kills us from the inside if we eat it. &nbsp;I wonder what happens if I let it rot until it smells like cat piss? &nbsp;Oh, it doesn&#39;t kill us anymore *even though it still tastes like cat piss* so we should make more of it!</p>

<p>No, Raymond is a &quot;strange attractor&quot; for odd (cultural/Swedish/etc) storieds. That is, propery of &quot;Raymond&quot; (not &quot;Microsoft&quot;).</p>

		<p>Because we &quot;love&quot; microsoft so much we really need to send lots of surstr√∂mming cans to them.</p>
<p>Perhaps with a device that will automatically open the can when it have reached its destination. For that extra cherry on the top love.</p>
<p>Leaving one of these cans open and hidden in an office or home and it will smell for days. Such a fun prank to play.</p>
<p>Somebody passing by suggested baking a cake with diarrhea inducing medicine. Hilarious when the office or home do not have enough toilets available.</p>

		<p>@Its the gift that counts:</p>
<p>Even better a surstr√∂mming cake!</p>
<p>*Ponders for a second if I should make one. Feeling hungry. Will it work in a am√∂rg√•st√•rta (&quot;sandwich-cake&quot; see wikipedia)?</p>
<p>Mmhh am√∂rg√•st√•rta.</p>

		<p>@Kirby FC Is it the can itself or what&#39;s inside that is considered hazardous material?</p>
<p>Would they allow me to transport the contents if I put the surstr√∂mming in another container&#8230; while in the airport?</p>
<p>That would be a fun experiment.</p>
<p>On that note: How bad can you smell before they refuse to allow you on the plane?</p>
<p>How do surstr√∂mming compare to natt≈ç?</p>
<p>@Raymond Do you like surstr√∂mming?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
