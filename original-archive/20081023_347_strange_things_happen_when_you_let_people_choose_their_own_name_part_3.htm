<p>Although Microsoft employees are internally assigned a cryptic email address by the IT department, the email address used for mail to and from the outside world  is open to customization, to some degree.</p>
<p> For example, consider an imaginary employee named Christopher Columbus. Christopher might be assigned an email address like <a href="http://www.crisco.com/"> <code>chrisco</code></a> or <code>chriscol</code> or <code>ccolum</code> or possibly the Slavic-sounding <code>chrco</code>. But Christopher has the option of choosing the external email address: When he sends a message to somebody outside Microsoft, the "From" line will show the external address, and if somebody from outside Microsoft sends mail to the external address, it will get routed to Christopher. </p>
<p> When you choose your external name, you have a few options. The most basic version consists of your first and last name, separated with a dot: <code>Christopher.Columbus&part;microsoft.com</code>. You can include your middle name or initial, to distinguish you from other people who have the same name: <code>Christopher.Q.Columbus&part;microsoft.com</code>. There are other possibilities, like using your nickname or initials instead of your legal name, but that's the basic idea. There is one final option: Don't have separate external and internal email addresses; just use your internal email address for both. </p>
<p> I had a brief conversation with somebody who, as it happened, encountered a bug in the tool that lets you choose your external email address. This person wanted something fairly standard like <code>Robin.Williams&part;microsoft.com</code> but for reasons not worth going into since they're not important to the story, a bug in the system ended up assigning the external address <code>Robin.Robin&part;microsoft.com</code>. (Note: Not Robin's real name, so don't try sending to it.) </p>
<p> The IT department fixed the bug, but Robin decided to keep the erroneously-assigned email address. I'm somewhat jealous: It's not often that a database glitch ends up giving you a cool email address. </p>

		<p>Is it really all that strange, the things that happen when people choose their own names? Ever since BBS&#8217;s and things like that, and much more now on the Internet, people have been using handles and nicknames that they pick themselves. The names people choose for themselves are not that exciting and hardly &quot;strange&quot;&#8230;</p>

		<p>A similar thing happened with me, only the mistake was made with my alias, which was a mash-up of my first name twice. &nbsp;When I went from contractor to full time, I was offered a new alias, but, by then everyone knew me by my unique alias and it was a conversation piece so I asked to keep it. &nbsp;:)</p>

		<p>About 10 years ago my UK ISP decided to do something about spam. Back then I got about 10 spam emails a day. They managed to get honey pot addresses onto the spammers lists, i.e. email addresses that only spammers used. Then if any email was sent to the honey pot address all copies of it were deleted from everyone else&#8217;s address. I wonder if Robin.Robin∂microsoft.com is a honey pot address? Or if Microsoft&#8217;s IT department will start using it as one. </p>

		<p>I used to work with somebody called Dot.</p>
<p>Hearing her telling her email address over the phone was always amusing. (I&#8217;m easily amused).</p>
<p>If this had happened to her, she&#8217;d have ended up with the email address</p>
<p>dot.dot∂microsoft.com</p>
<p>Of course, this might make no sense to Americans if they say &#8220;Period&#8221; instead of &#8220;Dot&#8221; when they&#8217;re spelling out email addresses.</p>

<p>In my experience, Americans say &quot;dot&quot; when talking about email addresses or URIs, but &quot;period&quot; pretty much everywhere else. Being consistent is too Old World for us.</p>

		<p>A bazillion years ago, I signed up for an AOL account. (This was back where it was still called &quot;America Online&quot;; they used Geo instead of Windows for their client; and before they started carpet bombing the world with floppies)</p>
<p>During the sign-up process, they asked for your first name and last name, which they would then use to create your screen name. The format they used at the time was {First name}{Last Initial}{Numeric disambiguator}. &nbsp;So, I probably should have been &quot;JamesC1234&quot; or something similar.</p>
<p>However, since they didn&#8217;t say that this was going to become my screen name, and as I had recently finished college and entered the industry, and wanted to distinguish myself from my father (who had the same name), I appended my middle initial to my name in the First Name field. This produced a screen name distictive enough that only one previous person had it, yielding &quot;James MC2&quot;</p>
<p>So, to AOL, I was &quot;James MC-squared&quot;!</p>

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
