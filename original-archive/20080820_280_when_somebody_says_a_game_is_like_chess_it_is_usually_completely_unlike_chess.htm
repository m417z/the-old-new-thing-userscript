<p>Chess has become elevated to the gold standard of board games. Everybody wishes their game had the cultural gravity of chess, a game whose mere mention elevates you to the category of <i>deep thinker</i> and <i>profound strategist</i>. (We'll set aside the scrawny glasses-wearing nerd part for now.)</p>
<p> I've learned that when somebody says a game is like chess, it's pretty much guaranteed that the game in fact bears no resemblance to chess whatsoever. </p>
<p> I came to this realization when somebody pulled out a game with a strange-looking board with what looked like plastic volcanoes glued to the surface, catwalks, and a lazy susan. Each player was represented by a token, set in its respective starting position. I asked, "Hey, what's this game?" </p>
<p> The person replied, "It's a lot like chess. First you <a href="http://www.stern.de/em2008/fotostrecken/allgemein/:Fu%DFballer-Spr%FCche-Wie-Schach-W%FCrfel/622828.html?cp=23"> roll the dice</a>..." </p>

		<p>While bearing little relationship in mechanics, I would think games like Go and Diplomacy could be put on similar footing. &nbsp;No element of randomness, a lot of strategy and a general attraction to the geek set.</p>

		<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.khet.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.khet.com/</a> this is the only game that has come close to chess for me. I actually like this one a lot better than chess. It is basically chess with lasers. There are some upgrades, like the Beam splitter pieces which add a whole new level of complexity. The Second level where they attempt to make a 3d chess, eh, everyone I have played that tried to use it if I didn&#8217;t, then I won.</p>

		<p>As the late George Carlin said (and I shamelessly ripped off; &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2003/10/16/53224.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/ericlippert/archive/2003/10/16/53224.aspx</a> )</p>
<p>&quot;Even volleyball is, technically, racketless, team Ping-Pong played with an inflated ball and raised net while standing on the table.&quot;</p>
<p>Clearly chess is also a form of racketless ping-pong, where instead of taking turns hitting a ball, you take turns moving pieces.</p>

		<p>I think when people say a board game is &quot;like Chess&quot;, they mean that there&#8217;s lots of public information, and it&#8217;s possible to think ahead to what your opponent is likely to do next, and how you might respond, and how they might respond to that.</p>
<p>Starting by rolling dice doesn&#8217;t mean a game isn&#8217;t like Chess, if the die roll is only used to determine who goes first, for example. But the larger the luck element and the more hidden information, the further away from Chess you&#8217;re getting, I guess.</p>
<p>Personally, I don&#8217;t mind games that have a luck factor, but I feel the luck should determine what plans you can choose from. (As in, say, Hearts.) It shouldn&#8217;t determine whether your plan succeeds or fails once you&#8217;ve put it into action. (Like Risk; I decide to invade and you roll 6s ten times in a row. Bah!)</p>

		<p>Remind me of the occasional heard phrase &quot;The human mind works just like a computer&quot;.</p>
<p>This always bothered my for two reasons:</p>
<p>1) The mind came first, so the copy should be compared to the original, not vice versa: (&quot;A computer works just like the human mind&quot;)</p>
<p>2) A computer works absolutely nothing like the human mind.</p>

		<p>I think the purpose is really to divide your players.</p>
<p>Chess has all of six different pieces, only two of which (the pawn and the knight) have even remotely confusing movement and capture methods. If a person cannot play chess, that person almost certainly cannot play ANY game with multiple unit types.</p>
<p>So any game with multiple unit types can be accurately represented as &quot;a lot like chess&quot; in the sense that if you are too stupid to play chess, you are probably too stupid to play this game, too.</p>

		<p>&quot;If a person cannot play chess, that person almost certainly cannot play ANY game with multiple unit types. &quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I stick to Go, where there&#8217;s only one type of peice. &nbsp;And they don&#8217;t move. &nbsp;Chess is too confusing!</p>
<p>Over the years, I&#8217;ve often seen someone try to explain Go to people as being &quot;like chess&quot;. &nbsp;The irony, to me at least, is that Go is <em>more</em> demanding of &quot;thinking deeply&quot; and &quot;strategizing profoundly&quot; than chess.</p>
<p>And the two games really aren&#8217;t alike. &nbsp;Go is more like beach volleyball. &nbsp;But without the sports bras.</p>

<p>(Go is played on the intersections, where Chess is played on the squares. Hence a 9&#215;9 Go board can be used as a Chess board.)</p>

		<p>If you&#8217;re truly insane, you can multiplex a (small) game of Go and a game of Chess on the same board at the same time.</p>

<p>&quot;&#8230;eh, everyone I have played that tried to use it if I didn&#8217;t, then I won.&quot;</p>
<p>I mean no offense whatsoever, but that is a marvel of linguistic insanity. I love it.</p>
<p>@Jay Bazuzi</p>
<p>&quot;Go is more like beach volleyball. &nbsp;But without the sports bras.&quot;</p>
<p>You&#8217;re obviously not playing Go with the right people.</p>

		<p>Playing chess is like making love to a beautiful woman. Just when you&#8217;ve got everything in the position you want them, the queen jumps all the way across the board and you&#8217;re left on your own.</p>

		<p>Ens: I didn&#8217;t want to explain it, but&#8230;</p>
<p>My Dad says that analogies are useless. &nbsp;&quot;Tell me what something IS, not what it&#8217;s LIKE!!&quot;</p>
<p>So, when I heard &quot;Analogies are like feathers on a snake&quot;, I made it a point to tell him, and he thought it was clever. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t make it up, though, I stole it from somewhere.</p>
<p>Sometimes I say &quot;Analogies are like feathers on a snake: &nbsp;Useless, unneccessary, and unhelpful&quot;.</p>

		<p>&#8230; the earliest version of chess was played with dice. The Indian &quot;Four rajas&quot; game. The dice were removed from the game only later.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
