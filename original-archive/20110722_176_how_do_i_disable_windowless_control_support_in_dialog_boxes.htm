<p>A customer wanted to know how to disable windowless control support in dialog boxes. "The customer has a CommandButton ActiveX control on his dialog box, and using <code>Get&shy;Dlg&shy;Item</code> to get the window handle of the command button succeeded with VC&nbsp;6.0, but when compiled with VC&nbsp;9.0, it does not create a window. I'm guessing that this is caused by <code>Dialog&shy;Box</code>'s support for windowless controls. Is it possible to disable support for windowless controls?"</p>
<p> The question on its face is somewhat puzzling, because dialog boxes don't "support" or "not support" windowless controls. It's like asking, "I want rice that doesn't support meat. My customer is a vegetarian and cannot eat meat." Rice doesn't support meat, and it doesn't not-support meat. If you don't want meat, then don't add meat. And if you don't want windowless controls on your dialog box, then don't create windowless controls. </p>
<p> I was also not sure what the customer meant by CommandButton, because <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa511453.aspx"> Win32 command buttons are not ActiveX controls</a>. The customer must be referring to something else also called <code>Command&shy;Button</code>, in which case the customer should also consult the documentation for that something else to see if there's a way to control its windowed/windowless behavior. </p>
<p> The customer liaison gave some more details: "My customer uses <code>Get&shy;Dlg&shy;Item</code> to get the handle of a specific window. This method worked in VC&nbsp;6.0 since VC&nbsp;6.0 doesn't support windowless controls. But VC&nbsp;9.0 added support for windowless controls in dialog boxes, which breaks my customer's code. Is there a way to disable support for windowless controls in dialog boxes?" </p>
<p> It took a few more questions, but eventually we figured out that the customer was not using raw Win32 dialog boxes (as <code>Dialog&shy;Box</code> suggested in the original question) but rather MFC dialog boxes, and the CommandButton in question is a <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/180822"> Microsoft Forms 2.0 CommandButton control</a>. </p>
<p> "The customer simply wants to continue using his code without modification. He is already using the Microsoft Forms 2.0 CommandButton control, and he is already using <code>Get&shy;Dlg&shy;Item</code> to obtain its handle, but that technique no longer works." </p>
<p> The pieces started to fall into place, and somebody from the Visual Studio team provided an explanation: The version of MFC which comes with Visual Studio&nbsp;2000 added support for hosting windowless ActiveX controls. By default, the MFC hosting code permits controls to be added as windowless controls if the control requests it. To force all controls to be windowed, you need to provide a custom class which derives from <code>COle&shy;Control&shy;Site</code> and overrides <code>IOle&shy;In&shy;Place&shy;Site&shy;Windowless::<wbr>Can&shy;Windowless&shy;Activate</wbr></code> to return <code>S_FALSE</code>. Then override the dialog's <code>CWnd::<wbr>Create&shy;Control&shy;Site</wbr></code> method to return an instance of this class instead of the default control site. </p>
<p> I haven't actually tested this to see if it works, but the customer didn't come back, so either it worked, or they decided that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/tags/The+social+skills+of+a+thermonuclear+device/"> we were jerks</a> and didn't want to waste their time with us any more. </p>

		<p>What a mess.</p>
<p>Two things I hate: non-standard compilers and code that breaks because you upgraded the compiler. I&#39;m not sure which is worse.</p>

		<p>Joshua: Um, MFC isn&#39;t a compiler, it&#39;s a class library. And I thought Microsoft Forms was another library meant for VBA. And they were never meant to play together. So could you explain what you mean here?</p>

		<p>@Joshua:</p>
<p>You did notice it isn&#39;t the compiler upgrade that broke it, right? It&#39;s the framework that got a version bump, and had an new setting of which the default is incompatible in this particular case. Throw the old MFC version into the new compiler, and it is quite likely to work. (Then again, those old sources may or may not have relied on features/bugs that were changed in more recent revisions of the compiler and/or C++ standards.)</p>
<p>Besides, as it is, Microsoft probably released some kind of changes/upgrade document somewhere, but this customer would have had to find the right document for the right version-upgrade that introduced the change. After all, it is unlikely Microsoft would release VC6-&gt;VC9 transition documents. The only problem is finding it in the mess that is MSDN. :)</p>

<p>Exactly! I know MFC sources were shipped but what a pain (oh and now you have to private install them as your new build makes them incompatible with stock).</p>

		<p>Sadly we never found out why they felt the need to resort to manipulating an ActiveX control via a window handle in the first place&#8230;</p>

		<p>@immibis</p>
<p>I can take a reasonable guess: &nbsp;The original author of the code was a VB developer recently come to VC++. &nbsp;The VB versions of the standard controls had a number of nice convenience properties such as foreground/background color properties.</p>
<p>I suspect that he needed something like a custom foreground and found it easier to use the VB controls via ActiveX than to figure out WM_CTLCOLOR.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
