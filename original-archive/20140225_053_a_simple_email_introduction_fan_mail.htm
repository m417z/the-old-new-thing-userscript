<p>One of my former colleagues on the Windows kernel team wasn't afraid to make changes all across the system when necessary. If the engineering team decided to upgrade to a new version of the C++ compiler, my colleague was the one who gave it a test-drive on the entire Windows source code, and fixed all the warnings and errors that kick up as well as ensuring that it passed the build verification tests before updating the compiler in the official toolset. Beyond that, my colleague also ran around being a superhero, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/21/4486197.aspx#4494758"> writing tools that needed to be written</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/21/4486197.aspx"> fixing tools that were broken</a>, and generally <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/01/18/10116870.aspx"> being somebody</a>.</p>
<p> Since the effect on the Windows project was so far-reaching, everybody on the team knew this person, or at least recognized the name, and as a result, my colleage ended up receiving a lot of email about all different parts of Windows, be they bug reports, requests for help using a particular component, whatever. </p>
<p> And when the question was about something outside my colleague's sphere of responsibility, the message was forwarded to the correct people with a simple introduction: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  <b>From</b>: A<br> <b>To</b>: XYZ-owners, Y<br> <b>Subject</b>: Problem with XYZ </p>
<p> Fan mail. </p>
<div style="border-left: solid .75pt black; padding-left: 1em">
<p> <b>From</b>: Y<br> <b>To</b>: A<br> <b>Subject</b>: Problem with XYZ </p>
<p> Blah blah blah blah </p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<p> I've used this technique a few times, but it's been a while. I should start using it again. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: At least one of you has come out and said that you post your complaints here with the expectation that the complaints will be forwarded to the appropriate team. This expectation is false. No such forwarding occurs. This Web site is not a complaint desk. </p>

		<p>Mark VY: the way I read it, you&#39;re a fan of the original recipient&#8230; &nbsp;you&#39;re so impressed with him that you&#39;ve sent him email about something for which he isn&#39;t even responsible.</p>

		<p>Yay! I thought stories of colleagues were gone forever after the &quot;Bob&quot; issue. I love hearing stuff like this, Raymond, please continue :)</p>
<p>(also, very clever way to distract people from the identity guessing by throwing out the troll bait bonus chatter!)</p>

		<p>@Lawrence: I think one main difference here is that even if Raymond has one particular person in mind, the description likely falls on many people. Note: I have never worked with any of the people Raymond may be writing about.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
