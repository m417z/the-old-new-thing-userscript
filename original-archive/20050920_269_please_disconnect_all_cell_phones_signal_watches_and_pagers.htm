<p>Last Saturday night, a group of us (including <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/thewendyhouse/Blog/cns!1pi9WfzARsOGwOQNB3QnZaGw!1099.entry"> butt photographer</a> <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/thewendyhouse/"> Wendy</a>) attended <a href="http://www.seattlesymphony.org/symphony/press/kit/release_detail.aspx?ID=258"> a performance of the Seattle Symphony</a> consisting of the world premiere of the orchestral arrangement of Shafer Mahoney's <i>Sparkle</i>, Richard Strauss' <i>Don Quixote</i> (with guest soloist Lynn Harrell) and concluding with Brahms' Fourth Symphony. I was pleasantly surprised by the Mahoney. World premieres are a hit or miss affair (mostly miss), but <i>Sparkle</i> had wit and direction. It had the feel of an overture, because when it was over, I was expecting Act One to start. And even today, I can remember bits and pieces of it. If only all world premieres had such stickiness.</p>
<p> I didn't have high hopes for <i>Don Quixote</i> either, but for the opposite reason from <i>Sparkle</i>: Instead of being apprehensive for the unknown, I was dreading the known. In my opinion, the piece merely rambles on and on, and last night's performance... rambled on and on. About a quarter of the way through, the muffled electronic tones of a cell phone could be heard. Imagine our surprise when the guest soloist himself reached into his jacket pocket, pulled out his mobile telephone, and disengaged the ringer! My seats were in the center of the third row, so I had an excellent view of this surreal scene. (The first-desk second violins, who were counting rests at the time, found this rather amusing.) </p>
<p> The final piece was reassuringly Brahms. I wallowed in the melancholy of the falling thirds and the lyricism of the Andante, and smiled to myself whenever I caught the opening theme returning in a different guise. The performance seemed to rush in places, during which the orchestra had some difficulty keeping together, but I was satisfied overall. (Of the four symphonies, this one has the weakest ending, in my opinion.  It feels like he went, "Oh, right this is the last variation, I should put a big chord here.") </p>
<p> It so happens that my seat was positioned such that I was in the line of sight of the second first violin as well as the second second violin. When they were looking at their music, they were looking pretty much directly at me; it was kind of creepy. I could see their eyes dart from the music to their stand partner to the conductor. Both of them are long-time symphony members so I recognized them quickly enough, but my previous seats were much further away, so I only knew them from afar. Up close, I could read the expressions on their faces. The second first is really their acting concertmaster who sits second because <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/classical/220097_ssoconcertmaster.html"> the Seattle Symphony is auditioning for a permanent concertmaster after a messy break-up with the previous concertmaster</a>. She was all business, hardly cracking a smile the entire time; this is something that is completely lost on me when I'm in the upper orchestra much less the third balcony. (I had to scour the program to figure out who the guest concertmaster was this evening. Elisabeth Adkins' name was dropped into the program incidentally in a paragraph attributed to Gerard Schwarz. She wasn't listed as a guest artist or in the orchestra roster. It appears that <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/artsentertainment/2002488431_symph12.html"> Ms. Adkins is a finalist in the concertmaster search</a>. She did a fine job on stage, but the real work of the concertmaster is behind the scenes, so I don't know how well she fared there.) </p>

		<p>I ould have LOVED to see the reaction of both the solo artist and everybody else when he pulled out a cell phone.</p>
<p>After reading your title and 1st sentence I was expecting it to be somebody in the audience.  It&#8217;s amazing how ignorant people are when it comes to cell-tique.</p>

		<p>I suspect Mr. Harrell may never take a phone to the stage again.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
