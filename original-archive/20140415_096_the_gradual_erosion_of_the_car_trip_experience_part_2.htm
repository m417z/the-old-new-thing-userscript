		<p>If I use electronics in the car I tend to feel car sick now. &nbsp;Never happened when I was a kid. :(</p>
<p>Fortunately it&#39;s just with a 3DS or similar&#8230; with simple phone stuff I usually don&#39;t get sick.</p>

		<p>My kids are limited to 30 minutes of PC or TV a day. &nbsp;We recently went on a 18 hour road trip &#8212; so we gave them each a tablet with an assortment of games and movies. &nbsp;I was shocked that they could get so involved that they would only come up for air when we stopped for gas.</p>

		<p>Why not take the chance to insert science documentaries, or Nth-grade ABC or algebra games, in the electronic devices? &nbsp;They&#39;ll still be kind of knocked, but they&#39;ll be learning at the same time.</p>
<p>And the best part is, if they don&#39;t like the entertainment, they&#39;ll have to put up with the trip and/or sibling(s), as it was probably originally intended.</p>

		<p>A good dozen or fifteen years after graduating from college, my father remembered with distaste a ride he caught back home across the Midwest. I forget what song the driver kept singing, but it might have been &quot;Working on the Railway&quot;. This may be why I don&#39;t remember us singing on long car trips, of which we took quite a few.</p>

		<p>And while I&#39;m at it, shouldn&#39;t you count the interstates as part of the deterioration? I mean, why slide by Hagerstown on I-70 at speed, when you could be stopping at ever red light in the town, and as I recall taking a couple of cycles to get through each one?</p>

		<p>I would imagine that there are some families that like singing, and they sing on road trips. I recall having one friend growing up whose car actually had song books stowed away for just such occassions.</p>
<p>My family was not one of those that sang. I generally brought programming manuals with me to read. I can&#39;t remember what my siblings did on road trips, but I doubt it was anything more fun than playing with a tablet computer.</p>
<p>I suppose road trips are supposed to build character?</p>

		<p>@Lascaille: &nbsp;By TV what I really mean is Netflix or something from our XBMC library. &nbsp;They are also allowed to pool resources &#8212; so that all three could work together and select a 90 minute movie. &nbsp;They rarely do though. &nbsp;In practice they blow through their chores, play a few minutes of Minecraft or Terraria then go play outside or read a book &#8212; which is more or less what we wanted them to do in the first place.</p>

		<p>On vacation trips, my parents used to sing in two-part harmony, or, my dad did some string bass or tuba part singing &quot;bah, bah, bah&quot;. Problem was that he couldn&#39;t keep his foot steady when singing those tunes, so the driving tended to be a little bumpy, or what would you call it. We kids enjoyed it nevertheless.</p>

		<p>They refuse to sing even when you ask them to, anyway.</p>
<p>In my experience they play games in iPad for a while, then they&#39;ll sleep through the rest of car trip when they get tired.</p>

		<p>@TheMAZZTer: that&#39;s because grownups have some sort of &quot;link&quot; between their motion sensors in the ear and their eyes. The brain constantly compares what you see with what your ears tell you you should see (accelerations and such), and if there&#39;s a too large discrepancy you get sick. Which makes sense, because this can happen when you eat something unhealthy. In kids this protection is not yet active, because &quot;nature&quot; assumes that there are adults that wath over those kids. So kids can read while sitting in the backseat of a driving car, be hours on a swing (and walk flawlessly afterwards), spin around for minutes (and think you can spin around with them&#8230;) etc.</p>

		<p>Of course, if the kids have (some generic tablet device) with Frozen, or Tangled or some other top notch entertainment, there&#39;s no reason that using electronics excludes the trip turning into a joyous sing-a-long..</p>

		<p>Maybe I&#39;m being stupid and/or naive, but I&#39;ve told my kids there will be no electronics on our 10-week journey from New York to Alaska and back next summer. They will be keeping journals and taking photographs of the adventure for a memory book I will get published and bound for each of them.</p>

		<p>@Engywuck: I don&#39;t think that the motion-sickness effect is unique to adults or children. &nbsp;In my own life, for instance, I&#39;ve been able to read for hours on long car trips, plane trips, on boats, trains, whatever, ever since I learned to read. &nbsp;I&#39;m still that way now as an adult human. &nbsp;Every couple of months or so my fiancee and I go on a road trip to visit the extended family a couple of states &amp; about 300 miles away. &nbsp;They drive on the way up because I can use daylight to read books, and I usually do, for the whole drive up. &nbsp;On the way back, I drive the car, because my fiancee gets motion sickness from reading in the car. &nbsp;I&#39;m told that they have had motion sickness like that from childhood.</p>
<p>Also consider the MythBusters: they have done multiple episodes (two that I can recall) that involve motion sickness. &nbsp;One was a Shark Week special in which Adam got horribly sick due to the motion of their boat while Jamie was fine. &nbsp;Clearly they&#39;re both adult humans, so according to your theory, both of them should have been seasick, but that wasn&#39;t the case. &nbsp;Later they tested the extended MythBusters crew and only Adam Savage was proven to get motion sickness. &nbsp;There&#39;s definitely a lot of variation in humans regarding susceptibility to motion sickness, but I don&#39;t think that it correlates with age.</p>

		<p>Brian_EE: I&#39;m going to guess that during a round trip to Alaska you&#39;ll probably spend more than a week (close to 200 hours) in a car. What do you expect the kids to do for all that time? I certainly don&#39;t know enough songs to fill all that time. Are they going to be taking pictures from the car window and writing in their journals all that time?</p>
<p>When my mother did that trip with her family, it was before cars had seatbelts. Her father had seatbelts installed so there would be no wrestling in the back of the station wagon among the camping gear. It was also before cars had FM radios (let alone iPods or tape players), and my mother doesn&#39;t recall any singing, so there was no music for entertainment. She brought a stack of books to read (good thing she didn&#39;t get carsick!), and played the usual highway games of looking for license plates and such.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
