<p>
From a purely theoretical point of view, there is only one "want" code
you really need: <code>DLGC_WANTMESSAGE</code>.
All the others are just conveniences.
For example,
returning <code>DLGC_WANTARROWS</code> means
"I want this message if it is an arrow key; otherwise, I don't care."
It lets you write
</p>
<pre>
case WM_GETDLGCODE:
 return DLGC_WANTARROWS;
</pre>
<p>
instead of the more cumbersome (but equivalent)
</p>
<pre>
case WM_GETDLGCODE:
 if (lParam &amp;&amp;
     ((MSG*)lParam)-&gt;message == WM_KEYDOWN &amp;&amp;
     (wParam == VK_LEFT || wParam == VK_RIGHT ||
      wParam == VK_UP || wParam == VK_DOWN)) {
   return DLGC_WANTMESSAGE;
 }
 return 0;
</pre>
<p>
Similarly, <code>DLGC_WANTTAB</code> is equivalent to
returning <code>DLGC_WANTMESSAGE</code> if the message is a press of the
tab key,
and
<code>DLGC_WANTCHARS</code> is equivalent to
returning <code>DLGC_WANTMESSAGE</code> if the message is <code>WM_CHAR</code>.
</p>
<p>
And that leaves <code>DLGC_WANTALLKEYS</code>,
which is just another name for <code>DLGC_WANTMESSAGE</code>:
</p>
<pre>
#define DLGC_WANTALLKEYS    0x0004
#define DLGC_WANTMESSAGE    0x0004
</pre>
<p>
They mean the same thing but look at the situation
through different perspectives.
The <code>DLGC_WANTMESSAGE</code> value is more readable
if you return it as part of some larger decision-making process,
like we did with our mimicry of <code>DLGC_WANTTAB</code>:
You do a bunch of tests and then when you decide, "I guess I want
this one," you return <code>DLGC_WANTMESSAGE</code>.
On the other hand,
the <code>DLGC_WANTALLKEYS</code> value is more readable
if you are just returning it unconditionally.
"I want all keys, no matter what it is."
</p>
<p>
It's like when you're at the grocery store,
and the bagger asks you,
"Would you like me to help you carry your watermelon to your car?"
You can say "Yes" or "Always"; the result is the same.
The only difference is one of expectation: If you expect to
meet the same bagger in the future, and the bagger remembers,
then "Always" implies "You don't need to ask me again."
The dialog manager, on the other hand, doesn't have that good of a memory,
and in fact, if you think about it, you <i>don't want it to have a good
memory</i>.
</p>
<p>
Suppose the dialog manager remembered whether you said "Always"
and stopped asking you in the
future.<font FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">&#x22B6;</font>
It sends the <code>WM_GETDLGCODE</code> message to a control,
the control responds <code>DLGC_WANTALLKEYS</code>,
and then later, you subclass the control and change the dialog code.
Oops, that doesn't work because the dialog manager "remembered"
the control's previous answer and doesn't ask any
more.<font FACE="Lucida Sans Unicode">&#x22B7;</font>
Naturally, you expect subclassing to work, so the dialog manager
asks each time.
</p>
<p>
Continuing the analogy, if you want the bagger to help you if it is
raining but not on a dry day,
you can either look out the window, confirm that it is not raining,
and say, "Yes",
or you can just say, "Yes, if it's raining," regardless of the weather,
and let the bagger make the call.
(Of course, the analogy breaks down because the bagger might have a
different assessment from you as to whether or not it is raining.
The decisions you leave up to the dialog manager, such as whether a key
is the tab key or not, are much less ambiguous.)
</p>
<p>
Next time, we'll look at a dialog manager problem,
and the information you learned today may come in handy in solving it.

		<p>I like your choices of footnote symbols!</p>
<p>I think every publication, scholarly or otherwise, should use (a) randomly selected symbol(s) on each page. &nbsp;Of course, the footnote symbol should match the callout or we&#8217;ll get (more) confused (than we already are).</p>
<p>Besides, some of those symbols are under-utilized, and they might get lonely and depressed if they are never allowed out.</p>

		<p>I like your choices of footnote symbols, with one caveat &#8212; they should be reversed.</p>
<p>The filled dot should represent the factual information (ie, fill of info), while the empty dot should be the counterfactual (ie, devoid of facts)</p>

		<p>While cute, the random footnote symbols (at least this time) don&#8217;t automatically stand out as footnotes. I just assumed that my Firefox was misinterpreting some IE-only characters.</p>

		<p>ScottR: maybe you&#8217;re not a) cute enuf; or b) helpless-looking enuf. Also, you&#8217;re refutation is invalid because &quot;rarely&quot; does not mean &quot;never&quot;. And even if an analogy doesn&#8217;t apply to your little universe it doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;s not valid.</p>

		<p>what is a bagger? actually I can probably guess&#8230; its the poor mexican immigrant getting paid $1/hr to pack groceries into bags for lazy Americans :-)</p>
<p>Also keep up the footnote fun, it keeps stupid people from writing code since they spend all their time arguing about footnote symbols.</p>

		<p>No complaints about footnote symbols here and I don&#8217;t even care about them to be honest.</p>
<p>But this is strange. I am using firefox and I see an asterix just fine. However when used together with the IE tab extension and I visit this place again with an IE view now, the asterix becomes a mail message icon.</p>

		<p>Paully: Grocery stores still have to pay Mexican immigrants minimum wage. There were plenty of Mexicans working at the Wendy&#8217;s store I worked at before going into IT, and most of them were paid *more* than I was (They had been working at the store longer than I was).</p>
<p>As for baggers, they&#8217;re some random employee that could have been doing anything else. I&#8217;ve seen people that worked as cashiers the day before, managers, stockers, anyone will do the bagging. They can be of any gender and any race.</p>
<p>If you were intending to say *illegal* immagrants, illegals are usually hired to do yard work or construction work. Most major franchise companies won&#8217;t hire illegals because it would be a scandal if they were caught. Mom&amp;Pop stores might, though.</p>
<p>Yes, I lived in southern California where country gas stations doubled as a hard labor recruiting offices (lots of illegals hanging out, looking for work).</p>
<p>Raymond: Love the footnote symbols.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
