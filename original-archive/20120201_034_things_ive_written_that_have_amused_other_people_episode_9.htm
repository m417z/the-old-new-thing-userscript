<p>A customer liaison reported that their customer wants to be able to access their machine without needing a password. They just want to be able to <code>net use * \\machine\share</code> and be able to access the files right away. I guess because passwords are confusing, easy to forget, and just get in the way. Anyway, the customer discovered that they could do so on Windows&nbsp;XP by going to the folder they want to share, going to the Sharing tab, then clicking on the <i>If you understand the security risks but want to share files without running the wizard</i> link, <img width="368" height="455" src="http://www.microsoft.com/library/media/1033/windowsxp/mediacenter/images/en-us/YEA_LapTV02.jpg"></p>
<p> and then on the <i>Enable File Sharing</i> dialog, clicking <i>Just enable file sharing</i>. </p>
<p><img width="368" height="184" src="http://www.microsoft.com/library/media/1033/windowsxp/mediacenter/images/en-us/YEA_LapTV03.jpg"></p>
<p> What the customer wanted to know was if there was a way they could automate this process. </p>
<p> My response to the customer liaison went like this: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Your customer has chosen to ignore not one but two security warnings. Furthermore, since they are looking for an automated way of doing this, it sounds like they intend on deploying this "feature" to all the computers in their organization. Maybe they just enjoy being part of a botnet? Your customer is basically saying "I wish my computer to have no network security." They should at least restrict access to authenticated users. But if they <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/22/10041190.aspx"> if they insist on having their corporate network turned into a spam farm</a>, they can enable the Guest account and say that it can "Access this computer from the network." Congratulations, your computers will soon be filled with malware and porn. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> That last sentence made it into some people's quotes file. </p>

		<p>Y U assume they don&#39;t have the shared folder locked down with NTFS permissions? &nbsp;I seem to recall at least one book recommending that permissions always be applied at the NTFS level rather than the share level. &nbsp;(Personally I ignored this advice and applied permissions on the share rather than at NTFS.)</p>

		<p>Should have just told them to turn off automatic updates; the malware coming in on the next remote execution vulnerability would open up their network for them. &nbsp;The best part is that 1) turning off automatic updates can be automated and 2) you only have to ignore one security warning.</p>

		<p>Understood, but in all honesty, the security model in some Windows versions are so f*cking complicated to the uninitiated, that we are left for hours sometimes just scratching our heads&#8230; &quot;Why does it still not work!!!??&quot;</p>
<p>We give up and open the floodgates. Just share any damn file, damn the security. That&#39;s when we do stupid ass stuff like this.</p>
<p>My most recent moment of &quot;Why is something so simple so $%^$%# hard to do?&quot; came when one of my computers (all Windows 7) at home refused to join the homegroup. No matter what i did, it still to this day refuses to recognize that there is an existing homegroup. If I create a new homegroup on this computer and then attempt to have the others join the homegroup of this one computer I get the exact same thing: They do not see each other. &nbsp;Yes, I have checked and triple checked they are on the same subnet, same DHCP server, same blah blah blah. Still it does not work. the next option was to reinstall Windows from scratch, and I did not have the time to deal with that mess.</p>
<p>User error/ignorance or not, I just gave up and enabled passwordless sharing, which accomplishing that was another pain in the ass, but at least it worked.</p>
<p>So, in defense of that customer, I will say that the root cause might be something that either did not work as intended, or was too complicated and opening the floodgates seemed like a quicker fix.</p>

		<p>Oh and don&#39;t get me started on &quot;Troubleshoot this problem&quot; wizards and help files included in Windows&#8230; Do you guys measure how often those things actually solve anything?</p>
<p>Seriously, I&#39;d actually be very interested in the stat if MS has it (and if not, why are you guys not measuring it?). It has not helped me once in all my years with Windows, I wonder if troubleshooters and help files are helpful to anyone at all.</p>

		<p>@Martin: Agreed, but still I&#39;ve never heard of them helping anyone. &nbsp;And the suggestions in the help files do not make that much sense. Users would be far better off of those help screens were merely shortcuts to web searches for the error code. Unless the problem is with getting networking up and running, which in that case, the help files and troubleshooters simple need to be far better than they are now.</p>

		<p>In that customer&#39;s network, did they have a domain at all? Looks like not. I don&#39;t think computers in a domain have that unlimited sharing option.</p>
<p>They should have enabled sharing for &quot;Domain Users&quot; group. I think this can be easily done with a script. The shared folder will have to have the appropriate ACL added (by cacls).</p>
<p>@Maurits[ms]:</p>
<p>Isn&#39;t the share ACL applied on top of the NTFS ACL? Means you need to have NTFS permissions to access the file, before the share ACL will give (or deny) you permissions.</p>

		<p>I run my shares wide open and leave the permissions stuff to the filesystem. I&#39;ve done this with every version of NT because it gets far too confusing having to compute effective permissions from two places!</p>
<p>The only time when I would ever consider using share permissions is for shares that absolutely have to be read-only (for a provisioning server or something like that) or if I had to share a FAT volume for some reason. Fortunately those are very unlikely for me.</p>

		<p>To be fair, many small companies have a half dozen computers, no domain, no proper server, and they only want things like file sharing to &quot;just work&quot;. &nbsp;Physical security provides access restriction, and a firewall/router provides all the network security they need.</p>

		<p>@Nick</p>
<p>Physical security and a &quot;firewall/router&quot; is all fine and dandy until it&#39;s not.</p>
<p>Like, say, when the boss&#39;s kid brings an infected laptop in and uses the wifi for &quot;homework&quot;, or someone &quot;accidentally&quot; opens some random porn malware.</p>
<p>Then suddenly all their corporate data is gone, or being sent to the owners of some botnet. Probably along with a copy of their MYOB database or Excel spreadsheet containing your credit card.</p>

<p>1) The support people who cannot take care of this shall not be allowed to take the job.</p>
<p>2) On the second thought, from the dialog, these machines clearly hadn&#39;t join domains. Maybe it&#39;s just small company with 4-6 people that cannot afford the money to hire real I.T. people.</p>

		<p>Actually, this isn&#39;t *neccesarily* a ridiculous thing to do, depending on the context.</p>
<p>Example: At my office, we occasionally run training. We have a VM on our network that acts as a server for training. The machine is always rolled back to the initial state before a training session.</p>
<p>Training involves people downloading the software in which they are being trained onto their machines, which are temporarily added to our network.</p>
<p>So: Do we want to force everyone on that network to have a login on the training server? Could be done. But it&#39;s a bit tedious and redundant, considering they&#39;ll only be there for a few days.</p>
<p>So we do an alternative. We set up the VM to disable password-protected sharing.</p>
<p>The shared folders on that VM that we don&#39;t want just anyone to access explicitly require a member of the Users group. Trainees cannot access these folders without a password.</p>
<p>However, the shared folders that we *do* want the trainees to access has Users, Guest and ANONYMOUS LOGON.</p>
<p>In all cases, write/modify permissions are restricted to administrators.</p>
<p>This works. Well&#8230; And the VM is only up and running during training anyway, so no big deal.</p>
<p>In the right circumstances, this particular scenario isn&#39;t all that crazy.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>But these people wanted to <span style="text-decoration:underline;">automate</span> this setting. In other words, they planned to set up <span style="text-decoration:underline;">hundreds</span> of machines in this configuration, not just a few. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>It might be that their network is well protected from outside and they only use shares for exchanging files (so what if there&#39;s some spam in temporary folder, just delete it).</p>
<p>Personally, I always enable guest account access from network because why the hell disable it? It&#39;s just as good a part of a security system as any other. If I wish to share something to everyone, guests included, then that&#39;s my decision. If I didn&#39;t want the whole world to attend the event, I wouldn&#39;t have included everyone in the visitors list.</p>

<p>Well, it is a good thing that on Windows that the Everyone group doesn&#39;t include guests then.</p>
<p>If they need to share files, then doing one simple thing like adding a common user/password pair to all machines would be much more preferable to enabling guest. You see, enabling guest gives everything the chance at an elevation of privileges attack on the system, but using a common username/pass only gives the people who know about the user account. Enabling guest would also allow the possibility of network transmitable malware to propegate easily. So no, I wouldn&#39;t class guest a good part of any network security system.</p>
<p>Well, if you like a gaping security hole then it is up to you.</p>

		<p>&quot;Then suddenly all their corporate data is gone, or being sent to the owners of some botnet. Probably along with a copy of their MYOB database or Excel spreadsheet containing your credit card.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s actually usually a calculated risk. To spend a week or two of work on playing windows&#39; impossible &quot;security&quot; game, when you are in a hurry, may cost you a missed deal with a customer.</p>
<p>This is a risk which small startups often take, comparable to security surveillance, which they cannot afford, and they get robbed. Or cannot afford any backup harddisk, and disk crashes.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not fatal in most cases, some employee usually has a copy somewhere. Big deal.</p>
<p>I would personally never dream on working at such a company of course, but I know of many.</p>

		<p>@Crescens2k:</p>
<p>Enabling Guest by itself does nothing. It does not &quot;allow for privilege escalation&quot; and doesn&#39;t &quot;help malware propagate&quot;.</p>
<p>It only lets you decide what you want. If you don&#39;t want to share stuff with everyone, you can continue sharing it only with selected people.</p>

		<p>&quot;But these people wanted to automate this setting. In other words, they planned to set up hundreds of machines in this configuration, not just a few. -Raymond&quot;</p>
<p>Or they want to set up a few machines again and again. That actually fits with the training lab scenario, since at the end of the course they want to hit a button and have all the machines revert back to a consistent state, ready for the next group of students</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
