		<p>After you&#8217;re done with the screening, buy / rent the DVD. Bruce Campbell does his entire commentary as Elvis.</p>

		<p>Please, No! I&#8217;ll never get that 1 1/2 hours of my life back.  I don&#8217;t care about the 4 buck to rent the DVD, but time is precious.  A friend at work recommended it to me and i&#8217;ll never forgive him for it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a cool concept but in reality i don&#8217;t think i lauged the entire time.  Perhaps if i had been a masochist and tried the commentary i would have  felt better about my choices.  As it is now, my wife doubts my judgement in DVD rentals.</p>

		<p>Different strokes for different folks I guess. My friends and I had a hoot watching Bubba Ho-Tep laughing throughout the movie.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s also showing at the Cambridge Film Festival (<a target="_new" href="http://www.cambridgefilmfestival.org.uk" rel="nofollow">http://www.cambridgefilmfestival.org.uk</a>) on the same day, coincidentally. I must decide which films to book for before the good ones sell out.</p>
<p>alfons: No-one plays JFK. Ossie Davis plays a character who thinks he&#8217;s JFK.</p>

		<p>Ben: Or maybe Ossie Davis&#8217;s character really is JFK.  Just like maybe Bruce Campbell&#8217;s character only thinks he&#8217;s Elvis or maybe he really is Elvis.  It&#8217;s part of the tinfoil hat mystery of the story.</p>
<p>Since seeng the movie, I&#8217;ve been meaning to check out some of &quot;champion mojo storyteller&quot; Joe R. Lansdale&#8217;s other writing:<br />

		<p>At BioWare we had a small movie night.  We saw Bubba Ho-Tep and Storm Troupers 2.  To say the least, Bubba Ho-Tep was MUCH better. :)</p>

		<p>Well, I was disappointed.  It realy was kinda crappy.  Though, I&#8217;m not a total loser fanboy who would service Bruce Campbell orally.  The whole segment about how Ho-Tep got to where he is, the toilet hieroglyphics, the pimp outfit on the zombie, the incessant penis jokes that weren&#8217;t funny&#8230;  It was realy sad.  You can shoot it so that it looks like shit, but for chrissakes have a good goddamn script.  And as for that night at BioWare, sounds like a real hum dinger.  A screening of &quot;Storm Troupers 2&quot;?  I guess that is probably retard-speak for Starship Troopers 2.  Whoever chooses the pics to watch at that company should be fired immediately.  I&#8217;d rather watch Devine eat hot fresh steamy dog shit over and over while force-fed fudge than watch one more minute of that POS movie, ST2.  If you want more shitty movies to watch, I&#8217;d suggest the whole Troma video catalog, anything released &quot;straight to video,&quot; and any movie starring Eric Roberts.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
