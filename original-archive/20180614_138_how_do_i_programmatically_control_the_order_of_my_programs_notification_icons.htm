<p>
A customer had a program that created multiple taskbar
notification icons,
and they wanted to know if there was a way to
control the order in which they appeared.
</p>
<p>
Nope, that's not something you can control.
You can create multiple icons, but the system chooses
where they go.
They might go into the visible portion of the notification area.
They might go into the overflow.
The user can use the control panel to move your icon between
the two places, or the system could decide automatically.
The user can also drag the icon directly from the notification
area into the overflow, or vice versa.
The user can even drag the icon within the notification area
to customize the order.
</p>
<p>
The customer responded that they figured out how to do it.
They performed a <code>Find&shy;Window</code> for the control
that renders the notification area and sent it private messages to
reorder the icons.
</p>
<p>
These customers make the application compatibility team sad.</p>

		<p>Let me parapharse: The use can reorder the icons not just by dragging and dropping the icons themselves but also by changing the taskbar&#8217;s position and resizing it. If the resist all this, they risk losing market share.</p>

		<p>Maybe the icons represent steps in a multi-stage process (status of the input bin, status of the high-speed-frobbing engine, status of the output bin) and it would make sense to have them displayed in that order&#8230;</p>

		<p>I can think of several scenarios where the order could be important. For example, it could be a music player that adds prev/next/play/pause buttons to the taskbar (there&#8217;s a pretty standard order to these). Maybe they tried to make one &#8220;mega-button&#8221; by adding several matching images together. Maybe the application could control the speed of something (&#8220;1&#8221;, &#8220;2&#8221;, &#8220;3&#8221;). Maybe they tried to show the progress of some process there with multiple icons (Stage 1 status, Stage 2 status, Stage 3 status). Etc. In all of these cases, I <i>suppose</i> you could ignore the order, but it would be weird from UI/UX perspective.</p>

		<p>I remember a music player that did just this in the Win9x days. I believe it kept its order by occasionally removing and re-adding the control buttons. This wasn&#8217;t perfect as things could happen but in general Win9x seemed to keep them approximately in the order they were created. User rearrangement wasn&#8217;t typically a thing although IIRC there were a couple third party apps that could do it.</p>

		<p>@Vilx- of course the real solution in all those scenarios is either &#8220;combine the icons into one, with details in a menu as necessary&#8221; or &#8220;don&#8217;t use the notification area for this feature&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m probably the last person that should be giving UI advice, but it seems to me that it would be weird from a UI/UX perspective to use notification icons as prev/next/play/pause buttons.</p>
<p>On the other hand, showing what stage is active (or completed?) seems to make sense for a notification icon, but I&#8217;d think you&#8217;d only have to show one of those icons at a time &#8211; why is a &#8220;stage 1&#8221; icon still showing when &#8220;stage 3&#8221; is underway?</p>

		<p>Many, many years ago (before toolbars in the task bar were a thing) I used a utility that could place program shortcuts in the notification area, and that allowed its icons to be ordered. Given the age of it I&#8217;d guess it just created the icons in the order it wanted them.</p>
<p>(on &#8220;things programmers don&#8217;t do properly&#8221;, it&#8217;s surprising how many programs don&#8217;t recreate their icons if explorer is restarted!)</p>

		<p>The likely reason for the importance of this is that there are specs that include a picture of the icons in a particular order.  Changing the order of the icons (or specifying that there is no order) would require a change to the specs, and approval up and down the SDLC (it might even been in the requirements document &#8211; who knows).  Not everyone develops code in a rational, agile manner.</p>

		<p>Your team should&#8217;ve responded/helped with a &#8220;custom notifications dude&#8221; reply. Sometime it pays to go the extra mile since not only you have an already code base for future similar requests, but also steer the customer from an unwanted direction. Letting the customer run wild is what comes bite in the proverbial rear your compatibility team later.</p>

		<p>At least this doesn&#8217;t fall under &#8220;what if two programs did this&#8221;. There&#8217;s no fundamental reason why rearranging your own program&#8217;s notification icons is asking for a proxy fight.</p>

		<p>Cases like this I&#8217;d kindly inform them that the window name may change with every release of windows. Then I&#8217;d set a build step to randomize the window name for that control with every single patch that touched that component. This is similar to what some compiler writers have done to discourage people from using internal methods, they deliberately change them every single release.</p>

		<p>Why stop there, change it at every run!</p>

		<p>Microsoft chooses rather not to break badly written applications (or hacky UI customizers) just for the sake of breaking them. For example the class name of the taskbar has been Shell_TrayWnd since Windows 95.</p>

		<p>Alternatively, and for approximately the same amount of work, you may want to realize one day that some of us write Windows applications that are used in &#8220;kiosk&#8221; mode and shared by multiple users to control some (usually large and expensive) hardware thingy. In that case the assumption &#8220;it&#8217;s the one currently holding the mouse who gets to decide where icons go&#8221; is not valid&#8230; So some variation of the &#8220;Windows embedded&#8221; version could be activated, where questions such as &#8220;what if two apps did that ?&#8221; do not hold because you guarantee there is only one app.</p>

		<p>In that case, you would change the shell program from Explorer to your kiosk program (policy available in GPEdit since long), and you can draw whatever you like in that program. By the way, Windows 10 seems to have more convenient interfaces for assigning dedicated apps to kiosk accounts.</p>

		<p>Presumably what they should have done is have a single notification icon, which would then show some sort of popup/menu containing the icons they wanted? I could see the appeal of something like a media player having a set of &#8220;&lt;&lt; [] &gt;&gt;&#8221; icons as a single group, at least &#8211; but better a little popup window than hacking around overriding the order though, and less clutter when the user isn&#8217;t interacting with it.</p>

		<p>You&#8217;re not getting into the right mindset here. Obviously <i>this</i> program is the <b>most</b> important program that the user will ever run. Of course, it should take up as much space in the notification area as it wants to.</p>

		<p>You win the comments.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d not be surprised to learn their true goal was to locate and hide icons from competing products while ensuring their precious product&#8217;s sole icon is always in visible position 1.</p>
<p>To be sure there&#8217;s lots of raw incompetence amongst the world&#8217;s techies and plenty of confused UI/UX designers as well.  But for sheer &#8220;You want to do WHAT!!??!&#8221; bad citizenship by apps look to the sales department as the driver.</p>

		<p>I wish Windows remembered the order of notification icons that I (as user) set, but unfortunately they always move around somewhat.</p>

		<p>Honestly I would prefer if the icons of Core Temp (the temperature of each CPU core) remained in order of the CPU cores they represent. But that feature doesn&#8217;t exist and Microsoft won&#8217;t let it happen.</p>

		<p>The shell only remembers the order of application icons not each individual icon&#8230; If you have App1, App2, App3 then you arrange those icons App2, App3, App1 the shell will remember that order when you close/launch each of those applications later. However, if App2 creates three icons Core1, Core2, Core3 then you rearrange those icons Core2, Core3, Core1 and later restart the application they&#8217;ll be reset 1,2,3 instead of previous 2,3,1 configuration.</p>
<p>The main problem is users expect the order to be remembered for every individual icon like it already does for other icons and when other applications that &#8216;fix&#8217; the behavior using hacky workarounds they&#8217;ll assume that application is doing it wrong and blame the developer when in reality its a problem with how the shell persists icon guidItem/uID ordering.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
