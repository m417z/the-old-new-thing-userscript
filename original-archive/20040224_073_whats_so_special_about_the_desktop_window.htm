<p>The window returned by  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/Windows/WindowReference/WindowFunctions/GetDesktopWindow.asp">  GetDesktopWindow()</a> is very special,  and I see people abusing it all over the place.</p>
<p>  For example, many functions in the shell accept a window handle  parameter to be used in case UI is needed.  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/ifaces/ishellfolder/EnumObjects.asp">  IShellFolder::EnumObjects</a>, for example.  </p>
<p>  What happens if you pass GetDesktopWindow()?  </p>
<p>  If UI does indeed need to be displayed, you hang the system.  </p>
<p>  Why?  </p>
<ul>
<li>A modal dialog disables its owner.  </li>
<li>Every window is a descendant of the desktop.  </li>
<li>When a window is disabled, all its descendants are also      disabled.  </li>
</ul>
<p>  Put this together:  If the owner of a modal dialog is the desktop,  then the desktop becomes disabled, which disables all of its  descendants.  In other words, it disables every window in the  system.  Even the one you're trying to display!  </p>
<p>  You also don't want to pass GetDesktopWindow() as your  hwndParent.  If you create a child window whose parent is  GetDesktopWindow(), your window is now glued to the desktop  window.  If your window then calls something like  MessageBox(), well that's a modal dialog, and then the rules  above kick in and the desktop gets disabled and the machine  is toast.  </p>
<p>  So what window do you pass if you don't have a window?  </p>
<p>  Pass NULL.  To the window manager, a parent of NULL means  "Create this window without an owner."  To the shell, a UI window  of NULL typically means "Do not display UI," which is likely  what you wanted anyway.  </p>
<p>  Be careful, though:  If your thread does have a top-level unowned  window, then creating a second such window modally will create much  havoc if the user switches to and interacts with the first window.  If you have a window, then use it.</p>

		<p>Oh, wait, now I remember why I abuse this all over the place.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s some sample code from MSDN that advocates this exact abusage:</p>
<p><a target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/DialogBoxes/UsingDialogBoxes.asp#init_box" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/DialogBoxes/UsingDialogBoxes.asp#init_box</a></p>
<p>At some point, I don&#8217;t remember where, I was taught not to just throw around NULL willy-nilly to functions that want HWNDs, but to always use a real HWND, GetDesktopWindow being a last resort.</p>

		<p>Here&#8217;s a question &#8211; on XP/2000, is the desktop HWND always 0x10014? If so, why? It&#8217;s presumably the first window object Win32 creates, so you&#8217;d expect 0x10000 or something like that (making sweeping assumptions about how HWNDs are generated of course).</p>

		<p>Thanks, Joel, for digging up all the bad sample code &#8211; people who find errors can send them directly to me via the Contact link and I&#8217;ll submit doc bugs to the MSDN team.</p>
<p>Real HWNDs are preferred of course. And if a function really wants a window then you had better give it a window. But GetDesktopWindow() is nearly always the wrong choice, since you don&#8217;t control that window.</p>
<p>The numerical value of the desktop window is just whatever value happens to be assigned next. I am not myself familiar with XP&#8217;s algorithm for assigning window handles, but I suspect that the handle table is used for other things too (menus, icons, etc.) and it&#8217;s not out of the question that USER32 creates some menus and stuff before it gets around to creating the desktop.</p>

		<p>Okay I took a look at that sample code, and it&#8217;s not using the desktop window for parenting. It&#8217;s just calling GetWindowRect() on it. That&#8217;s fine; it gets you the size of the desktop.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s definitely bad, since it associates your program with the desktop window&#8217;s thread, which is not a thread your program is actually running on. Even worse: If two programs do this, they end up stepping all over each other.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m only reading your blog since a few weeks, but the more I read about mistakes people can make and actually even <em>do</em>, the less am I getting surprised by funky behaviour some applications may expose on themselves or the system. Strange, huh? :)</p>
<p>I hope WinFX will be free of possibilities to create such sort of quirks.</p>

		<p>So, what are good uses for GetDesktopWindow? </p>
<p>The kind of measuring you mentioned (GetWindowRect) looks OK, but is that primarily why GetDesktopWindow was exported and documented?</p>

		<p>Mario: You can have flexibility or you can have robustness in the face of uninformed engineers. Pick either one; you can&#8217;t have both.</p>
<p>Gregor:<br />
<br />Just create a hidden top-level window, and attach your DirectSound code to it. If you use ATL&#8217;s Windowing classes, you can do it with very little impact to your code, and it&#8217;ll solve all of your problems.</p>

		<p>Not sure I&#8217;m clear why you wouldn&#8217;t want to pass GetDesktopWindow() as your hwndParent. I thought that when you show a modal dialog, the parent gets disabled, not the grandparent. What am I missing?<br /></p>

		<p>Didn&#8217;t you just answer your own question? If the act of invoking a modal dialog is to disable the parent and ALL OF IT&#8217;S CHILDREN. Then doesn&#8217;t invoking a modal dialog and declaring the desktop to be it&#8217;s parent (GetDesktopWindow() returns a handle to the desktop) cause the desktop and all of it&#8217;s children (including your new dialog) to be disabled as well? Yes it does, because you have created a deadlock.</p>

		<p>Remember that owner and parent are two different things.</p>
<p>Modal dialogs disable their OWNERs. All top-level windows have the desktop as their PARENT.</p>

		<p>In the current SPs for Windows 2000 and XP, it looks like they fixed it so that disabling the desktop window is no longer possible.<br />
<br />(i.e. EnableWindow(GetDesktopWindow(), FALSE) has no effect)</p>

		<p>Raymond &#8211; You said owner and parent window are different. At the same time, you also state that &quot;To the window manager, a parent of NULL means &quot;Create this window without an owner.&quot; </p>
<p>I am confused here. By the above statement you probably mean owner window and parent window are one and the same. Or may be you should explain why CreateWindow API doesn&#8217;t differentiate between owner and parent.</p>

		<p>Sigh. The parent/owner confusion is on my list of topics to cover.</p>
<p>The problem is that the ninth parameter to CreateWindowEx and the third parameter to the DialogBox functions are called &quot;hwndParent&quot; &#8211; when in fact it really should be called &quot;hwndParentOrOwner&quot;. In casual talk, people often say &quot;parent&quot; when they really mean &quot;parent or owner&quot;.</p>
<p>To be more precise, I should have written &quot;an owner of NULL means &quot;Create this window without an owner&quot;.&quot;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m also confused by two of these three:</p>
<p>&gt; A modal dialog disables its owner.<br />
<br />&gt; [Irrelevant to my confusion:  Every window<br />
<br />&gt;  is a descendant of the desktop.]<br />
<br />&gt; When a window is disabled, all its<br />
<br />&gt; descendants are also disabled.</p>
<p>This seems to imply that a modal dialog would always disable itself (among others).  No need to involve the desktop window in this mess.  I assume your upcoming discussion of parent vs. owner will explain this too.</p>
<p>By the way, the MSDN Library said that GetAncestor() could be used in Windows 98 but the header files said that it couldn&#8217;t, last time I looked.  And at the same time, a Knowledge Base article said that some Windows 98 crashes were caused by programs somehow getting handles to their ancestor window even though there was no known way to do so.  Perhaps the author of that Knowledge Base article should be given a pointer to the MSDN Library?</p>

<p>My guess (and note, I&#8217;m just guessing &#8211; I&#8217;m not Raymond) would be that as a belt-and-braces measure, the last step in the DialogBox function would be a call to EnableWindow for the Dialog itself. Then, even if it is created with the disabled style set, or you set the Desktop as its owner, it&#8217;ll still be valid and won&#8217;t lock up the application which spawned it.</p>
<p>There are other possibilities; DialogBox might be spawning a modal message loop and eating messages instead of actually calling EnableWindow on all of the other messages.

		<p>An owned window is not a child window.  Disabling a parent also disables children, but it does NOT disable owned windows.</p>
<p>The desktop is the parent of all top-level windows, so disabling the desktop disables everybody. The desktop is special that way.</p>

		<p>Hmm.  Suppose an attempt to disable a desktop window would result in an error message and close the application (or yield an exception if the application is still running at its developer&#8217;s site instead of a hapless customer).  Would this cause any new bugs?  Does anyone really have a legitimate reason to disable a desktop window?</p>

		<p>Actually, Norman, if anything&#8217;s going to change, it makes much more sense to just silently ignore the request to disable the desktop window. According to others in this thread, this may actually be the current behavior for Win2k and XP.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
