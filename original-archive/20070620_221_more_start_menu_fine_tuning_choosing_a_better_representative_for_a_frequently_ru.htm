<p>If you paid really close attention to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/06/12/3238198.aspx"> the way a representative shortcut is selected for a program</a>, you may have noticed a problem with it. Here's the rule again:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> If there are multiple shortcuts to the same program, then the most-frequently-used shortcut is selected as the one to appear on the front page of the Start menu.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Suppose there are two shortcuts to Notepad on the All Programs section of the Start menu, one is the standard Notepad shortcut that comes with Windows, and the other is a shortcut whose command line is <code>notepad.exe C:\Program Files\LitWare Inc\Release Notes.txt</code>. Now suppose the user opens a text document on the desktop. Notepad runs, it "earns a point", and suppose that this gives Notepad enough points to appear on the front page of the Start menu. Which Notepad shortcut do we show? </p>
<p> According to the rule stated above, we will choose either the standard Notepad shortcut or the LitWare Release Notes shortcut, depending on which one you've run most frequently. If it's the latter, then you'll have the puzzling result that opening a text document on the desktop causes the LitWare Release Notes shortcut to show up on the front page of the Start menu. It's perfectly logical and completely baffling at the same time. </p>
<p> In Windows Vista, another tweak was added to the algorithm by which a shortcut is chosen to represent a program on the front page of the Start menu: If the user hasn't run any of a program's shortcuts from the Start menu, a shortcut that doesn't have any command line parameters is preferred over one that does. </p>
<p> This tweak causes the Start menu to favor the standard Notepad shortcut over the LitWare Release Notes shortcut. It also means that, for example, a shortcut to <code>Litware.exe</code> is preferred over a shortcut of the form <code>Litware.exe -update</code>. </p>
<p> Note: I was not present at the Windows Vista Start menu design meetings, so I have no insight into the rationale behind its design. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/06/14/3278670.aspx#3310648"> Sorry</a>. </p>

		<p>Raymond, quoting an earlier post: &#8220;If there are multiple shortcuts to the same program, then the most-frequently-used shortcut is selected&#8221;</p>
<p>Raymond, today: &#8220;we will choose either the standard Notepad shortcut or the LitWare Release Notes shortcut, depending on which one you&#8217;ve run most recently.&#8221;</p>
<p>In my mind there&#8217;s a difference between &#8220;most-frequently-used&#8221; and &#8220;most recently [used].&#8221; &nbsp;One is not necessarily the other. &nbsp;You could&#8217;ve run Notepad 500 times but the Litware version was the one that pushed it over the top. &nbsp;That doesn&#8217;t make it the MFU shortcut, does it?</p>
<p>(Sorry for asking a question, I probably just canceled the whole series.)</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Corrected. Actually, since points also fade over time, a more accurate description would be &#8220;most frequently recently&#8221;, but that&#8217;s pretty unwieldy, and as you&#8217;ve noticed, I&#8217;ve been inconsistent in how I abbreviate it. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Given that he&#8217;s said &quot;most frequently&quot; repeatedly now, I suspect &quot;recently&quot; was a mistake on his part this time, so I assumed that&#8217;s what he meant.</p>

		<p>This answers the question of why, for the longest time, I had SourceSafe release notes in my start menu. &nbsp;Now I have &quot;Reporting System Release Notes&quot;.</p>
<p>LOL.</p>

		<p>Oddly, I think my brain inserted a comma, so I read &quot;depending on which one you&#8217;ve run most, recently&quot; (that is, which one has been run the most, in recent days). Apparently that was the &quot;correct&quot; reading, so I guess it was all for the best.</p>
<p>English is a wonderful language.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve had that Notepad &quot;bug&quot; happen to my start menu, and found it confusing. &nbsp;The new rules seem quite logical to me.</p>

		<p>Wolf, you&#8217;re not alone, I read it the same way, and even considered posting that, but I figured I&#8217;d just let Raymond clarify what he meant.</p>

		<p>This whole thing is ridiculous. &nbsp;How many man hours were spent designing, coding and testing this feature which is (a) impossible to get right, as your tale of escalating hacks shows (b) pretty useless anyway</p>

		<p>@Al: the feature is definitely not useless. I had a computer yesterday of which the owner claimed Word had disappeared. What had happened was that is was no longer on the start menu.</p>
<p>This user depended on that &#8216;useless&#8217; feature to do all his PC work.</p>
<p>By the way Raymond will the series cover what happens when the dektop wizard cleans up unused icons?</p>

		<p>So what effect does the &quot;Remove from this list&quot; context menu item have?</p>
<p>Does it reset the counter to 0 for that program? &nbsp;or just enough to get it off the &quot;hit list&quot;?</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t been able to see a pattern&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
