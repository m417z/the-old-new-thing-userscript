<p>There is often confusion about the case where you call <code>Wait&shy;For&shy;Multiple&shy;Objects</code> (or its variants), passing <code>bWaitAll = FALSE</code>, and more than one object satisfies the wait.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  When <i>bWaitAll</i> is <b>FALSE</b>, this function checks the handles in the array in order starting with index 0, until one of the objects is signaled. If multiple objects become signaled, the function returns the index of the first handle in the array whose object was signaled. </p>
<p> The function modifies the state of some types of synchronization objects. Modification occurs only for the object or objects whose signaled state caused the function to return.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The worry here is that you pass <code>bWaitAll = FALSE</code>, and two objects satisfy the wait, and they are both (say) auto-reset events. </p>
<p> The first paragraph says that the return value tells you about the event with the lowest index. The second paragraph says that the function modifies the state of the "object or objects" whose signaled state caused the function to return. </p>
<p> The "or objects" part is what scares people. If two objects caused the function to return, and I am told only about one of them, how do I learn about the other one? </p>
<p> The answer is, "Don't worry; it can't happen." </p>
<p> If you pass <code>bWaitAll = FALSE</code>, then only one object can cause the function to return. If two objects become signaled, then the function declares that the lowest-index one is the one that caused the function to return; the higher-index ones are considered not have have caused the function to return. </p>
<p> In the case of the two auto-reset events: If both events are set, one of them will be chosen as the one that satisfies the wait (the lower-index one), and it will be reset. The higher-index one remains unchanged. </p>
<p> The confusion stems from the phrase "object or objects", causing people to worry about the case where <code>bWaitAll = FALSE</code> and there are multiple objects which cause the function to return. </p>
<p> The missing detail is that when you pass <code>bWaitAll = FALSE</code>, then at most one object can cause the function to return. ("At most", because if the operation times out, then no object caused the function to return.) </p>
<p> The presence of the phrase "or objects" is to cover the case where you pass <code>bWaitAll = TRUE</code>. </p>

		<p>I can&#39;t think of a common use-case where the setting of bWaitAll would be computed at run-time. &nbsp;It therefore seems like two functions would have been better than one.</p>

		<p>&#8230;surely you aren&#39;t suggesting that there should be individual functions every time a function parameter is a constant?</p>
<p>(The open() mode, for example, is also never computed at run-time, and yet there is open(&#8230;, O_WRONLY|O_APPEND) instead of open_read() vs open_write_append() vs open_write_truncate() vs open_write_create_or_truncate() &amp;c. just because one would end up having too many combinations.)</p>

		<p>This seems like the only sensible way to design WaitForMultipleObjects. &nbsp;If you can only return one meaningful piece of information (the first handle which was signaled), then you should only modify the state (auto-reset the event) of objects referenced by that information.</p>
<p>Conversely, the select(2) POSIX system call returns multiple pieces of information (the set of all FDs which are readable/writeable/exceptional); if it were to modify the state of any of those FDs, the calling code could know all of the FDs modified and act on them accordingly. &nbsp;It doesn&#39;t actually modify the FDs, but you could imagine an alternate universe in which it did.</p>

<p>&quot;Modification occurs only for the object, or objects (only if bWaitAll = true), whose signaled state caused the function to return.&quot;</p>

		<p>There are no WaitForAllObjects/WaitForAnyObjects, yet there is a WaitForSingleObject which can also be seen as a special case of WaitForMultipleObjects&#8230; but maybe there&#39;s an historical reason explaining why reducing the number of functions didn&#39;t apply in this case?</p>

		<p>No, I&#39;m arguing that &quot;wait for any one object&quot; and &quot;wait for all of them&quot; are sufficiently different as to benefit from being different; there&#39;s little point in combining them.</p>
<p>Then, for example, waitForAnyObject could return the handle of the signalled object, and waitForAllObjects could return a value that doesn&#39;t look like it&#39;s a reference to only the first one (WAIT_OBJECT_0). &nbsp;Even if it&#39;s only an alias for the same bit-pattern.</p>
<p>As a bonus, we&#39;d get separate documentation for separate semantics.</p>

		<p>Better than the &quot;object or objects&quot; and covers the interaction with bWaitAll:</p>
<p>&quot;If bWaitAll is FALSE, modification occurs only for the object whose signaled state caused the function to return.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#39;s not necessary for this sentence to apply with bWaitAll is TRUE, because then modification doesn&#39;t apply to a subset, but to all handles in the array.</p>

		<p>I can think of one case where this might be useful.</p>
<p>Say you have a set of jobs to assign to a thread pool, and you want to wait until one or more threads in the pool become available, then assign as many jobs as you have available threads. &nbsp;Knowing that more than one thread is available (and which threads they are) would be useful in that case. &nbsp;Of course you could also achieve this by calling WaitForMultipleObjects in a loop, assigning one job per iteration, but I&#39;m wondering if there may be more efficiency in being able to do multiple assignments per WaitForMultipleObjects call.</p>
<p>All hypothetical of course, and the internals of WaitForMultipleObjects might make this a complete non-issue.</p>

		<p>@Joshua</p>
<p>In C, the address of a variable is an array of size 1, so the call wouldn&#39;t be that more complex:</p>
<p>WFSO(myHandle, timeout) =&gt; WFMO(1, &amp;myHandle, TRUE, timeout)</p>
<p>@Raymond</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t notice that because I don&#39;t really know the higher level functions! I barely even know Win32! My question was quite candid, I supposed that dave&#39;s point (two WFMO instead of one) was considered at the time and that there was a good reason for not splitting the &quot;any object&quot;/&quot;all objects&quot; cases but still splitting out the &quot;one object&quot; case&#8230;</p>
<p>Knowing now that the higher level functions didn&#39;t split this case, I imagine that the decision made for Win32 was later regretted&#8230;</p>
<p>Because I love speculation ;-), here are the possible explanations I see for the decision of having separate WFSO and WFMO:</p>
<p>&#8211; a design mistake (hindsight always 20/20)</p>
<p>&#8211; design&#39;s &quot;best practices&quot; evolved over time</p>
<p>&#8211; WFSO was created first, at a time when waiting for multiple objects wasn&#39;t possible for the windows kernel, and then when it became possible, WFMO was added and head were banged.</p>
<p>I think the third one would fit quite well with the theme of this blog! :)</p>

		<p>It seems to me, then, that the simplest and clearest answer to &quot;how do I learn about the other one? &quot; would be &quot;Call WaitÂ­ForÂ­MultipleÂ­Objects again.&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Nawak</p>
<p>I assume the decision was deliberate, since the example I linked to earlier ($WFLOR, $WFLAND) came from VMS, which Dave Cutler (design lead for NT) had also designed.</p>
<p>The overall trend in the NT native API is &quot;honking great functions with many parameters&quot;.</p>

		<p>I think another important piece to the puzzle of confusion is the last part of &quot;If multiple objects become signaled, the function returns the index of the first handle in the array whose object was signaled.&quot; This currently implies that when the function returns the (say) auto-reset objects will no longer be signalled. I&#39;d say &quot;whose object is in a signal state&quot; instead.</p>

		<p>@Sven2: D&#39;oh! You&#39;re right about that!</p>
<p>So as @Dave points out, the API was designed like that. The design patterns evolved over time so that when higher level functions were designed, the fashion was having less functions (but more generic) instead of having different functions for special cases.</p>

		<p>@Ariel: is it? Shouldn&#39;t copy_from_user be only noticeably more expensive than memcpy when the passed pointer is invalid? How does it compare to the cost of making a system call?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
