<p>Back in the crazy dot-com boom days, I knew someone who was into high-performance automobiles. And since these were the crazy dot-com boom days, he had the money to satisfy his urge to drive high-performance automobiles. He bought a used Ferrari, but found that it spent more time in the repair shop than on the road. To solve this problem, he bought a second Ferrari. (Note: This is not a solution available to most people.)</p>
<p> One of the many trips to the auto repair shop was to address an indicator light on the dashboard which had lit up. The mechanics studied the problem and concluded that the indicator light was a false positive. There was nothing wrong with the car aside from the light itself. "Just ignore it," they told him. "We can't disconnect the light for &laquo;some reason&raquo;. If it really bothers you, you can <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/03/03/9971903.aspx#9972222"> put a piece of black electrical tape over it</a>." </p>
<p> "I don't accept that solution," he replied, and told them to go and fix the problem for real. </p>
<p> Some time later, he returned to pick up the car, and yes, the indicator light was off. Satisfied, he drove off. </p>
<p> The next day, he took a closer look at the dashboard. The repair shop had cut out a piece of black electrical tape in the exact shape of the indicator light and placed it over the malfunctioning lamp. </p>

		<p>This is/was a regular thing that some BMW drivers would do for their dash-based oil change indicator lights. &nbsp;Resetting the light required a tool from BMW that plugged into a port under the dash. &nbsp;If you got your car serviced at the dealer, they have the tool and would reset the dash. &nbsp;If you went to an independent shop, they probably didn&#39;t have the tool, so the light stayed on. &nbsp;Simple solution for &#39;turning off&#39; the light: electrical tape. &nbsp;Knowing when to get your oil changed again was done via the sticker placed in the top corner on the inside of the windshield&#8230; no need for the light.</p>

		<p>SMW, I remember that. &nbsp;That light was on the whole time I owned that old car&#8230; never considered trying to cover it up. &nbsp;Then again, the instrument panel only worked around half the time anyway. &nbsp;Good times.</p>

		<p>laonianren: If it is a sealed instrument cluster, it could involve taking the whole dashboard apart, prying open the sealed cluster (and possibly breaking things) just to cut a wire. &nbsp;In those scenarios, black electrical tape is the better choice for everyone involved. &nbsp;It could have literally cost thousands of dollars in parts and labor to cut that wire on a Ferarri if something went wrong. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Raymond&#39;s acquaintance sounds like a coder. &nbsp;To a coder, anything can be fixed properly and easily with some new code. &nbsp;In the physical world, that doesn&#39;t always work out well.</p>

		<p>Earlier this year, I was looking up instructions on how to remove the instrument cluster from an Opel/Vauxhall/Holden Vectra. A common fault with these cars&#39; Triple Information Display is that some pixels/columns on the LCD stop illuminating or flicker randomly &#8211; loose contacts, I believe.</p>
<p>Well, one person who posted such instructions said that they had got sick of looking at the broken display, so they just left it disconnected when reinstalling the cluster! (I was going to try to fix that while I had the cluster out, but the case proved a little difficult to open, so I just left it alone. However, it seems to have come good all on its own over time!)</p>

		<p>My car&#39;s oil pressure light comes on (and it flickers, like it&#39;s trying to barely come on) when the car gets hot and the engine speed goes down to idle. &nbsp;The problem is not that the car&#39;s oil pressure is low, but the oil pressure sending unit has a known, documented problem when the car gets hot. &nbsp;The real solution, spelled out in a service bulletin, is to replace the oil pressure sending unit with one that isn&#39;t quite as sensitive.</p>
<p>So, as long as the light doesn&#39;t come on solid when I first start the car, I know that the oil pressure is probably okay &#8212; I haven&#39;t decided to replace the oil pressure sending unit yet. &nbsp;Occasionally, a friend who is riding in the car will tell me that my oil pressure is low, and I&#39;ll say &quot;no, it&#39;s really not &#8212; the instrumentation is defective&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Carmen &#8211; even in software there is not always (or even often) a simple easy fix to a problem by just recoding some code&#8230; often, in my experience, it introduces new shortcomings, interactions with old software, mixed environments, old OSes, etc., ad nauseum, such that for every attempt to fix a thing, there is often an unexpected problem created. &nbsp;That&#39;s overstating it a bit &#8211; but only a bit. &nbsp;Software coders think everything can be fixed with a few lines of code&#8230; and they&#39;re (often) wrong.</p>

		<p>This reminds me an episode from The Simpsons. The family is in the car and a noise starts to sound. Lisa realizes a warning sign that is flashing on the dashboard and Homer puts some duct tape on it. Then the car stops after a while, precisely at the Springfield Retirement Castle where Grampa is waiting them.</p>

		<p>:-) I regularly tape over power-indicator leds on devices. Much easier than removing or shorting them and this way they&#39;re still there for the unlikely circumstance that you&#39;ll need them.</p>

		<p>Nigel Stuke: Mechanics need to get the heck up to date. Cars have been more about electronics than rubbing components since electronic fuel injection was introduced (early 90s?) Electronic throttle and electronically-controlled brake-force distribution are more recent additions but are appearing on a wide range of cars.</p>
<p>On the Prius group we see a lot of US post-2006 owners covering up the tyre pressure monitoring light, because the mechanic broke or didn&#39;t properly re-seal the TPMS sensors when they got their tyres changed. Art&#39;s Automotive wrote a great article about TPMS:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.artsautomotive.com/maintenance-faq/81-tpms-tire-pressure-monitoring-system" rel="nofollow">http://www.artsautomotive.com/&#8230;/81-tpms-tire-pressure-monitoring-system</a></p>
<p>I&#39;d prefer a $1,000 diagnostic fee to a $4,000 replacement transaxle, and still have the problem not fixed! If there&#39;s a problem serious enough to log a Diagnostic Trouble Code, which causes the Check Engine light to come on, the car&#39;s service manual has a diagnostic tree of things to test. It seems that frequently the dealers don&#39;t actually follow this but just replace the most expensive component. It shouldn&#39;t take 10 hours to rule out most of the causes for failure.</p>
<p>To that I would add checking that the chassis ground points have good conductivity &#8211; a poor connection causes a voltage difference between different ground points. This can cause an ECU&#39;s read of a sensor value to be different to what the sensor thought it was reporting, if there&#39;s a voltage between the ECU&#39;s ground point and the sensor&#39;s (or if different planes in the ECU have different ground points!)</p>

		<p>Mike Dimmick: You may be fine paying a $1,000 diagnostic fee but many wouldn&#39;t because they would think of it as paying that much money to find out that the light they can see is on. Nigel was spot on in the potential repair route, while you mentioned the Prius TPMS sensor may be a common issue with a simple fix it&#39;s often not the case. A sensor reported problem could be anywhere between the sensor and the computer and it&#39;s not easy or cheap to fully test or replace this systems. I&#39;ve seen a car with intermittent fuel pump problems have it&#39;s fuel pump, computer, and much of the cars wiring replaced (both new and borrowed from known working cars at huge costs) still have intermittent fuel pump problems.</p>
<p>My daily driver currently has three dash lights on because one sensor is intermittently not working, I haven&#39;t yet fixed it for two reasons: it doesn&#39;t affect the safety or functionality of the car, and the sensor is extremely cheap but embedded in an extremely expensive part and cannot be replaced individually. Though I don&#39;t use tape, I just don&#39;t pay attention to them anymore.</p>

		<p>When I used to work on cars, there was a technique we had called the &quot;shotgun approach&quot; for these scenarios. There *MUST* be something wrong somewhere that is causing the light to come on. It could be an electrical short, a bad computer, or a bad sensor somewhere. Diagnosing this properly could take tens of hours, and no shop will try to sell you a $1,000 diagnosis fee. If someone really want something like this fixed and has enough money; even without the proper diagnosis if you replace enough parts eventually you will fix the problem. The salesman just needs to be very clear in his wording that a) replacing part &#39;a&#39; may not fix the problem and b) you&#39;re still paying. The more likely problem is that the mechanics don&#39;t feel comfortable with electronic components&#8230;. </p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
