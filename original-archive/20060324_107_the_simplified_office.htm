<p> In response to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/11/11/491780.aspx"> my description of my own office</a>, my colleague Colin Birge shared this anecdote about one Microsoft employee who took office simplification about as far it could go: </p>
<blockquote class="m">
<p> He was one of the earliest usability specialists in Office, later to become the usability manager before ultimately retiring. As befits a person of seniority, for most of the last four years or so he spent at Microsoft, he had a window office, usually extra large.   </p>
<p> The contents of his office were as follows: </p>
<ul>
<li>One small square table. </li>
<li>One office chair. </li>
<li>One guest chair. </li>
<li>One laptop. </li>
<li>One whiteboard. </li>
</ul>
<p> That was it. The rest of the standard desk was gone, including the corner piece and the extended table. There were no bookcases. Apart from the whiteboard, he had nothing on his walls. He had no books, no computer equipment apart from the laptop, no personal materials at all. When he retired, he didn't have to clean out his office. He took nothing with him but the clothes he was wearing. </p>
<p> Apparently his apartment was nearly as spartan. </p>
<p> I knew a guy once who claimed that you didn't really own anything that you couldn't carry at a dead run while firing an AK-47 over your shoulder. This fellow was the only person I ever knew who lived that philosophy. </p>

		<p>I think he used the office to it&#8217;s fullest extent. &nbsp;He didn&#8217;t cover it with worthless bits of paper and pens and electronic equipment.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m always amazed at how most people look at a nice room and their immediate thought is how to fill it with junk.</p>

		<p>My philosophy is: &quot;If it can&#8217;t fit in my laptop case, I don&#8217;t need it&quot;. &nbsp;When I leave at the end of the day, no trace of my being there exists.</p>
<p>When I&#8217;ve been at the same client for 6 months, I start leaving my spare power supply and backup network cable overnight. &nbsp;I consider that &quot;moving&quot; in.</p>

		<p>People are fabulously diverse and creative, &nbsp;part of their creativity is fed by serendipitous chaos. &nbsp;With a minimlist approach you can achieve visual cleanliness and task focus at what cost? &nbsp;What proportion of &#8216;users&#8217; have a &#8216;minimlistic office&#8217; &nbsp;the question is hardly even worth gathering data on? &nbsp;Minimalistic office do not produce a strong environment for empathising with users. &nbsp;I have friends who work in companies that &#8216;require&#8217; a clean desktop. &nbsp;Do they have a clean desktop. &nbsp;NO. &nbsp;Not on their desktop (software) and not on their Desktop (Table) they subvert the policy and sneak in personalisation. &nbsp;This &nbsp;is counter to a minimlist ideal, &nbsp;its real, &nbsp;personalisation, &nbsp;identity in multiple forms (not just minimalisation). &nbsp;Experience the clutter!!!</p>

		<p>Wendy:</p>
<p>If those companies are anything like the companies that I have worked at, a &quot;Clean Desk&quot; policy means you aren&#8217;t allowed to have sensitive/private information that is not secured and/or covered in some fashion. Its not a tidiness requirement.</p>

Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
