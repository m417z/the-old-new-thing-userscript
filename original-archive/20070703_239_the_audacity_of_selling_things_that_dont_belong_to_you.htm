<p>Lustig is the swedish word for amusing/funny.</p>

		<p>I also was thinking about his name Lustig. Was it taken or just a coincidence?</p>
<p>According to a great new Swedish English lexicon tyda.se:</p>

		<p>OK, selling the Eiffel tower I can see. &nbsp;I mean, there were already rumors in the news so the contractors probably already had the seed of plausibility implanted in their brains.</p>
<p>But selling people a box that supposedly duplicates money, and the banks say it&#8217;s OK and not counterfeit? &nbsp;This con has holes on so many levels that I can&#8217;t fathom how anyone would fall for it. &nbsp;Even in the 1920s when I guess institutional banking in the US was still a relative mystery to the average joe.</p>

		<p>Then there&#8217;s &quot;The Man Who Sold The Moon.&quot; &nbsp;He just didn&#8217;t realize he *could* actually do it. &nbsp;I haven&#8217;t thought about or read that story in ages.</p>

<p>except it&#8217;s not a con, the state does it. (Is it even worse then?)</p>

		<p>This has been a huge problem in Canada for a while.</p>
<p>What happens there is people will rent(or in some cases not even that) a place then do an ID theft of the real owner(or get a fake letter of authority), and then sell the property or they will take out a mortgage on the property and run. &nbsp;Canada law, may of been changed by now, says the sale or mortgage is legal as long as the lender/purchaser is not in on the scam.</p>
<p>In the US the lender would be the one to take the loss, so they tend to do a good job of checking out the title owner. &nbsp;For a sale the purchasers can recover any costs they may of paid if they had purchased title insurance.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
