The <code>Start&shy;Run&shy;No&shy;HOME&shy;PATH</code> policy affects
whether the user's <code>HOME</code> path is the current directory
when you run a program from the Run dialog</a>.
But that's all it does.
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/04/30/10521436.aspx#10521626">
DWalker asks</a>,
"I wonder why the behavior is different between Start and Start.Run."</p>
<p>
The Start.Run dialog is not related to the Start menu.
It's just some dialog box that happens to be directly invokable
from Start.
This dialog is also used by Task Manager when you say
File.New Task, and you can also
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/11/24/55823.aspx">
invoke it programmatically</a>.
</p>
<p>
The search box on the Start menu is a search box,
not a run box.
Its job is to use what you
typed as the basis for a search and present you a list of
matches, and to execute the top match if you press Enter.
That it runs Notepad if you type N-O-T-E-P-A-D is
a consequence of the search rather than any attempt to run
the command line <code>"notepad"</code>.
</p>
<p>
As for why the policy is so narrowly-defined,
a lot of that falls back to the customer who requested
the policy in the first place.
Many policies are the result of direct requests from
IT departments who want to control some very precise
aspect of the system because it affects their network
or otherwise creates a burden on their
computing infrastructure.
You can usually spot these types of policies because
of their extremely precise formulation.
</p>
<p>
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/04/30/10521436.aspx#10521731">
morlanweb wonders</a>
if there are equivalent policies for other
launch points.
Given that the
<code>Start&shy;Run&shy;No&shy;HOME&shy;PATH</code> policy
was created in response to a specific customer request,
it stands to reason that corresponding policies for other
launch points would exist only if a customer requested them.
And so far, no corporate IT department has asked for them.
</p>
<p>
As a rule, IT departments do not notify us when they
no longer need a policy,
so these random strange-looking policies can linger
for a long time without any real clients.
Not that it would help,
because once the policy is published, any other company's
IT department could start using it without telling us.
</p>
<p>
These special one-off policies are tested primarily by
the customers who requsted them.
If the policy implementation solves their problem,
then that's that.
This helps to shift the support burden of the policy
from the product team to the individual who
requested the policy.
If a service pack or a future version of Windows
causes the policy to behave strangely,
we rely partly on the customer letting us know.
In a sense, the loser become responsible for testing
his check box.

		<p>&quot;The loser becomes responsible for testing his checkbox.&quot; Good. Among other reasons this ensures the box solves the actual problem.</p>
<p>It&#39;s pretty obvious this box predates vista and doesn&#39;t solve its problem anymore.</p>

		<p>@Adam Haha, I stumbled on this comment in there: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/13/9416485.aspx#9419935">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/9416485.aspx</a></p>
<p>Gotta wonder what he thinks about Windows 8 and Windows 10. I disagree with his argument about Windows 7, but looking back it does likely apply to Windows 8 since it would seem users did not like the &quot;one size fits all&quot; attempt at a tablet and desktop UI. Windows 10 in fact uses such a &quot;loser checkbox&quot; with two different start menus, though I am sure they share a lot of code especially with the tiles UI.</p>

		<p>Thanks, Raymond, for answering my question. I&#39;m glad to see that my question helped us get a greater understanding of these obscure policies.</p>

		<p>At first I read &quot;NOHOMEPATH&quot; as &quot;NOHOMEOPATH&quot;, and wondered what Windows has against alternative medicine quackery.</p>

		<p>Once again, please stop adding useless features that increases your maintenance cost! When will you learn, never? You should actually start *deleting* code. No one wants bloated software. Do one thing, and do it well.</p>
<p>&quot;This helps to shift the support burden of the policy from the product team to the individual who requested the policy&quot;</p>
<p>No it does NOT. If the individual have any problems at all with the feature, YOU will be the one responsible for fixing it, and that will require double amount of work. For YOU.</p>
<p>Or as in most cases, the individual detects problems but cannot be bothered to post an issue to a non-cooperative support department, and solves the problem in another way himself using a good enough work-a-round. Result: Useless code in the code base + Angry customer.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
