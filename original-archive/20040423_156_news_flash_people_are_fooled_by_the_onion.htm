		<p>People are idiots.</p>
<p>There is this right-wing group in a town I used to live in that also used an Onion article to further their own agenda (which was to refuse equal rights of all children regardless of sexual orientation): </p>
<p><a target="_new" href="http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/LondonFreePress/News/2004/04/08/412787.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.canoe.ca/NewsStand/LondonFreePress/News/2004/04/08/412787.html</a></p>
<p>The galling thing was, when they were told their news story was fake, they continued to claim that The Onion was a legitimate, gay advocacy newspaper.</p>

		<p>The onion is a bit crap. Adequacy.org (now an archive only) is better. This spoof story, &#8216;is your son a computer hacker&#8217;, got 5917 comments: <a target="_new" href="http://www.adequacy.org/public/stories/2001.12.2.42056.2147.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.adequacy.org/public/stories/2001.12.2.42056.2147.html</a></p>

		<p>I find it disturbing how easily people are fooled by these things.</p>
<p>I every now and then get mass-emails telling me to support the banning of a site called bonsai kitten which is about putting newly born kittens in a jar and as they grow they will be shaped by the jar. The site is obviously a fake (and quite humorous in a morbid way) but most people fail to see that and get very angry and send a lot of hate-mail. It&#8217;s quite interesting how these hate-mails show the true color of the people sending them as some of the mails are very racist in nature.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  I find it disturbing how easily people are fooled by these things. </p>
<p>A few months ago, I saw a documentary show on ARTE (cultural French-german TV network). A journalist (French, I think) was explaining that American never actually put a toe on the moon. Since the Nixon administration didn&#8217;t want to take any single risk that the moon conquest failed, all the world saw was a film made very secretly by Kubrick himself (shortly after he finished the Space Odissey).</p>
<p>OK, german and french are opposing US about war on Iraq. But can it be up to a point where a network as serious as ARTE can be so fooled ?</p>
<p>But wait ! The show went on with interviews by Rumsfeld, Kissinger and couple of others. These guys <em>did</em> confirm the story. They even gave details about the operation. The more they were speaking, the more the details became crazy. Boy, Rumsfeld ! Kissinger ! Telling me that all we saw of the moon was a film shot in Kubrick&#8217;s private studio in London !</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll tell you: I don&#8217;t get easily caught by hoaxes. But that night, after 45 minutes of that show, I was sitting in my sofa, open-mouthed. I was really feeling sick. And the show ended, the credits were scrolling on the screen&#8230;. and i was stuck. I simply couldn&#8217;t move or get my eyes off that TV.</p>
<p>&#8230;. After the (long) credits were done, suddenly and unexpectedly, the interviewees came back to screen, laughing : &quot;We got you :-)&quot;</p>
<p>The whole purpose of the show is to illustrate that you can make people think anything you want. Here they used the credibility of famous people talking about what they know. (I admit it&#8217;s not that easy to get these names acknowleding your thesis).</p>
<p>&quot;What ? Rumsfeld, trustworthy ?&quot; will you tell me ? &quot;Of course Rumsfeld is not trustworthy !&quot;. Until the day in 20 years from now where you&#8217;ll hear him say &quot;Of course we knew from the very beginning that there were no WMD in Iraq&quot;. That day, whether or not you believed him first, whether or not some were found, whether or not he&#8217;s right, I bet you&#8217;ll believe him ! Because he&#8217;s telling you something that puts him in a really bad position. Why would he do that if it were not true ?

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
