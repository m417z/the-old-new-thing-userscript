<p>To connect to the Microsoft corporate network from home, <a href="http://redmondmag.com/features/article.asp?editorialsid=524"> employees need to use smartcard authentication</a>. But, somewhat paradoxically, you do better if you remove the smart card.</p>
<p> A colleague of mine tipped me off to this. To initiate the connection, you have to insert the smart card and provide the smart card password. Then the system connects to Microsoft and validates both the smart card and password. During this time, you can see the smart card access light blink on and off, and an "elapsed time" meter will start running. </p>
<p> Once the elapsed time reaches five seconds, <strong>remove the smart card</strong>. The actual authentication happens in five seconds; the rest of the time is doing other validation, quarantining your system, confirming that you have all the necessary patches, that sort of thing. Some of those operations in turn require authentication, and if you leave your smart card in the reader, the system will try to authenticate with the smart card (slow) even though that isn't the authentication it needs. </p>
<p> If you remove the card, then the system won't try to use the smart card, and the rest of the logon process will go much faster. </p>
<p> This tip may not work for other people who use smart cards for authentication, but it works for me to connect to Microsoft. What used to take thirty seconds now takes just seven. </p>

		<p>Has anyone submitted a bug report?</p>
<p>I know that when these sort of things happen to me, I always find myself shaking my fist and thinking &#8220;doesn&#8217;t anyone at Microsoft notice these problems!&#8221;. Looks like it does but that doesn&#8217;t always help :)</p>

		<p>Is this for all (NT4/5/.x+?) operating systems, or is it some Vista specific screwup (I did btw have a chance to try Vista RTM now, and my first and probably lasting impression is that Microsoft is its own worst enemy; given a chance I want back the NT4/Win95 Explorer.exe &#8211; seriously!).</p>

		<p>Wow&#8230; You found a behaviour that is know since years now. But it seems that MS was not interested in fixing this. Maybe now we get a solution. Btw. i develop applications that take massive usage of smartcard and pki. It&#180;s really nice if you have inserted round about 200 cards allready, and all the public certificates are stored in your crypto container. When enumerating the store for a sign certificate it checks all those 200 certificates if the card where the private key is stored may be available&#8230; Thsi takes normaly between 5-10 seconds per certificate</p>

		<p>As the slowest authentication provider, the smart card should be at the END of the search path, then this workaround wouldn&#8217;t be necessary.</p>

		<p>(Disclaimer: I&#8217;m not a windows user and don&#8217;t know this subsystem)</p>
<p>What about parallelizing authentication? If search order doesn&#8217;t matter this could be a huge win. If search order does matter then this could still be a win, albeit a smaller one. This sounds especially apropos here where it sounds like the smart card is a local resource so you don&#8217;t have to worry about overtaxing it with requests.</p>

		<p>First, the MS VPN software is way better than the nortel stuff I used before, smartcard or not. Second, yes, there is wierdness with Smartcards and the OS itself. Like if you boot with one, it brings up a different login dialog from normal.</p>
<p>What is most annoying for me is that Domain authentication at login time happens before you are on the network, so you can&#8217;t easily renew your domain password *and have the laptop update its cached value*. There&#8217;s an assumption in the domain code that you bring your machine back in to the office regularly. Which means that a domained VMWare image at home every so often has to traipse into work on the hard disk of a laptop, then back again. </p>

		<p>wireless floppy: Write-through caching &#8211; cache the stuff you *read*, keeping that in memory to speed up those PATH searches, but write everything out straight away (so you never lose data that way).</p>
<p>Or you start throwing &#8216;delayed write failed &#8230; data lost&#8217; errors during backups, even when write caching is disabled. That made for a fun weekend, trying to get backups working properly again on that server :-(</p>

<p>Not much use if you&#8217;re not connected to a network yet.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m doing a lot of travelling between different companies/sites at the moment and pretty much everywhere has an &quot;internet-only&quot; wireless LAN setup that non-employees can use to connect back-to-base when they&#8217;re working with the company. So I need to boot up the laptop, login using cached credentials, find the right WLAN, do the WEP/WPA dance, login to VPN, and then finally I&#8217;m on the domain. Logging straight into VPN from the Windows login is fairly impractical (apart from the fact that I generally hibernate the laptop over night, and it&#8217;s normally only rebooted once a month after patch Tuesday).</p>
<p>The lock workstation and unlock with your new password trick works perfectly, and only takes a few seconds once a month.</p>

		<p>I ran into a problem here where one of our Japanese executives (at a Canadian company) would log into a TS session with a server in Japan. &nbsp;It would just sit a blue screen and would never bring up the login screen. &nbsp;All the other executives could get in just fine except this one. I got loucky I just went down the list of services running and for some strange reason Smard Card service was running and it stood out in my mind. &nbsp;I killed it then re-launched the TS connection and instantly the login screen came up. &nbsp;It appears that just having the service running will cause other connections to slow down as well.</p>

		<p>If the smart card is left in, how long should it typically take to authenticate? &nbsp;I find I can remove the smart card after as little as two seconds and it will complete the authentication, but if I leave the smart card in I have never had the authentication complete, even after letting it go for as long as ten minutes. &nbsp;It seems like the smart card driver is holding onto some sort of lock which stops the connection manager from doing anything, which makes it piss-poor software.</p>

<p>&quot;If the smart card were not in the search path of authentication providers, then how could you log on with a smart card?&quot;</p>
<p>Ah, but why it has to be in the path after login?</p>
<p>Why an application can&#8217;t chose to ignore slow authentication devices?</p>
<p>Why all this is not user-configurable?</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
