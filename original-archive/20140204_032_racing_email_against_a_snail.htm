<p>The Windows team <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/08/02/10191834.aspx"> double-dogfoods</a> Windows Server and Exchange Server, and while this is good for both products, it can be quite frustrating when something goes wrong.</p>
<p> I remember back in the early days of the Windows&nbsp;95 project, the mail servers once got so messed up that some email messages were not delivered for several days. After a colleague told me that he had just received an email message that I had sent several days earlier, I went to the library to look up the typical speed of a garden snail. (This was back in the days when you had to use an actual library to look up facts, and cat videos were available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000G0O5D2/?tag=tholneth-20"> only once a week</a>. The Internet looked like <a href="http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html"> this</a> and a few years later, <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/misc/features/features_flshbk_hp1.htm"> this</a>.) </p>
<p> Conclusion: A garden snail would have delivered the message faster than our email system. </p>
<p> More recently, a wrinkle in the space-time continuum resulted in one of our automated systems sending out warning messages four months after the anomalous situation was detected. (The anomalous situation was repaired almost immediately, so the warning was not only late, it was spurious.) </p>
<p> One of my colleagues remarked, </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I have <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0064440206?tag=tholneth-20"> a story I read to my grandkids</a> where Frog writes Toad a letter and gives it to a passing snail, who delivers it to Toad's house four days later. </p>
<p> Can we hire that snail? </p>
</blockquote>

		<p>Notifications that the mail server is unavailable, or in the process of shutting down (which of course will only be sent if and when it comes back up) can be amusing &#8211; or irritating &#8211; in this respect.</p>
<p>Windows Event 6008 (since Windows 2000 SP4) is a clever reversal of the delayed message &#8211; on startup, creating and backdating a crash log entry to the time the system was last recorded as functioning normally, originally in the LastAliveStamp registry key, later in two files (lastalive0.dat and lastalive1.dat). Quite cunning really &#8211; and &quot;how on earth did this system log the fact it crashed/lost power, when it wasn&#39;t running to do it?&quot; is a better conundrum for new people than &quot;how on earth did this email take a week to get here?&quot;</p>

		<p>I recently had a friend&#39;s mailman server deliver me 16 identical copies of the first of the month list reminder email, in the middle of the month. &nbsp;Upon further investigation of the headers, I discovered that they weren&#39;t completely identical. &nbsp;Each one came from a different month. &nbsp;So, I received emails that had been sent up to 16 months ago all at basically the same time. &nbsp;He had just rebooted his server, so I guess they were stuck in the queue, and rebooting released them.</p>

		<p>@Maurits: the device with the greatest bandwidth is, and probably will be for a while, a lorry (or a plane) loaded with MicroSD memory cards. Of course, it may also be the most expensive consumer communications device by several orders of magnitude.</p>

		<p>These comparisons fail to include the time it takes to write to the media before it&#39;s sent and to read from the media after it&#39;s received. When you send data to a network, you&#39;re copying it, not moving it, so at least the first must be considered. When you receive data from a network, you must store it somewhere, be it in memory for ephemeral consumption or in persistent media for later analysis, so the second time must be added to be fair.</p>
<p>In the case of multiple hard drives or micro SD cards, there&#39;s also the mechanical insertion and removal, which depending on the copying devices, it may be one at a time (e.g. one PC with one free slot, cheap and slow), a few at a time (e.g. one PC with a few dedicated slots not on the same bus; expensive and faster), or a cluster of them.</p>
<p>Last but not least, this is assuming that there&#39;s some kind of error detection in these media or in the way their content is encoded, Of Courseâ¢. And that it&#39;ll survive all international cross-border X-ray, magnetic, &lt;whatever&gt; scans.</p>

		<p>I worked with the Exchange Team back in ~94. Back in those days, you put as much of your message as would fit in the subject line (delivery of the subject was more reliable than the body at the time), put your message in the body too (for dogfooding purposes; hey, it might get thru), hit send, and then called the person you were trying to communicate with since they were unlikely to get the whole message anytime soon. </p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
