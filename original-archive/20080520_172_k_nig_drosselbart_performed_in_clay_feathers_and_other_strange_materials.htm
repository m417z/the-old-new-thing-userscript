<p>This past weekend I went to the <a href="http://www.seattleinternational.org/"> Seattle International Children's Festival</a> to attended a performance of <a href="http://www.seattleinternational.org/seattle/performers/halle.html"> <i>K&ouml;nig Drosselbart</i></a> in German. I was not familiar with <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/grimm052.html"> the story</a> beforehand, but that's okay. It just makes for a better surprise.</p>
<p> The interpretation was very creative. The narrators embodied the characters in the story at times; other times characters were represented by props manufactured on the spot from clay, decorated with feathers and twigs. (With one exception: The princess was represented by <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc510335.aspx"> a well-known doll</a>.) </p>
<p> The most amusing parts were when both techniques were used simultaneously: For example, at one point in the story, the princess was being particularly difficult. One narrator said "She sat down" as he placed the doll representing the princess on the table in a sitting position. The other narrator (embodying the pouty princess) placed the doll flat on her back just to be contrary. </p>
<p> The first narrator corrected himself. "The princess lay down." </p>
<p> The other narrator made the doll sit up again. </p>
<p> "Sat down." </p>
<p> On her back. </p>
<p> "Lay down." </p>
<p> Sitting up. </p>
<p> "Did some exercise." </p>
<p> If you know your <a href="http://oaks.nvg.org/folktale-types.html"> Aarne-Thompson classification of fairy tales</a>, the story of <i>K&ouml;nig Drosselbart</i> is <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~dash/type0900.html"> story type number&nbsp;900</a>. If you go to a folklore convention, you can just say "Number 900!" and people will say, "Ah, that's a good one" or "Yeah, I'm not a big fan of that." </p>
<p> Or they may just look at you in disgust and say, "You told that story so badly." </p>
<p> It's all in the delivery. </p>

		<p>I haven&#8217;t heard the &quot;numbered joke &#8216;joke&#8217;&quot; told in that context before, but as a folklore fan who knows the numbering system I have to say &quot;Yes, that&#8217;s funny.&quot; :)</p>

		<p>According to that site, story types 900-909 are &quot;The Obstinate Wife Learns To Obey&quot; and categorised under &quot;Realistic Tales&quot;.</p>
<p>Obstinate wives (or any other kind for that matter) learning to obey don&#8217;t sound very realistic to me :-)</p>

		<p>I grew up with Brothers Grimm&#8217;s fairy-tales from earliest childhood, and my kids do so, too. They are simply german folk-lore.</p>
<p>But &quot;K&#246;nig Drosselbart: Performed in clay, feathers, and other strange materials&quot; &#8211; that sounds like awfully high culture :-)</p>
<p>I imagine the fun-factor being quite low, but enough stuff for prolonged discussions with plenty of absinthe&#8230;</p>

		<p>The Aarne-Thompson classification of fairy tales is a huge useless mess. Propp had killed it with his Morphology over fifty years ago, it&#8217;s just that the bult of Western linguistics had failed to notice it for some inscrutable reason. Perhaps the linguists are willfully ignoring any structural or historical approach to the matter?</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propp" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propp</a> has the complete list of 31 structural elements that exhaust the available fairy tale plots. There are also certain patterns of them meshed together, sadly not mentioned in the article.</p>
<p>Still, even so it should be pretty evident how it compares to the AT which classifies irrelevant details into hundreds of irrelevant pigeonholes.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
