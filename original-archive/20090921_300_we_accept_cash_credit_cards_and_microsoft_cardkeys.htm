<p>One of the restaurants that opened at the new <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/microsoft/2009086103_microsoftcampus20.html"> Microsoft Commons</a> is Spitfire, which opened under its own name <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/12/10/9188556.aspx"> instead of one of the many wonderful alternatives proposed</a>. At The Commons, the dining establishments operate in a variety of ways (cafeteria, buffet, fast casual, deli, etc.) but they share the common characteristic that you pay for your meal before you sit down to eat, and you clear your own table when you're done. In other words, it's a giant upscale food court spread out over two buildings.</p>
<p> Except for Spitfire, which has its own building and operates as a sit-down restaurant with table service. </p>
<p> One thing that I still can't get over is that you can pay for your lunch at Spitfire with your Microsoft cardkey. That somehow just seems wrong. </p>

		<p>Oh, it&#8217;s not free. Unless they changed it recently, you deposit money into an account, which is then charged when you get lunch or dinner with the card.</p>
<p>At least when they did punch cards you got $27 or $29 value for a $25 card. &nbsp;With the cardkey system you tie up money whether you use it or not.</p>
<p>But otoh, cardkeys are often clipped onto clothing, which makes them harder to misplace than wallets.</p>

		<p>I work for a company that employs over 10,000 people at one location, and they have let 3rd party businesses (such as restaurants) set up shop.</p>
<p>Yes, we can use our employee badges to pay, which cause a deduction on our next paycheck.</p>

		<p>Part of what seems wrong about it is you&#8217;re letting your employee ID go out of sight for a nontrivial amount of time, I&#8217;d think. I hope the employees eating there trust the waiters with access to their buildings!</p>

		<p>@Yuliy: &nbsp;likely, the card is swiped at a portable terminal, and never out of sight of the owner.</p>

		<p>Surely they are RFID cards that you just swipe near a sensor. &nbsp; That&#8217;s what our companies access cards are like, it&#8217;s pretty cool.</p>

		<p>Never out of sight where I am, but even if they were to go out of sight, all the higher security areas require someone on the inside to buzz you in.</p>
<p>The badges themselves arent actually access cards. They are tracking/logging cards (swipe in where you are so that its possible to find out where you are, and to log who-did-what)</p>
<p>Badges (or the paper-equivalent &#8216;idiot badge&#8217; when someone forgets theirs) must be visibly worn at all times by nearly 100% of the staff. They also double as name badges, since with 10,000+ employees you will often be dealing with someone you arent familiar with at some point during the day.</p>

<p>Or stay at home and donate the cost of a restaurant meal to your local food bank. Just a thought. :-)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
