<p>
We had extended family over for a visit,
and we decided to take everybody to the public swimming pool.
While waiting in line, the kids (ages 4 through 7) somehow got onto
the topic of lifeguards.
</p>
<p>
Six-year-old:
"I hate lifeguards. Whenever you do something fun, they tell you to stop."
</p>
<p>
Four-year-old:
"I hate lifeguards, too.
They made me stop hopping.
But I didn't fall down!
When I grow up, I want to be a lifeguard, so I can yell at people."</p>

		<p>I wonder why children found &#8220;can yell at people&#8221; attractive.</p>
<p>Perhaps it could be nice experience to tell the child to yell at people for the whole day, and see if they&#8217;ll get tired to do that.</p>

		<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s because they&#8217;re frequently on the receiving end of being yelled at, so they&#8217;d like to be on the dishing out end instead?</p>
<p>In any case, you should reassure them that there are many more occupations in which you can get away with yelling at people, so they don&#8217;t need to commit to any one thing yet.</p>

		<p>If children want to grow up and regularly yell at people, I would suggest being a head coach of a men&#8217;s, college basketball team.  All yelling &#8212; all the time!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
