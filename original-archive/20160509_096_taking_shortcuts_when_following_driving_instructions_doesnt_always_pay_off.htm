<p>
Many years ago, I had to pick up a package from
the local UPS distribution center.
This was back in the old days,
before everybody had a GPS with turn-by-turn navigation.
In the uphill-both-ways era,
the way you figured out how to get somewhere was
to <i>pull out a map printed on paper</i>
and plot your strategy unassisted.
</p>
<p>
Armed with my homemade directions to the UPS
distribution center,
a granola bar,
and a signal flare to assist search-and-rescue
in locating me,
I set out on my quest.
</p>
<p>
As luck would have it, I chose to set out on my
journey early in the morning,
just as the UPS trucks arose from their slumber
and set out in search of food, or whatever it is
they do in the morning.
As I got within a few miles of the distribution
center, I saw a stream of brown trucks coming
toward me.
</p>
<p>
"What luck!" I thought to myself, nibbling on
a granola bar.
I don't need to consult the directions I scribbled
down.
I can just follow the UPS trucks back to their lair!
</p>
<p>
This plan worked great.
The convoy of UPS trucks continued without a break,
allowing me to trace their path backward,
like a schoolboy following an ant trail.
</p>
<p>
Or at least the plan worked great until I reached
the source:
The UPS loading dock and a gate
with the sign <i>Authorized vehicles only</i>.
</p>
<p>
Oops.
</p>
<p>
(I managed to find the customer entrance by
going around the block.
So this plan sort-of worked after all.)</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t see any problems here; after all, you yourself have said that programming is usually a matter of snapping blocks together. Block 1 led you to an entrance, Block 2 led you to the right one. You also stuck to the public APIs by stopping at the &#8220;Authorized vehicles&#8221; sign and going around the block.</p>

		<p>The orthodox solution would be to look up the address in the Yellow Pages and plot the route on the city map, then pay close attention to any signs. However, Raymond was spontaneously trying to create something new here, an improvised guidance system based on taking a guess, adjusting for the result then caching the location for future reference, all the while relying on UPS&#8217;s public signage on public roads, with no expectation that they&#8217;d need to match Raymond&#8217;s expectations, either now or in the future.</p>
<p>I sympathize because I do that all the time: pay attention to what I&#8217;m doing in a particular environment and think if there is any way to automate parts thereof, or work around any temporary limitations. Software design without software, basically.</p>

		<p>I recently had a similar experience and due to the main entrance being hidden inside the car park of a store and a one way system that prevents you from blindly driving round the block, block 2 was an order of magnitude harder than block 1. The problem here was that the GPS couldn&#8217;t make sense of the address either.</p>

		<p>&#8220;As I got within a few miles of the distribution center, I saw a stream of brown trucks coming toward me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Since I would have been heading (hopefully) towards the depot, I would have assumed the convoy was *leaving* the depot, fully laden, to make their deliveries, and that following them would have been a really bad idea.</p>

		<p>No, that would be &#8220;oops&#8221;. &#8216;Ups&#8217; is just the sound of &#8216;up&#8217; with an &#8216;s&#8217;, as in &#8220;(someone&#8217;s) ups and downs&#8221; &#8211; that is, if you _really_ wanted to pronounce it as a word, incorrectly, as opposed to the correct acronym pronunciation.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve always pronounced UPS (the company) with a &#8220;u&#8221; as in &#8220;pudding&#8221;[0], somewhere between the &#8220;oo&#8221; sound of &#8220;oops&#8221; and the &#8220;uh&#8221; sound of &#8220;ups&#8221;. That makes the pronunciation close enough to &#8220;oops&#8221; to still allow the joke to work, while not making it too forced.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a recent forum post that, a student is using GPS map on his/her phone to locate the school holding his/her public exam. The GPS lead the student to another school that is at the side of the original target, but with like 100M vertical distance because the schools are located on a hill.</p>
<p>Fortunately the student come early, so he/she called a taxi to travel 10 minutes up the winding road to there.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not a driver, but I assume any planner would be smart enough not to allow access from a public road into a section where the turn can only be made by passing through an &#8220;authorized vehicles only&#8221; gate?</p>

		<p>The staff access could be on a private road (it doesn&#8217;t have to be, depending on the neighbors), but the access for the public (which was Raymond&#8217;s goal) should definitely be accessible from the public roads.</p>

		<p>Yes, but if you drive into into the staff access road by mistake, you should be able to get out as well, without it becoming a one-way street ending at &#8220;Authorized vehicles only&#8221; and a bunch of angry UPS vehicles behind you? I&#8217;m wondering if that is what Cesar was getting at.</p>

		<p>No sane planner would make a dead end one-way. I find it more probable that Cesar meant that, at some point, reversing the trucks&#8217; route would lead Raymond to a one-way street the trucks were coming out of.</p>

		<p>You&#8217;ve never been to Washington(*) Southbound Services and taken the wrong turn into the goods yard. I had to very cautiously drive the wrong way back up a one-way to escape.<br />
(*)The English one.</p>
<p>Raymond essentially used Newton-Raphson to get to the YewPeeEss depot.</p>

		<p>I had a temp job at a big UPS facility in NYC in the &#8217;80s. I thought, since I was working at UPS and needed to send a package, that the easiest thing to do was just take it with me into the office. No. It&#8217;s very easy to take things into a UPS facility and very difficult to get them back out. I had to talk to two levels of security with my manager, and then we had to get two managers to walk me out of the facility and to the retail office that was at the other end of the block. And I was told in no uncertain terms never to bring any packages into the office again.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
