<p><a href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/actionable"> The word <i>actionable</i></a> has as its primary meaning "providing grounds for legal action", but in the world of management, it is the secondary meaning "capable of being acted upon" that is more common. Something that is <i>actionable</i> provides a specific demand for action. Although I'm not necessarily a big fan of the word itself, I definitely appreciate the value of the concept it is trying to capture.</p>

<p> The concept is valuable because it emphasizes the importance of clear communication, and making sure people understand what you want. Without it, meetings turn into a passive-aggressive-athon, with people saying, "Oh, sorry, I didn't realize you wanted me to do anything about that. I thought you were just venting." </p>
<p> That's also why I'm not happy with the nounification of the word <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/07/48304.aspx"> <i>ask</i></a>. It's not a requirement; it's not a demand. It's this vague <i>ask</i> thing. How do you prioritize an <i>ask</i>? </p>

		<p>If you ask me, you prioritize an &quot;ask&quot; along with all the other &quot;ask&quot;s, near the bottom of the list. &nbsp;If it&#8217;s not important enough for you to make it a requirement, or a demand, then it&#8217;s not important enough for me to do unless I have nothing else to work on.</p>
<p>If you want me to do it, make it a requirement. &nbsp;If you just want me to feel good that you aren&#8217;t making requirements, then don&#8217;t expect it to get done. &nbsp;:-P</p>
<p>But then again, I&#8217;m not management, either&#8230;</p>

		<p>Doesn&#8217;t the use of &quot;actionable&quot; communication inadvertently narrow the range of appropriate responses to it? Doesn&#8217;t it suppress otherwise appropriate responses that do not fit its perspective?</p>
<p>It also seems excessively confrontational and demanding rather than mutually supportive.</p>

		<p>I think that actionable communication is important, and people who are proficient with it learn to write their messages so they are clear that they are willing to accept other approaches. &nbsp;For example:</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m seeing behavior X, but I had expected in this case that I&#8217;d see behavior Y. &nbsp;Could someone explain to me why X happens? &nbsp;Is there a different API I should be using that would get me the results I&#8217;m looking for?&quot;</p>
<p>You have to make it clear what you&#8217;re looking for, or you will be misunderstood. &nbsp;Just saying &quot;I&#8217;m seeing behavior X&quot; certainly implies that you&#8217;re unhappy with the result, but why? &nbsp;In technical communication, you should generally explain what you were doing, what happened when you did it, and what you were trying to achieve when you did it. &nbsp;That&#8217;ll put the request into context, and you&#8217;re much more likely to get the answer that you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<p>Also, Raymond was translating very short statements into very short statements. &nbsp;You can see in my example above that being actionable doesn&#8217;t mean that you have to be confrontational and/or demanding.</p>

		<p>This is one of those inside Microsoft terms that you tend to take for granted until confronted with the question of what the term is expected to accomplish. It&#8217;s ironic because in past jobs I had used the term &quot;request&quot; for an item such as this, but had stopped using it because it just didn&#8217;t seem to be &quot;Microsoft&quot; enough.</p>

		<p>Nounification and verbification are both *nouns* denoting the action of converting from to a noun or verb by adding suffixes. </p>

		<p>&quot;Ask&quot; is something that&#8217;s always bothered me. There was already a perfectly good word that means *exactly the same thing*: &quot;request&quot;. Instead of &quot;I have an ask&quot;, what was wrong with &quot;I have a request&quot;? Was the savings of a single syllable really worth such an awkward construction?</p>

		<p>In Denmark an ask would be a tree. Trees are outside with all the other green stuff. I&#8217;m inside. So none of my business. :-)</p>
<p>But seriously, all this trying not to be confrontational is screwing up communication instead of enabling it. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with conflicts as long as they are handled constructively. That&#8217;s a skill that can be learned. Is trying to avoid confrontations a sign that *gasp* women are horning in on our playground?!? We&#8217;re doomed!*</p>
<p>As an aside, when Winston Churchill was asked what he thought about the prediction that in the year 2000 women would rule the world, he muttered &quot;They still will, will they?&quot;.</p>
<p>*: Kindly note the tongue in my cheek. The best sysadmin I&#8217;ve ever worked with was of the female persuasion. OK?</p>

		<p>Actionable has good uses in guidelines like &quot;meeting summaries should contain actionalbe items&quot;.</p>
<p>Actionable != Doable:</p>
<p>Actionable = &quot;capable of being acted upon&quot;, as opposed to &quot;so what do you want exactly&quot;</p>
<p>Doable = &quot;something you can do&quot;, as opposed to &quot;something you can&#8217;t do (because it&#8217;s impossible / etc)&quot;</p>
<p>When asking people that are not personally commited to getting me answers, I usually number my asks (nyah! to all you ask-haters):</p>
<p>Hello,</p>
<p>In scenario A, I see behaviour X when I expect behaviour Y.</p>
<ol>
<li>Why is that?</li>
<li>
<p>Is that intenional? Documented?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can I get Y?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>etc.</p>

<p>Any hardware guy would ask you for your copy of hardware manual, rip it apart and get you a new one which says you should get Y.</p>

		<p>&#8212;-&quot;I hate the verbification of the word noun&quot;&#8212;-</p>

		<p>&#8212;-&quot;How does a statement like &quot;Red Hat users owe us money for our intellectual property in linux&quot; parse?</p>
<p>Is that an actionable statement?&quot;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d argue Balmer ought to be sued for chutzpah.</p>

		<p>Add the following to the Microsoft vernacular&#8230; in order of increasing importance:</p>
<ol>
<li>a beg</li>
<li>
<p>a plead</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>an ask</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a demand</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>a mandate</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Sorry, items 4 and 5 are real nouns. File a beg to nounify two unsuspecting verbs. :-)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
