<p>One of the audio features added to Windows&nbsp;7 goes by the formal name <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd316773.aspx"> <i>stream attenuation</i></a>, but it is more commonly known to people in the audio world as <i>ducking</i>. Ducking is the process of lowering the volume of background sounds in order to draw more attention to the foreground sound. For example, when you're watching a big battle scene in <a href="http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20090623/REVIEWS/906239997"> a summer action movie</a>, your ears are assaulted with the sounds of weapons fire, objects exploding left and right, but when the hero turns to his girlfriend-of-the-moment, the sound level of all the death and destruction drops a bit so you can hear him say something tender, or maybe inspiring, or maybe inspiringly tender. Something like that. And then when the moment is over, the sound level returns to normal and once again the sound of things blowing up overwhelms your eardrums.</p>
<p> Sorry, I got a bit carried away. Where was I? Oh right, ducking. </p>
<p> Ducking is the process of temporarily reducing the volume of background sounds in order to make foreground sounds easier to hear. Here's <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/pdc2008/PC13/"> a presentation from the 2008 PDC</a> by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/"> Larry Osterman</a> which covers the technical part of ducking. </p>
<p> When the feature was added to Windows&nbsp;7, the icon on the <i>Communications</i> tab of the Sound control panel was a yellow rubber duck. Those audio folks think they're so cute. </p>
<p> Sadly (or perhaps fortunately), the icon was changed to a telephone handset. </p>
<p> The subject line of this article is an inside joke: When visiting one of my friends, I would sometimes speak to his three-year-old daughter in German, because they say that exposure to multiple languages is a good thing. At one time, I asked her a question, I forget what it was, and she responded, in English, "That's not a duck!" </p>
<p> None of us could figure out what she was talking about, but it has been a catch phrase among us for over a decade. </p>

		<p>I hate to say it but this is probably the worst &quot;feature&quot; of Windows 7. &nbsp;It could&#39;ve been fine, if only it had not been enabled by default. &nbsp;This confuses people to no end. &nbsp;They go to use two separate audio apps at the same time (for example game + voice comm software) and wonder why the volume on one of them drops really low, seemingly at random. &nbsp;They have no idea this feature exists. &nbsp;Windows doesn&#39;t tell you it&#39;s doing this behind your back. &nbsp;The setting for it is buried in the Control Panel. &nbsp;And it coexists poorly with other audio problems people have.</p>

		<p>The problem as always with Windows is not the feature &#8211; I think it&#39;s cool, the problem is people don&#39;t know &nbsp;that and I&#39;m 100% convinced MS hides settings on purpose. &nbsp;Everyone I know gets frustrated trying to find out how to do this and undo that because the settings are nowhere where you&#39;d expect them. &nbsp;On the plus (sometimes negative) it&#39;s the only time I get a call from these people. &nbsp;LOL</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t think that&#39;s true for DVD&#39;s I wish it was. One thing that I noticed (and commonly reoccurs) is that we&#39;ll be watching a DVD and we can hear everything except for the dialog. It&#39;s very annoying.</p>

		<p>@jader3rd DVDs typically use Dolby audio; Dolby decoders typically have a setting that allows you to switch between &quot;theater mode&quot; (high dynamic range) and &quot;night mode&quot; (low dynamic range) and may also have a &quot;dialog normalization&quot; setting.</p>

		<p>Steam has had issues with Win7&#39;s audio ducking for quite a while now; they just finally fixed it in the last update. &nbsp;It took me several days to figure out why all of a sudden my music would get really quiet for a minute or so and then return to normal, and I *knew* all about the new ducking feature (read Larry&#39;s original blog posts about it long time ago).</p>
<p>I agree with the first couple comments about feature discoverability in Windows, but I don&#39;t pretend to know a solution. &nbsp;While more dialog boxes is (almost) never the right answer, maybe a prompt the first time ducking occurs (similar to the accessibility dialogs) would help people know about the feature and disable it if they want to.</p>

		<p>I had to turn this feature off, on it&#39;s own it&#39;s fine. But it&#39;s activated by default, and many audio sensitive applications implement this themselves. Voice program A will push all other sound down by 50%, then windows will come in and do it as well(expect for a different app).</p>

		<p>@jader3rd: If you have problems with dialog on most DVDs, turn up the volume on your center channel (dialog is placed there on purpose), and reduce the volume on the left and right channels.</p>
<p>If you are not using a surround sound system, check the 2 channel outputs of your DVD player. Some of them map only the left/right audio of a 5.1 stream to the 2ch outputs. Others mix the center channel into the left-right (which also allows Pro Logic decoding). If your DVD player does the former, that&#39;s why dialog is so low as the center audio is missing and only a little of it bleeds to the left/right channels. You may have to play around with the connections to see if maybe switching to PCM only (digital) rather than bitstream, or using the analog outputs work better.</p>

		<p>For those wondering about the commonality of the term &quot;duck&quot; in audio, it&#39;s *extremely* common in film-audio post, only slightly less so in live sound and studio engineering. &nbsp;Corporate and fixed-install guys should know it straight off. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I can&#39;t speak to the frequency with which one encounters this term outside of the US and the UK, but it&#39;s absolutely a term that pros in the industry will know. &nbsp;Having been in the film/studio/live-sound tools industry for over a decade, I can simply say that they chose the right term for this feature.</p>
<p>Now, whether or not users actually want auto-ducking on their computer? &nbsp;Well&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
