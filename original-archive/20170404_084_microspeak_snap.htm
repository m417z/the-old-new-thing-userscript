<!-- CONTENT START -->
<p>
Today's Microspeak is the word <i>snap</i>,
which means "To take a snapshot of the source code,"
usually for the purpose of producing a build.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
The build lab snaps at 6pm,
so make sure your changes are in by then.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This is saying that the build lab will take
whatever has been checked in as of 6pm
and use that to generate a build.
If you commit your changes at 6:01pm,
they won't be in the build.
</p>
<p>
The term <i>snap</i> may be applied to
a process that goes beyond a single build:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
The release team is going to snap at 6pm
for the beta.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This means that
the release team has decided to create a release
branch based on what was checked in at 6pm.
If you want your changes to be in the beta,
they need to be checked in before 6pm.
</p>
<p>
Nobody ever says <i>snapshot</i>.
It's just <i>snap</i>.</p>

		<p>In a place where people don&#8217;t add label to source control before starting to build things, we were frequently requested to hold all the check-ins before the whatever-build-they-prepare-to-send-to-customer is complete.</p>

		<p>In British English at least, &#8220;The release team is going to snap&#8221; translates more as &#8220;&#8230;will be going postal&#8221; (which sounds reasonable)</p>

		<p>&#8220;Nobody ever says snapshot. It&#8217;s just snap.&#8221; Because snap is a verb; snapshot is a noun. (All your examples so far have been verbs.)</p>

		<p>Verbing nouns is perfectly cromulent behaviour.</p>

		<p>Yes, it&#8217;s a verb, but it&#8217;s being used in a non standard way, as a shortcut for &#8220;take(s) a snapshot of the code&#8221;.  Also, snapshot is both a noun and a verb, just like snap, according to dictionary.com.</p>

		<p>&#8220;snap&#8221; seen in the wild from the Skype team just this weekend. <a href="https://microsoft.github.io/reactxp/blog/" rel="nofollow">https://microsoft.github.io/reactxp/blog/</a><br />
Definitely reads as &#8220;take a snapshot&#8221; but I still need to double read it as I just think of a string snapping.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
