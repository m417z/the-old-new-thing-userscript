<p>On Mark Rosenfelder's <a href="http://www.zompist.com/">Zompist</a> web site I found a series of cultural guides named <a href="http://www.zompist.com/amercult.html"> How to tell if you're &lsaquo;<i>nationality</i>&rsaquo;</a>. All of the entries are simultaneously funny and insightful, such as this one <a href="http://www.zompist.com/turkcult.html"> from Turkey</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> A company can fire just about anybody it wants. But it will also hire anybody. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> For some reason, my favorite is this one from <a href="http://www.zompist.com/poland.html"> the Polish entry</a>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> When you negotiate, you are polite, of course, but it's only good business to 'play hardball'. You don't say what you mean, you pretend not to know many things, but you surely never lie. You know the other side does the same thing, and they know you know. Many people are tired of it, so they start talking normally. You say "let's talk like people" then. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I like how the Poles understand that it's all an act, and they have a code for saying, "This is stupid." </p>
<p> While you're there, you should also check out <a href="http://www.zompist.com/phrases.html"> The Zompist Phrasebook</a>, the absolutely worst phrasebook you'll ever find that's still hilarious. </p>

<p>Impressed as I am with the New Wave in cinematography, I must say that this particular film seemed both pretentious and unsatisfying, and that the director&#8217;s imagery, though compelling, is no substitute for a true cinematic message.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I don&#8217;t know&#8230; Being Pole I sadly agree with, like, 99,99% of the &quot;facts&quot; in Polish entry.</p>
<p>Anyway, it took me a while to translate &quot;Let&#8217;s talk like people&quot; back into Polish. If I&#8217;m correct, this is &quot;Porozmawiajmy jak ludzie&quot; (more &quot;human beings&quot; than &quot;people&quot;, never the less the original entry is great). It is used by one one side when he/she thinks that he/she will not get even the acceptable minimum. Or something like that.</p>

		<p>Lies, all lies! ;-)</p>
<p>Seriously, spent 24 years of my life in Poland and this is the first time I saw &quot;let&#8217;s talk like people&quot; phrase. We do say &quot;let&#8217;s talk like grown ups&quot;, but that&#8217;s used if you intend to insult your &quot;oponent&quot;. We do say &quot;stop this BS&quot;. Lets talk like people? Never.</p>

		<p>Well, the French version fits French people perfectly.</p>
<p>The &quot;anti-translations&quot; in the phrasebook are funny, but I agree Centaur, some of the &quot;normal&quot; translations look a bit strange.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
