The Internet appears to have awakened to the surprise that
the trench run that serves as the climax of the original
<i>Star Wars</i> movie
<a HREF="http://fxrant.blogspot.com.au/2017/01/the-death-star-and-final-trench-run.html">
doesn't take place along the Death Star's equatorial trench</a>,
but rather takes place along a smaller north-south trench.
</p>
<p>
I have to say that I was not fooled into thinking that it
was the equatorial trench.
But I was fooled anyway.
</p>
<p>
Based on the graphics in the briefing sequence,
I was led to believe
that the attack route was a dive into the Death Star's core.
I mean, look at it:
The line goes from the north pole straight down to what appears
to be the center of the Death Star.

<p>
I kept waiting for the fighters to stop putzing around on the surface
and make their final dive into the core,
but it never happened.
</p>
<p>
Oh well.
I enjoyed the movie anyway.</p>

		<p>I never thought the trench run took place along the equatorial trench. Figured it would be some random trench. The movie showed quite clearly what that equatorial trench was and the trench run looked nothing like that.</p>

		<p>Really? I recall the graphics in the briefing scene clearly showing a ship dropping a torpedo onto the top of the exhaust port, and then pulling up and flying away. The torpedo either travels down the port into the core, or explodes inside the top of the port and the explosion ripples down the port into the core.</p>
<p>Still, RotJ has a final dive into the core, so you only had to wait 6 years to eventually see it.</p>

		<p>Does the Death Star even have an equator? It only would have one if it spun along some axis. I don&#8217;t remember much spinning going on.</p>

		<p>It has to be able to spin because its superlaser only has a limited arc of fire. For instance, if it&#8217;s been attacking the rebel fleet, it would need to rotate 180° in order to destroy the moon of Endor. I don&#8217;t know how many axes of spin it&#8217;s capable of but at the very least it&#8217;s capable of the one necessary to name the equatorial trench.</p>

		<p>Well, it has to be able to orient itself in any direction in space, necessitating rotation around all 3 dimensions. That doesn&#8217;t mean that &#8220;it spins&#8221; &#8211; i.e. has a preferred non-zero angular momentum around a well-defined axis. In fact, if it did spin, the angular momentum would be an impediment to orienting itself in a given direction.</p>
<p>(Although, this is the Star Wars universe we&#8217;re talking about, so &#8220;conservation of momentum&#8221; and &#8220;in space&#8221; do not necessarily work the same way as they do in ours ;-)</p>

		<p>Cool links to background material!<br />
I always thought the trench run was a random trench, rather than the equator. But I also wondered why the Empire would have had heavy cannons facing <b>down</b> the trench. Did they really anticipate enemies slithering through random alleys on the Death Star surface? Cannons everywhere would have been expensive! Maybe the filmmakers added cannons for dramatic effect. 8-&gt;</p>

		<p>Star Wars is full of inconsistencies, what is more important is whether it was supposed to be the equatorial trench. It looks like a lucky coincidence that the wireframe animation (that we know is wrong) gives a plausible explanation.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
