<p>
In the process of designing a way for a game to
obtain the the ping time to a game server,
the question arose
as to what units the ping time should be expressed in.
The original idea was to express the ping time in
milliseconds,
since that's the unit in general use.
</p>
<p>
But someone asked,
"What if networking technology improves to the point
where sub-millisecond ping times become commonplace?
Should we use a time reporting unit with higher resolution,
so that if there are multiple servers with
sub-millisecond times, the app can pick the best one?"
</p>
<p>
Well, first of all, for people playing online games,
any ping time less than 20 milliseconds is
probably good enough.
If you had to choose between two servers that both
have sub-millisecond ping times,
you would be ecstatic.
</p>
<p>
Second, the speed of light is unlikely to improve.
The absolute lowest ping time is therefore the time it
takes light to travel from your computer to the other
computer, and back.
Make all the improvements in netwokring technology
you want.
A system more than 150km away will never be able to produce
a sub-millisecond round-trip ping time.
</p>
<p>
We stuck with milliseconds.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s actually not even that good, unless the space between you and the server is a vacuum and the trip is light all the way. The speed of light in a fiber optic cable is about 30% slower (a simple rule of thumb is that a signal using optical fiber for communication will travel at around 200,000 kilometers per second). So, make that ~100 km (~60 miles) and that&#8217;s fiber distance, not physical distance. Subtract more for time spent as electrons in copper plus latency through the integrated circuits and software that makes up switches, routers, and media converters (copper to fiber and back).</p>
<p>You might not see sub-millisecond times even if you&#8217;re in the same building.</p>

<p>That exists. Not vacuum, but close enough: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_optical_communication" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free-space_optical_communication</a></p>
<p>Also, some high-frequency traders buy line-of-sight microwave links, since they have less latency than optic fiber.</p>

		<p>The question &#8220;what if networking technology improves to the point where sub-millisecond response times become commonplace?&#8221; is an example of someone either not using common sense, or not being &#8220;numerically literate&#8221;.  Even applying grease to the wires won&#8217;t make the electrons travel faster, as you said.</p>
<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s hard to look at the bigger picture&#8230;..</p>
<p>A ping to the router that&#8217;s 60 feet down the hall from me often says &#8220;&lt;1 ms&quot;, and that&#039;s good enough info for me!</p>

<p>Once you realise there is nothing is particularly spooky with quantum mechanics and that you just need a different model for the particles then all the magic disappears. A Ford and a Ferrari will go round corners differently and a model for one doesn&#8217;t match the model for another, it doesn&#8217;t mean one of them can fly.</p>

		<p>Had a related problem at a past company, a customer was complaining of reliability in our program&#8217;s comms over a satellite link.  The devs said, &#8220;oh that shouldn&#8217;t be a problem&#8221;.  I did a back-of-the-napkin lower bound estimate on latency assuming geosynchronous orbit and speed-of-light transmission, and stuck that number into a router that allowed simulating latency.</p>
<p>The problem was easily reproduced.  And then fixed :)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not sure why you bothered to estimate it. You either test it with multiple latencies to make sure it works no matter what the latency is, or you find out the actual latency that the link has.</p>
<p>You could have ended up &#8220;fixing&#8221; an issue that the customers weren&#8217;t experiencing and ignoring the issue that they were. You got lucky.</p>

		<p>I estimated it purely to provide a firm lower bound.  Because nobody else was bothering to do it, and didn&#8217;t seem to occur in their imaginations that the latency could be &#8220;that high&#8221;.  Nope, I wasn&#8217;t doing anything sophisticated, just using a basic laws-of-physics cluebat!</p>

		<p>It depends on what the pings are used for. With sufficiently fat pipe (to make the wasteful use of bandwidth more acceptable) a server could pre-emptively reply to pings that hadn&#8217;t been issued yet. Recipients would ignore the replies to things they hadn&#8217;t asked and enjoy sub-millisecond reply times to things that they had asked. (The server would use the actual questions to guide the second-guessing algorithm.)</p>
<p>Obviously you&#8217;d want to hide most of that complexity behind some sort of proxy layer, at which point the rest of the client code probably believes it has sub-millisecond ping times to the remote server.</p>

		<p>Of course the next logical step would be for Netflix to start sending me every video stream in their library continuously so I never have to buffer when starting a video.</p>

		<p>In order to not &#8220;buffer&#8221;, you&#8217;d need to actually buffer all that video. So, unless you had a massively parallel connection and memory, you&#8217;re still &#8220;buffering&#8221; the pre-emptively sent data sequentially and so, if what you wanted to watch wasn&#8217;t one of the first things sent, you&#8217;d end up needing to wait for it to &#8220;buffer&#8221;. Buffering just leads to more buffering.</p>

		<p>It would certainly be possible to buffer Netflix locally, it&#8217;s not the size of the internet. They almost certainly have their own caches closer to customers already, it&#8217;s just an extrapolation of that. Like any predictive cache, it has downsides when what you want isn&#8217;t in the cache. So zero day programmes on Netflix would likely take longer to get out to everyone, but I doubt they care too much as they don&#8217;t broadcast live and anything they want to make available at a certain time can be pushed out in advance. It would fail completely if they were adding more content quicker than it could be downloaded.</p>
<p>Some broadcasters do pre-emptively send out content that is stored on your set top box hard drive in case you want it. Kinda like the U2 album being sent out to iphones but because it doesn&#8217;t fill up your entire device then it doesn&#8217;t get such bad press.</p>

		<p>I get less than 1ms ping to another machine.  It&#8217;s not *much* less than 1ms, and it&#8217;s hardwired into my local network and in the same room&#8230; but still.  :)</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s much like people asking why we don&#8217;t have 64-bit quality music &#8211; because the current standard is already an overkill. Pushing up the precision will not give any improvement on things you think could improve.</p>

		<p>&#8220;It’s much like people asking why we don’t have 64-bit quality music – because the current standard is already an overkill. Pushing up the precision will not give any improvement on things you think could improve.&#8221;</p>
<p>The current standard is 16 bit @ 44100 and a lot of music is delivered below that. You can get 24 bit @ 48000 but it&#8217;s not the standard. Going higher than 48000 is probably worth it, I&#8217;m not sure that going higher than 24 bit is. Not because it&#8217;s some magical property of human hearing, but because the more bits you add the harder (and therefore more expensive) it is to build a DAC &amp; you need that level of accuracy at every level including the speakers.</p>

		<p>For a final format, 44.1 kHz 16 bit per sample is almost certainly beyond the limits of human hearing.</p>
<p>Assuming a decent DAC, that&#8217;s good enough to get perfect reproduction at up to 20 kHz, and a dynamic range such that if it&#8217;s just about reproducing the quietest sounds you can hear, the loudest sounds in the media are at about the same volume as a jackhammer at 1 meter distance (that&#8217;s 3.2808 feet in American measures).</p>
<p>There&#8217;s definitely no need for a higher sampling frequency &#8211; you *might* gain a little bit from an extra 4 bits (so 20 bits) per sample, if you&#8217;re mostly interested in things like the 1812 Overture, with a mix of full volume cannons and quieter music.</p>

		<p>smf, going above 48 kHz / 16 bit is largely pointless for music distribution. 96 dB dynamic range is plenty enough for listening, especially given that you won&#8217;t find a listening environment with low enough background acoutic noise levels to get even that for non-hearing damage inducing listening levels. For playback you can use a couple of more bits to allow digital volume control, and for recording 24 bits (closer to 19 bits of actual resolution unless you pay big money) gives more headroom for unexpected peaks.</p>

		<p>The overhead of the protocol stack has to be taken into consideration as well. For example, if I ping a VM on my server I get pretty good pings but they&#8217;re still in the 0.2-0.5ms range  (it&#8217;s not a super-powerful server!); even pinging localhost gives me 0.06-0.07ms times.</p>
<p>I wonder if ping times will go down as IPv6 becomes adopted more widely. One of the promises that I remember hearing when IPv6 first came out was that the number of hops would decrease as ISPs could simplify their internal network routes, as well as not needing NAT techniques. I&#8217;m not certain about this yet: my ping times to IPv4 and v6 hosts are roughly the same.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll see any benefits of IPV6 until IPV4 is dead and buried and IPV4 is still relevant as a lot of devices don&#8217;t support IPV6 (the majority of smartphones and a lot of ADSL routers for example).</p>
<p>It may then show some improvement, but maybe not as the ietf have worked hard to keep IPV4 working effectively until it can be dropped. Unfortunately some people have then seen this as a reason not to switch to IPV6, but there will come a time when IPV4 can&#8217;t be kept working effectively and there are enough IPV6 compatible devices to justify switching IPV4 off.</p>
<p>Kinda like how the huge investment in Year 2000 changes made most of the problems disappear, so people wondered why so much money was spent on fixing Year 2000 problems.</p>

		<p>if taken to the extreme a ping of 1 Nanosecond would mean at most a 30cm round-trip. </p>
<p>That&#8217;s one of the reasons (besides power dissipation etc) that we currently are limited to a few GHz CPU frequency: at 3GHz you can &#8220;only&#8221; have a chip diameter in the order of a few cm if you want it to be synchronuous (which is the easiest to design and has the lowest latency). We can go up with the speed when we build smaller synchronuous areas, but then we add complexity for the communication between those areas.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
