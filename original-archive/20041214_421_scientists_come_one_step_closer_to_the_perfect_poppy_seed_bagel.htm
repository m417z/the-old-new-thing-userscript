		<p>Distributing points evenly is very hard, I usually do something along the lines of <a target="_new" href="http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/experiments/repel/" rel="nofollow">http://mrl.nyu.edu/~perlin/experiments/repel/</a> as a preprocess and be done with it.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know that &quot;make a bunch of points repel each other&quot; is really a new technique.  I first encountered this basic technique a long time ago, on this delightful (but rarely updated) home page: </p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think the technique is new either.  I haven&#8217;t read the paper yet, but I assume they&#8217;ve thrown in something new.  I had a toy app a few years ago that used a similar technique to generate an arbitrary number of colors for a graph such that no two colors were too &quot;close&quot;.  In that case, the metric on the color space was more important than the particular exponent in the force function.  But the idea is the same.<br />
<br />I also remember a talk from when I was in grad school by someone who was using the technique to place points on the surface of a sphere.  In that case, it was a small number of points.  E.g. 5 points go 3 on the equator, 2 at the poles, etc. (similar to Eric&#8217;s link).  Some distributions were unintuitive, and some had several different &quot;local minima&quot;.</p>

		<p>I think the paper provides a mathematical tool to distribute points evenly on any type of curved surfaces, not just a sphere (as in most examples i read from some links)</p>

		<p>Using repulsion to distribute points over a surface isn&#8217;t new.  An analytical result connecting the way the points distribute, the exponent of the repelling function and the dimension of the surface, is new.  This lets you choose a repelling function that will give a provably optimal distribution of points.<br /></p>

		<p>For those too lazy to navigate the gruesome Vanderbilt site (and I did not see a link in the news article):</p>
<p><a target="_new" href="http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~esaff/saff_articles.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.math.vanderbilt.edu/~esaff/saff_articles.html</a></p>
<p>It&#8217;s the topmost paper.</p>

		<p>&quot;It&#8217;s the topmost paper&quot;  That criteria for finding the paper will certainly be no longer true at some point!  The papers seem to have fixed numbers; is it the paper numbered 201?  That&#8217;s the topmost at 6:04 PM Mountain time USA on 12/16/2004.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
