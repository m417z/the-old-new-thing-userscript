<p>Sixth grade students (ages 11 to 12, roughly) were instructed to imagine that they have no television, computer, or telephone for a week and write an essay (in the form of a letter to their parents) on what they would do with their time and why. The assignment was given under standardized test conditions: 90 minutes with nothing but pencil and paper, with an additional hour available upon request. (In practice, few students ask for the extra hour.)</p>
<p> Remember, these are only the funny sentences/excerpts. Do not assume that all students write like this. </p>
<p> <b>Stage One: Denial</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>A powerman came to our house and is trying to fix the     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="precious">precios</span>     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="valuables">valubles</span>...     <i>But don't touch the family jewels.</i> </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Stage Two: Anger</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Since you have forcefully restricted me from using     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="essential">essenchal</span>,     electronics like the TV... </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Stage Three: Bargaining</b> </p>
<p> (couldn't find an example, sorry) </p>
<p> <b>Stage Four: Depression</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>My heart is full of grief and sadness,     yet I regret nothing but the loss of my precious x-box. </li>
<li>Although I am in a mood of melancholy over this gloomy oncoming event,     I hope my hobbies will cheer me up.     <i>Big words sound bigger.</i> </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Stage Five: Acceptance</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Since you have grounded me for a week, I need to nurture my growing sense of fun. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Other excerpts</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>[When working in the barn]     1) don't touch the electric fence 2) don't throw poop </li>
<li>Every day, I am getting closer to achieving my goal of     attacking my friends.     <i>You should see what your friends' goals are.</i> </li>
<li>... Gliding on black     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="asphalt">ashphault</span> ... </li>
<li>I'm going to play legos until my arms hurt.     <i>In my experience,     <a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/i-hope-you-step-on-a-lego">     your feet hurt first</a>.</i> </li>
<li>I have a life outside the digital world! </li>
<li>My grade went     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academic_grading_in_North_America">     from a C- to an A-</a>,     and that is the second highest you can get!     <i>So why not do it for real?</i> </li>
<li>After a long day of skating,     my legs are battered and crunched, and that just means I had a good day. </li>
<li>I have noticed lately that my social level is not up to my standards.     <i>Level up?</i> </li>
<li>I will draw elaborate scratches of     <a href="http://www.officemuseum.com/pencil_history.htm">     lead</a>     all over the blank paper. </li>
<li>Inside used to be another word for     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="trapped">trapt</span>.     Now it translates to party! </li>
<li>We have invented a new game.  We tie one sister to a post...     <i>I'm not sure who the winner of the game is,     but I'm pretty sure I know who the loser is.</i> </li>
<li>One of my options for an activity is reading.     I have noticed a big collection of books on my shelf     and a few look quite interesting.     <i>How'd those books get there?</i> </li>
<li>If there were no phones, I would die, but I would still have fun. </li>
<li>Remember, reading is a movie on pages. </li>
<li>By going to church, you don't need anything but faith. </li>
<li>I would go play behind the     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="aggressive">agresive</span>     looking houses.     <i>I prefer passive housing myself.</i> </li>
<li>Skydiving I went once it is like diving into a pool     you lose your     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="stomach">stomache</span>     sometimes you find it sometimes you don't.     <i>Somehow the run-on sentence makes it more poetic.</i> </li>
<li>It is a very relaxful activity. </li>
<li>One book I will read is     <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/0310205719?tag=tholneth-20">     A Purpose Driven Life</a>. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Any final requests?</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>The last thing I will do is tape toys together and make new toys. </li>
<li>The last thing I will do is go bike     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="riding">ridding</span>. </li>
<li>The final activity I would do is Africa!     <i>Um, you might want to rephrase that.</i> </li>
<li>Then, last but not     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="least">leave</span>, my instruments... </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>I'm not resentful. Why do you ask?</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Sincerely, Your Daughter, the Formerly Loved. </li>
</ul>
<p> Observe that many students talked about "the last thing" they would do. This is another consequence of adhering too close to formula. "I have three things, so I will say 'The first thing', 'The next thing', and 'the last thing'." They don't realize that when you write "The last thing I will do", it carries a somewhat different meaning. </p>
<p> (Today's post is in support of the millions of people currently <a href="http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/49593609/ns/weather/"> without electricity due to Hurricane Sandy</a>.) </p>

		<p>@Rick: I&#39;m guessing this was queued up for much later, but Raymond decided to move it up and make it a 2nd post for today (most weekdays are one post, but two are not uncommon).</p>
<p>I look forward to tomorrow&#39;s post about Halloween (or Hallowe&#39;en, as Raymond likes to write), and Friday&#39;s post about some Daylight Saving Time-related topic.</p>

		<p>Come on give them a break! &nbsp;They&#39;re only 11-12, although that last point about &quot;The last thing I will do&quot; was funny.</p>

		<p>•One of my options for an activity is reading. I have noticed a big collection of books on my shelf and a few look quite interesting.</p>
<p>The oppotunity cost for spending time to read time used to be too high, now I finally have the chance to finish them one by one.</p>
<p>Am I do it right? :P</p>
<p>(As for why the books end up there&#8230; There used to be mystical mechanism for books be automagically fill in a child&#39;s bookshelves&#8230; even with books that the child never have interest to read&#8230;)</p>

<p>I&#39;m still amazed by the thought of someone think they&#39;ll die if they don&#39;t bear the &quot;life threatening bell&quot;. Maybe they&#39;ll have different thought when they get older.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
