		<p>Have you tried using MSDN to find Win32 API help lately? You have to wade through page after page of C# info before you get to what you really want. I know MSDN is not your area but the original poster had at least tried to find information and it seems unfair to slate them for not knowing the exact place to look.</p>
<p>How about a small article on the resources used by &#8216;Guru Raymond&#8217;.</p>

		<p>The Win32 API has been renamed the Windows API (which I just discovered today via a search). &nbsp;I searched for that and found this:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc433218" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc433218</a>(VS.85).aspx</p>
<p>After that you have the tree on the left that can take you to the reference. &nbsp;Seems better organized than ever.</p>

		<p>To be fair, it&#8217;s really hard to search for things like &quot;C# ++&quot; in any web search engine, since they don&#8217;t typically recognize &quot;++&quot; as a word, and might trim off the trailing pound sign, and only actually search for &quot;C&quot;. This sometimes applies even when you&#8217;re searching the language specification directly.</p>
<p>I had a similar problem recently when searching for what &quot;$&quot; did in some Javascript code I was maintaining. According to the ECMAScript specification (the first place I looked), $ is reserved for &quot;mechanically-generated code&quot; whatever that means. Turns out, in reality, it&#8217;s commonly used in libraries like mootools.js, prototype.js to mean &quot;getElementById.&quot; Sometimes. Some libraries overload $ to do something entirely different. jquery.js uses it to do something entirely different, thus making it impossible to use jquery.js and prototype.js on the same site.</p>
<p>All of these libraries are probably in violation of the ECMAScript language spec, which makes me laugh since they&#8217;re usually maintained by the most hardcore &quot;web standards are God! Any violation from the standards deserves DEATH!&quot;-type of people.</p>

		<p>Steve, have -you- tried MSDN lately? &nbsp;The search received a major upgrade a couple of weeks ago.</p>
<p>For this MD5 hash example, if you go to <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/</a> , then type &quot;create md5 hash&quot; into the search box then filter by &quot;Win32 &amp; COM development&quot;, and then filter further by &quot;Windows Security&quot;, it becomes pretty easy to find the answer you&#8217;re looking for. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>David, thanks for the tip, but it mostly annoys me when I&#8217;m already at the language spec and their search engine won&#8217;t find things like &quot;++&quot; or &quot;%&quot; or what-not. Adobe&#8217;s Actionscript documentation is an example of this, and pretty much a good example of crappy documentation everywhere. I particularly enjoy the AS2 samples that don&#8217;t work when copied from the website and pasted into Flash CS3.</p>
<p>But this is the web world, where everything sucks.</p>

		<p>James: if you read the JQuery documentation, it provides the capability to &nbsp;interoperate with other libraries that use &quot;$&quot; via thejQuery.noConflict() method. Locating said documentation is left as an exercise for the reader ;-)</p>

		<p>For all the quirks that search engines may have, it&#8217;s pretty amazing that people often don&#8217;t even seem to try. &nbsp;We&#8217;re in an age that was literally science fiction a few years ago. I can go to any computer and type in any question (more or less) and generally get good answers. &nbsp;I&#8217;m still amazed by this every time I stop to think about it.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not so much that people don&#8217;t TRY to search (although sometimes this is the case); it&#8217;s more that people don&#8217;t know HOW to search.</p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t know jack about CryptoAPI, you are going to be hard-pressed to find any useful information about calculating MD5 hashes in unmanaged code. &nbsp;Go to MSDN and search for MD5-related things; every result is about the .NET MD5 class. &nbsp;Buried deep on the second page are a few hits that will point you in the right direction. &nbsp;The problem with searching documentation is that if you don&#8217;t have the function name it is going to be hard to find what you are looking for. &nbsp;Even Google struggles in this area. &nbsp;Inevitably you end up at a code example website that does what you are trying to do; now you have the function name and can get to the documentation with ease.</p>

		<p>MSDN search is so messed up. For some reason they want to think that an underscore is word separator. Good luck trying to search for an underscore-separated #define&#8217;d macro. That said, local search in WDK doc viewer is so incredibly slow, slower than online.</p>

		<p>There is also another library available on Windows: cryptdll.dll. The Visual Studio 2005 documentation says that is part of Windows since Windows 2000. It contains all you need for MD5 hashes: MD5Init, MD5Update and MD5Final.</p>

		<p>MSDN has changed for a little better. Underscore now means the words go immediately one after another. It still thinks I&#8217;m searching for separate Device Object words, when I want DEVICE_OBJECT, but at least Device and Object has to come together in the test. And it now prioritizes search result more or less reasonably.</p>

		<p>One thing I&#8217;d love to know a searchable name for is the &#46; and \? path name prefixes that show up in various places on MSDN. Google refuses to search for such weird strings, and MSDN search gives millions upon millions of questionable &quot;hits&quot;. I suspect it considers every page it knows to &quot;match&quot; &#46; as a search string.</p>
<p>The documentation for CreateFile tells of various things that one can put after &#46;, but makes no claim of being comprehensive. For example, &#46;mailslotfoo is not mentioned, presumably because mailslots cannot or should not be manipulated using the file API. But clearly there is some general structured namespace involved here &#8211; raising such questions as what else it is used for and what are its rules? (E.g., if I&#8217;m writing a function to check for &quot;moral equivalence&quot; of pathnames, in which parts of the namespace is . and .. compression valid?)</p>
<p>Now, if only I knew of useful search terms for &#46; and \? &#8230;</p>

		<p>Yeah, most people on Windows, even &#8212; or especially &#8212; experienced developers, don&#8217;t have the reflex of grepping in the system header files. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Probably because help view searcj is just there, and easier to search, so we&#8217;re not connected to the header files. &nbsp;Also, historically the header files have been in a folder very deep, with spaces in them. &nbsp;Just plain annoying to get at.</p>
<p>The only reason to grep is to find the value of an ID, like a windows message.</p>

		<p>Funny enough, I&#8217;m sure if some google&#8217;d for MD5 calculations, they&#8217;d run into the RFC about it, which includes a nice C implementation of MD5. A similar one exists for SHA as well.</p>
<p>And sometimes, it helps to use Wikipedia too.</p>
<p>(I had to learn how to implement s crypto service provider, and learn CryptoAPI to test my CSP)</p>

		<p>Ah, my favorite game, &quot;grep the SDK headers to find the value of a constant&quot;.</p>
<p>A game which I used to play a lot when having to do P/Invoke from C# at work.</p>
<p>Note that *some* pages in the PSDK docs will give you the constant value next to it (i.e. the SystemParametersInfo one, although in VS2008 it does not do it anymore), and some won&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8217;grep&#8217; is not recognized as an internal or external command,</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Apparently so.</p>
<p>However, a non-helpless person would probably be bold enough to try using other file searching tools at their disposals (even that built-in search feature with the annoying doggy animation can search for contents in text files for you, IIRC), or at least attempt to investigate how to acquire this wonderful utility of which Raymond speaks. Google for &quot;grep for Windows&quot; and several useful hits appear on the first page, along with a helpful suggestion to refine the search to &quot;unix utilities for Windows&quot;.</p>

		<p>The search dog is the most useless search feature EVER constructed. It doesn&#8217;t find anything useful! I had to create a search program myself. And have turned off indexing which make windows slower.</p>

		<p>@dog_sux:</p>
<p>There have been a number of upgrades to the Windows search facility since XP came out. &nbsp;The latest version is Windows Search 4.0; you can get it &lt;a href=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940157/en-us&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940157/en-us&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&#038;gt" rel="nofollow">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/940157/en-us&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&#038;gt</a>;. &nbsp;It is a big improvement.</p>
<p>Incidentally, you do realise that you can turn the dog off? &nbsp;Two or three clicks IIRC&#8230;</p>

		<p>&quot;The documentation for CreateFile tells of various things that one can put after &#46;, but makes no claim of being comprehensive. For example, &#46;mailslotfoo is not mentioned, presumably because mailslots cannot or should not be manipulated using the file API. But clearly there is some general structured namespace involved here &#8211; raising such questions as what else it is used for and what are its rules?&quot;</p>
<p>Clue: Look at the native APIs and the paths and namespace it uses. For example, if you, for example, call CreateFile with &#46;ddd, it calls NtCreateFile with ??ddd. There is also Device, for example.</p>

		<p>&quot;If you don&#8217;t know jack about CryptoAPI, you are going to be hard-pressed to find any useful information about calculating MD5 hashes in unmanaged code.&quot;</p>
<p>Similarly, you aren&#8217;t going to answer Henning Makholm&#8217;s question if you don&#8217;t know jack about the Native API.</p>
<p>BTW, WinObj lets you browse the native namespace.</p>

		<p>Searching the Headers is a good start since it will likely turn up an enumeration, does anyone remember before internet when you had to read the compiled help file or a book? &nbsp;If you were lucky you could fidonet a sample or something back when they had bulletin boards.</p>
<p>As far as Jack of the CryptoAPI I remember having one of the first betas mailed to me along with the nifty non-export warning. &nbsp;Good times then, my son was still an infant.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m with you Raymond, people stop and spend the extra fifteen minutes to try to learn something. &nbsp;It really helps in the office environment when I&#8217;m not being interrupted by a question that might have required 30 minutes of research/discovery. &nbsp;Instead of a Senior Software Engineer I&#8217;m becoming a Programming Instructor with much of my work becoming me explaining how I&#8217;ve learned to navigate documentation to get answers for things I don&#8217;t specifically know but that I understand exist because I fathom the capabilities of the hardware, the division of the modules (physically, logically), often times I discover things this is some of the joy of learning. &nbsp;(Anyhow sorry for the long comment, it&#8217;s just those questions that I can answer in 30 seconds that someone could discover in about ten minutes that distract me and drive me nuts throughout my day).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
