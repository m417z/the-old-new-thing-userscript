<p>
Remember that Microspeak is not merely for terminology specific
to Microsoft.
It also covers terms in common use which you are expected to know
because nobody will explain them to you.
</p>
<p>
In an old Microspeak entry,
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20090630-00/?p=17693">
I included a snippet from an old document</a>
that included the sentence
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
Project XYZ is at ZBB and
we are now at a recall class only bug bar until RTM. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I introduced this sentence in a discussion of the Microspeak phrase
<i>the plan for the plan</i> which appears later in the document,
but I never did get back to these other terms.
</p>
<p>
<i>ZBB</i> stands for <i>Zero Bug Bounce</i>,
which is the moment that, even for only a brief shining moment,
there were no active bugs in the database more than 48 hours old.
The precise amount of time varies from team to team, but it
means basically that there are no active bugs aside from the ones
that just came in recently.
</p>
<p>
This is an important milestone because it means that the development
team has fixed all their bugs, and they can reasonably be expected
to fix new bugs shortly after they are discovered.
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="https://ericlippert.com/">
Eric Lippert</a>
discussed this topic
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/ericlippert/2004/11/15/bouncing-zero-bugs-together/">
in greater detail in 2004</a>.
</p>
<p>
Related to ZBB is the <i>glide path</i>.
Consider a graph that shows the number of active
bugs as a function of time.
You hope that as the product nears completion, this graph
shows a line
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/testing123/2007/07/06/the-bug-glide-path/">
sloping down and to the right</a>.
Superimpose upon this graph a dotted line showing management's
prediction of active bugs in the future,
with the dotted line
reaching zero at ZBB.
That dotted line is the
<i>bug glide path</i>, or simply the
<i>glide path</i>.
</p>
<p>
Note that I'm using the word <i>prediction</i> euphemistically.
</p>
<p>
The term probably relates to the use of the term
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130716-00/?p=3793">
landing</a>
to refer to when something will be completed.
</p>
<p>
The next piece of Microspeak in that sentence is
<i>recall class</i>.
This term has its origin in the days when software was
distributed in physical media, purchased in stores.
A <i>recall-class bug</i> is a bug so severe that
you would issue a product recall,
shutting down the factory
and asking all the warehouses to send back all their
copies of the product.
</p>
<p>

Cyrus Najmabadi</a>
discussed this topic
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/cyrusn/2005/03/17/recall-class/">
in greater detail in 2005</a>.
</p>
<p>
The last Microspeak term is <i>RTM</i>, which is short for
<i>Release to Manufacturing</i>.
(The <i>T</i> is capitalized even though the word <i>to</i> is not
normally capitalized in titles.)
This term also has its origin in the days when software was
distriubuted in physical media.
It originally referred
to the point at which the final product is delivered
to factories for mass production.
Today, it refers to the point at which the final product is
delivered to whatever process gets the product into customers' hands.
</p>
<p>
You might think that the term <i>RTM</i> is obvious, but I was having a
discussion with a person who was only a few years out of college.
I used the term RTM,
and the person asked me,
"Um, what is RTM?"

		<p>The glidepath term (and ZBB and RTM) was used by my manager when I worked in Bld 5 around 1996.   He definitely drew the analogy between landing a software product and landing an airplane.   I&#8217;m curious how far back those terms go.</p>

		<p>Interesting.  When I worked at Microsoft, everybody used the term &#8220;zero-bug bounce,&#8221; but nobody was able to define it.  Different people clearly had different ideas of what would constitute a bounce.</p>
<p>At a prior company, we would estimate the glide path by computing the net run rate of (bugs found &#8211; bugs resolved).  If, over the last week, 15 new bugs were found but 25 were closed, then we&#8217;d extrapolate a glide path based on a net decline of 10 bugs a week.  Some project managers made more sophisticated models and some even secretly kept per-developer and per-feature stats to come up with better estimates based on who was working on what.  They were extremely good at release management back before it was possible to send out an update to everyone.</p>

		<p>Huh. Saying &#8220;project is ZBB&#8221; would have a completely opposite meaning for us.</p>
<p>ZBB = Zero Based Budget, a budgeting technique where you build it up from zero every time, instead of assuming that past needs are indicative of the future. But as a result of projects being killed because of the budget, something getting &#8220;ZBB&#8217;ed&#8221; means there&#8217;s no budget for it and it is therefore cancelled.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
