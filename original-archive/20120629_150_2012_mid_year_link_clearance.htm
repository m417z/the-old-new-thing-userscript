<li>     <a href="http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/02/conspiracy-uber-alles.html">     <i>Conspiracy &Uuml;ber Alles</i></a>:     Once you entertain one conspiracy theory,     you start to take them all,     even if they are contradictory.     For example,     the more strongly you believe that     Princess Diana may have faked her own death,     the more strongly you also believe that     she may have been murdered.     "The monological nature of conspiracy belief appears to be driven     not by conspiracy theories directly supporting one another     but by broader beliefs supporting conspiracy theories in general." </li>

You'll be shocked, I'm sure, to learn that     <a href="http://hookedonhouses.net/2010/06/02/the-truth-about-house-hunters-on-hgtv/">     it's a total fabrication</a>.

		<p>Interesting JPL tidbit: &nbsp;Somewhere around 2004 I had an email exchange with one of the guys at JPL that does their navigation and I asked him what type of floating point math they were using for their calculations. &nbsp;Turns out virtually everything was done with 64-bit IEEE floating point except for their &quot;master planetary ephemeris&quot; (which tracks the major planets). For that they used (if my memory is correct) some old Unisys box with supported a 68-bit floating point format. They wanted to move off that old box, but apparently those extra 4 bits of accuracy were needed.</p>

		<p>House Hunters is truer than I thought! I thought it was all fake, like, people with no intention of buying any house; them being already in the process of buying one and being shown two others is much truer than I thought.</p>

		<p>For the first reply in &quot;What is it like to have an understanding of very advanced mathematics?&quot; link, I think the mock answer for &quot;Mathematician&#39;s answer&quot; is incomplete. A real Mathematician will try to reduce it to simplest form on reply, with clear steps for how to reduce it to there. Afterall, it&#39;s why those lengthy journal papers exist.</p>

		<p>CamelCamelCamel is nice to use for tracking hard drive prices, which as of this post still haven&#39;t quite made it back to pre-flood prices. What&#39;s interesting to note is that prices were quick to rise and slow to fall; an interesting inside view of how the market works, albeit a very simple and convoluted look. Here&#39;s one example: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://camelegg.com/product/N82E16822136533" rel="nofollow">camelegg.com/&#8230;/N82E16822136533</a></p>

		<p>&quot;Gee, Raymond, all you have to do is change your target audience from &#39;IT Professionals&#39; to &#39;IT Profesionals and xpclient. How hard can that be?&quot;</p>
<p>Easy &#8211; just requires a few minor adjustments to xpclient&#8230;</p>
<p>On the NASA side, I&#39;d have thought a &quot;long double&quot; (80 bit) would do for that? (Not on MS Visual C++ for some reason, that treats it as plain &#39;double&#39;, unlike the Intel compiler.) Talking of them and conspiracies, I loved the suggestion about faking the moon landings that thoroughly being such a hard job, the easiest way would in fact be to do it for real. Clearly, Princess Diana had to fake her own death because she knew too much about that &#8211; but it all went wrong when the emergency cricothyrotomy was done using a pencil instead due to a stationery mixup in Crystal Palace.</p>
<p>The Euro-crisis articles were a good read, though I still can&#39;t shake the suspicion far too many of the target audience are the architects of the situation in question.</p>

		<p>The Mars rover video is pretty cool, but there are so many moving parts; one tiny thing goes wrong at any stage and the mission is done. &nbsp;On the other hand, I&#39;m a bit disappointed that they weren&#39;t able to do a barrel roll and tell us to deal with it.</p>

		<p>@Mark the video says why: &nbsp;the atmosphere&#39;s too thin for aerobraking. &nbsp;Left unsaid is the idea that just using a bigger rocket to land is probably a lot more expensive. &nbsp;Presumably the bouncing inflatable balls used on the previous rovers aren&#39;t scalable to the size of the new one, either.</p>

		<p>Re: The TechNet column on Power Users vs Admins</p>
<p>Sorry to ask such a basic question, but why is it that file associations are system-wide, with all the security implications that creates? Why not per-user, defaulting to the system-wide version when that&#39;s not specified, like most other setttings? This question sort of applies to COM object registrations as well, but I don&#39;t know much about COM so I&#39;m happier to believe there&#39;s an obvious answer I&#39;m missing.</p>

		<p>@Jim: &nbsp;COM object registration and file associations can be per-user or per-machine. &nbsp;The issue is that a normal user can only modify his per-user registration while a power user can modify the per-machine registration.</p>

		<p>From the Seattle thing:</p>
<p>Seattle traffic is so generous and efficient that a woman sued the city in the &#39;80s because it took her more than 7 minutes to get to work.</p>
<p>Maybe so, but ever since the late 90s it&#39;s been a mess, thanks to Tim Eyman getting the funding gutted for the mass transit that kept the traffic congestion down.</p>

		<p>Assuming you mean that you can *override* a per-machine file association with a per-user one, in that case I don&#39;t understand why this is a useful privilege to give to a power user. Just so they can annoy other users on the machine?</p>
<p>(To a certain extent this applies to the program installation privilege too, since you can install programs in your user folder. But I can understand that some poorly-written programs might not work well in that situation.)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).

<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
