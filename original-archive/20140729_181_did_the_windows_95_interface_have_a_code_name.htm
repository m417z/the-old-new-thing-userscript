		<p>I have vague memories of the term &quot;Newshell&quot; &#8212; a proper noun, one word &#8212; being used around the time of NT 4&#39;s release to distinguish its shell from NT 3.5&#39;s shell.</p>

		<p>And NT 4 didn&#39;t really have a codename either. It was just the &quot;Shell Update Release&quot;, or &quot;SUR&quot;.</p>

		<p>The funny thing about CabinetWClass is that if you run &quot;explorer.exe /e&quot; or use CMF_EXPLORE (on pre-Vista systems) then the class name is changed to ExplorerWClass. This is rather strange since you can toggle the folder pane on/off in the UI either way.</p>

		<p>&#8230;and some of the old (probably undocumented in the 90&#39;s) shell stuff like ReadCabinetState() used the Cabinet name while its cousin SHGetSetSettings() just used the now common SH prefix.</p>

		<p>Hey Raymond, how to suggest you something? Suggestion box 4 is closed, email form you don&#39;t have and I think twitter is not an option too.

		<p>Vitor, to steal a phrase from Raymond, I don&#39;t know, but I can guess. Explorer hides known extensions from some users, so it tries to protect them from typing a file name with an extension but nothing before it, as renaming a file &quot;.doc&quot; would leave it with a blank file name. This explains why explorer stops you when you just have a leading dot, but why does the second dot help? Because it&#39;s the part after the final dot which is the extension, so the leading dot is now just like any other part of the filename. The final piece of the puzzle is another bit of hand-holding from explorer &#8211; if you type a dot at the end but don&#39;t add an extension, explorer tidies it away instead.</p>

		<p>@Andy Well, looks possible and acceptable. ;)</p>

		<p>I&#39;m going to violate my own rule about following on up a major derailment.</p>
<p>With the popularity of git on Windows to even the point of Visual Studio now supporting it via MS&#39;s own development, leading . in a filename does now need to be allowed. The rules HAVE already changed and the least damage is now allowing it and not treating an initial dot as part of the extension. Depending on the bug in the check about the trailing period is stupid.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
