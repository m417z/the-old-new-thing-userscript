		<p>It&#8217;s not like $50,000 is enough to hire several people for several years to keep the computer systems running. If you&#8217;re lucky, it might last one year with one person, but yes, it&#8217;s sad that fraudsters got a hold of it.</p>

		<p>The money was supposed to go towards hiring a single person for one year.</p>

		<p>They are merely following in the fine tradition and examples set by the current banksters with their TARPs and Madoffs.</p>

		<p>It makes me feel like as if the school takes the money for gambling&#8230; except when you gamble you have certain chance to win, but for this they&#8217;re destinated to lose.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s DC. Probably one of the most corrupt school systems in one of the most corrupt local governments in the country.</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s no gambling involved here. &nbsp;The concert was intended to fail. &nbsp;(Gospel music for high-schoolers?) &nbsp;Haven&#8217;t you seen The Producers?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easier to embezzle money by holding a failed concert, than a successful concert. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a matter of: &quot;Gee, that&#8217;s too bad, you lost all my money on a concert.&quot; &nbsp;Rather than &quot;So where are the profits from the concert?&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s hard to get rid of an entrenched culture of corruption. &nbsp;China imposes the death penalty on officials caught embezzling from public funds, and people still do it.</p>

		<p>It is perhaps worth mentioning that the school system now has new leadership&#8211;not that the old top leadership was corrupt, or that it did not try to manage. Caricaturing broadly there seem to be three school syndromes.</p>
<p>Urban: a jobs and patronage machine that does not educate.</p>
<p>Well off suburban: mania for test scores rendering the supervisor&#8217;s job uncertain.</p>
<p>Poorer suburban, exurban, rural: hostility to taxes, schools squeezed for money.</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8230;John M. Cashmon, the head of the school district&#8217;s audit office&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>I wonder if his name influenced his career choice&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
