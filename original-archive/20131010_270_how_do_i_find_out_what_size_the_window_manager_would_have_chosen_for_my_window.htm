<p>We saw some time ago <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/11/26/10371440.aspx"> how the window manager decides where to place a newly-created window</a> if you pass the <code>CW_<wbr>USE&shy;DEFAULT</wbr></code> values when creating the window. But what if you want to filter the values first? If you pass an explicit upper left corner but pass <code>CW_<wbr>USE&shy;DEFAULT</wbr></code> for the width and height, then the bottom right corner will be down near the bottom right corner of the screen.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Given that your <code>CW_<wbr>USE&shy;DEFAULT</wbr></code> code is buggy, is there a way I can ask how big you would have made the window, so I can go in and fix your mistake? If I try to resize it after the fact, there's an ugly flicker. I'm kind of disgusted that something this simple still doesn't work after all these years. This is why Apple is eating your lunch. This code was obviously never tested because it doesn't even work. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> There appears to be some elevation of opinion to fact here, because the customer thinks that when you say "I will let you decide where to put the bottom right corner of the window", and when the window manager decides to put the bottom right corner the window near the bottom right corner of the screen, then that is <i>obviously a bug</i>. </p>
<p> Yeesh, if you don't want to let the window manager choose the bottom right corner of the window, then don't pass the value that says "I will let you choose the bottom right corner of the window." </p>
<p> Anyway, back to the original question. </p>
<p> If you want to get a peek at the coordinates the window manager chose when you said, "You go ahead and choose," you can just create the window without the <code>WS_<wbr>VISIBLE</wbr></code> flag. And then look at the rectangle, and if you don't like it, resize your window while it is still hidden. When you're finally happy: Show it. </p>

		<p>If this person goes to a restaurant and tells the waiter, &quot;Surprise me!&quot;, does he then complain when he gets a cheeseburger instead of a steak? By using CW_USEDEFAULT, you&#39;ve explicitly said &quot;Surprise me!&quot; to the window manager so should expect anything (hopefully something sensible, but that&#39;s not in the contract.)</p>

		<p>If he wants to check the returned values for CW_USEDEFAULT he seems to have some criteria to decide if they are correct or not. Why doesn&#39;t he use this criteria to calculate the wanted size on its own instead of relying on the window manager?</p>

		<p>If you pass an explicit size but CW_USEDEFAULT as the upper left corner, Windows will in many cases put the window in a position where the lower and/or right part is only partly visible because it is off the work area. Unlike the issue raised by the moron who wrote the &quot;bug report&quot; above, shouldn&#39;t this be considered as a bug?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Arguably. Handling of <code>CW_USE&shy;DEFAULT</code> is not a sophisticated feedback system. It&#39;s &quot;if (x == CW_USEDEFAULT) x = CalculateDefaultLeft(); if (cx == CW_USEDEFAULT) cx = CalculateDefaultWidth(x);&quot; It chooses the top left, then it chooses the size. It doesn&#39;t try to adjust the top left based on the future size. Arguably a bug, but it&#39;s not going to change at this point for compatibility reasons. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Windows also liked to place windows with CW_USEDEFAULT partially under the taskbar when the taskbar was on the left. But they seem to have actually fixed this in Windows 8.1.</p>

		<p>ErikF: Maybe your analogy can be worked out fully: the person went to a restaurant and told the waiter &quot;Surprise me with a _tiny_ _cake_!&quot;. Then he complains that the cake is tiny. (so the window manager puts the bottom right to the bottom right (ideally)).</p>

		<p>&gt; This is why Apple is eating your lunch. This code was obviously never tested because it doesn&#39;t even work.</p>
<p>Given that Microsoft make a point of extensive testing for features, this is kinda annoying. Sure, MS software isn&#39;t some bastion of bug-free code, but I appreciate the fact that normally when they say something works, it works.</p>

		<p>@Azarien: If they restore the WINDOWPLACEMENT using SetWindowPlacement(), then the system adjusts it automatically.</p>
<p>&quot;If the information specified in WINDOWPLACEMENT would result in a window that is completely off the screen, the system will automatically adjust the coordinates so that the window is visible, taking into account changes in screen resolution and multiple monitor configuration.&quot;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
