The VSTS team wrote a response to my series from a few months ago
titled
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180323-01/?p=98325">
Stop cherry-picking, start merging</a>.

<b>Stop merging if you need to cherry-pick</b>
</p>
<p>
As the stewards of Visual Studio Team Services's Git server, we read Raymond's
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20180323-01/?p=98325">
stop cherry-picking, start merging</a>
series with great interest.
When Raymond pays attention to your area,
you should probably pay attention to what
he has to say.
After finishing the series, we both agree and disagree with his conclusions.
</p>
<p>
Given the constraints Raymond's team works under,
we think he's found a pretty good solution to some very real
problems.
Windows, for historical reasons,
has a lot of long-lived branches that need to merge into each other
pretty often.
If you need to fast-track a fix from one branch into another
ahead of the official integration schedule,
you're definitely setting yourself up for the kinds of conflicts
Raymond writes about.
</p>
<p>
<b>But</b>...
if you aren't Windows, you probably don't have this problem.
Over in VSTS, we use and recommend a
<a HREF="https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com">
trunk-based development model</a>
with few long-lived branches.
While our
<a HREF="https://www.visualstudio.com/learn/use-git-microsoft/">
"Release Flow" model</a>
does include servicing
branches for some releases,
those branches will never merge back together.
Thus, we don't encounter the merge
conflicts and silent work reversions that Raymond's team does.
</p>
<p>
In a way, the solution is almost as painful as the problem.
You have to know ahead of time what branches you're going
to cherry-pick your commits into.
If you don't, you can make quite a mess of your Git graph.
And if anyone on your team
doesn't fully understand the history contortions this workflow involves,
they can mess it all up for you.
For those reasons,
and because we expect it's rare outside of Windows's workflow,
we don't plan to put any features into VSTS to automate this.
</p>
<p>
One other note:
think twice (or maybe three times)
before you
<code>git merge -s ours</code> under any circumstance.
While it's the right thing here,
you're <i>intentionally throwing away someone else's work</i>.
We've fielded innumerable customer tickets of the form,
"Git lost my work".
In the vast majority of cases,
the culprit was someone resolving merge conflicts by throwing away work.
Git didn't lose your work &mdash; you asked it to forget your work!
</p>
<p>
Thanks to Raymond for writing this series,
and for allowing us to pile on.
The Windows team has been a great partner
in helping us make our server
(and indeed all of Git)
scale to insane sizes and workflows.
We're always considering new approaches to Git
which might be applicable to the wider community.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I extend my thanks to the VSTS team for providing their
perspective.
</p>
<p>
As the VSTS team notes, the problem case is where you
cherry-pick between two branches that will eventually merge.
If the two branches never merge, then there's no need
to get all fancy with your cherry-picking.</p>

		<p>It depends. Lots of OneNote clones are being announced, promising users not having to put up with the new UWP thing. Clearly, Microsoft has bled and sharks want a piece of its market share.</p>

		<p>First, they did build their own behemoth. That behemoth is now 28 years old.</p>
<p>Second, Git and GitHub are two different things. One is a back-end, the other is a website.</p>

		<p>&gt;&#8221;Git lost my work&#8221;</p>
<p>The beauty of Git is that everything stays there forever, nothing is lost for good. Even orphaned commits are kept there for 90 days by default, before the garbage collection discards them, and you can find the history of amends and rebases in the reflog. Work lost in a merge? Do the merge again with the correct parameters, then use the merged tree for the new commit (git read-tree). MAKE SURE TO ONLY MERGE ON A CLEAN TREE. &#8211;abort will not restore back to the original dirty tree.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
