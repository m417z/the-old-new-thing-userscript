<p>Some time ago, I joked about the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/11/14/1075573.aspx"> people who rearrange computers in their house during the winter in order to use them as space heaters</a>.</p>
<p> Turns out this happens a lot at Microsoft. One of my friends said that one of his coworkers used a small heater in her office to keep warm. On the other hand, his office always ran warm because of all the computers in it. They hit upon a simple solution to both problems: "Now she's using a 12 core/24 thread space heater that's a lot quieter than her old one." </p>
<p> At one point in time, I had a large number of computers in my office, including an Itanium prototype. (You knew it was a prototype because it contained <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/21/472296.aspx"> Engineering Styrofoam</a>.) The thing generated a lot of heat. My friend across the hall, on the other hand, had a cold office. Solution: With some help from colleagues, we moved the Itanium across the hall. Two problems solved. </p>

		<p>I think I know what Itanium you mean; the original HP workstation 2x Itanium 1 (ES) @ 733/800MHz. It was an absolute beast, weighted a ton, run hot as Hell and loud too!</p>
<p>We got ours off eBay after HP refused to sell us one;) It was sad to &quot;decomission it&quot; &#8211; while others broke during various moves the Itanium never broke somehow. You can still probably buy some now on eBay 10+ years later &#8211; IA64 development anyone?</p>

		<p>I work at a company near Tampa, Florida. &nbsp;It&#39;s regularly in the high 70-80&#39;s during much of the year. &nbsp;The office tower we&#39;re in has dysfunctional temperature regulation however, with many offices on the top floor going into the 60&#39;s in the afternoon. &nbsp;Right now, the outside air temp is 64f, but the A/C has been running continuously, keeping my office at a frigid 68f and dropping. &nbsp;I do have some spare machines here that I should fire up&#8230;</p>

		<p>I cannot believe that I am first to mention the &quot;Microsoft Heating Plant&quot;, a.k.a the DEC-20 mainframe at the Northup Microsoft building around 30 years ago. I always assumed the machine&#39;s exhaust heat really was connected to the building furnace ducts somehow.</p>

<p>I had a similar experience when I was doing an internship at $SOFTWARE_COMPANY. I&#39;m not sure what the cause was, but in the middle of summer (OK, it was in New York, but it was still 80s outside or something) and we were showing up to work in long pants and long sleeves and still freezing.</p>

		<p>@Evan: Better than my NYC office experience. We had steam heat (single setting for the whole building, which was configured to keep the retail store on the bottom floor warm, even when it left its doors open mid-winter), with per-floor AC to counteract the effects of any excess heat. The AC broke repeatedly. I kept shorts at the office in mid-winter, because every time the AC broke, my floor would rise to 80 or 90 degrees, even in January/February.</p>

		<p>@Drak:</p>
<p>90 degrees C is a mighty reasonable sauna temperature (although when enough stupidity is applied, temperatures of 110+ aren&#39;t rare) so you get a free sauna @ work, a privilege that many others pay serious money for :)</p>

		<p>I did some work in the Solomon Islands way back when (1997ish) and the server room was overheating. The &quot;solution&quot; was to install additional aircon units. Me and another guy cleaned the filters in the meantime. Problem solved. Sort of. With the additional aircon, the segue from beautiful tropical weather to super-cold server room was horrific.</p>

		<p>As far as I remember the &quot;Engineering Styrofoam&quot; in the HP Itanium prototype was to guide the air internally to specific paths; so the computer was not empty inside.</p>
<p>You had to put them back in the right order like a puzzle. I think the computer would complain if you left them out. It was quite an impressive design IMHO.</p>

Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered

At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
