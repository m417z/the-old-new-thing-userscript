No, this is not my attempt to get
<a HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/$h*!_My_Dad_Says">
picked up as a television show</a>.
It's just that my father-in-law sometimes says funny stuff.
</p>
<p>
When my mother came to visit,
she brought some bread that she had made in a
bread-making machine.
The conversation went something like this:
</p>
<p>
Father-in-law:
"Wow, this bread is really good.
Maybe we should get a bread-making machine."
</p>
<p>
Mom:
"It's really easy to do.
You just measure the ingredients,
put them in the machine,
and push the button.
Three hours later, you have fresh bread!"
</p>
<p>
Father-in-law:
"Three hours?
After three hours I might not still be hungry!"</p>

		<p>After reading the title I thought it would be a pun inside. Like, you know, &#8220;baking bread&#8221; &#8211; &#8220;breaking bad&#8221;. I was wrong :-)</p>

		<p>I remember someone told me that CS working on pager company are supposed to queue for toilet/restroom before they have need to. In that way when the queue goes to their turn, it&#8217;d be about the time they have the need. Enqueueing &#8220;just when you have need&#8221; would be too late for you.</p>

		<p>Ok, so the answer I suspected and then confirmed is that bread machines have a delay timer for the purpose.</p>

		<p>Well, yes, but I was just completing Raymond&#8217;s article here. If this were a case of solving the underlying problem instead of answering the question, I suspect it would&#8217;ve ended like this: &#8220;If you want to obtain fresh bread at particular times of the day, you can use a <a href="http://breadmakerguides.com/bread-machine-features/bread-machines-with-a-delay-timer" rel="nofollow">delay timer</a>.&#8221;</p>

		<p>Yes, but for on-demand bread the machine would require a delay timer that allows negative amounts and incorporates time travel. Raymond has assured us that Microsoft Research is working hard on that feature, but we need to wait because it&#8217;s coming out Real Soon Now.</p>

		<p>Or you can just buy a bread machine with &#8220;keep warm&#8221; function, setup to bake the bread before you sleep, and let the machine keep it warm for you after the bread is baked until you wake.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
