<p> Here are some airline-related web logs that I follow. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://joepodcaster.libsyn.com/">Fly with Me</a>,     a sort-of monthly     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/07/18/439940.aspx">     podcast</a> from a professional airline pilot.     A glimpse into the world behind that cockpit door. </li>
<li><a href="http://betty.libsyn.com/">Flight Attendant Betty</a>,     another podcast, this one from your friendly flight attendant.     (Though I have to admit, in Episode&nbsp;2, I skipped over     the disaster story and listened just to the stories of the     world's stupidest hijackers.) </li>
<li><a href="http://yuhustewardess.blogspot.com/">Yu Hu Stewardess</a>,     a flight attendant who isn't afraid to talk about all the     stupid passengers she has to put up with     (Do you recognize yourself?)     and talk about what life is like when you spend a significant     fraction of your nights away from home. </li>
<li><a href="http://doingboeing.blogspot.com/">Doing Boeing</a>,     the web log of a Boeing database administrator.     From     <a href="http://www.centennialofflight.gov/essay/Aerospace/Boeing_military/Aero22G13.htm">     the original technology company in the Seattle area</a>. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.boeing.com/commercial/777family/200LR/flight_test/">The 777 Flight Test Journal</a>.     I had been looking for something to replace     <a href="http://www.boeing.com/randy/">Randy Baseler</a>'s blog     in my Boeing blogroll because Randy's was just all marketing     hot air.     The Flight Test Journal still feels a bit too heavily-managed,     but it's a big improvement. </li>

		<p>Wow&#8230; this is amazing!  I had no idea that people actually read my blog&#8230; I guess I better start writing stuff for it again.</p>
<p>I hope we don&#8217;t run into that little problem that Boeing is notorious for anymore, layoffs. &quot;They&quot; claim they&#8217;re taking steps to prevent it, but I&#8217;m not sure.  We&#8217;re on the uphill of a cycle (maybe we&#8217;re on top of the cycle right now), but in 5 years, that could be completely different story.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
