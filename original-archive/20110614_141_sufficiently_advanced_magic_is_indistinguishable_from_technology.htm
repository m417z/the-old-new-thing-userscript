<p>An informal tradition in a former group was that whenever somebody bought a new car, we all went out to lunch to celebrate, but the person with the new car had to be one of the drivers.</p>
<p> During one of our new-car trips, the proud owner of the new car showed off its fancy features. "Check this out, this car has a voice-controlled radio: Radio, On." </p>
<p> The car radio turned on. </p>
<p> "Radio, Select KUOW." </p>
<p> The radio changed its station. </p>
<p> "Radio, louder." </p>
<p> The volume went up. </p>
<p> But this wasn't a demonstration of voice-recognition technology. It was a magic trick. </p>
<p> You see, the car has radio controls built into the back of the steering wheel. </p>

		<p>One of my friends has an SUV that has steering wheel radio controls. It also (unbeknownst to him) has radio controls on the back of the center console for the passengers in the back seat. His radio would sometimes mysteriously &quot;malfunction&quot; during road trips.</p>

		<p>My grandfather played that trick on a visitor from South Africa, using his garage-door opener. (Wireless remotes were somewhat uncommon, I guess) He was found out when she said the Afrikaans word for &#39;clothes&#39;, and the door opened&#8230;</p>

		<p>Here&#39;s one we prepared ealier. &nbsp;The aXcess concept car had this feature for real. &nbsp;Hearing it fire up with a throaty roar to the command of &quot;engine on!&quot; was awesome.</p>

		<p>I pulled a similar trick on my boss with racing game pedals hidden below my desk. I faked gesture recognition in our game. That was way before there were webcams or even USB ports.</p>

		<p>Actually, a few modern &quot;magics&quot; performed by magicians are with the aid of modern technologies.</p>

		<p>So, we had an open day at my school once when I was a teenager, and some of us who were involved in the computer club set up an exhibit where we had a BBC micro running an AI eliza-style chatbot.</p>
<p>It talked really good conversational English, told jokes, was aware of current events, and just thoroughly wowed all the parents who saw it in operation. &nbsp;Totally passed the Turing test.</p>
<p>And all day long, not one of them wondered what the cable was that was coming out the back of the computer, disappearing out the window of the physics lab, running twenty feet along the outside wall and disappearing back in through the window of the seemingly-locked classroom three doors up the corridor&#8230;</p>

		<p>I guess the full saying goes something like this (copied from Rick Cook&#39;s Wizardry Compiled):</p>
<p>Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. &nbsp;</p>
<p>—Clarke&#39;s law</p>
<p>Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable</p>
<p>from technology. &nbsp;</p>
<p>—Murphy&#39;s reformulation of Clarke&#39;s law</p>
<p>Any sufficiently advanced magic is indistinguishable</p>
<p>from a rigged demonstration. &nbsp;</p>
<p>—programmers&#39; restatement of Murphy&#39;s</p>
<p>reformulation of Clarke</p>

		<p>These days it&#39;s even easier still with WWAN and WLAN technology. Look ma, it can&#39;t be rigged. No cables!</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve always liked Gehm&#39;s Corollary to Clarke&#39;s Third Law: &quot;Any technology distinguishable from magic is insufficiently advanced.&quot;</p>

		<p>I have Microsoft&#39;s implementation of voice control in my car, and it is actually pretty darn close to magic. &nbsp;You just have to know the right magic words and it will nearly always get it right. &nbsp;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
