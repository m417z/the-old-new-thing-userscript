<p>One evening, I had a series of three dreams. In each one, I visited an unusual home.</p>
<p> In the third dream, I visited the home of a friend of mine. He lived in a white stucco split-level, a stereotypical suburban home. What made the house interesting was that if you did things just right, dark dots would appear on the wall and slowly consume it. </p>
<p> My friend explained, "This house is running a very old build of DirectX, and sometimes it just does that." </p>
<p> We set up a repro and calculated that when the dots appeared, stack usage was exactly 5124 bytes. This was a 16-bit house, and the stack overflow into the heap caused a return address to be changed to point into the DirectDraw flood fill function. </p>
<p> When I told my friend about this strange dream, he quipped, "I've since then upgraded to a 64-bit house." </p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>I am trying to help someone unsubscribve from this blog &#8211; see [How to] Unsubscribe from a MSDN Blog? on <a href="http://social.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/11f17d2e-2734-447c-ae48-6371a2aaa32e/how-to-unsubscribe-from-a-msdn-blog?forum=Profile" rel="nofollow" target="_new">social.microsoft.com/&#8230;/how-to-unsubscribe-from-a-msdn-blog</a></p>
<p>Sadly, I too subscribed by filling in the &quot;Subscribe w/ Email Address&quot; textbox when I was NOT logged into MSDN with any account &#8211; note that this textbox is not visible when logged in. I DID subscribe with an email address which is associated with a Windows LIVE id.</p>
<p>So, Now, when I login to the MSDN site with that Live ID, I see a &quot;email subscribe&quot; link &#8211; I can click that, and it changes to &quot;email unsubscribe&quot; &#8211; but even after clicking &quot;email unsubscribe&quot;, emails still are sent by MSDN.</p>
<p>This is affecting multiple people.</p>
<p>Is there anything you can do to fix this?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Anybody who is having trouble unsubscribing can send me email and I will forward it to the site administrators. Is this a longstanding problem or something that showed up recently? (If it is recent, then I can ask the admins if they applied any patches that may have introduced the problem.) -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@OldLarlm &#8211;</p>
<p>I reckon your best bet is to go to the blogs home page &#8211; <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/">http://blogs.msdn.com/</a> &#8211; and use the &#39;Provide Site Feedback&#39; link. There was a blog post some time ago (not Raymond&#39;s blog) telling people to use that to get email passwords reset. Might work&#8230;.</p>

		<p>I&#39;d email you if I could find an email address :)</p>
<p>This seems to have been an on-going issue. Bing shows many people are simply blocking emails from @blogs.msdn.com as spam&#8230;.</p>

		<p>Hmm straight from 16 to 64. I wonder how confused 64 bit code that walks the process tree would get if it encountered a 16 bit process. For some reason, Wine allows both to exist simultaneously.</p>

		<p>There is no such thing as a &quot;DirectDraw flood fill function&quot; unless you write one yourself. Or you can use [Ext]FloodFill but that&#39;s not DD specific.</p>

		<p>I just like the idea that if you&#39;re having trouble with your house, you can set up a repro house to investigate it.</p>
<p>I wonder if I can attach a debugger to my house to warn me when the termites come back?</p>

		<p>Well, 18,446,744,073,709,551,615 cubic feet* ought to be enough for anybody! :)</p>
<p>(Unless of course his house is actually only 48-bit, in which case he&#39;ll have to live with 281,474,976,710,655 ftÂ³)</p>

		<p>The house might only be 48-bit, but there&#39;s a 64-bit virtual address space still. The house pages in and out out cubit feet to neighboring houses.</p>

<p>No, no, no! Shakespeare explained this years ago: All the world&#39;s a stag[ing server]!</p>
<p>Overflow causing an unrequested flood-fill can be reproduced on physical houses as well as virtual ones, too: trigger an upstairs sink/bath overflow, and on the floor below, &quot;dark dots would appear on the wall and slowly consume it&quot;. (As happened here earlier this year, due to installing a bad plumber.)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
