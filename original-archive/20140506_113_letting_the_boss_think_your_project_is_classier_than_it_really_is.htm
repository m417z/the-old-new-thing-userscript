<p>Once upon a time, there was a team developing two versions of a product, the first a short-term project to ship soon, and the other a more ambitious project to ship later. (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/22/61647.aspx">Sound familiar</a>?) They chose to assign the projects code names Ren and Stimpy, in honor of the lead characters from the <a href="http://nicktoons.nick.com/shows/the-ren-and-stimpy-show"> eponymous cartoon series</a>.</p>
<p> Over time, the two projects merged, and the code name that stuck was Ren. </p>
<p> When the project came up in a meeting with Bill Gates, it was mentioned verbally but never spelled out, and since Bill wasn't closely tuned into popular culture, he mapped the sound  <nobr>/r&#603;n/</nobr> not to the hairless Mexican dog but to the Christopher Wren, architect of St. Paul's Cathedral. In follow-up email, he consistently referred to the project by the name "Wren". </p>
<p> The Ren team liked the fact that their name gave the boss the impression that the project was going to be a masterpiece of architectural beauty, so they never told him he got the name wrong. </p>
<p> <b>Even though it has nothing to do with the story</b>: The project in question is the one that <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/technicalrecognition/dinarte-morais.aspx"> eventually became known to the world as Outlook</a>. </p>

		<p>If you believe Wikipedia &quot;Ren and Stimpy&quot; were Exchange Client and Schedule+. I would have thought it was Exchange Client and Microsoft Mail though. I remember in 1998 training for my MCSE and having to learn the Exchange Client because it came with Exchange Server 5.5. </p>

		<p>@Jack B Nimble: Exchange Client and Schedule+ makes much more sense. &nbsp;Schedule+ was going to be an enterprise-ready calendar and task management solution, while Exchange Client would serve as an e-mail client companion to the Exchange Server. &nbsp;Outlook, the resulting program, ended up combining the featureset of both programs into a single solution. &nbsp;Microsoft Mail was the precursor software to Exchange, so it doesn&#39;t make any sense to develop that in addition to Exchange Client and then merge them; a much more sensible solution would be to add backwards compatibility support in Exchange Client (which they did).</p>

		<p>Exchange Client (-&gt; Outlook) was part of Windows 95 (mainly as Fax solution) and Mail and News, too. Mail and News was later renamed Outlook Express because of the success of Outlook and to give an impression of an Outlook Light. Actually, it wasn&#39;t. The two programs were developed independently. Outlook was developed by the Office team, and Outlook Express was developed by the IE team.</p>
<p>So, yes, the &quot;other&quot; being Schedule+ fits perfectly.</p>

		<p>This one time, I wrote a proposal to daboss@Microsoft to support esoteric programming languages to assist in porting a project. Never heard back :(. But now come to think of it, I wrote the proposal in Whitespace (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language#Whitespace">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Esoteric_programming_language</a>) and sent it via Outlook. I bet Outlook was configured for html messages or something and corrupted my proposal!

		<p>Hmm, I&#39;ve never heard of Christopher Wren, and, although I *have* heard of &quot;Ren and Stimpy&quot;, I expect that if *I* were working at Microsoft in the 90s and heard of a project codenamed &quot;Ren&quot; in isolation, I would wonder why a mail client was codenamed after a command used to rename files.</p>
<p>Also, I didn&#39;t realize that Outlook was only introduced in 1997. The first version of Office I used was 98, and I kind of assumed Outlook has been there for a while, it was quite mature for a 1-year-old project. That explains why Outlook Express wasn&#39;t called that until 1997.</p>

		<p>Outlook is one of the (few) reasons my company will buy new Office and Exchange versions &#8211; another is the sheer amount of legacy office documents with macros and complex pivot tables. We searched for a suitable replacement a while back, but either the alternatives hav not all functions or cost even more&#8230;</p>

		<p>Raymond, on the topic of Outlook could you do a post discussing on the Office file formats (specifically Msg format) and compatibility considerations (and maybe mention a few mistakes) made over the product lifetime. I am curious as to the decision process that resulted with the different MIME properties being used for the same data by various Outlook versions and how minor decisions for the msg format point early in the development (at a time when file size and memory requirements had considerable performance implications) continue to have to be worked around.</p>
<p>If possible could you also allude to why Microsoft has yet to make the transition to a newer message format (say msgx, akin to docx and xlsx). I understand that such a new format would require providing of a free viewer / translator to msg format (but I seem to recall that this was done for docx) and that no new feature is not without it&#39;s cost but Exchange web services already returns .EML format items &#8211; is the internal inbox format not separated enough to allow it&#39;s replacement?</p>

		<p>@Boris, Stephen Griffin wrote about this in 2008 with <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/stephen_griffin/archive/2008/01/08/no-msg-for-you.aspx">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/no-msg-for-you.aspx</a> but I think Raymond would have some interesting insight and opinions on supporting and expanding legacy (and until recently proprietary) file formats and would be able to provide some interesting anecdotal examples of why things are they way they are. Rather than a dry response such as &quot;MFCMAPI provides the code needed to save MAPI properties to XML format but we (Microsoft) have no plans to officially support it&quot;.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
