<p>In Korea, it is generally believed that leaving a fan on in an enclosed room can be fatal. Ken Jennings <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1451656254/&amp;tag=tholneth-20"> looks at cultural superstitions</a> and wrote a Slate article focusing on <a href="http://www.slate.com/articles/life/foreigners/2013/01/fan_death_korean_moms_think_that_your_electric_fan_will_kill_you.html"> the scourge of Korean fan death</a>.</p>
<p> My mother told me that handling cellophane tape makes you sterile. Though that may have just been her way of getting me to stop playing with cellophane tape. </p>
<p> What strange cultural superstitions exist in your part of the world? (Of course, this is a bit of an unfair question, because if you genuinely believe it, then you won't recognize it  as a strange cultural superstition!) </p>
<p> <b>Clarification</b>: Please reply in the spirit of the article. Keep it fun. </p>

		<p>My mother always said if you spill salt you would have to pick it up with your eyelashes in the afterlife.</p>
<p>Since salt was expensive, this kind of makes a twisted sense.</p>

		<p>In Russia, many people believe that mixing &quot;raw&quot; (tap/spring/well) water and boiled water will give you diarrhea.</p>
<p>Now, I agree that this may be the case if the unboiled water has germs in it. But the superstition is that raw+boiled mixture is more dangerous than raw water on its own.</p>
<p>Draughts are as dangerous as in Germany and Austria. Children should wear much warmer clothes than adults &#8211; and never, ever go for a walk without a hat! or else flu/pneumonia are imminent. Except in summer, maybe.</p>
<p><!-- p>Some older people believe that microwaves are dangerous (radiation!).


<p>A car should have icons on the dashboard. Seatbelts, on the other hand, are optional. What's the worst that could happen?</p>

		<p>But being cold and wet can suppress the immune system. True you can&#39;t catch a cold from being cold, but it makes it more likely you catch one on exposure.</p>

		<p>In Italy people believe that if you take a bath (in your house or at the beach, whatever) you will die of &quot;stomach congestion&quot;. So it&#39;s imperative for Italian parents to keep their kids from bathing for a period that goes from an hour to four after a meal; some parents even consider a small snack to be harmful. Showers are not considered dangerous. The surprising part is that even doctors, with degrees in medicine, believe in this. It&#39;s not really superstition but extremely close to it.</p>

		<p>My mother you should not sleep with unbundled rope, cords, cables, etc near your pillow when you sleep, or snakes will emerge while you sleep, wrap around your neck, and strangle you.</p>
<p>I guess they said things like this because there is actually a slight chance that you will move around during your sleep and really strangle yourself with the loose rope.</p>

		<p>In most east Asian countries, they have this widely spread believes that women should be very careful in the first month after they gave birth of new born babies. They cannot drink cold water, take cold bath, stand on a windy place and eat soup without salt, etc.. In different region, believes are vary but there are a lots of them..</p>

<p>An opportunistic flare-up of a latent infection because of cold (temperature) exposure totally happens. Such as catching pneumonia or tooth abscess. A personally got a tooth abscess after sitting a whole day in classes with no heating during the winter (no, soviet ROTC would not cancel them).</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t know where it comes from but I heard that you cannot leave a newborn baby and a cat together in a room with no adults present, or the child will die. I have also heard that this is because cats breath more slowly that humans, and with only the cat present for reference, the baby will slow its breathing rhythm to match the cat&#39;s, not noticing that that is too slow. (Humans have a tendency to synchronize breathing.) Not sure if that&#39;s superstition or not.</p>

		<p>In the south of Brazil (I&#39;m not sure if this applies to the rest of the country) people say that if you drink milk while you eat mango you&#39;ll die. They usually say it in a tongue-in-cheek way, but on the other hand I never saw anybody daring to test the theory. :-)</p>
<p>We also have the Italian superstition mentioned above about the &quot;stomach congestion&quot;, but that also includes showers.</p>
<p>People think that if your ears get warm and/or red, it&#39;s because somebody somewhere is talking about you.</p>

		<p>It took a while, because of course I&#39;m the worst one to judge my own beliefs.</p>
<p>but I finally thought of one: You shouldn&#39;t eat the core of an apple because the seeds are full of cynanide and will kill you. &nbsp; I used to believe this and my wife still insists its true. &nbsp;I became suspicious when a friend made a habit of eating the entire apple, including the seeds. &nbsp;He somehow avoided death. &nbsp;He said his family always did that. &nbsp;His parents were French immigrants, I don&#39;t know if eating the core is French, or just something his family did. &nbsp;Snopes gives a good summary of the situation, there are cyanide compounds, but your body can easily handle that small dosage. &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.snopes.com/food/warnings/apples.asp" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/&#8230;/apples.asp</a></p>
<p>The article you linked revealed a second to me. &nbsp;I had believed that poinsettias were incredibly toxic to humans, but now I know I&#39;d need to eat a monstrous poinsettia salad to be endangered in the slightest. &nbsp;So I corrected an erroneous idea I had, so today counts as productive!</p>

		<p>My pregnant sister shocked her parents-in-law by revealing the name they had chosen for the coming baby boy. Where her husband grew up, it was commonly &quot;known&quot; that if the name is set before birth, the baby will be stillborn. I have later learned that this was a quite common belief in rural areas in Norway at least into the 1980s.</p>

		<p>A friend of mine made it his hobby to maintain a list of the kinds of food you most definitely should stay away from if you have been suffering from kindney stone, or it will come back. It started out when he gathered lists of &quot;forbidden&quot; food from three different doctors; the lists didn&#39;t have one single entry in common. Asking other people who had been suffering from kindney stone what they had been told not to eat gave him new entries to his list, and more entries, and more&#8230;</p>
<p>If you have problems fighting obesity, make sure to have an attack of kidney stone. After that, there is nothing whatsoever that you can eat without risking a new attack. Pure water is probably safe, but not much else.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m guessing the reality is that the cat would sit on and suffocate the baby, or else the baby could otherwise perish from SIDS and pre-science folks came up with some vaguely plausible theory about breathing patterns. Still probably not a good idea to leave a baby unattended with a cat.</p>

		<p>@jb: The trouble is that there are a lot of <em>different</em> substances that can build kidney stones over time if your urine are oversaturated with them. And the various kinds are indistinguishable on X-rays or other in vivo diagnostic methods. If you have a stone but then pass it without preserving it for analysis, there&#39;s no telling what you&#39;ll have to cut down on. The best general prophylactic advice appears to be to drink plenty of water, to keep concentrations of <em>anything</em> from running too high.</p>

<p>Lot&#39;s of things don&#39;t work correctly in babies. This is not turned on until some time after birth (that it cannot be on before birth is obvious). The breathing startup sequence is weird.</p>

		<p>A sort of meta-superstition &#8211; I&#39;ve heard (and I&#39;m not sure whether or not it&#39;s true) that in some parts of India, I believe (I might be misremembering this), many computer-illiterate people believe that right-clicking on the Windows desktop and clicking refresh will &quot;refresh the RAM&quot; and make the computer run faster.</p>
<p>Actually, I just googled it, and I believe this is where I originally heard it: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1163398" rel="nofollow">ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php</a></p>

		<p>Muzer0,</p>
<p>Some such rumours are perfectly true. For a long time I was working on a timehaaring-system that gave priority to interactive terminals over, say, a compilation job. (In those days, compilation of even a moderately sized program could take minutes.) A process with no interactivity would rapidly loose its high &quot;interactive&quot; prioriy, even if keeping the CPU continuously busy with a compilation. Any user interaction would immediately raise the priority to &quot;interactive&quot; level again.</p>
<p>In a few releases of the OS, it didn&#39;t matter whether the &quot;user interaction&quot; was requested by the program at all. Pressing a key on the keyboard was processed as a user interaction, raising the priority of the process who could have read the input if it cared to, but it didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>So if you wante to get ahead in the job queeue, ahead of the other lengthy compilation jobs, the trick was to hit the space button regularly. You wouldn&#39;t have to do it more than, say, once per second to have your compilation go ahead of all of the others in the queue.</p>
<p>In my student days, this &quot;myth&quot; went from an unconfirmed rumour, to systematic testing (by yours truly, among others) to prove that it was indeed a fact, and finally having it confirmed by the designers of the OS.</p>
<p>This isn&#39;t exactly &quot;refreshing the RAM&quot;, but it is clicking buttons to make the computer run faster (for that user, and slower for the others!)</p>

		<p>Huh, the Italian superstition mentioned above about not bathing after eating is very similar to a superstition which is common in America (or at least in suburban New Jersey, where I grew up). <a href="http://www.snopes.com/oldwives/hourwait.asp" target="_new" rel="nofollow">http://www.snopes.com/&#8230;/hourwait.asp</a> It&#39;s nearly the same thing, just more extreme (I&#39;m pretty sure I&#39;ve met people who took it in the &quot;don&#39;t go in the water&quot; sense rather than in the &quot;don&#39;t swim&quot; sense). But somehow, unlike with the Italian version, I&#39;ve never seen anyone apply it outside of swimming areas (e.g. I haven&#39;t seen it applied to bathtubs).</p>

		<p>Some of the superstitions I grew up with included:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Going outside in the night with a lit candle would attract bad spirits and death</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Opening an umbrella indoors was considered bad luck</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you stayed up after midnight, witches would come and take you away (I believe this was made up on the spot to make us go to bed)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Walking backwards could bring disgrace upon you</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>My personal favourite: If you turn around counter-clockwise (to your left) you might see the devil (that guy made an awful number of cameos in local myths)</p>
</li>
</ul>

		<p>Growing up in Australia, we were told by parents, teachers, and adults in general, never to swim for an hour after eating lunch. They never said what exactly would happen if you did; but the tone and expression always implied it would be instant death. Even half a Vegemite sandwich could kill you in the surf. Maybe the same advice exists in other countries too; but I&#39;m sure Australia took it to an extreme degree.</p>

		<p>Russian people hold two beliefs about diet:</p>
<ol>
<li>You should eat hot food, including soup, at least once a day. Eating just cold food will cause ulcer, or at least constipation.</li>
<li>
<p>Drinking at the same time as eating is harmful: gastric acid gets diluted, leading to indigestion. It&#39;s better to drink tea only after meal.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Somehow, hot soup (traditionally eaten before other courses) manages to avoid diluting precious bodily fluids.</p>

		<p>Oh, and drinking vodka may prevent flu (either by killing germs, or by pure magic). Not sure whether this is an honest belief, or just an excuse to have a drink.</p>
<p>There are also several medical procedures that are common in Russia, but largely unknown (or disproved) in most Western countries. For example, using interferon intranasally to prevent flu (contrary to the vodka example above, this is recommended by doctors). Antibiotics should be accompanied or followed by probiotics. There are also some popular OTC drugs, not known anywhere else in the world (Arbidol being the most well-known example).</p>

		<p>In Russia, you don&#39;t shake hands over a doorstep or your relations with them will worsen. Broken glass means there&#39;ll be a quarrel. You spit three times over your right (or left) shoulder if a black cat has crossed your path to prevent bad luck.</p>
<p>Monitors (even LCD ones) emit bad radiation which can be offset by putting cacti around. Cellphones emit bad radiation too and eventually give you cancer. Masturbation is bad for your eyes, and also hair will grow on your hands.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Ever had disbacteriosis after taking antibiotics? Or Clostridium Diff. after taking antibiotics? Or, worse, fungal infection in the guts? That&#39;s what &quot;probiotics&quot; (normal gut bacterii) are preventing. THis is not &quot;russian myth&quot;, this is accepted knowledge.</p>
<p>Re: arbidol, get away with the thought that everything in &quot;Western&quot; (American) medicine is the cutting edge, and everywhere else is bass ackward. America may have better equipment. Not better practices. The doctors are still the same arrogant know-it-alls. It&#39;s as difficult to find a doctor who really knows and cares, as in Russia. Maybe not as likely to find a hack, though.</p>

		<p>My father in law swore that WD-40 relieved arthritis pain because it lubricated the joints. Explaining to him that the substance couldn&#39;t permeate the skin, and you wouldn&#39;t want it to anyway (petroleum distillates under the skin would be bad) proved pointless.</p>
<p>When I was in my teens, one of my friends was convinced that he could touch his eyeball by sticking his finger up his nose. Apparently, his dad told him, &quot;you keep picking your nose and you&#39;re gonna snag an eyeball.&quot;</p>

		<p>Wait, drinking while eating is *not* harmful? Although, I&#39;ve been told drinking after eating is just as harmful and you should only ever drink *before* eating or wait 2 hours after.</p>
<p>My grandfather firmly believes the no soup causes ulcers one, though everyone else in the family thinks he&#39;s nuts.</p>
<p>Might as well add another one (also Russian). If someone says something and someone else in the room coughs, that means it&#39;s true.</p>

		<p>My grandmother and grandfather swear that eating oranges and drinking milk in near succession will make you ill, because the acid in the oranges will curdle the milk in your stomach.</p>
<p>When my inquiring 6-year-old mind &#8211; a mind that rather liked both milk and oranges &#8211; asked why stomach acid didn&#39;t do the same thing as the acid in the oranges, there was a definite moment of confusion. :P</p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>I&#39;d heard that one about putting chopsticks in rice too. But since I&#39;ve moved to Hong Kong, I&#39;ve asked several friends and business associates in China (North and South) and Korea, and all seem somewhat puzzled about why I would think that upright chopsticks look like funerary incense. I suspect this might be based on a few very old anecdotes. On the other hand, it is true that I&#39;ve never seen anyone stick their chopsticks in a bowl of rice&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
