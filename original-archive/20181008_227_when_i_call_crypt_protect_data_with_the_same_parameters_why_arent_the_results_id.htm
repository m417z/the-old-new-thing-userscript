<p>
If you call
<code>Crypt&shy;Protect&shy;Data</code> twice in a row
with the same parameters,
you get different results.
Why are the results inconsistent?
</p>
<p>
The plaintext is the same.
The entropy is the same.
The key is the same.
Shouldn't the result be the same?
</p>
<p>
If those were the only inputs to
the encryption algorithm,
then the results should be the same.
But they aren't the only inputs to the encryption algorithm.
The
<code>Crypt&shy;Protect&shy;Data</code> function
adds in some bonus random data.
This extra data is recorded in the encrypted blob so that it can
also be used during decryption.
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20161214-00/?p=94935">
The purpose of the extra data</a>
is to prevent exactly what you're trying to do.
Without the extra data, an attacker could recognize that two
encrypted blobs were identical and conclude that they
had the same plaintext.
</p>
<p>
For example, suppose an attacker sees that
two passwords have the same encrypted blob.
The attacker can try to extract the plaintext from
one of the blobs by some other means.
Maybe one of the blobs corresponds to a site
which
<a HREF="https://haveibeenpwned.com/">
suffered a security breach that leaked a bunch of passwords</a>.
Or maybe the site transmits passwords unencrypted.
Or perhaps the site is one the attacker is good
at phishing for.
However the attacker gets the plaintext for one site,
it now knows the plaintext for the other site.
</p>
<p>
Adding extra random data means that multiple encryptions of the
same plaintext with the same key and entropy will nevertheless
produce different results.
This foils attacks based on comparing encrypted results.</p>

		<p>Nitpick: Entropy is changed precisely because of that random data.</p>

		<p>Nitpick of a nitpick.  If you call the function 3 times, there&#8217;s added entropy from the IV/Salt on the first call, but the same amount of added entropy on the second and third calls as well.  So Raymond&#8217;s statement &#8220;The plaintext is the same. The entropy is the same. The key is the same. Shouldn&#8217;t the result be the same?&#8221; is correct.  What&#8217;s different are the bits that make up the added entropy.</p>

		<p>You took the word ‚Äúentropy‚Äù out of the context. In Raymond‚Äôs article it is an optional blob passed into the API.</p>
<p>Mathematically, entropy is a number that reflects the degree of uncertainty of a distribution. I believe Windows draws a random IV (or whatever it is) from the same distribution each time you call <code>CryptoProtectData</code>, therefore, the entropy is constant across invocations.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
