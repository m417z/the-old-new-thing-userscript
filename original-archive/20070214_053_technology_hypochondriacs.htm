<p>One phenomenon I've noticed quite a bit is something I'm going to call "technology hypochondria", the belief that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/03/16/552821.aspx#552860"> you are suffering</a> from whatever problem <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/02/10/529525.aspx#529882"> you just read about</a>. It reminds me of this joke:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  A man goes to his doctor. "Doctor," he says, "I'm pretty sure I've got this disease here. All the symptoms match. I'm suffering from fatigue, sleeplessness, irritability, and memory loss." </p>
<p> "Mr.&nbsp;Jenkins," the doctor responds, "I'm fairly certain you aren't suffering from menopause." </p>
</blockquote>
<p> One of my relatives who is a medical doctor in a public hospital explained to me that in his experience, you should never trust the diagnosis of a med student. "When we bring them along on rounds and show them a patient and ask them what they think the problem might be, they always answer with the disease they just studied last week." </p>
<p> When I describe one way a program can become unresponsive, that doesn't necessarily mean that that's why <strong>your</strong> program is unresponsive. A program can become unresponsive for any of a million reasons, most of which have the same basic symptoms: "When I click on the program, nothing happens." That's really not enough information from which to make a diagnosis. To make a diagnosis, you need to whack a debugger under the program and see why the UI thread isn't processing messages. (<a href="http://blogs.technet.com/markrussinovich/archive/2006/08/31/453100.aspx">Mark Russinovich did exactly that</a> to investigate a process startup delay he was experiencing, and the cause in his case was something I hadn't seen before.) </p>
<p> If you post a comment to one of my articles asking, "Could this be why my program also has a similar problem?", don't expect much of an answer from me. It's like writing a letter to a newspaper's medical advice column saying, "I'm suffering from fatigue and loss of appetite. Do I have AIDS?" </p>

		<p>Interestingly, from Mark&#8217;s blog entry:</p>
<p>&quot;I scoured MSDN documentation and the Web and found essentially no information on the underlying cause for that error code.&quot;</p>
<p>And the next few sentences feature the words &quot;implies&quot;, &quot;didn&#8217;t make sense&quot;, &quot;hunch&quot;, etc.</p>

		<p>The non-techy users I talk with usually think everything bad is caused by a virus, because that&#8217;s the only term they know. I had one person who was getting duplicate emails in her inbox, and it was clearly the POP server&#8217;s fault, so she just had to delete the dupes until the server got straightened out. But she kept asking me &quot;do I have a virus?!!?&quot;</p>

<p>Windows 98 had technology hypochondria. &nbsp;If you shut it down wrong or if Windows started to boot and didn&#8217;t get a chance to finish, it would be convinced something was wrong with it and run scandisk. &nbsp;The cure, naturally, is to use a non-hypochondriac version of windows like 2000. :-)</p>

		<p>A friend of mine always thought bugs in games occurred because something had gone wrong during the copying of files in the installation process. Couldn&#8217;t get him to understand that if a file was copied wrongly more stuff would go wrong (this btw was in the old DOS days where lots of games were just 1 file).</p>
<p>That being said, if my computer hardware acts up, and I find someone having the same problem on the internet and they have a solution, I do tend to think my problem is the same as theirs, which is not always true..</p>

		<p>Drak: actually I once had a problem with Virtual PC where, after installation, it would always crash my PC on booting. I traced this to one of the Virtual PC drivers (the virtual network driver) having the wrong link checksum.</p>
<p>Windows 2000 would blue-screen if the checksum was wrong. Windows XP would load properly but the network wouldn&#8217;t work if the driver was enabled.</p>
<p>Checking the CD we&#8217;d burned from the VPC ISO against a copy extracted from the ISO using IsoBuster showed that there was an error in that file on the burned copy (installing from the extract worked fine). We chucked the CD away and used the extract in future.</p>

		<p>The good thing about some technology hypochondriacs is that you can prescribe technology placebos.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
