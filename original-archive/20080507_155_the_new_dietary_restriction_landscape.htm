		<p>Allergies and intolerance I understand and I will accomodate you. For the others: you&#8217;ll eat what I cook or starve.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s fine if you don&#8217;t want to eat meat, but you won&#8217;t force it on me. Seriously&#8230; This is a disease of modern times.</p>

		<p>I was on a flight once and they asked everyone not to eat peanuts because of some kid on the plane that had a peanut allergy. &nbsp;Guess what the only snack I brought was? &nbsp;I ate them anyway, and the kid was fine. &nbsp;People are WAY too fussy nowadays, and we as a society are WAY too accomodating. &nbsp;It reminds me of a state park I used to go to in Ohio&#8230;the parking lot was 20% handicapped spaces, which were never occupied. &nbsp;Apparently handicapped people don&#8217;t spend all that much time on unpaved nature trails, who would have thought? &nbsp;idiocy.</p>

<p>Can&#8217;t or don&#8217;t want to eat my bacon-wrapped, tripe-stuffed creme-puffs? &nbsp;Well, here&#8217;s a nice tossed salad. &nbsp;You can pick out the olives if you don&#8217;t want &#8217;em.</p>

		<p>Asking for vegetarian food on an aircraft (beforehand, obviously) can be a good way to get better food.</p>
<p>On an Air New Zealand flight to Auckland many years ago, my fellow passengers were rather jealous that my vegan meal consisted of about 2lbs of fresh strawberries together with various other varieties of fruit (after a first course of a mushroom pie). Much more appetising than the stodgy chicken something-or-other that everyone else received!</p>
<p>And before anyone thinks me rude &#8211; I did share the strawberries with my neighbours.</p>
<p>The food provided by Microsoft at the UK Vista launch last year was quite good too &#8211; plenty of fruit and salad.</p>
<p>For most vegetarians/vegans you can &nbsp;satisfy requirements just by providing a range of fruit and salad (just probably avoid dressings other than oil/vinegar). Cheese dishes tend to get a big yawn (or worse from the vegans!).</p>

		<p>&quot;none of my dinner guests have had nut allergies&quot;</p>
<p>I have a nut allergy (and a peanut one as well) but I don&#8217;t know that I have ever made a big deal about it. I am careful about what I eat, travel with an Epie Pen and will eat the food I can and avoid the food I cannot. If people want to eat nuts/peanuts around me that is fine &#8211; just don&#8217;t get upset when I wait until you&#8217;ve washed your hands to shake them. :-)</p>

		<p>For my wife and I, going out to eat (or having friends cook, etc) can be exasperating. &nbsp;She&#8217;s a heart patient, so low salt, etc. &nbsp;I have a weird laundry list of allergies &nbsp;which I mostly reduce to &quot;cow&quot; (cow&#8217;s milk/cheese, beef) and spinach. &nbsp;That knocks out most &quot;random green salad&quot; items because even when the waiter checks with the chef the answer can be &quot;he&#8217;s not sure; best to skip it.&quot; &nbsp;I don&#8217;t remember the last time we ordered off the menu at a restaurant without a bunch of questions or special instructions.</p>
<p>(Who else is allergic to spinach??? geeze)</p>

		<p>Wow, a lot of rude people commenting. &nbsp;If your father didn&#8217;t like green beans, you&#8217;d make green beans as the only side? &nbsp;If your friend didn&#8217;t like pizza, you&#8217;d insist on going to Domino&#8217;s? &nbsp;Jeez. &nbsp;If you have friends over who don&#8217;t eat meat, why not try just a teeny tiny bit to accommodate them? What&#8217;s the harm? (No, I&#8217;m not a vegetarian.)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m very fortunate that my wife is an excellent and creative cook. &nbsp;One of our children is a strict vegetarian, and another is Celiac (requires strict gluten-free diet). &nbsp;AND we keep kosher. &nbsp;Always interesting&#8230;</p>
<p>No complaints, though &#8212; we&#8217;re fortunate not to have any nut allergies, though the kids have classmates who do. &nbsp;Very, very scary stuff, nut allergies. &nbsp;@Randall, it may have seemed like fussiness and low risk to you, but had particles of your snack become airborne in that cramped cabin, it could have killed someone. &nbsp;You should take that stuff more seriously.</p>

		<p>Remember when guests thought it was rude to inconvenience a host?</p>
<p>My only other thought on the subject is : Remember who the vegetarians are, when society collapses, they are the grain-fed ones who don&#8217;t taste gamey!</p>

<p>In large sections of India, this is still the case. Meat is a delicacy consumed on special days &#8211; Sundays, festival days, etc.</p>
<p>I eat meat every day, and quite a few of my colleagues and friends check to see if I&#8217;ve blood dripping down my chin :)</p>

		<p>Blimey, what is with all of the self-righteous meat-eating commenters? If people don&#8217;t like the taste of meat (I know a couple), or think it&#8217;s healthier not to eat meat (I know one), or don&#8217;t like killing animals (I know several) then that&#8217;s fair enough. Why force them to eat something they don&#8217;t want to?</p>
<p>Last I checked, meat-eaters can also eat vegetarian meals. I know someone who complains about having to cook two meals when a vegetarian visits. I never understood why they didn&#8217;t instead cook a vegetarian meal for everyone. I&#8217;ve tried their vegetarian cooking and it was excellent and would have been enjoyed by everyone.</p>
<p>Of course if there is no common ground among a group of guests then you have to have multiple options or make some go without, but I find it downright stupid that meat-eaters cannot even conceive of eating one meal without meat.</p>
<p>I eat meat but I respect those who don&#8217;t for whatever reason.</p>
<p>The only diets which I don&#8217;t really respect are the religious ones, because it&#8217;s so obvious (to me) that the reasoning behind them is faulty and out-of-date, but even there if I had a guest with those concerns then I&#8217;d respect them and aim to do something which made everyone happy, rather than single them out with something special and complicate things further. If it bothered me that much I wouldn&#8217;t invite them in the first place.</p>

		<p>&quot;I ate them anyway, and the kid was fine.&quot;</p>
<p>That is toying with danger, since people can be more or less allergic. A friend of mine is allergic to peanuts, and just having them in the same room will cause him serious problems.</p>

		<p>Leo -&gt; Allergies are one thing, but the group you are talking about tend to push their eating habits on others as a political point of view rather than just limit their own food choices.</p>
<p>Sooner or later, people were bound to get sick of it.</p>

		<p>The Capt: There is a pretty simple reason.</p>
<p>If I invite my friends over to have fried chicken wings, one of the wives of my friends is vegetarian, so I (being the host that doesn&#8217;t want to totally exclude guests) also have to make something for her to eat.</p>
<p>When a vegetarian wants to prepare a meal, they don&#8217;t have to cook something with meat in it (assuming they&#8217;re good at making flavorful vegetarian dishes). &nbsp;Since non-vegetarians can/will (generally) also eat good vegetarian food, the vegetarian does not have to go out of his/her way to cater to non-vegetarians.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s roughly the same complaint as for game/software development: you have to code/cook for the lowest common denominator.</p>
<p>That is, if you want to write one app/make one dish that works for everyone, you have to make it using the intersection of all target systems/diets.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s fine if you happen to be the most-restricted person (you have a 10 year old video card/the vegan cooking dinner for their non-vegan friends), but if you are the least-restricted person (and especially when a large majority of the group have similar systems/diets to your own), it&#8217;s an issue. &nbsp;Again, one makes exceptions for people with allergies (I don&#8217;t use peanuts due to a friend with heavy peanut allergies, though on my own I would be making the wings in peanut oil), for people that used to eat meat that one day decide &quot;I don&#8217;t want to eat meat anymore&quot; it&#8217;s a bit of a bother.</p>

		<p>&quot;Depending on whom I invite to dinner, I may have to put together a meal that conforms to one or more of the following restrictions: low-fat, pescetarian, vegetarian, nondairy, non-pork, non-beef.&quot;</p>
<p>OOh, I know. Poached Salmon. Get some salmon steaks, splash on some olive oil, salt, pepper and herbs to taste. Wrap the steaks in aluminium foil and bake until cooked. Serve with salad, rice or new potatoes. Ok, not vegetarian. But maybe the vegetarians eat fish.</p>
<p>If not how about</p>

<p>but use vegetarian mince. I think it&#8217;s quorn based.</p>

		<p>&quot;I ate them anyway, and the kid was fine.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;People are WAY too fussy nowadays, and we as a society are WAY too accomodating.&quot;</p>
<p>Can I join a different society then the one you belong to?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve found that sometimes these differing food requirements dovetail nicely, though. &nbsp;We were having some Indian friends for dinner once and I asked about their food preferences. &nbsp;It turned out that their avoidance of meat and some other animal products fit nicely with our Russian Orthodox fasting requirements (e.g. no meat, no dairy), so we invited them to come on a fasting day and everyone was able to eat what we served.</p>

		<p>&#8220;&#8230;but I find it downright stupid that meat-eaters cannot even conceive of eating one meal without meat.&#8221; &#8211; that isn&#8217;t really the point.</p>
<p>Vegetarians will expect you to cater specifically for their &#8216;needs&#8217; (always a euphemism for &#8216;choices&#8217;) whist never being willing to do the same in return.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
