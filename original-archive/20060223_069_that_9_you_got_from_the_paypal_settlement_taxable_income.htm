<p> If you're like many people, you signed up for <a href="http://www.settlement4onlinepayments.com/"> the PayPal class action lawsuit</a> and got around $9 for filing a claim against the Statutory Damage Fund. My read of <a href="http://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p4345.pdf"> IRS publication 4345</a> says that this constitutes taxable income. Note: This is just my personal opinion. Consult with your tax advisor before taking action. As for me, I reported it. Given <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/06/17/430195.aspx"> my previous experience with the IRS</a>, I'm willing to fork over the $3 to avoid getting audited.</p>

		<p>I believe income under $10 is not required to be reported. (It&#8217;s definitely true for interest and dividends)</p>

		<p>Would I just need to be selling some software for $9 per license then, and all that income would be untaxable? :)</p>

		<p>I didn&#8217;t know there was a personal injury suit against Paypal, I think you&#8217;re basing your opinion on a publication that is not applicable to your case.</p>
<p>At the same time I would agree that unless the money is for overcharging you it will be considered taxable income.</p>

		<p>Jon: &nbsp;I believe that your bank or broker doesn&#8217;t report income under $10 via a statement to you or the IRS, but you&#8217;re still supposed to claim it on your taxes.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s a refund of your already taxed income for overpayment, not income. </p>
<p>That would be saying that if I bought a pair of shoes for $100, realized they charged me $120 and then got a refund of $20 that it would be income. It is not.<br /></p>

		<p>According to my read of form 4345, compensatory damages are not taxed, but punitive damages are.</p>

		<p>You have to report *all* income.</p>
<p>One of my favorite IRS quotes:<br />
<br />&quot;Illegal income. Illegal income, such as money from dealing illegal drugs, must be included in your income on Form 1040, line 21, or on Schedule C or Schedule C-EZ (Form 1040) if from your self-employment activity.&quot; â€” IRS Publication 17, Your Federal Income Tax &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.irs.gov/publications/p17/ch12.html#d0e32305&gt;" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://www.irs.gov/publications/p17/ch12.html#d0e32305&#038;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.irs.gov/publications/p17/ch12.html#d0e32305&#038;gt</a>;</p>
<p>Bribes and Stolen Property must also be reported.</p>

		<p>pcooper said:<br />
<br />&quot;One of my favorite IRS quotes: &quot;</p>
<p>You might find that&#8217;s in there as a tool to <em>use</em> on criminals, not as any real expectation of them really reporting it.</p>
<p>If they discover such income on a drug dealer or theif, they can prosecute them under tax law as well as criminal.</p>

		<p>I just want to know one thing:</p>
<p>How much did the lawyers involved in the settlement get taxed after they got paid?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
