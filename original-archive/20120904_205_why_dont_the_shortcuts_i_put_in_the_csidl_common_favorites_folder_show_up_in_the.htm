<p>A customer created some shortcuts in the <code>CSIDL_<wbr>COMMON_<wbr>FAVORITES</wbr></wbr></code> folder, expecting them to appear in the Favorites menu for all users. Instead, they appeared in the Favorites menu for <i>no</i> users. Why isn't <code>CSIDL_<wbr>COMMON_<wbr>FAVORITES</wbr></wbr></code> working?</p>
<p> The <code>CSIDL_<wbr>COMMON_<wbr>FAVORITES</wbr></wbr></code> value was added at the same time as the other <code>CSIDL_<wbr>COMMON_<wbr>*</wbr></wbr></code> values, and its name strongly suggests that its relationship to <code>CSIDL_<wbr>FAVORITES</wbr></code> is the same as the relationship between <code>CSIDL_<wbr>COMMON_<wbr>STARTMENU</wbr></wbr></code> and <code>CSIDL_<wbr>STARTMENU</wbr></code>, or between <code>CSIDL_<wbr>COMMON_<wbr>PROGRAMS</wbr></wbr></code> and <code>CSIDL_<wbr>PROGRAMS</wbr></code>, or between <code>CSIDL_<wbr>COMMON_<wbr>DESKTOP&shy;DIRECTORY</wbr></wbr></code> and <code>CSIDL_<wbr>DESKTOP&shy;DIRECTORY</wbr></code>. </p>
<p> That suggestion is a false one. </p>
<p> In fact, <code>CSIDL_<wbr>COMMON_<wbr>FAVORITES</wbr></wbr></code> is not hooked up to anything. It's another of those vestigial values that got <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/25/5658731.aspx"> created with the intent of actually doing something</a> but that thing never actually happened. I don't think any version of Internet Explorer ever paid any attention to that folder. Maybe the designers decided that it was a bad idea and cut the feature. Maybe it was an oversight. Whatever the reason, it's just sitting there wasting space. </p>
<p> Sorry for the fake-out. </p>
<p> <b>Exercise</b>: Another customer wanted to know why creating a <code>%ALL&shy;USERS&shy;PROFILE%\<wbr>Microsoft\<wbr>Internet Explorer\<wbr>Quick Launch</wbr></wbr></wbr></code> directory and putting shortcuts into it did not result in those shortcuts appearing in every user's Quick Launch bar.

		<p>Taking a stab here&#8230;</p>
<p>Quick launch toolbar is hooked up to only the Quick Launch directory for the current user?</p>
<p>Quick launch is just a folder toolbar right? AFAIK you can&#39;t have a &quot;multi&quot;-folder toolbar&#8230; unlike the desktop which can get items from various folders.</p>

		<p>I would pretty much consider this a good thing. There is a certain company (A???e) that likes to create a useless shortcut on the common desktop even when you apply updates etc and if you are not admin there is no way to remove it&#8230;</p>

		<p>Quick Launch was always per-user, it won&#39;t automagically turn all users. Neither are the &quot;simplified&quot; pinned shortcuts.</p>

		<p>Yes, definitely a good thing that there is no such thing as &#39;all user favourites&#39;. A favourite is by definition specific to a particular user, and being unable to remove items that you don&#39;t want would be a Bad Thing.</p>

		<p>@Ian: does that apply to the Start Menu? *nix got it right in this regard. A globally placed start menu item can be removed by any user, and the removal only affects that user. If you think about it you know how it works.</p>

<p>Er, really? The whole of Unix-like OSes got it right? So you&#39;re telling me that every single start menu-like implementation in Unix-like OSes does what you say? ;)</p>
<p>But, no, seriously speaking, I know what you mean (the freedesktop.org spec) &#8211; I didn&#39;t know about that feature as I&#39;ve never used a Unix-like OS in a multi-user environment, so how DOES that work (I would completely guess that it just adds it to a list of &quot;blacklisted&quot; icons or something similar, I can&#39;t think of any other way it would work).</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t like that idea, that implies there must be some script that runs on login creating these symlinks. Then it would need to keep track of which symlinks have been deleted so it knows not to create them again. Before we know it, it&#39;s essentially back to the blacklist idea but with much more baggage.</p>

		<p>@Muzer: it works by creating a per-user .desktop file with Hidden=true. (For Windows people, a .desktop file in this context is sort of similar to a .lnk, only that it has a .ini-like text format. The global menu items use the same format.)</p>
<p>See <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://standards.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/latest/ar01s05.html" rel="nofollow">standards.freedesktop.org/&#8230;/ar01s05.html</a> for that part of the spec.</p>

		<p>@Raymond:</p>
<p>Isn&#39;t this a good example of an define that Microsoft should remove? If the feature is unimplemented, any use of it in code must be incorrect, and can lead to problems (like your original customer discovered).</p>
<p>All it&#39;s doing by sitting there is taking up bytes on developer machines and taking up cycles during each compilation and bloating up Intellisense with definitions that will cause people trouble if they use them.</p>

		<p>Having written a Windows Installer package before, the easiest way to get a shortcut on everyone&#39;s desktop by default is to just put it in All Users / common desktop. &nbsp;There doesn&#39;t seem to be a better way of doing this that I know of. &nbsp;Ideally there might be some kind of per-user &quot;hide this common icon&quot; option, but no such mechanism exists.</p>
<p>Adding the icon to the current user&#39;s desktop when installing just smells wrong since other users then don&#39;t get the option of the icon &#8211; the install user might be different from the normal user. &nbsp;And there would also be the problem of roaming profiles (what if software isn&#39;t on another computer?), and the problem of new users.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Yeah, and break accessibility or worse in the process. I&#39;m sick of this attitude (by said professionals).</p>
<blockquote><p>
  The All-user start menu contains items that the IT administrator thinks all users should see. If the IT administrator wanted users to be able to remove it, they&#39;d push out the shortcut to the user&#39;s normal start-menu, not the all-users start menu.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Probability of push-out script breaking exceeds 50% once the user begins customizing (in my experience it&#39;s more than 90%).</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Otherwise the IT helpdesk get phone calls like &quot;Hi &#8211; I right clicked on something in the start menu and then my mouse slipped, and now I can&#39;t find Microsoft Word anywhere&quot;
</p></blockquote>
<p>That&#39;s a general usability problem. It shouldn&#39;t be possible to accidentally modify the start menu but it is.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve always assumed the quick launch was completely personal to a user. &nbsp;It&#39;s a massive change to (especially small) screens to have the Taskbar suddenly get smaller in favour of a few shortcuts, imagine if you couldn&#39;t change them?</p>
<p>As for IT trying to keep a lock on every detail to avoid users &#39;accidentalying the desktop&#39; I can sympathise, but maybe you should give control of this permanent screen space to the users and avoid putting any important shortcuts anywhere other than the Start Menu or another place that&#39;s less invasive?</p>

		<p>&quot;but maybe you should give control of this permanent screen space to the users and avoid putting any important shortcuts anywhere other than the Start Menu or another place that&#39;s less invasive?&quot;</p>
<p>Never underestimate the stupidity of the average user.</p>
<p>I once worked in technical support (years ago, before I taught myself programming) and would frequently get calls like &quot;I can&#39;t use MS Word! It&#39;s not installed! WTF is wrong with you people? Blah blah blah!&quot;</p>
<p>Then I&#39;d show up at their desk and office was installed; Office shortcuts were in the start menu; *BUT there was no shortcut on the desktop.*</p>

<p>We can only hope that Windows 8 will resolve these issues! &nbsp;The window system isn&#39;t exactly a trivial concept combined with the Taskbar, Start menu, desktop gadgets &amp; shortcuts, notification area and possibly quick launch (or the Windows 7 equivalent). &nbsp;I can empathise with users struggling to balance all of the concepts with little computer expertise.</p>

		<p>Behold, just saw a question and thought of this discussion in the comments. &nbsp;This is a direct quote:</p>
<p>&quot;I cannot see the buttons at the bottom where I can open things. &nbsp;Lots of changes lately. &nbsp;Cannot see Sykp and more.&quot;</p>
<p>I imagine this is pretty harsh on the user, as I said earlier I&#39;m really hoping Windows 8 fixes this!</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
