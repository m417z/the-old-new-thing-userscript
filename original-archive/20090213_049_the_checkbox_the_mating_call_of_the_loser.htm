(Cultural note: The phrase
<i>the mating call of the loser</i>
is a term of derision.
I used it here to create a more provocative headline
even though it's stronger than I really intended,
but
<a HREF="http://www.deez.info/sengelha/2008/01/30/in-writing-precision-often-harms-readability/">
good writing is bold</a>.)
</p>
<p>
When given a choice between two architectures,
some people say that
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/01/29/7294949.aspx#7324700">
you should give users a checkbox to select which one should be used</a>.
That is the ultimate cowardly answer.
You can't decide between two fundamentally different approaches,
and instead of picking one, you say
"<a HREF="http://www.dilbert.com/strips/comic/1996-01-27/"
>Let's do both</a>!",
thereby creating triple, perhaps quadruple the work compared
to just choosing one or the other.
</p>
<p>
It's like you're remodeling a book library and somebody asks you,
"Should we use
<a HREF="http://www.oclc.org/dewey/">
Dewey Decimal</a>
or
<a HREF="http://www.loc.gov/catdir/cpso/lcc.html">
Library of Congress</a>?"
Your answer, "Let's do both and let the user choose!"
</p>
<p>
Imagine if there were a checkbox somewhere in the Control Panel
that let you specify how
Windows&nbsp;XP-styled controls were implemented.
Your choices are either to require applications to
link to a new <code>UxCtrl.DLL</code> (let's call this Method&nbsp;A)
or to link to <code>COMCTL32.DLL</code> with a custom manifest
(let's call this Method&nbsp;B).
Well, it means that every component that wanted styled common controls
would have to come in two versions,
one that linked to <code>UxCtrl</code> and used the new class names
in its dialog boxes and calls to <code>CreateWindow</code>,
and one that used a manifest and continued to use the class names
under their old names.
</p>
<pre>
#ifdef USE_METHODA
 hwnd = CreateWindow(TEXT("UxButton"), ...);
#else
 hwnd = CreateWindow(TEXT("Button"), ...);
#endif

DLG_WHATEVER DIALOG 36, 44, 230, 94
STYLE WS_POPUP | WS_CAPTION | WS_SYSMENU |
      DS_MODALFRAME | DS_SHELLFONT
CAPTION "Whatever"
BEGIN
#ifdef USE_METHODA
    CONTROL         "Whatever",IDC_WHATEVER,"UxButton",
                    BS_AUTOCHECKBOX | WS_TABSTOP, 14,101,108,9
#else
    CONTROL         "Whatever",IDC_WHATEVER,"Button",
                    BS_AUTOCHECKBOX | WS_TABSTOP, 14,101,108,9
#endif
    ...
</pre>
<p>
At run time, every program would have to check this global setting
and spawn off either the "Method A" binary or the "Method B" binary.
</p>
<p>
Now you might try to pack this all into a single binary with
something like this:
</p>
<pre>
if (GetSystemMetrics(SM_USEMANIFESTFORSTYLEDCONTROLS)) {
 hwnd = CreateWindow(TEXT("Button"), ...);
} else {
 hwnd = CreateWindow(TEXT("UxButton"), ...);
}
...

if (GetSystemMetrics(SM_USEMANIFESTFORSTYLEDCONTROLS)) {
  DialogBox(hInstance,
            MAKEINTRESOURCE(DLG_TEMPLATE_WITH_OLDNAME_CONTROLS),
            ...
} else {
  DialogBox(hInstance,
            MAKEINTRESOURCE(DLG_TEMPLATE_WITH_UXCONTROLS),
            ...
}
</pre>
<p>
But it's not actually that simple because a lot of decisions take
place even before your program starts running.
For example, if your program specifies a load-time link to
<code>UXCTRL.DLL</code>, then that DLL will get loaded before your
program even runs, even if the system switch is set to use Method&nbsp;B.
A single-binary program that tries to choose between the two methods
at runtime will have to do some activation context juggling
and delay-loading.
Hardly a slam dunk.
</p>
<p>
Okay, so now you have two versions of every program.
And you also have to decide what should happen if somebody
writes and ships a program that uses Method&nbsp;A exclusively,
even when the system switch is set to Method&nbsp;B.
Does everything still work within that program as if Method&nbsp;A
were the system setting, while the rest of the system uses Method&nbsp;B?
(If you go this route, then you've completely undermined the point
of Method&nbsp;B.
The whole point of Method&nbsp;B is to allow programs that
rely on specific class names to continue working,
but this rogue Method&nbsp;A program is running around using the
wrong class names!)
</p>
<p>
Now the entire operating system and application compatibility work
needs to be done with the checkbox set both to Method&nbsp;A and to
Method&nbsp;B,
because the compatibility impact of each of the methods is quite different.
Okay, that's double the work. Where is triple and quadruple?
</p>
<p>
Well, the two different versions of the program need to be kept in sync,
since you want them to behave identically.
This can of course be managed with judicious use of <code>#ifdef</code>s
or runtime branches.
But you have to remember both ways of doing things
and be mindful of the two method each time you modify the program.
Somebody else might come in and "fix a little bug"
or "add a little feature" to your program,
unaware of how your program manages the shuffle of Method&nbsp;A
versus Method&nbsp;B.
The mental effort necessary to remember two different ways of doing
the same thing plus having to expend that effort to correct mistakes
in the code, that's the triple.
</p>
<p>
The quadruple?
I'm not sure, maybe the ongoing fragility of such a scheme,
especially one that, at the end of the day, is a choice between
two things that have no real impact on the typical end user.
</p>
<p>
Engineering is about making tradeoffs.
If you refuse to make the choice,
then you're taking the cowardly route
and ultimately are creating more work for your team.
Instead of solving problems, you're <i>creating them</i>.
</p>
<p>
All because you're too chicken to make a hard decision.</p>

		<p>The quadrupling happens six months in the future, when you add another checkbox that somehow interacts with the first one, and now you have a 2&#215;2 matrix of configurations to develop and support.</p>

		<p>Good question Ray, let me stretch a little bit. Can we make a choice before we get into the window for the operating system? Can MS let us choose between the XP and Vista? Obviously not, and the problem is what you have described. But between the Marketing Depart and the Engineering Group, we are playing those chicken games too often. It really comes down to the leadership of the respect departments.</p>

		<p>A product I used to work on fell into this trap. When the spec owners couldn&#8217;t decide if it would be a worthwhile feature to do X for the user in situation Z, we ended up showing a &quot;Do you want to do X now?&quot; message box. Even if Z was very common and X was something you&#8217;d do 10% of the time.</p>
<p>One time, I searched the code base for MessageBox and there were over 200 instances. They weren&#8217;t all Yes/No questions, but still&#8230;</p>

		<p>A similar topic was covered by Bruce Schneier (I don&#8217;t remember which book) on the selection of crypto algorithms. The attitude he expressed can be summarized as &quot;if you&#8217;re not smart enough to choose the best algorithm, how can you expect the end user to be smart enough to choose one?&quot;.</p>
<p>Of course, life&#8217;s not always that simple, but I like the general idea.</p>

		<p>I spend most of my time on Macs (and make most of my sales on Windows) so I really hope that Windows 7 will move in the right direction.</p>
<p>My opinion is that Windows would be so much better system if it had better defaults. I need to do like 5 customizations on a fresh copy of Mac OS X before I can start comfortably working with it. Setting up fresh Windows installation is not that simple. Far from it.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll never understand who needs autoplay on USB thumb drive (or any other rewritable device) and why I can not eject it via keyboard or Eject command on contextual menu?!</p>

<p>To be true I need to do some customizations to OSX and it doesn&#8217;t allow me to do them!</p>
<p>It is the least customizable OS in the world (and I really can&#8217;t figure out what people find good in it).</p>
<p>Anyway, I can&#8217;t stand an OS which forces colors on me.</p>

		<p>@Chris Hanson</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see any link between your article on CS_DROPSHADOW and this blog entry, but I did read it.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t get the question as to why a drop shadows would work with child windows, or should be window style. &nbsp;It&#8217;s all logical for me; normally all windows of class would behave the same way &#8212; otherwise you should create a new class &#8212; and of course it&#8217;s for popup/overlapped windows. &nbsp;That&#8217;s the whole point of the visual cue, the fact that they&#8217;re overapping.</p>
<p>In fact you erred in trying to implement a &quot;popup panel&quot; with a Child style. &nbsp;You&#8217;re even describing it as working like Combo. &nbsp;These windows need to be WS_POPUP so they do not become clipped by the parent. &nbsp;That&#8217;s just the way these things are done; menus, popup widgets, the list of a combo box, tooltips, etc, they are all WM_POPUP and that&#8217;s how we expect them to be, that&#8217;s the goal of the style.</p>
<p>I think the whole trying-to-force-it-to-use themes part is a little too hack-and-slashery for me, thank god an eventually saner solution prevailed ;-)</p>

		<p>Oh, man, this reminds me of the top salesman in a company I used to work for (systems automation/integration &#8211; we did the large, expensive custom jobs that none of our competitors wanted to do).</p>
<p>I tried to explain it endless times over my 8 years with the company: if you have 99 situations that require one set of logic, but one situation that requires a completely different set of logic, then you have *more than doubled the complexity*!</p>
<p>He never got it.</p>

		<p>I have one good counterexample for &quot;When given a choice between two architectures&quot;. &quot;Architectures&quot; in a big sense, not in &quot;one check box&quot;, of course:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve just read that Windows 7 will not have the classic Start menu and taskbar. In Vista, even if it managed to spread Control panels to unexpected location, the users who already have hardwired how to do things were able to do so by switching Classic mode on. Windows 7 will make necessary new learning and training for all people who already know how to do their daily jobs. I guess that millions of people will waste in summary immense amount of money and time just to reach the point to do that what they anyway efficiently did up to now. That will maybe help Windows users to really reconsider Mac, (and as the added benefit it wouldn&#8217;t at least randomly forget the placements of icons and wouldn&#8217;t come in the number of versions adjusted for extortion).</p>
<p>It seems now &quot;The MSDN Magazine Camp&quot; won over &quot;The Raymond Chen Camp&quot; (as Joel calls it: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/APIWar.html</a>) even regarding user interface. Now Joel&#8217;s article can be easily adapted, all with the section titles:</p>
<p>How Microsoft Lost the UI War</p>
<p>* Developers, Developers, Developers, Developers</p>
<p>* Why Apple and Linux had problems increasing user base</p>
<p>* The Two Forces at Microsoft</p>
<p>* Microsoft Lost the Backwards Compatibility Religion</p>
<p>* Automatic Transmissions Win the Day (Windows 7 is &quot;I have to learn to change gears for that damn thing after all these years of driving cars with the same gear logic&quot;) </p>
<p>* One UI To Rule Them All</p>
<p>* It&#8217;s Not 1995 (context is not the same for switching from 3.1 GUI to Win95 (which can hardly be called a GUI) and from classic to win 7)</p>
<p>* Enter Mac and Linux</p>
<p>* Am I a Little Bit Sad About This</p>

		<p>Re: keithmo</p>
<p>There are plenty of cases where the end user knows his needs better than you will know his needs. Your cryptography example is actualy a rather good one, although maybe not exactly in the terms you are probably thinking.</p>
<p>Sure, between two stream cyphers that take N-bit keys, its probably best to pick one for him.</p>
<p>But you might want to also allow him to use a one-time pad, which is a paradigm shift.. he knows better about when to apply such a shift than you ever will, because such things are highly situational.</p>
<p>A one-time pad cannot ever be default behavior, because every use weakens it. Just the same, when used properly the one-time pad is the strongest encryption that will ever be available.</p>

		<p>&quot;Why can&#8217;t Microsoft just build a perfect interface and then leave it alone?&quot;</p>
<p>Yes, you&#8217;re right as in you cant make it perfect. But maybe more people in the windows team should take Raymonds advice and grow a pair. i.e. Stop caring about broken apps which leads to lame design compromises.</p>

<p>Eh, so rather than just training on the new* start menu when these user switch to Windows 7, they&#8217;re instead going to switch to Mac &#8211; where they&#8217;ll have to train on ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING&#8230; right.</p>

<p>Why do you need to start so much from your Start Menu? I have only 13 items pinned to it, which is enough for me at work. At home I have even fewer items pinned.</p>

		<p>While I agree in principle, some things (especially in the UX realm) really do need that checkbox.</p>
<p>While I love the type-in box in the Start Menu in Vista, for example, I would much rather have the flyout menu monstrosity from XP and before for the All Programs menu instead of the treelike monstrosity in Vista. &nbsp;(Yes, it&#8217;s multi-column and gets messy quickly, but I can rearrange it as needed and positional memory and sorting makes it really quick to get to things. &nbsp;If Vista *didn&#8217;t* have the type-in box, it would be utterly unusable.)</p>
<p>But someone, somewhere, decided for the XP-style menu to go away entirely, leaving the only choices between W2K style and Vista style. &nbsp;And I want to wap them onna head.</p>

		<p>@Miral: If Vista *didn&#8217;t* have the type-in box, it would be utterly unusable.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the idea. The &quot;All Programs&quot; list in Vista was intentionally crippled in order to make you dependent on search. Of course nobody at Microsoft will ever admit this, but its the only reasonable explanation I&#8217;ve ever heard.</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a lot of crap flying around in these comments&#8230;</p>
<p>First of all, it constantly amazes me how many technical people (or at least self-labeled &quot;technical people&quot;) are afraid of any kind of change, even when the change is absolutely, measurably, better. Yes, the Office 2007 interface is different, get over it already&#8211; the new design is simply better all-around. Yes, the Start menu changed, it&#8217;s also better. Cope with it already and stop the whining. Change is good.</p>
<p>Secondly, saying that people will switch to Mac because they have to re-learn the Start menu is moronic; on a Mac, they need to relearn *everything*. Hell, even the way the up-arrow and down-arrow work in text fields is different on Macintosh! (And don&#8217;t get me started on the Mac difference between &quot;Enter&quot; and &quot;Return&quot;, which even Apple seems to have given up on by this point. A shame.)</p>
<p>The M: It&#8217;s half the explanation of why Linux sucks; the other half is that Linux users, generally, don&#8217;t even bother to do the &quot;more work&quot; that their options generate. (Except in a completely random ad-hoc fashion.) It&#8217;s not like they add the &quot;additional window style&quot; checkbox, then add a whole grid of test-cases for it&#8211; instead the guy who put it in just kind of runs a few apps maybe and if it looks sort of slightly right he rubberstamps it. There are good open source projects, but they are too few and far-between.</p>

		<p>Aaron: &quot;Why can&#8217;t Microsoft just build a perfect interface and then leave it alone?&quot;</p>
<p>Try to look from the point of view of the real users (in real companies). Companies don&#8217;t install &quot;latest and greatest&quot; as soon as MSFT publishes. Windows 2000 was still installed on the new computers in my company until around 3 years after the XP appeared. In between a lot of bugs were actually fixed. Still the &quot;classic&quot; look made the transition easier. Now by dropping the &quot;classic&quot; the thing that works is dropped and the &quot;new and untested&quot; forced to the unwilling users. Again, not all users are kids who don&#8217;t have anything else to do than learn anew how to do something that was a built in reflex before.</p>
<p>I still consider the attitude &quot;we current managers/developers are so smart that we&#8217;ll drop the old functioning things to introduce something new on which the people will eventually get used to and which will eventually be bug fixed&quot; very, very wrong. That attitude apparently destroyed Netscape:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000069.html</a></p>
<p>At these same times MSFT prospered, keeping the same interfaces for Office and Windows. And now it came to the point that the latest Ubuntu and Open Office are easier to be used by &quot;classic&quot; user than Win 7 and Office 2007. That Open Office can do Basic and that MS Office can&#8217;t (on Mac). And seeing that the guy who removed File menu from Office leads Windows all the results don&#8217;t surprise me.</p>
<p>Now a lot of that &quot;it&#8217;s slower&quot; perception of users (how Vista was seen) is:</p>
<p>a) Because the user *are* actually slowed down &#8212; they spend much more time and energy</p>
<p>b) Because the product is made to &quot;look good in the presentation&quot; &#8212; all these transition effects! Transition effects are OK when you look at the movie and you gave up the next two hours to always &quot;wait and see what comes next.&quot; &nbsp;They are also good on tests of &quot;new UI&quot; since when the UI is new nobody knows what it is doing. But when you work with the computer you *know* what comes next (except the first time you try) and any animation which show &quot;nice&quot; phases between what user initiated and the final result induce of perception of &quot;slowly happening.&quot; A lot of visual cues &quot;designed&quot; for new products are wrong. They do look good in the presentations, however. &nbsp;As Raymond would say &quot;I bet a lot of people are looking to get a really nice bonus for all that.&quot; The Emperor is naked, but it still doesn&#8217;t come to his head. Oh well&#8230;</p>
<p>There should be one main checkbox in Windows Wow effect &#8212; wow starts now.&quot; &nbsp;Tha would be the &quot;mode for bonuses for MSFT managers and developers and for fanboy excitement.&quot; Turned off, it lets people do their jobs with as little fuss as possible. Both modes should be configured fully independently.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve recently received a brand new (Core 2 2.1GHz) notebook. I started using Vista and it simply appeared slow, slow, slow! I didn&#8217;t have to measure it but it appeared slow even in the &quot;maximize performance&quot; mode. Then I sit in front of my 2002 notebook (AMD 1.4 Ghz) with XP &#8212; it just feels faster &#8212; the response is immediate, simply not so on Vista. I believe that people in MSFT used Vista so long that they forgot how it looks like using XP (or even traditionally not optimized enough, that is, compared with classic Windows, Linux for that matter, one more thing probably not allowed among the &quot;omg were&#8217;re so smart&quot; MSFT managers).</p>

		<p>@acq: &nbsp;the joelonsoftware reference is about something completely different. &nbsp;Code wasn&#8217;t thrown away here &#8212; it evolved. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Re the point about latest/greatest &#8211; I understand where you&#8217;re coming from. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve seen lots of companies deploy a newer version of Windows and make it look like a one or more versions back because they&#8217;re concerned about retraining. &nbsp;However, their employees are usually buying computers with the current version of Windows and most likely sticking with the default interface (it&#8217;s easier to use for one thing), and so they&#8217;re learning it on their own time. &nbsp;And then the work computer is a PITA because it uses the older, inferior interface. &nbsp;Keeping AND MAINTAINING older code involves a lot of risk, and sometimes that risk is not worth the marginal benefit.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
