<p>Over the past few days we've learned how 16-bit Windows <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/14/665669.aspx"> exported</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/17/668284.aspx"> imported</a> functions from DLLs and that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/18/669668.aspx"> the way functions are exported from 32-bit DLLs</a> matches the 16-bit method reasonably well. But the 16-bit way functions are imported simply doesn't work in the 32-bit world.</p>
<p> Recall that in 16-bit Windows, the fixups for an imported function are threaded through the code segment. This works great in 16-bit Windows since there was a single address space: Code segments were shared globally, and once a segment was loaded, each process could use it. But 32-bit Windows uses separate address spaces. If the fixups were threaded through the code segment, then loading a code page from disk would necessarily entail modifying it to apply the fixups, which prevents the pages from being shared by multiple processes. Even if the fixup table were kept external to the code segment, you would still have to fix up the code pages to establish the jump targets. (With sufficient cleverness, you could manage to share the pages if all the fixups on a page happened to agree exactly with those of another process, but the bookkeeping for this would get rather messy.) </p>
<p> But beyond just being inefficient, the idea of applying import fixups directly to the code segment is downright impossible. The Alpha&nbsp;AXP has a "call direct" instruction, but it is limited to functions that are at most 128KB away. If you want to call a function that is further away, you have to load the destination address into a temporary register and call through that register. And <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/08/55239.aspx"> as we saw earlier</a>, loading a 32-bit value into a register on the Alpha&nbsp;AXP is a two-step operation which depends on whether bit 15 of the value you want to load is set or clear. Since this is an imported function, we have no idea at compile or link time whether the target function's address will have bit 15 set or clear. </p>
<p> (And the Alpha&nbsp;AXP was hardly the only architecture that restricted the distance to direct calls. The Intel&nbsp;ia64 can make direct calls to functions up to 4MB away, and the AMD&nbsp;x86-64 and Intel&nbsp;EM64T architectures can reach up to 2GB away. This sounds like a lot until you realize that they are 64-bit processors with 16 exabytes of address space. Once again, we see that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/09/14/229387.aspx"> the x86 architecture is the weirdo</a>.) </p>
<p> Both of the above concerns made it undesirable (or impossible) for import fixups to modify code. Instead, import fixups have to apply to data. Rather than applying a fixup for each location an imported function was used, a single fixup is applied to a table of function pointers. This means that calls to imported functions are really indirect calls through the function pointer. On an x86, this means that instead of <code>call ImportedFunction</code> the generated code says <code>call [__imp__ImportedFunction]</code>, where <code>__imp__ImportedFunction</code> is the name of the variable that holds the function pointer for that imported function. </p>
<p> This means that resolving imported functions is a simple matter of looking up the target addresses and writing the results into the table of imported function addresses. The code itself doesn't change; it just reads the function address at runtime and calls through it. </p>
<p> With that simple backgrounder, we are equipped to look at some of the deeper consequences of this design, which we will do next time. </p>

		<p>Being the only CISC one of the bunch, x86 may be an outlier among the Windows architectures, but it was pretty much the norm when it came out. All of the other architectures (MIPS, Alpha, PPC, IA64) are RISC or post-RISC, and none of them even existed when Windows first came out.</p>

		<p>This question might fit with the whole DLL theme you&#8217;re running now, Raymond&#8230;</p>
<p>We have a bunch of inhouse-developed C++ classes that utilize large parts of the STL, and follows quite a few design patterns. They build and work without a hitch in their original Unix environment. It took me about five minutes to get them to compile in Windows too, and all testcases worked the first try. Everything was wonderful.</p>
<p>Except for the fact that I had done a static link. After trying to build a DLL with these classes, I got bizarre crashes when deleting objects. A minute of source code inspection told me that I was not allowed to let a factory class in the DLL allocate an object, and then delete it in the main program. Adding a function in the DLL that deleted any pointer you sent to it worked fine, though.</p>
<p>Any experience or explanation for this behaviour?</p>

		<p>Jens, it seems like your .dll is linked with static CRT. In such case the library and main program have two separate heaps; memory allocated in .exe can&#8217;t be freed by .dll and vice versa.</p>

		<p>Jens: The DLL and the Application (EXE) are using different instances of a C-Runtime. Which means, simply, that the heap managers used by the EXE and Dll are incompatible. </p>
<p>To resolve the problem, make sure that both projects use the same CRT (by, for example, setting both to use msvcrt.dll), or &#8211; as you have done &#8211; ensuring that things are always deallocated using the same heap manager that allocated them originally.</p>

		<p>Ok, risking looking like a too-little-knowledge-is-dangerous; is it not true that 32-bit DLL&#8217;s need no fixups, because they are loaded at the same address in each processes&#8217; virtual address space? Ok I guess if two DLL&#8217;s collide, then fixups are still needed.</p>

		<p>James Risto: If the DLL can load at its preferred base address, then no fixups are required. If it cannot, any absolute addresses still need to be altered, and this work is done by the loader. The x86 has poor support for program counter-relative addressing, so many more absolute addressing operations are needed, and many more fixups are generated for this architecture.</p>
<p>The addresses of fixups are kept in the .reloc section of the image. To see the size of fixups (relocations) use dumpbin /headers. To see the fixups themselves, run dumpbin /relocations.</p>
<p>Neil: by default, no, but you can do this by running the bind tool. If the loader detects that the version of the exporting DLL matches the version recorded in the header by &#8216;bind&#8217;, it will skip checking the import table. I <em>think</em> binding becomes less important in Windows Vista due to Address Space Layout Randomization (see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2006/05/26/608315.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/michael_howard/archive/2006/05/26/608315.aspx</a>) although the suggestion that there are 256 possible layouts might make it possible to simply set the bits appropriately on a bound image rather than have to actually search the export table.</p>

		<p>A little bit of trivia for fans of the most obscure corners of Windows&#8230;</p>
<p>UNIX executables for Windows (yes, Virgina, there are UNIX executables for Windows) compiled with GCC with the -fPIC flag (Position Independent Code) use, instead, the AT&amp;T standard for relocations, that is a table (the GOT, Global Offset Table) is kept of all pointers used in the code, thus any relocations only affect a contiguous block of data, rather than sparse pages of code</p>
<p>It is a lot more efficient, and effectively allows any DLL to be relocated at will, but sadly on x86 it has quite some side effects&#8230;</p>
<p>Like, for example, all non-leaf functions have one less register to work with (specifically, EBX), to cache the address of the GOT, which would be bad enough&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, all functions with non-static linkage need to have a short prolog that calculates the position of the GOT relative to the current EIP. Program-counter-based addressing isn&#8217;t supported on x86, so the prolog has to emulate it and is quite convoluted &#8211; altough it can be skipped for calls within the same module, because the address is cached in EBX</p>
<p>The alternative approach would be &quot;far&quot; pointers, which can take two forms: &quot;fat&quot; pointers encoding both the address of the GOT (or a fixed offset from it, like the image&#8217;s base address) and the address (or offset) of the function, or indirect pointers, which actually point to a structure containing all the required information. Windows employed the former under 16-bit x86 (only differently, because it was a segmented memory architecture), and the latter under MIPS, Alpha and IA64</p>
<p>Aaand yes. The funny part is that they are PE executables, not ELF. After all, PE is just COFF in drag, and UNIX has run on COFF executables for decades. Did I mention they also support UNIX-style dynamic linking?</p>

		<p>Thanks, Mike.</p>
<p>One other question I hope someone can answer:</p>
<p>In 16-bit Windows you could import functions in your .DEF file (which I frequently did, because I was trying to target 3.1 with a 3.0 compiler). Is this no longer possible in 32-bit Windows?</p>

		<p>Actually, both x86 and x64 allows near calls up to 2 GB (32-bit and 64-bit) or 32 KB (16-bit) away.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
