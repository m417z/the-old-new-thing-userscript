Some time ago I had a problem with icon drawing.
When I tried to draw an icon with <code>Draw&shy;Icon</code>
it ended up being drawn at the wrong size.
A call to
<code>Get&shy;Icon&shy;Info</code> confirmed that the icon was
48&times;48, but it drew at 32&times;32.
</p>
<p>
The answer is documented in a backwards sort of way
in the <code>Draw&shy;Icon&shy;Ex</code> function, which says at the bottom,
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=m>
<p>
To duplicate DrawIcon (hDC, X, Y, hIcon), call <b>DrawIconEx</b> as follows: 
</p>
<pre>
DrawIconEx (hDC, X, Y, hIcon, 0, 0, 0, NULL,
            DI_NORMAL | DI_COMPAT | DI_DEFAULTSIZE); 
</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>
Aha, if you use <code>Draw&shy;Icon</code>, then the icon size is ignored
and it is drawn with <code>DI_<wbr>DEFAULT&shy;SIZE</wbr></code>.
</p>
<p>
The fix, therefore, was to switch to the <code>Draw&shy;Icon&shy;Ex</code>
function so I could remove the <code>DI_<wbr>DEFAULT&shy;SIZE</wbr></code> flag,
thereby permitting the icon to be drawn at its actual size.
</p>
<pre>
- DrawIcon(hdc, pt.x, pt.y, hico);
+ DrawIcon<font COLOR=red>Ex</font>(hdc, pt.x, pt.y, hico, <font COLOR=red>0, 0, 0, NULL, DI_NORMAL | DI_COMPAT</font>);
</pre>
<p>
A bonus quirk of the
<code>DI_<wbr>DEFAULT&shy;SIZE</wbr></code> flag
(and therefore of the
<code>Draw&shy;Icon</code> function)
is that the drawing is done at the default <i>icon</i> size,
even if you asked it to draw a <i>cursor</i>.</p>

		<p>&lsquo;DrawIcon draws the icon or cursor using the width and height specified by the system metric values for icons; for more information, see GetSystemMetrics.&rsquo; &#8211; So people can&#39;t blame the docs.</p>

		<p>I think I recall hitting this one in the past, except with a 16&#215;16 icon that was relentlessly being drawn at 32&#215;32 (ie. upscaled and nasty looking). &nbsp;I did get it sorted out in the end. :)</p>
<p>The default behaviour is a bit surprising, especially when you get your icon from LoadImage and explicitly specify the size you want. &nbsp;Still, no doubt there&#39;s some mysterious historic reason for the behaviour. &nbsp;(Future topic?)</p>

<p>I would guess it&#39;s for applications which use the &quot;default&quot; values when using LoadIcon. &nbsp;From LoadIcon:</p>
<p>&quot;The width, in pixels, of the icon or cursor. If this parameter is zero and the fuLoad parameter is LR_DEFAULTSIZE, the function uses the SM_CXICON or SM_CXCURSOR system metric value to set the width.&quot;</p>
<p>So the app calls LoadIcon with 0 for cxDesired and cyDesired and gets whatever the system values specify. &nbsp;This lets them then call DrawIcon and get an appropriately sized icon (without, I guess, actually querying the system metric values).</p>
<p>But that&#39;s just a guess :)</p>

		<p>Does Windows icon resizing use bicubic interpolation anywhere icons are used? e.g. Explorer toolbars?</p>

		<p>Aside from when they are loaded from a resource (since icons can be chosen from a group) I don&#39;t see why anyone cares whether a given handle is an icon or a cursor.</p>

		<p>I found out that in high DPI mode, DrawIcon draws 32 pixel-based icons in a very ugly way beginning with Vista &#8211; it seems to just StretchBlt them. If you use DrawIconEx instead, the icon is scaled up quite niceley, even if it&#39;s the same 32-pixel icon.</p>
<p>In a nutshell, never use DrawIcon in the future. The icon might look fine on your development Windows 7 machine at 96 dpi, but it will look ugly if a user has Large Fonts on. Replace all DrawIcon calls with DrawIconEx.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
