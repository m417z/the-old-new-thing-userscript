<p>I had previously written on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/04/23/118893.aspx"> how you can retrieve the text under the cursor</a>, and you may have noticed that it produces mixed results. It works great with some programs but not with others.</p>
<p> It depends on the program in question. Some programs were written with greater attention to supporting screen readers than others. Internet Explorer, for example, has excellent support for ActiveAccessibility because browsing the web is a great way for people with disabilities to get involved in the world around them. </p>
<p> Other programs don't do quite as good a job. For example, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/17/54944.aspx"> the program we developed to demonstrate various scrollbar techniques</a> does not handle <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/msaa/msaaccrf_4wms.asp"> the <code>WM_GETOBJECT</code> message</a> and is not accessible. </p>
<p> So whether ActiveAccessibility works for any particular program depends heavily on how much the author of that program had accessibility in mind when they wrote it. </p>

<p>I imagine that he may have ground beef &#8211; but, then, if you&#8217;re going to be breaking into somebody&#8217;s house, why on earth would you want to cook supper while you&#8217;re there?</p>

		<p>And while I&#8217;m at it, I wonder if Windows has a built in text-speaking thing.  Mac OS X does; I use it a lot when I have a headache, because it&#8217;s easier to listen to Stephen Hawking than stare at a screen.</p>

		<p>If you&#8217;re running XP, hit Windows key + U.</p>
<p>The Narrator is the text-to-speech app.</p>
<p>This may also work on other versions of Windows, but I&#8217;ve not tried it on others :)</p>

		<p>The speech SDK has stuff like this in it. And it was on some 98 (or maybe 95) disks. The Windows Sound System (for 3.1) also had toys like this.</p>

		<p>I hate to say it, but what incentive is there for developers to add ActiveAccessibility support to their product?  If I had to venture a guess I&#8217;d say less than 1 percent of computer users use that feature, probably a lot less than 1 percent.  So in the ever tight development cycle if the choice is between things like more features, fixing bugs, or adding ActiveAccessibility, I think the latter is going to get axed every time.  In an ideal world with unlimited development time, most developers would probably add support for ActiveAccessibility.</p>

		<p>My understanding is that software sold to the US government must be accessible (via Americans with Disabilities Act). That&#8217;s at least one piece of incentive.</p>

		<p>I hope third party screen-reader apps are better than the one supplied with Windows &#8212; in one of my legendary fits of boredom I tried turning my monitor off and using the PC just by listening to the screen reader, but the output it gave was pretty much meaningless.  (More precisely, it gives too much information about the physical layout of windows but almost no useful context &#8212; even when it reads out the content of the narrator window it lists the four checkboxes and buttons but makes no mention of the accelerator keys for any of them.)</p>

		<p>Yes, thirdparty screenreaders kick Narrator&#8217;s butt.</p>

		<p>But then, if Narrator was excellent, all the companies that produce screen readers would tumble out of the woodwork shouting &quot;anti-competitive practices&quot; to all and sundry.</p>

		<p>Also, active accessibility is not just about screen readers, it is about making your program more usable and accessible. It is about making it usable without assuming the presence of mouse, a speaker (and may be a color monitor). Also, most of the times, you get it from free if you are using standard controls.</p>
<p>Aaron goes in detail on this at &quot;Accessiblity is not a feature&quot; (<a target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/aaronbrethorst/archive/2004/04/03/107193.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/aaronbrethorst/archive/2004/04/03/107193.aspx</a>).</p>
<p>Sara Ford&#8217;s blog is a good resource on accessiblity (<a target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/saraford/</a>).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
