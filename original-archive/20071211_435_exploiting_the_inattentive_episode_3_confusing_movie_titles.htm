		<p>At my video shop you have to ask for films by name. I went and asked for &#8216;Fifty First Dates&#8217;, the romantic comedy. I didn&#8217;t notice till I got home I&#8217;d been given &#8216;Fifty-First State&#8217;, the (rather poor) violent thriller.</p>
<p>I felt that it would be far too complicated and embarrassing to explain the error.</p>

		<p>At a local supermarket they have 4packs of the stores own brand of &#8216;cola&#8217; right next to the 4packs of Coca Cola(tm), wrapped in a very similar red wrapper. There isn&#8217;t even a divider between the shelves (there is between every other product). The bottles have roughly the same shape an similar labels (just different enough to avoid getting sued).</p>

		<p>I dont see this as much anymore, but many Disney feature animation titles are from stories that are public domain. &nbsp;I would often see mock versions of Aladdin or Beauty and the Beast.</p>
<p>They always came in that same puffy white oversized VHS case Disney used. &nbsp;And the cover art would evoke memories of the Disney feature, but (hopefully) with enough difference to prevent copyright infringment claims. &nbsp;The genie in Aladdin was purple and had a big grin like Disney&#8217;s genie, but the face was altered enough to not look too much like the one Robin Williams voiced.</p>
<p>Interesting tactic. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t personally know how well it worked.</p>

		<p>I imagine some part of how well it worked to keep from getting sued would involve how closely the knock-off followed Disney&#8217;s changes to the story. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>JIM: No. &nbsp;But if it means &quot;trying to trick the consumer into buying your cheap derivative product instead of what he intended&quot;, then I think it would only be considered &quot;valid&quot; by marketers.</p>

		<p>@Aaargh:</p>
<p>The stores around me will do things like make a shelf with:</p>
<p>[name brand] [store brand] [name brand]</p>
<p>all of the same sort of thing. Then they&#8217;ll put the store brand version on fire. I almost got caught by that a couple times before I started expecting it.</p>

		<p>At the moment, there&#8217;s one movie studio that specialises in producing low-budget, IMDB-rated-below-4, direct-to-DVD movies that could, in a dim light, be mistaken for the latest blockbuster.</p>
<p>That studio is &quot;The Asylum&quot;:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asylum" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Asylum</a></p>
<p>High points of their output (as far as the titles go, at least) include:</p>
<p>&quot;Snakes on a Train&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Transmorphers&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;Alien Vs Hunter&quot;</p>
<p>And, for some reason released <em>before</em> the upcoming Will Smith version of &quot;I Am Legend&quot;:</p>
<p>&quot;I Am Omega&quot;</p>
<p>I, personally, feel that titles this close to those of real movies are only permissible for hard-core pornography. Regrettably, the depth of plotting and quality of production we&#8217;ve come to expect from porn is seldom to be found in The Asylum&#8217;s productions.</p>
<p>(Could be worse, though. Could be Uwe Boll.)</p>

		<p>Given that the store brands are usually just relabelled versions of the named brands (at least, this is true here in the UK), I think I&#8217;ll just take the cheaper store brand version most times, thank you.</p>

		<p>@myself: &quot;Then they&#8217;ll put the store brand version on fire.&quot;</p>
<p>On fire? Where the heck did that come from? In case it&#8217;s not clear from context, that should have said they&#8217;d put the store brand on *sale*.</p>

		<p>In Australia there&#8217;s a popular gardening product called &#8216;Weed and Feed&#8217;. A few years back, a cheaper import called &#8216;Feed and Weed&#8217; hit the market.</p>

		<p>Re: Store brands.</p>
<p>In some cases, store brands are the relabeled versions of the name brands. The factories quality-check each batch of product. The products with lower quality are labeled as the store brand, and the higher quality products are labeled as the name brand.</p>
<p>In other cases, store brands are prepared by a company that specialized in &quot;generics&quot;. A single factory might produce the same product for a dozen different stores.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
