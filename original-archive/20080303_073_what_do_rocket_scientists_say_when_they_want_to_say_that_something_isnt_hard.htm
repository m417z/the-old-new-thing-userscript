		<p>My friend and I now say &quot;it&#8217;s not quantum mechanics!&quot; after I failed my Electronic Systems Engineering degree by not being able to understand that particular subject (and therefore unable to complete the Semiconductors and Optical Electronics courses).</p>
<p>I transferred to Computing Science instead, which I did complete.</p>

		<p>What they should really say is, &quot;It&#8217;s not open-heart surgery!&quot;</p>
<p>It turns out that brain surgery is just a guy poking around with a stick mostly. Many times the patient isn&#8217;t even asleep.</p>
<p>Open-heart surgery, on the other hand, is extremely complicated and difficult. Many times it requires making the patient technically dead, coordinating many different people and machines.</p>

		<p>I dated a female rocket scientist once. &nbsp;This question, Raymond, is not the way to win a rocket scientist&#8217;s heart. &nbsp;Also, if I had to venture a guess, it would be:</p>

		<p>A few years ago, an American pundit was being interviewed on BBC radio news about some slightly technical issue &#8212; maybe WMD, or air transport security?</p>
<p>&quot;You don&#8217;t have to be a rocket scientist &#8211; although actually I am one &#8211; to see that &#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>Thus scooping the opportunity, surely desired by anyone with a technical education, to use that phrase on national radio.</p>

		<p>I think of &quot;rocket surgery&quot; as repairing a rocket, such as astronauts do on the ISS (using rocket loosely). &nbsp;That&#8217;s a lot harder than rocket science. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve heard it used in practice as repairing a system while it is in use. &nbsp;Consider repairing the atmosphere system on a space craft while you still want to breathe.</p>
<p>&quot;Brain science&quot; is understanding how the brain works. &nbsp;IMHO, that&#8217;s an order of magnitude harder than brain surgery.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
