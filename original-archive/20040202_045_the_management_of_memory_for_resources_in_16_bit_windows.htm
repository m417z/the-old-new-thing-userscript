<p><a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/30/65013.aspx">In a previous entry I threatened to discuss the way resources were managed in 16-bit Windows.</p>
<p>In 16-bit Windows, resources were not loaded until explicitly requested.   </p>
<ul>
<li>The FindResource function located the entry for the resource in the resource directory and returned it in the form of a HRSRC.   </li>
<li>The LoadResource function took that resource handle, allocated some movable memory (HGLOBAL), and loaded the referenced resources off the disk into that memory.   </li>
<li>The LockResource function took that global handle and locked it, returning a pointer to the resource bytes themselves.   </li>
<li>The UnlockResource function unlocked the global handle.   </li>
<li>The FreeResource function freed the memory that had been allocated to hold the resource. </li>
</ul>
<p>Actually, it was more complicated than this. Additional bookkeeping ensure that if two people tried to load the same resource, the same memory block got used for both, and the FreeResource didn't actually free the memory until the reference count went back to zero.</p>
<p>Actually, it was even more complicated than this. If the resource was marked DISCARDABLE, then the memory wasn't actually freed when the reference count dropped to zero. Instead, the global handle was marked as discardable (GMEM_DISCARDABLE), so the handle remained valid, but when the system came under memory pressure, the memory behind the handle would get freed, and the next time you did a LoadResource, it would get reloaded from disk.</p>
<p>So now you know what that DISCARDABLE keyword in resource files means. Or at least what it used to mean. Win32 doesn't do any of this; the DISCARDABLE flag is ignored but remains for compatibility. </p>

		<p>Raymond &#8211; love your blog!  Thanks for all your valuable information, I find it most refreshing.</p>
<p>Out of curiosity, I was wondering what your take would be &#8211; from a technical standpoint &#8211; on removing 16-bit compatibility from next-gen versions of Windows.  Do you believe this would increase performance in the OS, or make it more stable and secure? </p>
<p>In general, would a move like that be more helpful or harmful to Windows from a purely technical standpoint?</p>

		<p>So in Win32, LoadResource just basically returns a pointer, and LockResource, UnlockResource, and FreeResource are pretty much no-ops, right?</p>

		<p>Norman &#8211; Yeah, that&#8217;s pretty close to what I&#8217;m talking about.  I&#8217;m guessing that since Win64 doesn&#8217;t seem to suffer from any problems from the lack of Win16 support, Win32 wouldn&#8217;t either.  Nice to know :)</p>

		<p>Hi Raymond. After your recent entry on programmers using incorrect calling conventions(<a target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/15/58973.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/15/58973.aspx</a>), I had to laugh when I read this prototype on MSDN:</p>
<p>int WinMain(</p>
<p>    HINSTANCE hInstance,<br />
<br />    HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,<br />
<br />    LPSTR lpCmdLine,<br />
<br />    int nCmdShow<br />
<br />);</p>
<p>Something missing!?</p>

		<p>Jack: &quot;Try it and see&quot;.  And if you did, you&#8217;d find that LockResource does do something. FindResource returns a resource handle, and LockResource turns it into a pointer. But UnlockResource and FreeResource don&#8217;t do anything any more.</p>
<p>Mike: From a technical standpoint, I would be overjoyed if Win16 support were finally to go away. It would significant reduce attack surface, since there&#8217;s an awful lot of code which exists solely to support Win16. But from a practical standpoint, the world is not ready to abandon Win16 yet (alas).</p>

		<p>Very late message I know, but I wanted to comment on the &quot;LockResource turns it into a pointer&quot;.  When I stepped through the disassembly of LockResource, all it did was pass back the passed in value unverified and unaltered.  In other words the code for LockResource could be written as&#8211;</p>
<p>    MOV    EAX, [hResData]<br />
<br />    RET</p>
<p>So, at least on Win32, you could get rid of LockResource calls altogether by simply typecasting the passed in HGLOBAL to a pointer.  Of course this isn&#8217;t advisable for code that&#8217;s meant to run on other platforms (Win64 or, shudder, Win16) but if you&#8217;re bent on performance, it&#8217;s worth knowing.</p>

		<p>I challenge you to find any scenario where the extra memory access is even measureable in a real-world program. If you&#8217;re looking for performance improvements, this is the wrong place to optimize.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
