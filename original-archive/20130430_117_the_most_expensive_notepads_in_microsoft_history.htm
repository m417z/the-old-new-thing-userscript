<p>Many years ago, I visited the office of a colleague who worked on Internet Explorer in order to work on some problem or other. As we investigated the issue, we took notes on a 5"&times;7" tear-off notepad which bore the logo <i>Forms&sup3;</i>.</p>
<p> My colleague then pointed out to me that we were taking notes on the most expensive notepads in Microsoft history. </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.ericvasilik.com/2006/07/ie-trident-easter-eggs.html"> <i>Forms&sup3;</i></a> (pronounced "forms-cubed") was the code name for the project that was the precursor to <i>Trident</i>, the layout engine that powers Internet Explorer. As I recall the story as it was told to me, project management thought it would be cool to have custom notepads made for their project. The people responsible for converting this idea into reality designed a logo, laid it out, and found a vendor to produce the notepads. But there was some sort of misunderstanding (maybe the asked for too many colors? didn't order enough notepads to trigger the bulk discount?), and the price for the notepads ended up being something ridiculous like $10 for a 50-page notepad. </p>
<p> That's how the most expensive notepads in Microsoft history came to be. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: Oh, by the way, the word "precursor" I used up there? Yeah, that was a euphemism for "cancelled (but used as a learning opportunity)." Microsoft engineers are fond of black humor when it comes to software (especially software made by Microsoft) as a way of coping with adversity, and after the Forms&sup3; project was cancelled, there was a subculture of engineers who morbidly called it <i>Forms tubed</i>. </p>

		<p>I thought Forms^3 was the forms package used by Office of that era. Perhaps it was designed for Access, but also used in Excel and Word. Are you saying that there was an effort to take that and use it as a browser rendering engine? Or something else I didn&#39;t get?</p>

		<p>@Gabe, I think the forms for Office was Forms2, and Forms3 is actually Trident.</p>
<p>If you run MSHTMPAD in WACK, its titlebar says &quot;Forms3 Trident&quot;</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve worked on three different projects at MS with the codename &#39;Trident&#39; it&#39;s pretty popular for some reason.</p>

		<p>I was expecting some convoluted story about how you spent thousands of dollars to acquire some product or company and the only thing of salvageable value was the notepads. Perhaps you should make that a stretch goal.</p>

		<p>Forms^3 was designed for Sterling, the follow-on to Access. &nbsp;I thought it did ship in the MS Query designer and some of the Office for Mac stuff. &nbsp;It rolled pretty directly into Trident but at one point I was working on a prototype of adding Forms3 support to msdev c++ designers and switched to Trident since they were more up to date than what we could get for Forms^3. &nbsp;I think it was Forms3 because it merged three technologies that were under development; there was a Windows layout engine, Forms^2 and another one in Office and Forms^3 was going to be the one single unified presentation technology that everyone was committed to moving to&#8230; oh wait&#8230; maybe it&#39;s just another layout/presentation technology in addition the ones before and the ones that come after&#8230; &nbsp;Only Adam Bosworth really knows and maybe he&#39;s blocking it.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
