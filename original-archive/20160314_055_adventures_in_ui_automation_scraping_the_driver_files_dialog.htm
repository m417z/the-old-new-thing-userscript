If you go to Device Manager,
then view the Properties of a device node,
and then go to the <i>Driver</i> tab and
click <i>Driver Details</i>,
you get a dialog box with a list of driver files,
and when you click each file, you get information about it.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, this dialog does not have a <i>Copy</i> button
to copy the information to the clipboard.
This means that when somebody on the hardware team asks you
for the driver information,
you have to manually copy down all the drivers and versions.
</p>
<p>
And by "you" I mean "me".
</p>
<p>
As the joke goes,
a programmer is someone who will
<a HREF="https://www.bing.com/search?q=%22a+programmer+is+someone+who+will+spend%22">
spend six months writing a computer program to save 45 minutes
of work</a>.
(<a HREF="http://xkcd.com/1205/">Obligatory XKCD</a>.)
</p>
<p>
I'm a programmer.
Let's start.
</p>
<pre>
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Linq;
using System.Windows.Automation;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

static class AutomationElementHelpers
{
 public static AutomationElement
 FindChildById(this AutomationElement parent, int id)
 {
  return parent == null ? null :
   parent.FindFirst(
    TreeScope.Children,
    new PropertyCondition(AutomationElement.AutomationIdProperty,
                          id.ToString()));
 }

 public static IEnumerable&lt;AutomationElement&gt;
 EnumChildrenOfControlType(this AutomationElement parent, ControlType type)
 {
  return parent == null ? Enumerable.Empty()
                        : parent.FindAll(TreeScope.Children,
   new PropertyCondition(AutomationElement.ControlTypeProperty,
                         type)).Cast&lt;AutomationElement&gt;();
    }
}
</pre>
<p>
The <code>Find&shy;Child&shy;By&shy;Id</code> method
looks for a child item with a specific automation ID.
</p>
<p>
The <code>Enum&shy;Children&shy;Of&shy;Control&shy;Type</code>
returns all the children of an automation element with
the specified control type.
</p>
<p>
The last little helper thingie I need is a p/invoke.
</p>
<pre>
static class Win32
{
 [DllImport("user32.dll", EntryPoint = "FindWindow", SetLastError = true)]
 static extern public System.IntPtr
 FindWindowByName(System.IntPtr MustBeZero, string name);
}
</pre>
<p>
Technically, I didn't need this helper function;
I could have used
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/10/13/10564164.aspx">
<code>Automation&shy;Element&shy;Helpers.Find</code></a>,
but going straight for the window by title is faster because avoids
the full search of the automation tree.
</p>
<p>
Now let's
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/08/04/9856634.aspx">
snap some blocks together</a>.
</p>
<pre>
class Program
{
 [System.STAThread]
 public static void Main(string[] args)
 {
  // Find the Driver File Details dialog.
  var dialog = AutomationElement.FromHandle(
   Win32.FindWindowByName(IntPtr.Zero, "Driver File Details"));

  // Find the various pieces of the dialog.
  var list = dialog.FindChildById(228);
  var provider = dialog.FindChildById(229);
  var version = dialog.FindChildById(230);
  var copyright = dialog.FindChildById(231);
  var signer = dialog.FindChildById(232);

  // Enumerate and print the list items
  foreach (AutomationElement item in
          list.EnumChildrenOfControlType(ControlType.DataItem))
  {
   System.Console.WriteLine("Driver: {0}", item.Current.Name);

   var pattern = item.GetCurrentPattern(SelectionItemPattern.Pattern)
                 as SelectionItemPattern;
   pattern.Select();

   System.Console.WriteLine("Provider: {0}", provider.Current.Name);
   System.Console.WriteLine("Version: {0}", version.Current.Name);
   System.Console.WriteLine("Copyright: {0}", copyright.Current.Name);
   System.Console.WriteLine("Signer: {0}", signer.Current.Name);
   System.Console.WriteLine();
  }
 }
}
</pre>
<p>
Okay, let's see what just happened.
</p>
<p>
First we find the <i>Driver File Details</i> dialog box
with <code>Find&shy;Window</code>.
As I noted, we could have used
<code>Automation&shy;Element&shy;Helpers.Find</code></a>,
but the <code>Find&shy;Window</code> is much faster because it
doesn't have to search the entire automation tree.
(And I got tired of waiting for the tree search each time I wanted
to test the program.)
</p>
<p>
Once we find the dialog, we locate the important pieces of the dialog
via their automation ID:
</p>
<ul>
<li>The control that has the list of driver files.
<li>The controls that report on the properties of the selected driver file.
</ul>
<p>
Note that automation IDs are not contractual;
they can change at any time.
But then again, automation is not contractual either,
because the user interface can change at any time.
It's handy for little tools like this,
but you have to be aware that the automation may need to be updated
if the user interface changes.
</p>
<p>
We enumerate all the children of the list which say that they are a
data item.
This filter may seem unnecessary to the casual observer,
but it's important,
because a device with a huge number of driver files&mdash;I'm looking
at you, the display driver&mdash;will probably end up showing a scroll
bar, and we don't want to enumerate that.
</p>
<p>
For each item, we select it, and then read out the values for
the provider, version, copyright, and signer.
</p>
<p>
And that's it.
A program to extract the contents of the <i>Driver Files</i> dialog.</p>

		<p>And if it breaks (ref  your recent article &#8220;If what you’re doing is undocumented, it’s not guaranteed to keep working, and your promise not to complain doesn’t really hold water&#8221;) I&#8217;ll complain!</p>
<p>Really, though, as long as people understand the difference between &#8220;helper tools&#8221; and products, these kinds of things are great.  What would also be great is a Copy function in the user interface&#8230; but of course that starts out with -100 points.</p>

		<p>The great source of positive &#8220;points&#8221; for a feature like this is the support team.  Even if the &#8220;Copy&#8221; button&#8217;s UI doesn&#8217;t get surfaced in the product UI, being able to tell a customer &#8220;OK, now press ++C, now open an email to me, click in the body, press +V and send me the email&#8221; is a great support feature.  I&#8217;ve added a &#8220;copy&#8221; feature to the &#8220;About&#8221; box on every product I&#8217;ve worked on.  Visual Studio did the same maybe a half dozen versions ago.<br />
The mostly hidden &#8220;copy&#8221; feature on plain-vanilla message boxes is similar to what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>

		<p>Up through Windows XP i could copy my application&#8217;s version number right out of the File Properties dialog box. With Windows Vista, the file properties dialog was redesigned around the Windows Property System. Rather than the version number being in a read-only text box, it was an item in a listview.</p>
<p>Intuitively, i would want to right-click the list item and select Copy, but no option exists. I submitted beta feedback during Longhorn, and Windows 7, and Windows 8, and Windows 10. It never happened. </p>
<p>Because Windows 10 is the last version of Windows, where i&#8217;d have to switch my login to a Microsoft Account if i want early access fast push insider builds tick tock, i can&#8217;t ask for it anymore.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not actually true.  There&#8217;s a &#8220;sign in only to this application&#8221; option.  I have it set on two computers at work, where I need to use my domain account, not my Microsoft one.</p>

		<p>This is where I&#8217;d be tempted to use Alt-PrtScn and Ctrl-V and paste the graphical contents into the email rather than manually copy/type the information.</p>
<p>Did the hardware team really need the information in text versus just being able to read it from a bitmap copy of the driver details dialog?</p>

		<p>Since TFS supports bitmaps even in work item history, I&#8217;d also simply use the Snipping Tool, and resort to Raymond&#8217;s method only if there was no other option (we&#8217;d be talking about a hardware team using ancient hardware here). Or someone would have to spring for an OCR utility.</p>

		<p>I tried doing something similar to this to a program that was written with Visual FoxPro. Maybe I did something wrong, but what I found was that none of the controls in the FoxPro application were actually windows controls. I could find the window but then there was nothing in it; no controls to enumerate at all.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s why you use UI Automation rather than FindWindow for everything below the top-level window: Because many apps use windowless controls.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
