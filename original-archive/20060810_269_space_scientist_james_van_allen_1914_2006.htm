<p>Discoverer of the Van Allen radiation belts and one of the TIME magazine men of the year for 1960 <a href="http://www.press-citizen.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060809/NEWS01/60809004/1079"> James Van Allen died yesterday</a>. (What a coincidence. What are the odds that the person to discover the Van Allen radiation belts would <i>also</i> be named Van Allen?)</p>
<p> I never met the man, but I met his granddaughter. She has an amazing facility with languages and became fluent in Japanese after spending a year as an exchange student. Her Japanese was so good that at one point, a girl came up to her and asked, "How do you get your skin so pale?", mistaking her for a native who had undergone some sort of bleaching process to get milky white skin. </p>
<p> That's when you know you've made it. When native speakers mistake you for one of their own who merely has had a lot of cosmetic surgery. </p>
<p> (Whenever we tell this story, she tries to downplay the experience. "Yeah, well, the girl didn't have her glasses on." Like that changes the story in any significant way. Now, if the girl were deaf...) </p>

		<p>That sort of facility with language is amazing, especially for someone who learns it at an older age.</p>
<p>I wonder if she has a near photographic memory for things audio?</p>
<p>My daughter (7) is fluent in 3 languages (without accent) and has a near photographic memory for conversation and audio (even if it is not in a language she knows &#8211; she happily sings songs in languages she doesn&#8217;t know)</p>

		<p>If I&#8217;m not wrong, the Van Allen radiation belts didn&#8217;t have a name before he discovered them. So it&#8217;s not a coincidence that they&#8217;re named the same. :P</p>

		<p>That is so sad! &nbsp;That a person from one cultureal group would assume that another would put effort into changing skin-tones to look like a different ethnic group&#8230;. &nbsp;</p>

  That&#8217;s when you know you&#8217;ve made it. When<br />
  <br />&gt; native speakers mistake you for one of their<br />
  <br />&gt; own who merely has had a lot of cosmetic<br />
  <br />&gt; surgery.</p>
<p>Not always. &nbsp;A few months ago there were several newspaper reports about someone who was arrested for not carrying her passport or alien registration. &nbsp;Japanese don&#8217;t have to carry or have passports and can&#8217;t carry or obtain alien registration, but that doesn&#8217;t matter. &nbsp;She spoke impeccable Japanese too, but that didn&#8217;t matter either. &nbsp;I forgot now if she spent the night in jail or finally got out before midnight, after some maverick in the police department finally obtained information that the arrestee was Japanese.</p>
<p>Of course other kinds of events aren&#8217;t newsworthy because they&#8217;re so common. &nbsp;Like a Peruvian whose grandparents were Chinese but who speaks about 5 words of Chinese and 0 words of Japanese, but Japanese people can&#8217;t stop speaking Japanese to her no matter how many times they&#8217;ve been told that she&#8217;s a Peruvian whose grandparents were Chinese and doesn&#8217;t understand a word of Japanese.</p>
<p>There are also a few Caucasians who are Japanese due to being born to Japanese parents (the parents having been naturalized) and it doesn&#8217;t matter that they speak Japanese impeccably and are Japanese, they get treated as foreigners. &nbsp;Of course Japanese people with darker skin for similar reasons would have it worse, but they don&#8217;t seem to be numerous enough to hear about yet.</p>
<p>&gt; became fluent in Japanese after spending a<br />
  <br />&gt; year as an exchange student</p>
<p>The daughter of some friends also became fluent in Japanese in a year, but she&#8217;s about 4 years old.</p>
<p>When she gets old enough no one will ask how she got her skin so dark, she&#8217;ll just get stopped twice a day and forced to show her alien registration and bicycle registration.

		<p>Norman, funny you mentioned that.</p>
<p>I was stopped by the police and asked for my passport. Of course I have a visa and alien registration card, so I told the officer that I don&#8217;t make it a practice to carry my passport everywhere I go. Then I glared at him a little and asked if I could leave. Sure, no problem, thanks for your time.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say that I recommend walking from Toyocho to Gyotoku at 2 in the morning, though.</p>

<br />Pale skin is considered more attrative to the Japanese eye. It&#8217;s got nothing to do with trying to look like any other ethnic group.</p>

<br />&gt; Wouldn&#8217;t a Japanese girl be different from a<br />
<br />&gt; caucasian(SP?) in more way than just skin<br />
<br />&gt; color &#8211; eye shape, etc?</p>
<p>Around 99.9% are. &nbsp;In other words, not 100%.</p>
<p>But I think the one who was arrested for not having a sufficiently Korean-looking face wasn&#8217;t a descendant of Europeans. &nbsp;Her parents and enough ancestors going back far enough looked like Chinese so they didn&#8217;t get arrested for not carrying alien registration cards. &nbsp;What it was about her appearance that made the arresting officer and some number of other officers sure that she wasn&#8217;t Japanese, maybe only the officers involved know, or maybe it&#8217;s a state secret by now.</p>
<p>As for those who do have a Caucasian parent, there has even been a case of a racist proprietor determining that one sibling would be allowed into his establishment and one sibling wouldn&#8217;t be, on account of their appearance. &nbsp;Actually I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s been more than one case like this, but only one that became famous recently.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
