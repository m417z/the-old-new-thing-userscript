I remember being
<a HREf="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nonplus">
nonplussed</a>
upon reading news reports that some Windows feature or other
was a sure thing,
despite a lack of actual, y'know, official confirmation.
The one that sticks with me is the claim that
<a HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20110709064124/http://www.techguruhere.com/microsoft-planning-128-bit-version-of-windows-8/">
there would be a 128-bit version of Windows 8</a>.
The source for this information was a remark in somebody's
LinkedIn profile,
which I'm sure is completely reliable,
because nobody lies in their LinkedIn profile.
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20100306182617/http://blog.eightforums.com/windows-8-news/windows-8-x128-the-next-pc-revolution-has-is-begun">
One group</a>
<a HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20100305073830/http://blog.eightforums.com/windows-8-news/exclusive-interview-with-robert-morgan-about-128-bit">
claims to have lined up an exclusive interview
with the elusive Robert Morgan</a>,
although the interview never appears to have taken place.
</p>
<p>
Not only was the profile fake,
it was fakified
<a HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20091231091622/http://msftkitchen.com/2009/11/128-bit-kernel-support-in-windows-8-and-windows-9-a-big-fat-lie.html">
by the people who "discovered" it</a>.
</p>
<p>
Another example is the article
<a HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20100325110501/http://www.techradar.com/news/software/operating-systems/8-things-you-need-to-know-about-windows-8-643699">
8 things you need to know about Windows 8</a>,
which says
"But there are some things we do know."
And then a few paragraphs later, they admit that everything they know
is from job ads and LinkedIn profiles,
so y'know, totally reliable.
</p>
<p>
And then there's
<a HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/blog/microsoft/is-silverlight-for-iphone-finally-on-its-way/6350">
this article</a>,
which is 100% speculation.
"I'm thinking if such an announcement happens,
it'll be Silverlight for the iPhone."
The basis for this claim is a tweet from somebody guessing
that Steve Ballmer will announce Silverlight for iPhone at the
WWDC Keynote,
which is double-speculation, since Ballmer's purported appearance
was itself just wild speculation
(that
<a HREF="http://www.engadget.com/2010/05/27/debunk-steve-ballmer-not-speaking-at-wwdc/">
turned out to be false</a>).
After considering the feasibility of such an announcement
the article ends,
"What do you think?
Could the rumors be true?"
</p>
<p>
I have to admit, I really admire that.
The article makes up a rumor,
and then asks, "Is it true?"
Hey, here's an idea:
"No it isn't, because you just made it up."
</p>
<p>
Today is P. T. Barnum's birthday.
Or at least the day people <i>claim</i> to be his birthday.

		<p>On the rumor about Windows 8 128-bit version,  I wonder if it got its start from InterlockedCompareExchange128  <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh972640(v=vs.85)" rel="nofollow">https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh972640(v=vs.85)</a>.aspx</p>
<p>The minimum supported Windows version is 8 for those functions. Someone may have seen that Windows now has 128-bit atomic compare exchange and and interpreted that is relating somehow to a 128 bit version of Windows.</p>

		<p>I think it&#8217;s a bit of a strech, considering that anyone using InterlockedCompareExchange128 would probably know what cmpxchg16b is. Or maybe they were so happy that the 8TB limit is bumped up and got confused.</p>

		<p>Tomorrow on the news: Raymond Chen, official Microsoft representative, has announced that the next update for Windows will contain an iPhone emulator written in Silverlight.  Source: this article that used the words &#8220;iPhone&#8221;, &#8220;Silverlight&#8221;, and &#8220;true&#8221;.</p>

		<p>Also, 128-bit was just delayed and now appears for real. Raymond Chen, long-time employee at Microsoft, who also had the power to write the blue screen text, mentioned it in one of his articles in his blog about Windows.</p>

		<p>Some of the funniest are when Microsoft has an event on product &#8220;x&#8221; and doesn&#8217;t mention prodyct &#8220;y&#8221;. There will always be several articles decrying the demise of product &#8220;y&#8221; because Microsoft didn&#8217;t talk about it, and that means it&#8217;s been cancelled.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
