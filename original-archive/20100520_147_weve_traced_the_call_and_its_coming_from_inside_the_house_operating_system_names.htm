<p>
As the Windows Server 2003 project wound down,
somebody reported a serious bug that went something like this:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>Subject</b>: Windows Server 2003 still refers to itself as Windows .NET Server<br>
</p>
<p>
Previous versions of Windows report the product name correctly,
but Windows Server 2003 still calls itself "Windows .NET Server"
instead of Windows Server 2003.
</p>
<pre>
// on Windows XP
C:\&gt; osver
Windows XP

// on Windows 2000
C:\&gt; osver
Windows 2000 Professional

// on Windows 2000 Server
C:\&gt; osver
Windows 2000 Server

// on Windows NT 4 SP3
C:\&gt; osver
Windows NT 4 SP3 Workstation

// but on Windows Server 2003
C:\&gt; osver
Windows .NET Server
</pre>
<p>
I've attached a copy of the <code>osver</code> program
you can use to reproduce the problem.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Indeed, if you run the <code>osver</code> program attached to the
bug report, it does report <code>Windows .NET Server</code> when
run on Windows Server&nbsp;2003.
Now to find out where
<code>osver</code> gets the product name from,
so we can find and fix it.
</p>
<p>
The customer was kind enough to include the source code to the
<code>osver</code> program, and we found some code in that program
that gave away the root of the problem:
</p>
<pre>
...
if (osv.dwMajorVersion == 5 &amp;&amp;
    osv.dwMinorVersion == 2) {
 printf("Windows .NET Server\n");
}
...
</pre>
<p>
When we pointed this out to the bug submitter,
we received a simple but gracious reply:
</p>
<p>
"Oops. Sorry about that."</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
