The first time I saw them, I thought the first one was a cow and the
second one was a goldfish. But apparently they're a cat and a dog.

<p>
I never understood the need for these emoticons in the first place.
If you need to add a smiley face to indicate that you're joking,
then you need to work on your delivery.</p>

		<p>I think emoticon usage tends to change based on the generation; I&#8217;m 19 and tend to use them to differentiate between seriousness and lightheartedness (consider &quot;Bye.&quot; versus &quot;Bye :-)&quot;), while my 14-year-old sister seems to use things like &quot;lol&quot; and &quot;cya&quot; more than I would and emoticons less.</p>

		<p>Emoticons are very useful when the conversation has to cross cultural or language barriers. When you try to be funny in a language you don&#8217;t speak well, emoticons are some kind of insurance that nobody will take you seriously when you didn&#8217;t mean to.</p>

		<p>Speaking of generations, i&#8217;m neither an &#8216;early-teen&#8217; nor an &#8216;elder-teen&#8217;, rather a &#8216;very-post-teen&#8217;, the kind who even remembers the dark ages when people didn&#8217;t have cell phones or, wait&#8230; Internet connections ! :-)<br />
Does it explain why I&#8217;ve never seen these icons before and wonder where you guys have seen them ?</p>

		<p>I think the main thing about emoticons, as compared to working on your delivery, is that it&#8217;s unambigously smartass, as opposed to smartass by means of delivery.  This also works for cases where you are on an open forum and wish to avoid being trolled by somebody choosing to ignore the sarcasm and take you literally true.</p>
<p>This leads into a funny work story where people were sending &quot;scull&quot; icons back and forth during a bug session, at least partially to jokingly assign blame.</p>

		<p>Also not pre- or elder-teen, more of a minor adult (27 yrs old). I also remember the time where a cell-phone meant you&#8217;d have to drag your car around with you and &#8216;Internet&#8217; was something no-one ever heard of. Still, as soon as I started using e-mail I started using emoticons. Granted I generally only use :-) and ;-) and :-( (although I must confess with MSN Messenger I use more, just because I like the nice gx :-) ) &lt;&#8211; See, there is one!!<br />
I use it to convey emotion using writing, where in a normal conversation you could read it from my face. If I make a joke IRL you&#8217;d see me smile, but with an e-mail it&#8217;s not possible to tell the meaning behind the remark.<br />
I must confess I have no idea where a cat and a dog can be useful for. And why MSN Messenger features a devil (6), but no angel (aside from the smiley with the halo).</p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>Is the only way to find out if you&#8217;re in &quot;full screen&quot; mode to install a WH_SHELL hook and examine the WINDOWACTIVATED messages.  Is there no simpler way to query?</p>

		<p>I use the dog/cat emoticons with my partner, to mean &quot;thanks a lot, that&#8217;s great of you&quot;. Because they&#8217;re so cute, the image is like making puppy-dog eyes when asking for something. For ex<br />
Me: I was sick this weekend, so I don&#8217;t have the updated help files for the release today<br />
Him: That&#8217;s ok, I was out partying so I slacked off work too<br />
Me: (dog) thanks man</p>
<p>But on the subject of smileys, I see a generational thing happening now that I read boards where high school aged kids frequent (I&#8217;m 31 btw). My generation uses :) style smileys, while the young &#8216;uns favor the ^_^ style, which I personally can&#8217;t stand. ;)</p>

		<p>I recently found some websites from 13 year olds. The language is terrible. We use normal english with some abbreviations and some smileys. Th3y L1K3 T0 T4Lk L1K3 Th1s. I can&#8217;t read half of it. Oh and on my webiste I put an e-mail address to people can mail me. They put up a MSN Messenger handle (which _is_ an e-mail address) so someone can &#8216;MSN&#8217; them.</p>

		<p>Try to figure this one out: type (?) into messenger and you get a question mark in a circle with ASL below it.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;d be kinda nice if MSN had IntelliSmiley, to transfer your ‘:)’ into a smiley after you&#8217;ve typed it.  That way you could vet your comment before sending it. </p>
<p>The (R) catches me out every time, most times when I&#8217;m facetiously saying something like ‘IntelliSmiley(R)’ :)  Causes many a strange looks, especially when MSN’ing my work mates.</p>

		<p>Yeah.. I usually write (?) in e-mails and such if I&#8217;m not quite sure if what I write is true. Would be nice if the nice people at MSN changed (?) to be something more like the question-mark icon in the MessageBox API, and created something like (ASL) for that perv-emoticon :P</p>

		<p>My biggest problem with smilies is that I almost always use them after funny, *ironic* comments. The problem is that I put comments between parenthesesis (how do I spell that? :o)) and then the problem with the closing parenthesis occurs.</p>
<p>Of course there is the solution to do a left-handed smiley &quot;(-:&quot;, but that makes it harder to read, as the reader usually does not expect such a character combination.</p>
<p>As was pointed out earlier too is software that replaces for example &quot;:-)&quot; with a picture. This can screw up code seriously, but also limits the creativity with, for example, noses &quot;:o)&quot;, &quot;:^)&quot;, &quot;:-)&quot;, eyes &quot;:-)&quot;, &quot;8-)&quot;, &quot;;-)&quot;, &quot;|-)&quot;, length &quot;:)&quot;, &quot;:-)&quot;&#8230;</p>

		<p>What most annoys me in MSN Messenger is the parentheses-smileys, like when you write &quot;y=f(x)&quot; and get the argument transformed into a boy, or a girl, or whatever, I don’t remember. I wonder if web forums were already using graphical emoticons when MSNM was being designed. Many forums have  the :some_word: form for non-obvious smileys, this is substantially less ambiguous, although it can cause trouble with C++ namespaces :)</p>
<p>Anybody remembers what this one was supposed to mean? :)<br />
O C=}%~^~{F~=-</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
