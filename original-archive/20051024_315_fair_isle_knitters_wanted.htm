<p>The National Trust of Scotland has <a href="http://www.fairisle.org.uk/property.htm"> two houses to let on the island of Fair Isle</a>, population: 65. The two properties are available at a very reasonable rate of only &pound;300. Per year. Although the National Trust does not promise a job, it points out that there are skill shortages in construction and <a href="http://www.shetland-museum.org.uk/collections/textiles/fair_isle_knitting.htm"> knitting</a>. <a href="http://www.fairisle.org.uk/fairislecrafts/index.htm"> The knitting cooperative</a> apparently has more orders than it can fill. (<a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4866217">You can listen to the entire story and find a link to the original advertisement on NPR's web site</a>.)</p>
<p> (Alas, <a href="http://heritage.scotsman.com/news.cfm?id=2084032005"> the deadline for applications has passed</a>. That NPR story led to <a href="http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2-1837094,00.html"> an avalanche of interest from the United States</a>, mostly from knitters.) </p>
<p> This story reminded me that my friend <a href="http://spaces.msn.com/members/thewendyhouse/"> Wendy</a> made money on the side in her younger days doing hand knitting. I wonder how many people bought a lovely English hand-knitted sweater imagining it having been created by a sweet old lady in a rocking chair, when in fact it was done by a fifteen-year-old girl with a shaved head and an attitude while sitting in front of the telly watching <i><a href="http://www.ultimatedallas.com/">Dallas</a></i>. </p>

		<p>With Rayomnd,  I went to see the film &quot;The Corporation&quot;,  an excellent film that uses DSM IV (Diagnositcs and Statistics Manual IV &#8211; used by psychistricst as criteria for diagnosing mental illness) to analyse the behaviour of &#8216;Corporations&#8217; and concludes that thy are &#8216;Psyncotic&#8217;</p>
<p>He sat next to me knitting in the prelude to the film.  I didnt notice if he managed to knit throughout the film.  Admittedly there was something a bit &#8216;Unique&#8217; about the whole experience.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s easier to knit when there are not cats nearby to chew your needles.  So I can empathise with taking your knitting out of the house&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
