<p>Today is Election Day in the United States. Don't forget to vote. (Void where prohibited.) In honor of Election Day, I figured I'd tell a story about voting.</p>
<p> One of the complimentary beverages available in Microsoft kitchens is <a href="http://www.v8juice.com/v8.aspx?ProductID=2469"> Spicy Hot V-8</a>. (Sure it's tasty, but watch out for <a href="http://www.johnisfit.com/2008/01/15/rethinking-the-v8/"> the sodium content</a>!) </p>
<p> I remember well when Spicy Hot V-8 was added to the refrigerators. At the 1992 Company Meeting, Bill Gates and then-head of HR <a href="http://www.presidentmurray.com/"> Mike Murray</a> appeared on stage to read questions submitted by employees ahead of time. One of the questions was "Can we carry Spicy Hot V-8 in the kitchens?" </p>
<p> Mike Murray decided to put the matter to a voice vote. </p>
<p> The measure "passed" overwhelmingly. </p>
<p> Spicy Hot V-8 appeared in the kitchens the next morning. </p>

		<p>&quot;One of the complimentary beverages available in Microsoft kitchens is Spicy Hot V-8. (Sure it&#8217;s tasty, but watch out for the sodium content!)&quot;</p>
<p>Not only the sodium content but the gas content! I used to occasionally drink v-8 juice in college and one morning the pressure became too great and I was forced to release my &quot;nuclear bomb&quot; the whole class heard it, I never lived it down and I never drank any V-8 juice ever again. I just eat regular ole veggies now a days&#8230;</p>

		<p>Hey! &nbsp;I was there and I don&#8217;t remember it this way. &nbsp;My recollection is that Mike Murray asked us &quot;what you would rather have, Spicy V-8 or Low Sodium V-8?&quot; and then &quot;all for Spicy V-8, cheer now!&quot; and then &quot;all for Low Sodium, cheer now&quot;. &nbsp;We then voted by volume.</p>
<p>Spicy wins! ;)</p>
<p>I voted for Spicy myself!</p>

		<p>The problem is that now I&#8217;d much rather have low-sodium, and we don&#8217;t got it. :(</p>

		<p>The memory of that vote is etched into my brain &#8211; Spicy or Low-Sodium. 99% of the people who voiced their opinion that fateful day never drank V-8 from the MS kitchens. You could tell a mile away. Those who cared about the decision got drowned out by a bunch of loud, rowdy douchebags who could care less about what&#8217;s in that section of the refreshment cooler. It&#8217;s not in the same section as the Coke/Diet Coke so they probably never even knew the kitchen had V-8 (not the Google Javascript VM). I rue that vote, that day, that month, that year. That was my last company meeting.</p>
<p>[It had nothing to do with the fact that I caught on to the &#8216;pattern&#8217; of the meeting and could predict what would happen &#8211; except for the product demos]</p>
<p>Everytime I walked into an MS kitchen for a drink, the perennial almost-full section of Spicy V-8 cans taunted me, made me burn up inside. I don&#8217;t think they ever refilled the Spicy V-8 section unless it was due to all the cans expiring.</p>
<p>Mike Murray sucks. Microsoft management sucks.</p>
<p>Low-sodium FOREVER!!!</p>
<p>Signed,</p>
<p>Grumpy old developer who never forgets.</p>

		<p>Wow Grumpy, you really are grumpy. &nbsp;I thought that was a cool story about making things happen even in a large company (which I&#8217;m sure it was even in 92).</p>

		<p>The more I get to know Bill Gates &#8211; well I don&#8217;t really know him, but you know -, the more I appreciate him. Heck, I also liked the commercials he did with Seinfeld. They were different, and in this day and age of formats, that alone is enough for me.</p>

<p>That is the flaw of a pure democracy: mob rule.</p>

		<p>Sodium isn&#8217;t usually an issue unless you&#8217;re someone sensitive to it. For most people the actual reasonable limit is ~10,000mg/day.</p>

		<p>Never seen the &quot;spicy hot&quot; one in 34, 9, 10, or 40 &#8211; always the regular one. It&#8217;s better than the other cans fruity sugar though!</p>
<p>Pour two cans into a cup and microwave &#8211; makes a decent snack of soup in the afternoon. Tobasco and pepper are optional.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
