<p>Okay, somebody handed me a NCAA Men's Basketball Bracket to fill out. I don't know squat about college sports, so I decided that I would fill in the bracket based on the following simple principle: The school whose President (or Chancellor) has served longer will win the match-up. (Not counting the first-round games of the top five seeds in each bracket, just to avoid some wild upsets.)</p>
<p> At least I thought that was simple. Filling out the bracket given this rule turns out to be rather difficult, because I have yet to find a web site that has links to all the schools represented in this year's tournament. (I guess college athletics isn't about the academics, because if it were, then certainly people would be falling over themselves to extol the fantastic educational opportunities at the schools represented.) </p>
<p> And it's not exactly easy to figure out the school's web site from the bracket sheet. There is for example a team labelled simply "Texas". Do I want "The University of Texas at Austin"? Do I want "The University of Texas at Dallas"? Do I want "The University of Texas at Arlington"? "Texas State University"? "Texas College"? I'm guessing it's the University of Texas at Austin, though I might be wrong. </p>
<p> And then there's another box labelled "California". Which of the many California schools is that supposed to be? I don't even know what question to enter into a search engine to find out. (Turns out it's the University of California at Berkeley.) </p>
<p> Even after I hunt around to figure out which of the dozen universities named "Texas" I think I really want, I then have to find out who their President is and when they assumed office. Finding the President's page (or Chancellor's page) sometimes takes work, and even if you find it, it's sometimes wrong. For example, the first thing that I noticed on the page for Syracuse University's <a href="http://www.syr.edu/chancellor/"> Chancellor Nancy Cantor</a> is that it says "Learn about Chancellor-Elect Nancy Cantor". (If you don't see that phrase on the page, turn on your screen reader or disable images, or just hover over the "Inside the Chancellor's Site" link.) </p>
<p> "Well, great," I thought. "She's Chancellor-Elect, but who's the <strong>current</strong> chancellor?" </p>
<p> Turns out that Nancy Cantor <strong>is</strong> the current chancellor. She was inaugurated two years ago. The "Chancellor-Elect" text is badly out of date. </p>
<p> Even when I can find the site of the university's President/Chancellor it's sometimes quite a bit of work to find out when they took office. For example, go back to Nancy Cantor's page and try to figure out when she was inaugurated. You have to click on "Soul of Syracuse", then go to the News page, then scroll down to the article titled, "Amid grand community celebration, conversation and art, SU inaugurates Cantor as 11th Chancellor and President", click through to the article and read the dateline. </p>
<p> November 5, 2004. </p>
<p> That was a lot of work for a tiny bit of information that you think would be easily accessible on a biography page. Good luck finding the home page of the president of Utah State University; and if you manage to find the date at which he became president, then I tip my hat to you, because as far as I can tell they don't list that information on their web site. </p>
<p> (By the way, according to my highly scientific method, the final game between Villanova and George Washington University will be extremely close, with GWU eking out a victory by just two months, August 1, 1988 to October 5, 1988.) </p>

		<p>To determine what school California or Texas is refering to you can go to a site like Cbssportsline. &nbsp;Open the bracket and click on the what school you want to research. &nbsp;For example, when you click on California it opens up the stats for that team and it also includes the team&#8217;s mascot. &nbsp;For California it is the Golden Bears. &nbsp;Once you know the school&#8217;s name and mascot it will make you rsearch for the school&#8217;s website a whole lot easier. &nbsp;As university chancellors &#8211; these links might help: &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chancellors_and_other_leaders_of_US_universities" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_chancellors_and_other_leaders_of_US_universities</a> and this page maybe helpful to determine the websites for some of the Universities <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.utexas.edu/world/univ/state/" rel="nofollow">http://www.utexas.edu/world/univ/state/</a></p>

		<p>The usual logic of names is that California or Texas means &quot;The University of&quot;. Good luck if California and UCLA meet as we have the same head guy. I know there&#8217;s both a president and a chancellor, but I don&#8217;t know which is which.</p>

		<p>Raymond. . . &nbsp;You&#8217;re complaining because of ambiguity in the search process? &nbsp;Hmmmmph. &nbsp;Kids! We used to have to go down to the quarry, mine some rocks, build a library, get some more rocks, carve them, and then read the rocks to get any information.</p>

		<p>Miles, to add to your comment, the state name is usually given to the flagship school, i.e., the first campus in the system. In California&#8217;s case, Berkeley was the first campus in the UC system, hence California.</p>

		<p>Wikipedia is indeed an exelecent resource for this, but instead of the URL above, find the article on the individial school, for ex <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Texas</a>, which gives the president (William C. Powers, stated as being in since 2006-2-1 in his article) in the sidebar, the fact that it&#8217;s often called just &quot;Texas&quot; in the first paragraph. &nbsp;If that wasn&#8217;t enough, it also gives the mascot and colours in the sidebar.<br />
<br />Oh, and it also seems to indicate it has a good basketball team; you might want to rethink your system.</p>

		<p>Guess I should have provide a link to the bracket I was talking about on CBS Sportsline. &nbsp;You are correct that the viewable bracket does not provide links to the school info. &nbsp; Here are the instructions to get the the page I was talking about:</p>
<p>1) Go to <a href="http://www.cbssportsline.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.cbssportsline.com</a><br />
<br />2) On the home page there is a small blue box. &nbsp;The headings says &quot;Brackets&quot;. &nbsp;The links in the box are:<br />
<br />&#8211; Atlanta<br />
<br />&#8211; Washington D.C.<br />
<br />&#8211; Oakland<br />
<br />&#8211; Minneapolis<br />
<br />&#8211; Viewable<br />
<br />&#8211; Printable<br />
<br />&#8211; Women &amp; NIT</p>
<p>The ones you want to click on are the region links (Atlanta, Washington D.C, Oakland, &amp; Minneapolis). &nbsp;Select on of the regions.<br />
<br />3) On the new page you will see the team for whatever region you are in. &nbsp;Select a school.<br />
<br />4) New page will open will school info which includes the school&#8217;s mascot. &nbsp;</p>
<p>To make it even easier, here are links to each region:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/mayhem/brackets/region/south" rel="nofollow">http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/mayhem/brackets/region/south</a></p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/mayhem/brackets/region/east" rel="nofollow">http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/mayhem/brackets/region/east</a></p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/mayhem/brackets/region/west" rel="nofollow">http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/mayhem/brackets/region/west</a></p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/mayhem/brackets/region/midwest" rel="nofollow">http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/mayhem/brackets/region/midwest</a></p>
<p>Anyways, good luck with your bracket. &nbsp;It will be interesting to see how well your method works. &nbsp;Please update us when the tournament is over.<br /></p>

		<p>Hello Raymond,<br />
<br /> &nbsp; I am a student of Syracuse University CS Dept. I think that the tooltip needs to be updated and it is badly outdated, but as soon as you enter you see the WORD CHANCELLOR CANTOR in both Orange and white with her Keynote and signed by her at the bottom. That gives enough hints about who runs the show.<br />
<br /> &nbsp; However I do agree that, the other major question as to when she was elected is totally obscured and buried under all the links and text in that page. I actually clicked Chancellors 1-11 to see if they would give me the date and it only lead to a bunch of broken links.<br />
<br /> &nbsp; So I guess that designers should not only concentrate on making the UI graphically appealing but also easily accessible for the most common operations. So how do we do that any advice for a CS Grad??</p>

		<p>Hey Raymond,<br />
<br /> &nbsp; &nbsp;I get what you mean. How do designers decide upon what content to put on front page and how to design the navigation system.<br />
<br />Btw I think that it will be Syracuse Vs UConn or Boston College Final. </p>

		<p>Hm the bracket I found on CBS Sportsline wasn&#8217;t clickable: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/mayhem/brackets/viewable_men" rel="nofollow">http://cbs.sportsline.com/collegebasketball/mayhem/brackets/viewable_men</a></p>
<p>Neither is the NCAA&#8217;s<br />
<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.ncaasports.com/basketball/mens/brackets/viewable/2006" rel="nofollow">http://www.ncaasports.com/basketball/mens/brackets/viewable/2006</a></p>
<p>Even after I got the team mascots, a search on &quot;Texas Longhorns university&quot; got me sites like <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.texassports.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.texassports.com/</a> which just talks about &quot;The University of Texas&quot; without saying *which one* or having a link back to the school itself.</p>
<p>I considered calling the schools but decided they would consider me a crackpot.</p>
<p>&#8230;</p>
<p>Okay, I just called San Diego State University Office of the President to get the appointment date for President Weber (another school that doesn&#8217;t tell you when the president assumed office). After four minutes on the phone, the best they could come up with was &quot;July 1996&quot;. And that&#8217;s his own office!</p>

		<p>&quot;Wouldn&#8217;t it have been easier to pick up the phone and call the universities?&quot;</p>
<p>I think the point is not what *would* have been easier, but rather what should have been easier.</p>

		<p>Um, English person here. WTF is a bracket?</p>
<p>Both Mirriam-Webster (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/bracket" rel="nofollow">http://www.m-w.com/dictionary/bracket</a>) and dictionary.com (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=bracket" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=bracket</a>) only give meanings I&#8217;m already aware of, and none of them seem to fit whatever the hell it is you&#8217;re all talking about.</p>
<p>The thing that comes closest is &quot;a section of a continuously numbered or graded series (as age ranges or income levels)&quot;, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to quite fit, as you seem to be strictly ordering the items (teams) as opposed to putting them into pre-defined classifications.</p>
<p>Also, what is the point of filling it out? Is it a betting thing? If you get it right you win something? Or what?</p>
<p>/me is confused<br /></p>

		<p>&quot;I can&#8217;t see bitmaps. Browse to that page with images off and you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s practically empty.&quot;</p>
<p>Just wondering what is your reason for turning off images in the browser?</p>

		<p>Don:</p>
<p>Possible reasons include faster load times, less visual clutter, and cutting off adverts. Plus it reduces chances of possible attacks via image decoder bugs.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
