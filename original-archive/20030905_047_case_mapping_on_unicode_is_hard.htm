<p>         Occasionally, I'm asked, "I have to identify strings that are identical, case-insensitively.&nbsp;         How do I do it?"      </p>
<p>         The answer is, "Well, it depends. Whose case-mapping rules do you want to use?"      </p>
<p>         Sometimes the reply is, "I want this to be language-independent."      </p>
<p>         Now you have a real problem.      </p>
<p>         Every locale has its own case-mapping rules. Many of them are in conflict with the         rules for other locales. For example, which of the the following pairs of words compare         case-insensitive equal?      </p>

<li>             no in Turkey, yes in US          </li>
<li>             no in US, yes in Germany          </li>
<li>             no in US, no in Germany, yes in Switzerland! (Though you would likely never see it             written as "Ma&szlig;e" in Switzerland.)          </li>
<li>             yes in France, no in Quebec!          </li>
</ol>
<p>         (And I've heard that the capitalization rules for German are context-sensitive. Maybe         that changed with <a ref="http://www.ids-mannheim.de/reform/">the most recent spelling         reform</a>.) <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr21/tr21-5.html">Unicode Technical         Report #21</a> has more examples.      </p>
<p>         Just because you're using Unicode doesn't mean that all your language problems are         solved. Indeed, the ability to represent characters in nearly all of the world's languages         means that you have more things to worry about, not less.      </p>

		<p>Raymond, I am no expert in Unicode, but from a seminar I attended a few years ago and from <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#French_Accents" rel="nofollow">http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr10/#French_Accents</a> it would appear that your example 4 is incorrect (ie no in France). This is an oddity of the French language that I do not remember having learnt at school in France, but discovered while living in England!</p>

		<p>It is my recollection that French rules for capitalization is that when an accented character is converted to uppercase, it loses its accent mark. Therefore, a capital E compares equal to any accented lowercase e, because there is no such thing as an accented capital E.  (However, an unaccented e does not compare equal to an accented e.)  French Canadian, however, preserves the accent mark on capitalization.  That was the rule I was trying to exhibit (and failed).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
