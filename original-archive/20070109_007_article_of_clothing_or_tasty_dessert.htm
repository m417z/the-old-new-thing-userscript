		<p>I solve this problem by pronouncing Baklava as in original Turkish&#8230;</p>
<p>Actually &#8216;Baklava&#8217; exists in Turkish while &#8216;Balaclava&#8217; means nothing (gibberish that sounds like &#8216;Baklava&#8217;).</p>
<p>To tell the truth, I&#8217;ve just learned &#8216;Balaclava&#8217; exists in English by this post.</p>
<p>I think &#8216;Baklava &#8211; pastry, associate with bak(ed)&#8217; is the best suggestion so far, not that there&#8217;s any chance I can ever confuse the two words.</p>
<p>Best regards,</p>
<p>Burak</p>

		<p>Wait, a balaclava is an article of clothing… ? &nbsp;I thought it was some kind of musical instrument—</p>
<p>—oh, apparently I was thinking of the balalaika and of claves and sort of mixed them up. &nbsp;c.c</p>

		<p>To add to the confusion, there is also a city in Ukraine witha similar sounding name</p>

		<p>My guess would be that the article of clothing is named for the city in Ukraine. The British soldiers there during the Crimean War were cold, so England made up some hats with masks and sent them over.</p>
<p>In the US they&#8217;re primarily called ski masks because the US did not participate in the Crimean War, so they&#8217;re primarily used for skiing.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m sorry, I really don&#8217;t quite see how you can get the two confused. There&#8217;s a whole extra syllable in balaclava, and it&#8217;s not as if they&#8217;re particularly difficult to spell. Now, merengue (ballroom dance of Dominican and Haitian folk origin) and &nbsp;meringue (baked egg whites and sugar), that&#8217;s much tougher.</p>

		<p>This is worrying: should I find myself in WA any time soon, can I take Raymond&#8217;s earlier recommendation of the new dessert restaurant at face value, or would I risk being served a plate of knitwear?</p>
<p>Worse, it could even be selling deserts, with the house special leaving you with a big plate of heated sand&#8230;</p>

		<p>In Israel, and I believe also in Arab countries, we call (the food) Baklava in the name Baklawa which is pronounced something like bak-la-u-ah (rhymes with Nashua).</p>
<p>So it sounds kind of funny in to hear Baklava on American TV series and movies from time to time.</p>

		<p>Suggested solution: adhere to good English style and use &quot;hooded knit cap&quot; instead of &quot;balaclava&quot;. &nbsp;It is much more difficult to describe baklava as briefly in common everyday English, which is why the use of the specialized term is excusable.</p>
<p>&quot;The robber was wearing a hooded knit cap to hide his appearance. He had eaten a piece of very sweet cake originating in&#8230;., which is made of &#8230;&quot;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
