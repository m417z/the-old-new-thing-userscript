<p>
In the Windows team, you'll see the term IDW.
You don't see it much in the outside world,
though.
<a HREF="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=1919">
Here's an ISO image called
<tt>6.0.5383.1.1.WindowsSDK_Vista_idw.DVD.Rel.img</tt></a>,
so it does get out once in a while.
(You can see the file name if you expand the
<i>Installation Instructions</i> section.)
It also appears
<a HREF="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/network/performance-in-network-drivers">
on this Web page about
performance tips when developing network drivers</a>.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
The Kernprof.exe tool is provided with the developer
and IDW builds of Windows that extracts the needed information
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The abbreviation IDW stands for Internal Developer Workstation.
This is a term applied to builds stable enough to be self-hosted
by the development team.
</p>
<p>
Razzle was the code name for Windows NT
(or NT OS/2 as it was then known),
and it is the name of the script that prepares
the command line environment for
developing Windows.
You open a fresh command prompt,
then run the <code>Razzle.cmd</code> script,
and it gets your machine ready to work on the Windows source code.
It sets the environment variables used by the build tools,
it adds the build tools to your <code>PATH</code>,
it installs test signing certificates,
it lets you specify whether you want to build free or checked builds,
optimized or unoptimized builds, all that stuff.
</p>
<p>
Razzle is still alive and well, but
the term IDW is not used much any more because we use
Windows Insider rings nowadays to declare which builds are suitable
for developer self-hosting.
There was also an abbreviation IDS which stood for
Internal Developer Server,
but that abbreviation died out a long time ago.
</p>
<p>
And while Razzle provided the software half of the Windows NT story,
the hardware part originally came from a project called Dazzle.
Dazzle was a
<a HREF="https://danluu.com/microsoft-culture/">
single-board i860 computer</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/larryosterman/">
Larry Osterman actually used a Dazzle</a>,
though "used" might be a rather generous term.
It was basically a breadboard with a VGA port in the back.
As Larry recalls, they had Reversi running on it,
but the pieces were squares rather than circles.
</p>
<p>
Why squares and not circles?
</p>
<p>
Because GDI didn't support circles yet!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
