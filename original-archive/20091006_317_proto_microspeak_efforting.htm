		<p>Humans love to use language as a way to sub-group themselves, create secret coalitions, in some sense alienate and feel special. Teens do it all the time. Scientists love to do it, and then when one of them writes a book for the layman, s/he is panned as putting a toe into the low-brow waters. As with programming, a low percentage of people were born to manage, have innate skills, and don&#8217;t worry about jargon. The rest have to find some way to distinguish themselves. However, I think of the word meandering, which is what I&#8217;ve been doing for the past minute in this post, and wonder if anyone complained when it was verbed?</p>

		<p>&quot;Of course, what the person really meant to write was &#8216;A lot of efforting&#8230;&#8217;&quot;</p>
<p>Having been at a previous Microsoft-influenced company, I think that &quot;efforting&quot; more means &quot;to determine the effort of&quot; versus the effort itself. So the act of efforting itself requires effort :)</p>
<p>So I think the person did mean to say &quot;A lot of effort&quot;&#8230;</p>

		<p>@porter: even with Microspeak, the terms &quot;noun&quot; and &quot;verb&quot; will not be redundant. What you learned in school about nouns and verbs (as person/places/things versus actions/states of being) is, essentially, wrong, and you can think of many cases where this line is blurred (e.g., the noun &quot;destruction&quot;, and many others).</p>
<p>A better definition is simply that nouns and verbs are categories our mind uses, almost certainly intuitively, to classify words by certain properties, such as where they can appear in a phrase structure, what kinds of morphology (affixation, like -s, un-, or -ing, for example) it can take, and the like.</p>
<p>What makes some words interesting, like the verb &quot;effort,&quot; is that they are so-called zero-derivations, meaning no derivational affixes (e.g., suffixes that change nouns into verbs like -ize) are used. Still, to satisfy English grammar, they will use inflectional affixes (non-category-chaning affixes that are used because the grammar requires them, such as -ed on a past tense verb or -s on a third-person singular present indicative verb). This is how we know it&#8217;s a verb: besides from fitting into phrase structure in a way that only verbs can, it takes inflectional affixes (like -ed) that only verbs can take. For nouns zero-derived from verbs, you will find something similar.</p>
<p>Basically, there is no danger here&#8211;only really fun data for linguists. :)</p>

		<p>Angus: while that may be true, there really is no problem using nouns in a verbal context like this: check out <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_%28linguistics%29" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conversion_%28linguistics%29</a>. English has mostly stripped itself of features that distinguish parts of speech. The convention of adding -ize, -ify or -ate is just a habit copied from Greek and Latin words and used as a syntactic marker.</p>
<p>What would take this from &quot;proto-Microspeak&quot; is the sense drifting after its adoption: &quot;no, we&#8217;re not making an effort, we&#8217;re efforting&quot;.</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8230;Let&#8217;s use that thing that does this stuff when you give it other stuff to solve this problem!&quot;</p>
<p>The problem is that Raymond&#8217;s Microspeak examples are /not/ more precise or descriptive jargon, they just sounds that way. It detracts from the communication rather than enhancing it. Er, makes it worse, not better? Or something&#8230;</p>

		<p>Using the word mockingly just propagates it further. People who haven&#8217;t heard it before and who hear you using it may not realize you&#8217;re using it mockingly, and pick it. The word &#8216;synergy&#8217; falls into the same category &#8211; initially me and my (geek) friends used it to mock marketing/sales people but now it&#8217;s become normal-speak.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether you care if that happens to these micro-speaks but it&#8217;s something to keep in mind :)</p>

		<p>TDL: Maybe there was an overhead projector sitting there or&#8230; no you&#8217;re right, that&#8217;s terrible. I recently learned that a manager with our group was calling some employees &quot;tag monkeys&quot;.

		<p>&quot;Scientists love to [use language as a way to sub-group themselves, create secret coalitions, in some sense alienate and feel special], and then when one of them writes a book for the layman, s/he is panned as putting a toe into the low-brow waters.&quot;</p>
<p>Uh, most scientists in hard sciences (physics, chemistry, biology, paleontology) that I&#8217;m aware of try as hard as possible to be as clear and succinct as possible at all times.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a certain amount of technical vocabulary in any given field that you need to learn, but that does generally make things *easier* to understand. If you don&#8217;t actually name different subatomic particles, different types of molecule, taxonomic groups or geological eras, how exactly do you plan to make distinctions between them when you need to? If you don&#8217;t name processes, but always refer to &quot;nuclear fusion&quot; as &quot;forcing ionised atomic nuclei together against their electrostatic repulsion until the short-range strong nuclear force binds them together&quot; then that would be a lot less clear, prone to error and exclusionary.</p>
<p>Scientists don&#8217;t create language to exclude. They do it to make *detailed, precise* communication *easier* and *more inclusive*.</p>
<p>Popular science writing generally requires using some *less precise* language than research papers. There is a trick to doing this while still not being *imprecise*, accidentally misleading, or less clear than the &quot;proper&quot; language would be.</p>
<p>Occasionally, popular science will be accused of being &quot;too dumbed-down&quot;, but that is often when the author has not mastered the art as just described, and, for example, used some really inappropriate or plain wrong analogies in their attempt to simplify.</p>
<p>OTOH, I have heard that as your science gets more and more soft, making language deliberately impenetrable or unclear is a goal. Some authors have taken it as a compliment when a reader has complained that they struggled to understand a given passage. (cannot find citation) However, the further down that path you go, the more likely your are to get Sokaled.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
