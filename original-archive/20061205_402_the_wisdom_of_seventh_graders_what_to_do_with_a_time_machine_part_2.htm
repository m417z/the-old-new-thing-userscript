<p>(Make sure you've read <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/04/1205832.aspx"> Part 1</a> for background information.)</p>
<p> On the subject of where they would go in a time machine, many students wrote well-thought-out essays, beautifully composed. </p>
<p> These sentences below did not come from those essays. </p>
<p> I've categorized the snippets roughly by theme, though I had to guess at some of them since the sentences are taken out of context. (In a futile attempt to assist non-native speakers, I have glossed some of the trickier parts. I've also added editorial comments in italics.) </p>
<p> <b>Introductions</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>I would be honored to     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="try">     trie</span> the time machine </li>
<li>I am highly regarded to be selected to     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="engage">engorge</span> this experimental journey. </li>
<li>At the     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="The usual phrase is 'crack of dawn'. This student chose a more student-friendly starting time.">     crack of noon</span>, we will begin our mission. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Personal History</b>: These are essays from students who would     travel to their own past. </p>
<ul>
<li>In 5th grade you are at the top of the school,     and you feel the power     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="overcome">     over come</span> you. </li>
<li>Now, if we fall asleep in class we get in trouble.     But in kindergarten if we didn't fall asleep we would get in trouble. </li>
<li>She would work in little     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="orchards">orchids</span> picking fruit for her family. </li>
<li>I have 4 things in my life.     Soccer, family, God, and school. In that order. </li>
<li>If I could find a way to impel paranormal powers     to ignite in ones body     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="enabling">     enableing</span>     them to do incredible feats,     I would be ecstatic to the point of bliss.     (<i>This same student wanted Jesus to teach him how     to walk on water.     This student also wanted control over magnetism.     I think he needs to lay off the     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-Men">     X-Men</a> comics for a while.</i>) </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>The Middle Ages</b>: The students recently studied the Middle Ages, which helps to explain why so many of them chose to go there. </p>
<ul>
<li>And at that time in history,     everything was changing     either for the good or the bad.     (<i>Whoa there, let's not say anything too controversial now</i>.) </li>
<li>In Europe during the 1700's there were 5 sections in the social class:     1=Monarchs, 2=Lords &amp; Nobles, 3=knights,     4=<span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="peasants">pheasants</span>.     (<i>What happened to number five?</i>) </li>
<li>I find Middle Aged Europe very stimulating. </li>
<li>France is near water so I will feel more at home. </li>
<li>We have recently     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="discussed">disgust</span> the Middle Ages.  </li>
<li>King Arthur may have won some battles without the use of fiction. </li>
<li>In 1550 I would choose to go to Spain because nobody really lived in     N. American then. </li>
<li>I would learn a lot     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="going">gong</span>     to the     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="Medieval">Midieval</span> times.     I would even come back and write     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="an">and</span> essay about it! </li>
<li>I'd have benefit in watching a mock battle     between two knights on horseback with lances.     (<i>I may be wrong, but I think the battles in the Middle Ages     were for real</i>.) </li>
<li>It was sick and     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="gruesome">grusm</span> but really a thing to remember. </li>
<li>And I would go to     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="Britain">Britan</span> because Britan was     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="popular">populare</span> back in 1616. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>United States(?) History</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>Also, to investigate how the family worked [in Pilgrim times],     to see if they fought less because they had no appliances to fight over. </li>
<li>If I could go anywhere I would choose Boston, England. </li>
<li>I want to see what happened when Ben Franklin flew his kite in the rain.     For this reason I would go to England. </li>
<li>Though War is Hell, I still would be anxious to see a real one.     (<i>Try watching the evening news</i>.) </li>
<li>I wish the     <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Depression">     great depression</a>, but it did.     (<i>Even after you fill in the missing words, it's still funny</i>.) </li>
<li>Because California is a very interesting and mindblowing city. </li>
<li>In 1961 everything including life was simple. </li>
<li>Hopefully the president at their time isn't an idiot and     stops the first power plant ever built. </li>
<li>I want to     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="see">se</span>     the Great     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="Bambino">Babino</span> Babe     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="Ruth">Bruth</span>. </li>
<li>Besides the     <a href="http://www.steelers.com/">Stealer</a>     fans nobody like the Stealers. </li>
<li>It was like a family     <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="reunion">runnun</span> at disneyland. </li>
</ul>
<p> I'll stop here before I <span style="cursor: default; border-bottom: dotted .75pt red" title="run on">runnun</span> too much. We'll learn more about seventh graders and time machines in the next installment. </p>

		<p>Get used to &quot;crack of noon&quot; &#8211; that is becoming a common term. A number of whitewater boaters use that term, especially around now when it&#8217;s still possible to go on a quick raft or kayak trip as long as you wait until midday.</p>

		<p>Peter, you missed the joke. &nbsp;Read the sentence before it again.</p>
<p>&#8216;those essays&#8217; means the &#8216;well-thought-out essays, beautifully composed&#8217; essays, not all of the essays. &nbsp;The quotes that follow come from the poorly written essays.</p>

		<p>For those who don&#8217;t know, Boston in England is a small town with a particularly large church (the Boston Stump). When the English Pilgrims came to America they named the towns the same as what they knew. However, Boston in America is about 20 times the size of the one in England, and is no doubt what the kid was refering to.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a joke, right?</p>

		<p>The pilgrim fathers were arrested in Boston when they tried to leave England and sail to Amsterdam on the Mayflower. At least according to my favourite internet community edited encyclopedia. Perhaps if these children were taught this story at school this has prompted the fascination with visiting Boston, England.</p>

		<p>&quot;Crack of noon&quot; is one I&#8217;ve heard for quite a while now, from my stepfather. Just a way of admitting you&#8217;re being lazy and sleeping in.</p>
<p>And aside from the misspelling I have to agree with the second-to-last statement. Everyone knows the Pittsburgh NFL team name is actually spelled Squealers ;)</p>

		<p>What you don&#8217;t realize for the social classes is that he was using 0-indexing. 0 is just padding for now, since we haven&#8217;t implemented a higher class than monarchs, but we don&#8217;t want to break things when there is.</p>

		<p>Seeing as &quot;Stewart&quot; doesn&#8217;t seem to have made it very clear, there really is a place in England called &quot;Boston&quot;! It&#8217;s in Lincolnshire.</p>
<p>In fact, there are even two places in England called &quot;New York&quot;. Many US place names were &quot;imported&quot;, some of which, including Boston, became more well known as a US place name than a British one.</p>

<p>Often higher echelons don&#8217;t know that people beneath are reporting to them. It&#8217;s a good way of avoiding having to do work, if everyone except your boss thinks you report to him ;-)</p>

		<p>The phrase &quot;crack of noon&quot; is also used in a Tenacious D song. Not that that validates it, but maybe it was a joke?</p>

		<p>&gt; These sentences are cute, not insulting.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a perfectly good opinion, but I wonder if that really is your opinion.</p>
<p>When a 7th grade student said that nobody really lived in North<br />
America before whites occupied the land, the sentence is cute so it&#8217;s<br />
OK to report.</p>
<p>When a US lawmaker (I don&#8217;t even remember which party) said that the<br />
land was empty before whites expanded into it, the sentence isn&#8217;t cute<br />
so it&#8217;s insulting to report.</p>
<p>The meaning was the same. &nbsp;How did the cuteness of the sentence change? &nbsp;Did it depend on the exact wording?</p>
<p>Your posting looked like a fine set of bug reports and I did think<br />
it was cute. &nbsp;Sorry to argue but this is my response to your<br />
complaint.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m sorry, but this post actually makes me sad. &nbsp;These are 7th graders, and assuming vertabim copying of what they had written, their language skills suck. &nbsp;While I&#8217;m not saying that my language skills were perfect when I was in 7th grade, they were certainly an order of magnitude better than what we are seeing here.</p>
<p>I hope their skills improve significantly very soon.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I would appreciate it if you kept your political insults to yourself. -Raymond&#8221;</p>
<p>Sorry Raymond, but I must agree with him as well&#8230; I don&#8217;t understand what was so insulting about what he said (maybe because I&#8217;m not American, but oh well!)</p>
<p>And the sentences are funny, but whether you like it or not, they do say a lot about the current spelling abilities of 7th graders. I wouldn&#8217;t call that &#8216;cute&#8217;, though. ;-)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
