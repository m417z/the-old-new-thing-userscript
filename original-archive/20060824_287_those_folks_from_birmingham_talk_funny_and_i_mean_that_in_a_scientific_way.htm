<p>In celebration of their tenth birthday, the <a href="http://www.paramountcomedy.com/"> Paramount Comedy Channel</a> in the UK  commissioned a study on how regional accents affect perceived funniness, and the conclusion was that <a href="http://www.paramountcomedy.com/comedy/news/article.aspx?id=639"> people from Birmingham have the funniest accents</a>. The Received Pronunciation, which is the only British accent most people in the United States are familiar with, came in dead last. I'm sure that there are some nuances of class that I miss out on when I watch a British-made film due to my lack of familiarity with the connotations that each accent brings to the table: Which accents are the aristocratic accents, the working-class accents, the stereotypical football fan accents, and so on.</p>
<p> I wouldn't be surprised if the advent of mass media has taken its toll on regional accents, softening the harsher edges and bringing them a little closer together. Which I think is kind of sad. </p>
<p> Personally, I think the northern accents are funnier, like the ones used by <a href="http://www.wallaceandgromit.com/"> Wallace</a> and <a href="http://www.blitzgames.com/chickenrun/characters/cast-Babs.htm"> Babs</a>. </p>

		<p>&quot;I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if the advent of mass media has taken its toll on regional accents, softening the harsher edges and bringing them a little closer together. Which I think is kind of sad.&quot;</p>
<p>A lot of linguists thought this would happen, but lots have research has shown that this does not appear to be the case. &nbsp;Children seem to develop accents based primarily on their peers (in school and such, and moreso even then their parents) and through a process of identifying oneself with a group (if you are interested in this you should check out the writings of william labove, he&#8217;s done a lot of research in this area). &nbsp;They don&#8217;t seem to pick up much in terms of accent from tv, radio, movies, etc. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the USA right now, linguists say (I apologize for not having some cites right now, #include i_dont_know_what_im_talking_about.h) that regional accents are actually drifting further apart/becoming more pronounced. &nbsp;One interesting modern example of this is the so-called &quot;Northern Cities Vowel Shift&quot; (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_cities_vowel_shift" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_cities_vowel_shift</a>).</p>
<p>So don&#8217;t despair, Raymond! &nbsp;The annoying Northern Cities accent is here to stay and is getting even more annoying!</p>

		<p>AC &#8211; that&#8217;s true for people who learn to speak the language natively. I&#8217;ve known a couple of Scandinavian girls with American accents, picked up because they learned the language from watching films.</p>
<p>Me? I speak mostly RP but tend to lose it quickly when in the company of Americans! D&#8217;oh :)</p>

<p>But this is far from the case for other aspects of language. I heard Swansea checkout girls speaking fluent &quot;Friends&quot; &#8212; except for the local accent (which anyone outside S Wales or the UK in general can sample by renting &quot;Twin Town&quot;).

		<p>I thought you were talking about Birmingham, Alabama (USA) until I clicked the link. &nbsp;If it&#8217;s true that lowest perceived intelligence == highest perceived funniness, then I&#8217;d think Birmingham, AL would rank near the top of a similar American study. :)</p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>I suggest watching &quot;Keeping Up with Appearances&quot; [<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.bbcamerica.com/genre/comedy_games/keeping_up_appearances/keeping_up_appearances.jsp" rel="nofollow">http://www.bbcamerica.com/genre/comedy_games/keeping_up_appearances/keeping_up_appearances.jsp</a>] for an education in English classes. &nbsp;There isn&#8217;t much to help you with regional accents per se, but there is plenty of dialogue that can help you learn the differences between the upper classes, the middle classes, the working folk and the chavs.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s a double edged sword &#8211; Accents act as cues to the character of people (stereo-type) and for any specific person may be innaccurate (prejudice). &nbsp;My regional accent is South West (Bristol), &nbsp;the stereotype I encountered from the South Easterners (London included) thought I sounded like a farmer. &nbsp;But then, &nbsp;I thought they sounded like &#8216;Essex&#8217; Lads/gals, &nbsp;I think I got the better deal&#8230;.. &nbsp;;-)</p>
<p>Brummy&#8217;s also thought I sounded like a farmer, &nbsp;but they were funny and friendly so I love that accent and even learned to discern between Dudley, Brum and Coventry. &nbsp;Dudley being my favourite, &nbsp;they use the term &#8216;me ducks&#8217; like the american&#8217;s use the term &#8216;Hun&#8217; (short for Honey). &nbsp;As a Brit, &nbsp;being called a &#8216;Hun&#8217; jars a little becauase I register the German reference before the sweet-thing reference&#8230;..</p>

		<p>The study mentions 3 examples of &quot;Birmingham&quot; comedians.<br />
<br />Well, Lenny Henry is from Dudley, Frank Skinner is from Oldbury. These accents are very different from the &quot;Brummie&quot; accent, of Birmingham born Jasper Carrott.<br />
<br />Sorry, but I am from Dudley and it always annoys me when people call me a &quot;Brummie&quot;!</p>

		<p>Ah, Jasper Carrott.<br />
<br />It was he who suggested that even reading the news was funny in Brum. He then proceeds to do so, bringing the house down.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
