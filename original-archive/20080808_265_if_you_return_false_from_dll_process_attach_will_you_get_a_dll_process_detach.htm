<p>If you return <code>FALSE</code> from <code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code>, will you get a <code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code>?</p>
<p> Yes. </p>
<p> No. </p>
<p> ... </p>
<p> Yes. </p>
<p> All three answers are correct, for different formulations of the question. </p>
<p> From the kernel's point of view, the answer is a simple Yes. If a DLL's entry point returns <code>FALSE</code> to the <code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code> notification, it will receive a <code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code> notification. </p>
<p> However, most C and C++ programs do not use the raw DLL entry point. Instead, they use the C runtime entry point, which will have a name something like <code>DllMainCRTStartup</code>. That entry point function does work to manage the C runtime library and calls your entry point (which you've probably called <code>DllMain</code>) to see what you think. </p>
<p> If you compiled your program prior to around 2002 and your <code>DllMain</code> function returns <code>FALSE</code> in response to the <code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code> notification, then the C runtime code says, "Oh, well, I guess I'm not running after all" and shuts itself down. When the kernel calls the C runtime entry point with the <code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code> notification, the C runtime says, "Oh, I'm already shut down, thanks for asking" and returns immediately, which means that your entry point is not called with the <code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code> notification. In other words, if you wrote your program prior to around 2002, the answer is No. </p>
<p> Sometime in 2002 or maybe 2003, the C runtime folks changed the behavior. If your <code>DllMain</code> function returns <code>FALSE</code> in response to the <code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code> notification, you will nevertheless get the <code>DLL_PROCESS_DETACH</code> notification. In other words, if you wrote your program after around 2002 or maybe 2003, then the answer is Yes. Why change? Maybe they wanted to match the kernel behavior more closely, maybe they considered their previous behavior a bug. You'll have to ask them. </p>
<p> What does this mean for you, the programmer? Some people may look at this and conclude, "Well, now that I know how each of the specific scenarios works, I can rely on knowing the behavior that results from the scenario I'm in. For example, since I'm using Visual Studio 2008, the answer is Yes." But I think that's the wrong conclusion, because you usually do not have total control over how your program is compiled and linked. You may share your code with another project, and that other project may not know that you are relying on the behavior of a specific version of Visual Studio 2008; they will compile your program with Borland C++ version 5.5,&sup1; and now your program is subtly broken. My recommendation is to write your <code>DllMain</code> function so that it works correctly regardless of which scenario it ends up used in. (And since you shouldn't be doing much in your <code>DllMain</code> function anyway, this shouldn't be too much of a burden.) </p>
<p> <b>Footnote</b> </p>
<p> &sup1;I do not know what the behavior of Borland C++ version 5.5 is with respect to returning <code>FALSE</code> from <code>DllMain</code>. I didn't feel like doing the research to find a compiler whose behavior is different from Visual Studio 2008, so I just picked one at random. I have a 50/50 chance of being right. </p>

		<p>Rick C, I have a lottery ticket I&#8217;d like to sell you. &nbsp;Since you will either win, or not, you would logically be willing to pay up to 49% of the jackpot for this particular ticket. &nbsp;I&#8217;ll give you a whale of deal and let you have it for only 10% of the jackpot.</p>

		<p>Why must nitpickers ruin everything? &nbsp;It&#8217;s a 50/50 chance because for any random compiler it either does or doesn&#8217;t send the notification. &nbsp;The compilers are independent.</p>

		<p>Hmm, a failed attach means the dll is not unattached&#8230;</p>
<p>The MSDN documentation seems to suggest the detach occurs (when attach returns FALSE) only if the attach was a result of a LoadLibrary.</p>

		<p>Thanks for mentioning this!</p>
<p>Moments before reading this I had added a DeleteCriticalSection into a DLL_PROCESS_DETACH block. I didn&#8217;t realise they had changed the rules. I have a lot of DLLs to update!</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve got to wonder what was going through the mind of whoever made the change to the CRT. It crashes old code that was correct and new code cannot rely on the new behaviour (as you explained). That&#8217;s a lose-lose situation. All for the &quot;win&quot; of making old code that was incorrect code now sometimes correct. &lt;slaps forehead&gt;</p>

		<p>Seen in a footnote to what is actually an interesting and useful piece of information concerning DLL_PROCESS_DETACH notifications, at least if you&#8217;re a Win32 programmer: Footnote &#185;I do not know what the behavior of Borland C++ version 5.5 is with&#8230;</p>

<p>Why? The point of the blog was to advise against trying to rely on whether you&#8217;d get the DLL_PROCESS_DETACH or not, and giving specific version numbers would more easily allow people go against that advice.</p>

		<p>@Leo: As Raymond pointed out, the difference is only really a major problem if you have people compiling your DLL&#8217;s source code with different versions of the compiler (or different compilers altogether). &nbsp;For any other cases it&#8217;s just a simple compiler migration issue to be aware of, but not an ongoing problem.</p>
<p>Thus it&#8217;s only really a big deal for open source developers and large teams that share codebases (and individually compile common libraries) &#8212; and even then I would think that most teams mandate a particular compiler&#8230;?</p>
<p>&quot;[The interpretation of the value returned from DllMain changed. And you say this isn&#8217;t a behavior change? -Raymond]&quot;</p>
<p>The interpretation of the return value didn&#8217;t change &#8212; it still means &quot;oops, leave me alone&quot;; the change was outside of that, when the DLL entry-point is reentered for a different operation. &nbsp;It&#8217;s still a behavioural change, though, there&#8217;s no question about that :)</p>

		<p>Thanks BorlandUser. For reference, I get</p>
<p>C:temp&gt;test_dll.exe</p>
<p>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</p>
<p>C:temp&gt;</p>
<p>using VC6 which matches Raymond&#8217;s description of VC.</p>

		<p>&quot;Why? The point of the blog was to advise against trying to rely on whether you&#8217;d get the DLL_PROCESS_DETACH or not, and giving specific version numbers would more easily allow people go against that advice.&quot;</p>
<p>Except that the problem isn&#8217;t just in this blog article. I remember reading another blog article that has the same problem</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  &gt; C runtime library dates in not only this article but also another article are kind of cryptic. Version numbers like 7.0 and 7.1 would be much better. &lt;&lt;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Since I&#8217;m not Raymond and don&#8217;t know Raymond, I can only guess (which I suppose I shouldn&#8217;t do, but here goes anyway):</p>
<p>Raymond probably doesn&#8217;t know which versions exhibit which behavior and doesn&#8217;t care to know. &nbsp;He just knows that it changed at some point and decided it was an interesting tidbit to blog about.</p>
<p>If someone has a need to know further details, &nbsp;presumably they have the compilers (otherwise, why would they need to know) and can do the checking just as easily as Raymond could, using exactly the same methods as Raymond would.</p>
<p>Of course, there&#8217;s also still the reasoning that Dean Harding brought up.</p>

		<p>If people are returning FALSE from PROCESS_ATTACH, they deserve all the PITA. A point to remember: your DLL is NOT the most important in the world, to veto the whole process launch.</p>

		<p>Raymond said: &#8220;The interpretation of the value returned from DllMain changed. And you say this isn&#8217;t a behavior change?&#8221;</p>
<p>All I am saying is that you are using pretty name for a bugfix.</p>
<p>fedup said: &#8220;Igor are you a PITA in real life, or only when you comment in blogs?&#8221;</p>
<p>For you I am both &#8212; I hate stupid questions from anonymous cowards.</p>
<p>Alexander Grigoriev said : &#8220;A point to remember: your DLL is NOT the most important in the world, to veto the whole process launch.&#8221;</p>
<p>So if the DLL fails to allocate memory for say TLS it should return TRUE and initialize its variables with some random values and pointers?</p>

		<p>I think this is a bit counter intuitive. How can you detach from something you weren&#8217;t attached to in the first place?</p>
<p>I see it the same way I see C++ constructors. If you throw an exception in a constructor, your destructor will never run since the object was never created.</p>

		<p>[Igor Levitsky]&quot;So if the DLL fails to allocate memory for say TLS it should return TRUE and initialize its variables with some random values and pointers?&quot;</p>
<p>Unless you have to deal with legacy non-thread-aware-crap, like CRTL does, why would you need TLS? There are things you can do, but you should know better to avoid, such as using TLS. There are things you can get away most of the time, but they will come to bite you.</p>
<p>For example, a certain DLL that interfaced to a image capture board. If no board was installed, the DLL would display a message box and return FALSE from DllMain. Now what if you still want to run your program with alternate capture device? Welcome to LoadLibrary. It&#8217;s worth to mention that their kernel mode driver was importing KeBugCheck. How do you like a IHV driver bringing down your system at will?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
