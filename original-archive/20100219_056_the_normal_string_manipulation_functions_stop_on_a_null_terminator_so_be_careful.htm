One of the many gotchas of working with
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/10/08/9904646.aspx">
double-null-terminated strings</a>
is accidentally using functions on them which were designed
to operate on single-null-terminated strings.
Now, you do need to use those single-null-terminated strings,
but you also need to know when they won't do what you want.
</p>
<p>
One of the responses to my psychic detection that somebody
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/10/08/9904646.aspx">
passed a single-null-terminated string to
<code>SHFileOperation</code></a>
is,
"Oh, no, I double-null-terminated it. Look:
</p>
<pre>
sprintf(szDeletePath, "%s\0", file_to_delete);
</pre>
<p>
See, I put an extra <code>\0</code> at the end."
</p>
<p>
Well, yeah, you put an extra <code>\0</code> at the end, but
all that does is terminate the format string.
The <code>sprintf</code> function accepts its format string
as a traditional null-terminated string.
When it sees the <code>\0</code> you stuck into the string,
it thinks it found the end of the string.
It can't read your mind and say,
"Oh, this null is not a terminator.
It's an embedded null."
</p>
<p>
A simple mistake, but something that needs to be called out.
To be fair, most people recognize this mistake as soon as it's
pointed out to them.
You just have to remember to point it out to them.</p>

		<p>Given the choice between pascal strings with a max length of 256 and null-terminated strings, I&#8217;d pick null-terminated. Overall, I&#8217;m very glad those are no longer the only options.</p>

		<p>These last couple of posts have demonstrated one thing very clearly for a fact and that is &nbsp;these early API designs were truly horrific and should be discarded as soon as possible.

		<p>A Delphi string is ideal IMO. It is O(1) and how often will you need a string bigger than 4 GB? Now don&#8217;t forgot to lobby the ISO C and C++ committees to add a new string type. I&#8217;m sure they will.</p>

		<p>Delphi strings have their own share of problems. Most of them related to copy-on-write and ref-counting.</p>
<p>And passing them from one runtime to another leads to problems too.</p>
<p>And when casting them to PChar(=char*) you need exactly to know what you are doing, or you cause subtle bugs.</p>

		<p>It is my hope that Windows 7 will be a kind of watershed release in regards to backwards compatibility. &nbsp;With XP mode providing a reasonable option, Microsoft can now be aggressive about doing new stuff completely in .NET, and thus rendering double-NULL-terminated strings a thing of the (distant) past.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>That&#8217;s great for new stuff, but what about old stuff? Are you saying the old stuff should be deprecated and eventually purged from Windows? (What&#8217;s going to happen to all the programs that still use SHFileOperation?) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>The Windows kernel uses counted strings internally, and OLE uses BSTRs. If Microsoft could make a choice, make all functions use those and implement the old functions with some kind of backward-compatibility layer, we would suffer a lot less string handling issues.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>That sounds backwards. Shouldn&#8217;t it be &#8220;Write wrappers around the existing functions which take BSTRs?&#8221; Or are you saying that we we should reimplement all functions to use BSTRs internally? Won&#8217;t that introduce new bugs? -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>@Mircea: What do you possibly mean by a Delphi string begin O(1)? What operation are you referring to? Things like appending to an existing string must take at least O(min(m,n)) amortized time to copy the string data around, even in a perfect string implementation (O(m+n) in the worst case that a new buffer needs allocated for both strings).</p>

		<p>@Joe:</p>
<p>Because these were the only string types ever invented. Even Windows uses two, although rarely the twain meet. There&#8217;s the well known null-terminated string (TCHAR*, LPSTR, lpsz) and the UNICODE_STRING of the Native API. Outside Windows we have Delphi strings (32-bit length counter, i.e. the same as for char* on IA32), Ada&#8217;s String, Bounded_String and Unbounded_String (with different trade-offs for flexibility and speed) and quite a lot others (linked lists?). Abstraction is the keyword here. (Again, .NET is doing well in that regard)</p>

		<p>Raymond, I believe that J. Daniel Smith was trying to say that old programs would run in XP mode. The implication is that in order to run in &#8220;Win7 native&#8221; mode, old software would need to be rewritten to eliminate deprecated APIs.</p>

		<p>&#8220;[But this still entails reimplementing all functions which previously used null-terminated strings to use the new string format. Rewriting working code is not something undertaken purely for aesthetic reasons. -Raymond]&#8221;</p>
<p>The post I was refering to seemed to only be trying to get rid of double-NULL-terminated-strings. Granted, others do seem to think that all null-terminated strings should be eliminated.</p>
<p>As for rewriting working code, I think Steve Jobs would disagree that it shouldn&#8217;t be undertaken for purely aesthetic reasons. Mac application developers probably have to rewrite working code every few years. I recall when it was announced that planned 64-bit support for the backwards-compatible API (Carbon) would be dropped, meaning that anybody who wanted to release a 64-bit version of their app would have to rewrite the whole UI to use a different API (Cocoa). Surprisingly, lots of people were upset that some software vendors would have to delay 64-bit releases of major apps because they had spent the previous seven years merely adding features and fixing bugs, rather than rewriting millions of lines of code to use a shiny new API.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Reimplementation means you replace all the bugs you know with new unknown bugs. Sometimes it&#8217;s the right thing to do, but it&#8217;s not a decision to be made lightly, and I believe that doing it just for aesthetics is not a strong enough reason. That&#8217;s why I don&#8217;t run Apple Computer. -Raymond</i>]</div>

<p>Is it?</p>

<p>You know, my brother still using AutoCAD 2000 at home, because it&#8217;s simply too expensive to buy a new verion to justify it&#8217;s cost. He&#8217;ll probably be upset if he upgraded and see his program doesn&#8217;t work, and fall back to WinXP again&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
