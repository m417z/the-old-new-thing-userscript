A customer was looking for clarification on the
<code>msWindow&shy;Length</code> parameter to
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686271(v=vs.85).aspx">
the <code>Set&shy;Threadpool&shy;Timer</code> function</a>.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<dl>
<dt><i>msWindowLength</i> [in, optional]</p>
<dd>The maximum amount of time the system can delay
    before calling the timer callback.
    If this parameter is set, the system can batch calls to conserve power. 
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>
"It's not clear whether the window extends both before and after
the due time (presumably, half the window size on either side),
or whether the timer will always delay at least until the due time,
and possibly up to the due time plus the window value."
</p>
<p>
The window specifies the maximum delay,
and generally speaking, delay means late, never early.
(When was the last time you heard that your flight was delayed,
by which they meant that it landed 30 minutues early?)
</p>
<p>
In other words, the latter interpretation is the correct one.
The threadpool will schedule the callback at some point
between the due time and the due time plus the window.
</p>
<p>
(For the record,
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/hh405404(v=vs.85).aspx">
the <code>Set&shy;Coalescable&shy;Timer</code></a>
and
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd405521(v=vs.85).aspx">
<code>Set&shy;Waitable&shy;Timer&shy;Ex</code>
functions</a>
work the same way.)
</p>
<p>
The customer thanked us for the clarification.
That's what they thought, but they wanted to make sure.</p>

		<p>Using the word &#8220;Window&#8221; in the name suggests the opposite, so I can understand why they wanted to check that &#8216;delay&#8217; in fact was being used to mean &#8216;delay&#8217;. </p>
<p>&#8216;And only one for birthday presents, you know. There&#8217;s glory for you!&#8217;<br />
&#8216;I don&#8217;t know what you mean by &#8220;glory&#8221;,&#8217; Alice said.<br />
Humpty Dumpty smiled contemptuously. &#8216;Of course you don&#8217;t ‚Äî till I tell you. I meant &#8220;there&#8217;s a nice knock-down argument for you!&#8221;&#8216;<br />
&#8216;But &#8220;glory&#8221; doesn&#8217;t mean &#8220;a nice knock-down argument&#8221;,&#8217; Alice objected.<br />
&#8216;When I use a word,&#8217; Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, &#8216;it means just what I choose it to mean ‚Äî neither more nor less.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;The question is,&#8217; said Alice, &#8216;whether you can make words mean so many different things.&#8217;<br />
&#8216;The question is,&#8217; said Humpty Dumpty, &#8216;which is to be master ‚Äî that&#8217;s all.&#8217;</p>

		<p>It seems that the function documentation and parameters were written with kernel-mode glasses on: the window in this case is the window of opportunity that the kernel has to process other business before notifying the callback. My biggest issue with the documentation for this parameter is that it doesn&#8217;t specify what units of time are being used here (probably milliseconds like with msPeriod, but who knows?)</p>

		<p>I think the ms part in the parameter name hints at millisecond, but explicit calling it out wouldn&#8217;t be bad.</p>

		<p>Actually, KeSetCoalescableTimer allows the callback to happen at the target time plus/minus TolerableDelay. The documentation spells that explicitly.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
