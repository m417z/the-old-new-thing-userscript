The
<a HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/collaboration/research.aspx">
Microsoft Vulnerability Research</a>
team discovered a potential
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/11/11/10089223.aspx">
current directory attack</a>
in a third party program.
The vendor, however, turned around and forwarded the report
to the
<a HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/security/msrc/default.aspx">
Microsoft Security Response Center</a>:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
Our investigation suggests that this issue is due to a bug
in Microsoft system DLLs rather than our program.
When a process is launched,
for example, when the user double-clicks the icon in Explorer,
a new process object is created, and the DLLs are loaded
by a component known as the Loader.
The Loader locates the DLLs,
maps them into memory,
and then calls the DllMain function for each of the modules.
It appears that some Microsoft DLLs obtain DLLs from the
current directory and are therefore susceptible to a current
directory attack.
We created a simple Win32 application which demonstrates the issue:
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;

int __cdecl main(int argc, char **argv)
{
 return MessageBox(NULL, "Test", "Test", MB_OK);
}
</pre>
<p>
If you place a fake copy of <code>DWMAPI.DLL</code>
in the same directory as the application,
then the Loader will use that fake copy instead of the system one.
</p>
<p>
This technique can be used to attack many popular programs.
For example, placing a fake copy of
<code>DWMAPI.DLL</code> in the
<code>C:\Program Files\<wbr>Internet Explorer</code> directory
allows it to be injected into Internet Explorer.
Placing the file in the
<code>C:\Program Files\<wbr>Adobe\<wbr>Reader 9.0\<wbr>Reader</code> directory
allows it to be injected into Adobe Reader.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
(I like how the report
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/04/09/9539191.aspx">
begins with some exposition</a>.)
</p>
<p>
The vendor appears to have confused two directories,
the current directory and the application directory.
They start out talking about a current directory attack,
but when the money sentence arrives,
they talk about placing the rogue DLL
"in the same directory as the application,"
which makes this not a current directory attack
but an application directory attack.
</p>
<p>
We saw some time ago that
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/20/10176772.aspx">
the directory is the application bundle</a>,
and the application bundle can override DLLs in the system directory.
Again, this is just another illustration of the importance of
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/10/31/10364271.aspx">
securing your application directory</a>.
</p>
<p>
The specific attacks listed at the end of the report
require writing into
<code>C:\Program Files</code>,
but in order to drop your rogue <code>DWMAPI.DLL</code> file
into that directory,
you need to have administrative privileges in the first place.
</p>
<p>
In other words, in order to attack the system,
you first need to get on the other side of the airtight hatchway.
</p>
<p>
There was one final attempt to salvage this bogus vulnerability report:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
We can also reproduce the problem without requiring write access
to the <code>Program Files</code> directory
by disabling
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms682586">
Safe DLL searching</a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Nice try.
In order to disable Safe DLL searching,
you need to have administrator privileges,
so you're already on the other side of the airtight hatchway.
And if you elevate to administrator
and disable safe DLL searching,
then is it any surprise that you have unsafe DLL searching?
This is just another case of
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/01/14/9948124.aspx">
<i>If you set up an insecure system, don't be surprised that there's
a security vulnerability</i></a>.</p>

		<p>Presumably the customer was simply wrong in their assertion that some Microsoft DLLs obtain their DLLs from the current directory &#8211; since the current directory comes after the application directory and the various system directories in the search order.</p>
<p>Maybe they thought Microsoft were warning them of an &#39;application directory&#39; vulnerability? It certainly looks like this is what they investigated, regardless of what Microsoft actually told them. I doubt it was deliberate; more likely incompetence or too many people in a game of Chinese whispers.</p>

		<p>I wish the Windows kernel team would listen to your advice, Raymond. =) &nbsp;On of the things I noticed about Windows 8.1 Preview is that the kernel team flagged csrss.exe as a Protected Process to try to prevent attacks on the kernel from programs running as LocalSystem. &nbsp;Protecting the kernel from LocalSystem seems ridiculous from the &quot;other side of this airtight hatchway&quot; perspective.</p>

		<p>The referenced MSDN entry Safe DLL Searching (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms682586">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/ms682586</a>) is nearly unreadable.

<p>Nowhere is some explanation why the current directory is search at all, even when SafeDllSearchMode is enabled&#8230;</p>
<p>Also, I have to assume that this fragment &quot;If a DLL with the same module name is already loaded in memory, &#8230;&quot; means &quot;If a DLL with the same module name is already loaded into THE PROCESS, &#8230;&quot;. Is this correct?</p>

		<p>If the application directory is the application bundle, then why do Windows Store apps for Windows 8.1 have .appxbundle package, or simply app bundle (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/apps/bg182885.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_new">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/bg182885.aspx</a>)?</p>

		<p>@Hm</p>
<p>Loading a new copy of the DLL every single time any program ever asks for it would be horribly inefficient, wouldn&#39;t you agree? You&#39;d have to locate the DLL, allocate (and possibly page) memory, then load the DLL from disk. But there&#39;s already a copy available.</p>
<p>There are obviously some security checks (to keep you from being stuck with \malwareservermalwaremalicious.dll when you wanted %SystemRoot%System32relativelylessmalicious.dll).</p>

		<p>Anon, of course should the OS not allocate the same read-only pages twice, but the module name without path cannot be the criterion, as stated in that MSDN article. It must really be the exact same disk file.</p>

		<p>When an executable is loaded, it&#39;s opened for creating a file section. All processes that opened the same disk file will ultimately have the same cache pages mapped into their space, no matter what filename was used (it could be short filename or path components, or long, doesn&#39;t matter). As long as the file ID is the same (which is Windows equivalent of inode).</p>
<p>But if you want a shared data section, that&#39;s where fun starts. The shared data section is named based on the full pathname of the DLL. Long and short names don&#39;t match. (also, it&#39;s login-session local).</p>

		<p>@Alegr1, it would make sense if only pages backed up by the same dll file are shared across processes. But MSDN says &quot;If a DLL with the same module name is already loaded in memory, the system checks only for redirection and a manifest before resolving to the loaded DLL, no matter which directory it is in. The system does not search for the DLL.&quot; </p>
<p>This seems to indicate that the loader does not load the desired dll if some other ptocess has already loaded a dll with such name, even if this is not the file the application would load by its own regular search when it is the first process that tries to load this DLL (&quot;no matter which directory it is in&quot;).</p>
<p>If this is really done this way, I would call this very unsecure.</p>

		<p>&gt;it would make sense if only pages backed up by the same dll file are shared across processes.</p>
<p>The pages backed by the same file ARE shared across processes, because this is how file mapping works. Some pages are mapped as copy-on-write, which makes a separate copy once the page is modified by the loader. Other pages are read-NX-only, or read-execute-only.</p>

		<p>Alegr1, &quot;ages backed by the same file ARE shared across processes&quot;.

<p>This seems incorrect behavior, or very bad documentation, or both, even if this is only done within the scope of a single process. How should I know if some shell extension (pulled-in by the File Open dialog) loads a DLL with a name which I&#39;m also using for some of my own DLLs?</p>

		<p>&gt;How should I know if some shell extension (pulled-in by the File Open dialog) loads a DLL with a name which I&#39;m also using for some of my own DLLs?</p>
<p>Libraries loaded with two different full pathnames are loaded separately, even if their base filename is the same. Base filename matching is only done when only the filename is specified in LoadLibrary call.</p>
<p>The shell extensions need to use full paths in LoadLibrary call. This will prevent ambiguity. In any case, for libraries other than RTL, you better use the full path, if you want to save trouble.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
