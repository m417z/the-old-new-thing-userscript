		<p>It was nice to see the article about Doug Klunder. It turns out that he went to the same high school I did, and went back to visit while I was still a junior or senior. This was after he left MS but before he decided to become a lawyer. Anyway, we had quite a long conversation.</p>
<p>While discussing the design of Excel, I recall mentioning my disgust for its horrible macro facility. He said that it was actually his fault &#8212; Bill Gates had argued for a macro language based on BASIC, while Doug thought it would be more elegant to use formulas and spreadsheet cells. Unfortunately Doug won that argument and for the next 10 years or so until VBA came around, we were stuck with that horrible macro language.</p>

		<p>&quot;And that&#39;s why you should learn to pick your battles.&quot; OMG, that was awesome. As someone who&#39;s been married for more than a couple of years, I&#39;ve had the opportunity to be involved in idiot-battles myself, though none have ended in Beyonce&#39;.</p>
<p>(Someday I shall have to learn what Windows does instead of the hard-to-discover but somewhat logical Compose and/or ISO_LEVEL3_SHIFT keys. &nbsp;Maybe today, it&#39;s not like I&#39;m really working anyway.)</p>

		<p>In &quot;The Mystery of the Recalcitrant JPG&quot;, I don&#39;t understand, I use 8-bit JPEG images all the time. &nbsp;They&#39;re grayscale. &nbsp;Or am I missing something? &nbsp;The overall point of the article still makes sense though.</p>

		<p>So now Raymond talks about DRM a little bit. No crypto to be found, but he makes the point. If you can read it, you can copy it.</p>
<p>Incidentally the alternate remote client actually exists: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/rdesktop/" rel="nofollow">sourceforge.net/&#8230;/rdesktop</a>, and well enforcing anti-clipboard on a Linux machine is an exercise in futility. (We could probably run win2k&#39;s mstsc.exe under wine so even detecting a hacked remote desktop client is difficult.)</p>

		<p>Concerning the JPEG article, the assertion &quot;There’s no such thing as an 8-bit JPEG image&quot; is actually wrong.</p>
<p>There exist &quot;Grayscale JPEG&quot; files that are really encoded in 8-bit format rather than 24-bit.</p>

		<p>You know, I&#39;ve also seen 4-channel JPEGs produced by Photoshop in CMYK mode, say 10 years ago now. I&#39;ve never understood the logic on that: &quot;Hey, this is a physical document you just scanned in RGB on a cheap consumer flatbed scanner. Obviously, since the source was physical, I should work with it as CMYK, and never mind your output intent!&quot;</p>
<p>Proof I&#39;m not hallucinating or mis-remembering: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/jpeg-faq/part1/" rel="nofollow">http://www.faqs.org/&#8230;/part1</a> question 16.</p>

		<p>That Excel article left me a little disappointed. &nbsp;I am VERY impressed with Excel as a product. &nbsp;Just imagine, as a thought experiment, rewriting Excel yourself. &nbsp;Including the VBA language and all of Excel&#39;s features like charting. &nbsp;I know there were a lot of developers working on it for a lot of years. &nbsp;Such a massive amount of code for $100 is amazing.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
