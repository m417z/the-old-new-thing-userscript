I've written about my colleague Danny
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20161004-00/?p=94445">
before</a>.
He's an accomplished skier,
and one of the things he maintained was
a tradition of going skiing at least once every month.
He jokingly claimed that he held the unofficial record
for consecutive months of skiing.
<a HREF="http://www.seattletimes.com/life/outdoors/snow-obsessed-danny-miller-has-skied-every-month-since-1993/">
A recent profile in the <i>Seattle Times</i></a>
points out that this is a tradition he has been continuing for 23 years.
</p>
<p>
As the article notes, Danny thought he was the only
person with such an unusual streak,
until he discovered
<a HREF="http://www.turns-all-year.com/">
an entire community of like-minded skiers</a>.
</p>
<p>
As the article notes,
whether he holds the unofficial record for consecutive
months of skiing is not really the point,
because every skier sets their own criterion for
what counts as a "day of skiing".
</p>
<p>
As far as I'm concerned, he holds the record.
Not that it really matters.</p>

		<p>A friend of mine has a similar practice with some friends &#8211; they have been water skiiing/wakeboarding at least once every month for the past two years.  He&#8217;s got a great video somewhere with him on a wakeboard and snow on the ground.  We don&#8217;t get much snow in North Carolina, so its something of a miracle both of those events lined up.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
