One subtlety in the use of
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/06/26/647365.aspx">
in-place tooltips</a>
is that you should create the tooltip with the
<code>WS_EX_TRANSPARENT</code> extended style.
</p>
<p>
This style
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/12/30/10110077.aspx">
makes the window invisible to hit-testing</a>,
which is a good thing here.
The code that decides when to show and hide an in-place tooltip goes like
this:
</p>
<pre>
POINT ptCursor;
GetCursorPos();
HWND hwnd = WindowFromPoint(ptCursor);
if (hwnd == the_thing_that_needs_a_tooltip) {
 show_the_tooltip();
} else {
 hide_the_tooltip();
}
</pre>
<p>
If the mouse enters the thing that needs a tooltip,
then we show the tooltip.
If the mouse leaves the thing that needs a tooltip,
then we hide the tooltip.
</p>
<p>
Now let's see what happens if you forget the extended style.
</p>
<ul>
<li>What window is the mouse currently over?
&rarr; The item that needs an in-place tooltip.</p>
<li>Is that the thing that needs a tooltip?
&rarr; Yes: Show the tooltip.</p>
<li>What window is the mouse currently over?
&rarr; The tooltip window.</p>
<li>Is that the thing that needs a tooltip?
&rarr; No: Hide the tooltip.</p>
<li>What window is the mouse currently over?
&rarr; The item that needs an in-place tooltip.</p>
<li>Is that the thing that needs a tooltip?
&rarr; Yes: Show the tooltip.</p>
<li>What window is the mouse currently over?
&rarr; The tooltip window.</p>
<li>Is that the thing that needs a tooltip?
&rarr; No: Hide the tooltip.</p>
<li>...
</ul>
<p>
Oops, the tooltip keeps flashing in and out.</p>

		<p>So this is why in the SQL Management Studio that tooltip flashes like mad.</p>
<p>In the query execution plan window, there might be a &#8220;missing index&#8221; hint in green, the details of which are shown in a huge tooltip if one hovers the mouse over the hint. However the tooltip is impossible to read because it flashes like mad.</p>
<p>I wish the SQL Management Studio guys come across this post one day.</p>

		<p>SSMS really needs a makeover. It&#8217;s still pretty buggy, it&#8217;s huge and takes forever to start up, most of the dialogs are completely broken in high DPI, and many common operations take an unnecessarily long time (like seeing which columns are contained in an index).</p>

		<p>Our solution was to create the tooltip 16px to the right. Also keeps the mouse cursor from overlapping it.</p>

		<p>Windows sends WM_MOUSEMOVE when cursor X,Y remain the same, just window handle containing cursor is changed.<br />
This is what happens here too, tooltip is hidden (cursor is not moved) and Windows sends WM_MOUSEMOVE to<br />
the window beneath and cycle repeats. When HWND containing cursor is changed &#8211; only WM_SETCURSOR should be sent, but<br />
in addition WM_MOUSEMOVE also sent. Not cool!</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
