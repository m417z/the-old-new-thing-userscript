<p>One customer was confused by the two list view hit-test messages <code>LVM_HITTEST</code> and <code>LVM_INSERTMARKHITTEST</code>. What is the difference between the two?</p>
<p> The <code>LVM_HITTEST</code> message tries to find the item the point is <i>over</i>. </p>
<p> The <code>LVM_INSERTMARKHITTEST</code> message tries to find the item the point is <i>next to</i>. </p>
<p> For example, suppose you have two 32&times;32 items, item zero at (0,&nbsp;0) and item one at (0,&nbsp;32). </p>

<th>Coordinates</th>
<th><code>LVM_HITTEST</code></th>
<th><code>LVM_INSERTMARKHITTEST</code></th>

<td>(0,&nbsp;34)</td>
<td>On item&nbsp;1</td>

<p> You use <code>LVM_HITTEST</code> when you the user is dragging something and you want to see what the item is going to be dropped <i>on</i>. For example, your program might ask the user to drag an icon representing a trouble report and drop it onto the icon representing the department the report should be assigned to. </p>
<p> You use <code>LVM_INSERTMARKHITTEST</code> when the user is dragging something and you want to see what the item is going to be dropped <i>between</i>. For example, your program might show a list of customers, and the user can drag a new customer into the list or rearrange the customers by dragging an existing one. The <code>LVM_INSERTMARKHITTEST</code> message tells you where the dropped item should go. </p>
<p> The shell uses both of these hit-test messages when you drop a file into an Explorer window. It uses the Explorer uses <code>LVM_HITTEST</code> to determine whether you're dropping the file onto an item in the folder (hit-test reports an item) or whether you're dropping the file into the folder itself (hit-test reports nowhere). Furthermore, if you're dropping into the folder and Auto-Arrange is enabled, then Explorer uses the <code>LVM_INSERTMARKHITTEST</code> to determine where to place the item after it is dropped. </p>

		<p>Shouldn&#8217;t that be &quot;and Auto-Arrange is disabled&quot;? &nbsp;If it&#8217;s enabled, it doesn&#8217;t really matter where you drag it; Explorer is going to re-arrange it. &nbsp;If it&#8217;s disabled, Explorer is going to put it where you drop it.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
