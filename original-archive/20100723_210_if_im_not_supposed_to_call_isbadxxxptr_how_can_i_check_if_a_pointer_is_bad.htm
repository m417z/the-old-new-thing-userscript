Some time ago, I opined that
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/09/27/773741.aspx">
<code>Is&shy;Bad&shy;Xxx&shy;Ptr</code>
should really be called <code>Crash&shy;Program&shy;Randomly</code></a>
and you really should just let the program crash if somebody passes
you a bad pointer.
It is common to put pointer validation code at the start of functions
for debugging purposes
(as long as you don't make logic decisions based on whether the pointer
is valid).
But if you can't use <code>Is&shy;Bad&shy;Xxx&shy;Ptr</code>,
how can you validate
the pointer?
</p>
<p>
Well, to validate a write pointer, write to it.
To validate a read pointer, read from it.
If the pointer is invalid, you'll crash, and at a predictable
location, before the function has gotten halfway through its
processing (making post-mortem debugging more difficult).
Here are the functions I used:
</p>
<pre>
// Make sure to disable compiler optimizations in these functions
// so the code won't be removed by the optimizer.
void DebugValidateWritePtr(void *p, size_t cb)
{
 memcpy(p, p, cb);
}

void DebugValidateReadPtr(void *p, size_t cb)
{
 memcmp(p, p, cb);
}
</pre>
<p>
To verify that a buffer can be written to, we write to it
by copying it to itself.
Similarly, to verify that a buffer can be read, we read from it
by comparing it to itself.
The result of the operation is not important; we are interested
in the side-effect of the memory access itself.
</p>
<p>
Note that the <code>Debug&shy;Validate&shy;Write&shy;Ptr</code> function
is not thread-safe: If another thread modifies the buffer while
we are copying it to itself, the write may be lost.
But code that does this violates one of the
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/03/20/555511.aspx">
ground rules for programming</a> (specifically the parameter
stability requirements).
Of course, if your function has specific behavior requirements
beyond the ground rules, then that helper function may not
work for you.
I'm just putting it out there as a courtesy.</p>

		<p>From MSDN:</p>
<p>&quot;If the source and destination overlap, the behavior of memcpy is undefined. Use memmove to handle overlapping regions.&quot;</p>
<p>So the DebugValidateWritePtr should use memmove to work as intended, I guess</p>

		<p>(Sorry for double posting, I thought of this just right after clicking &quot;Post&quot;)</p>
<p>On the other hand memmove might do a quick check if src and dst are identical and skip the whole operation. While this is valid for the semantics of memmove it isn&#39;t what was wanted. So using either memcpy or memmove for this purpose will rely on their implementation.</p>

		<p>My C(++) is a bit rusty, but I think you can prevent unwanted interactions with compiler optimizations by using volatile here.</p>
<p>void DebugValidateWritePtr(void volatile *p, size_t cb)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>memcpy(p, p, cb);</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>if that requires casting, wrap this thing in a function that does that casting for you.</p>
<p>I also think you will have to roll your own memcpy and memcmp if you want to prevent the compiler from special-casing these, as a C++ compiler is allowed to know what standard library calls do. (a typical use is in optimizing &quot;for( int i = 0; i &lt; strlen(s); ++i){}&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Someone: If this function is only being used in debugging, it&#39;s usually the case that optimizations are not enabled (not always, but usually). I don&#39;t know about everyone else, but by the time I get around to working with optimized code I have all my debug-only code removed.</p>

		<p>memcpy behavior is undefined, since it relies on the copy direction. for example if you where you shift the following buffer to right by tow items:</p>
<p>1,2,3,4,5</p>
<p>and do it from left to right it would become</p>
<p>1,1,1,1,1,1,1</p>
<p>on the other hand from right to left you get</p>
<p>1,2,1,2,3,4,5</p>
<p>that&#39;s what memmove automatically handles.</p>

		<p>Why don&#39;t the IsBadXxxPtr functions use some kernel functions to check if the memory is valid? (Instead of &quot;try and see if it fails&quot;.) The kernel certainly has the ability to check that somehow.</p>
<p>Apart from that there is no point in using them anyway. If someone passes in valid but &quot;wrong&quot; pointers you might overwrite vital data and then will be crashing anyway somewhere. That&#39;s the callee&#39;s fault, though.</p>

		<p>Given the undefined behavior of memcpy here, and the fact that at least some memmove implementations that Google finds don&#39;t actually do anything if source == dest, C++ templates might be the better idea:</p>
<p>template &lt;typename T&gt;</p>
<p>inline void DebugValidateWritePtr(T* p)</p>
<p>{*p = *p;}</p>
<p>This likely isn&#39;t ideal either &#8212; for non-pointer types it&#39;ll invoke T::operator=, which often will check for assignment against &#39;this&#39; and do nothing &#8212; but at least it&#39;s a start, doesn&#39;t rely on undefined behavior, and will actually perform the write.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it&#39;s C++. &nbsp;I suppose we could use a macro for C:</p>
<p>#define DEBUG_VALIDATE_WRITE_PTR(p) do {*p = *p} while(0)</p>
<p>though not everyone likes heavy use of macros.</p>

		<p>For anyone concerned about the use of memcpy() in an undefined manner or that it might get optimized away (even though both are probably not concerns in the intended debug scenarios), here&#39;s an alternative that should take care of those concerns (I sure hope I didn&#39;t bug this somehow&#8230;):</p>

		<p>Is there any reason why we can&#39;t use memset rather than memcpy?</p>

		<p>So Raymond, are you saying that doing:</p>
<p>int some_func(void *p)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;if (p == NULL) {</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;return E_BADARG;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;}</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;// &#8230; some code &#8230;</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;return E_OK;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>Is also a bad idea/practice? Because a lot of people are writing such code, and they are checking the return value from some_func().</p>
<p>True, the above code won&#39;t catch a stray pointer (the one which is not NULL but is invalid anyway), but if you initialize your variables and return proper values on error you should not have such pointers anyway unless your hardware is broken.</p>

		<p>In addition to the problems with memcpy that others have already covered, that usage is not safe if the function is given a write-only pointer. &nbsp;Granted, those are pretty unusual, but for most &quot;output-only&quot; type functions they shouldn&#39;t be illegal, either.</p>
<p>Igor: explicitly validating parameters within the function is ok if it&#39;s part of the function&#39;s contract that it needs to be &quot;safe&quot; when given null data. &nbsp;If it&#39;s unspecified, or specified to only accept good data, then crashing on being given a null is usually (but not always) the better thing to do, since it&#39;s easier to find a crash than it is to find an error code return value, especially if the app ignores it (as many do).</p>

		<p>@Igor: Miral answered, but I&#39;ll provide an example. I maintain a library of API functions that accept structures of data, some fields of which contain pointers. If a pointer is NULL, I know not to take any action on it, but if the pointer is non-NULL I have to assume that it is valid, and crash otherwise. NULL is a known state, and actionable. Non-NULL has to indicate a valid pointer (leaving out the ugly case of non-NULL flag values).</p>
<p>So, no, testing for NULL is not the same as DebugValidateXXXPtr.</p>

At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
