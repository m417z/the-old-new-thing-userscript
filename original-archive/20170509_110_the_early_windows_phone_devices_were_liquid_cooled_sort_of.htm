shares this story about early Windows phone devices</a>:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
I remember during early development of Windows phones,
our solution to the overheating problems.
You would get two cans of soda from the fridge,
set one on the desk,
set the phone on top of that,
and set the other on top of the phone.
You were then good for an hour or so.
We probably had the only liquid-cooled phones on the planet.

		<p>There is a story from one of the Commodore 128 engineers from when they developing the computer, that the programmer of the CP/M for that computer used to put a metal cup with an ice over the 80 column video chip to have half an hour of development time.<br />
Hey!, The Old Old Thing?</p>

		<p>Perhaps that half hour time was how long it took for the humidity in the air to condense on the outside of the metal cup, drip down onto the circuit board, and short out the IC.</p>

		<p>My laptop&#8217;s fan started misbehaving to the point where it did nothing to cool the laptop and my screen would go all white, so I aimed an external fan at the hottest part of the laptop. It worked long enough to order a new laptop.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s induction-cooled, not liquid-cooled.</p>
<p>But of course, since that type of cooling was not a feature of the phone itself, the phone was neither liquid-cooled nor induction-cooled. It had no cooling features.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve done similar things with a regular Android phone &#8211; while playing certain games or playing content on a TV via a Slimport adapter the phone would get quite warm if the phone was charging at the same time. I was quite worried that this would cause the battery to wear out faster among other issues, so I&#8217;d get a regular zip-lock bag filled with room temperature water and place in under the phone. It worked really well because of the huge contact area and the fact that it takes a lot of heat to notably raise the temperature of a 100ml of water.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
