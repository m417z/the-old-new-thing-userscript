Last time, we dragged some text around</a>
and found that the text would be interpreted as a URL if you
dropped it onto Firefox,
but Internet Explorer was not as willing to accept it.
Today, we'll make the data object work for Internet Explorer.
</p>
<p>
The only change is that we have to provide the URL in the
form of a <code>CFSTR_SHELLURL</code> clipboard format
rather than as <code>CF_TEXT</code>.
Take the program from last time and make two changes.
First, use the handy-dandy search-and-replace function to
change <code>DATA_TEXT</code> to <code>DATA_URL</code>
throughout.
(This step isn't technically necessary, but it's nice to have
the name match its usage.)
The real work happens in this change to the constructor:
</p>
<pre>
CTinyDataObject::CTinyDataObject() : m_cRef(1)
{
  SetFORMATETC(&amp;m_rgfe[DATA_URL],
               RegisterClipboardFormat(CFSTR_SHELLURL));
}
</pre>
<p>
That's all; just change the clipboard format from
<code>CF_TEXT</code> to <code>CFSTR_SHELLURL</code>.
It is important to note that <code>CFSTR_SHELLURL</code>
represents an ANSI string.
Since
"<a HREF="http://rfc.net/rfc1738.html#s2.2.">URLs
are written only with the graphic printable characters
of the US-ASCII coded character set</a>,"
there is no loss of expressiveness by restricting to ANSI.
</p>
<p>
Run this new program and now you can click in the client area
and drag/drop the (invisible) object onto Internet Explorer,
where it will navigate to Microsoft's home page.
(If your system supports Active Desktop, you can also drag/drop
the invisible object to the desktop and create an Active Desktop component.)
</p>
<p>
Okay, so we have one version of the program that can drag
a URL to Internet Explorer, and another version that can
drag a URL to FireFox.
Next time, we'll combine them to have a single data object
that can drop to both.
It's quite embarrassingly simple (because I planned it that way).</p>

<p>I am not able to open this URL through IE.</p>
<p>I could see a rectangular box inplace of 月, and title bar says &quot;Invalid syntax error&quot;.</p>
<p>That means IE does not except UNICODE, and as per Raymond (or the link he mentioned) that is correct, so your URL is really invalid.</p>

		<p>You have to use IDN to encode a hostname containing characters outside the 7-bit-ASCII range, when you look up that name in DNS. &nbsp;So no, you can&#8217;t drop those characters as a CFSTR_SHELLURL onto IE, either: you have to drop the IDN-encoded version instead.</p>
<p>(The IDN-encoded version is what FF shows in its status bar: xn--sailer-183m.com is the host name.)</p>
<p>mvadu: I bet if you typed in the IDN-encoded host name, it would work in IE as well. &nbsp;Not that users should be required to do that, of course, but allowing IDN encodings causes other grief too, so it&#8217;s not all bad that IE doesn&#8217;t work with it. &nbsp;(How do you tell paypal.com apart from xn--pypal-4ve.com when your browser renders the IDN version using its native Cyrillic, but your font shows the same pixels for the ASCII &#8216;a&#8217; and the Cyrillic &#8216;a&#8217;? &nbsp;(The characters are homographs.) &nbsp;That was the basis for one of the patches to Firefox a few years ago.)</p>

		<p>Oh right, so the shell on a fully Unicode-enabled OS doesn&#8217;t have the foresight to support IRIs (like, for example, when IE happens to have full support for them)?</p>

		<p>Yes, and IE 7 will nag you to upgrade to IE 7. &nbsp;IE 6 on Win2K will nag you about upgrading to IE 7. &nbsp;If only there were some way the IE 7 upgrade site could detect which browser I was already using&#8230;</p>

		<p>I looked into Unicode URLs a couple of weeks ago and there seem to be at least three ways of encoding them, all incompatible with each other (and some impossible to tell apart from each other without some additional knowledge). It&#8217;s a mess.</p>
<p>Even more so since the URL may be understood by the browser but then handed off to an ActiveX control (or whatever) which assumes a different Unicode URL format, or doesn&#8217;t support non-ASCII URLs at all.</p>

		<p>The homographs issue was solved on the domain registrar&#8217;s side and on the browser side. domain registrars now refuse to accept most homographs and the browsers all warn if the URL contains homographs.</p>
<p>Since 月 is not a homograph to another character in another encoding (sadly, 1 and l and I are not consider homographs for domains), there is no warning.</p>

		<p>No, I definitely don&#8217;t trust them to do the right thing. It&#8217;s why I am glad some browsers (Safari, IE7 after I complained about the above example not working) do the right thing about homographs.</p>

		<p>Firefox displays IDNs in their real format only for specific TLDs, where the registrars have put active mechanisms for the avoidance of homographs in place. This includes, for example, the .at TLD, but not .com.</p>
<p>If I copy the above URL and paste it in the address field, Firefox will indeed convert it to its Punycode form <a href="http://xn--sailor-183m.com/imgs/blingedout.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://xn--sailor-183m.com/imgs/blingedout.jpg</a> .</p>

		<p>@Mike:</p>
<p>Actually, I run IE 6, IE 7 and the IE 8 b1, but I hadn&#8217;t actually checked what the status of full support for IRIs was in the respective versions, so I left my options open in the comment :)</p>
<p>My point really was that a big deal was made about NT being Unicode-capable, and yet the shell forces you to encode URLs as ANSI strings—it was readily conceivable even back in 1995 (prior to IE and Windows being integrated) that Internet resources could, at some point, be addressed using characters outside of the ASCII character set (perhaps not for domain names, but resource paths, queries and anchors), and so it seems to be an artificial restriction—it should have been IE&#8217;s job to say “actually, I can&#8217;t navigate to this location as it&#8217;s not a supported URL”, just as it would if you&#8217;d typed it into the address bar, rather than the shell&#8217;s job to say “Ha! Don&#8217;t even think about trying to encode *that*”.</p>

		<p>&gt; &#8230; Since 月 is not a homograph with another encoding.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that it checks whether certain *characters* are homographs. &nbsp;(That depends on the font that&#8217;s in use.) &nbsp;It checks the TLD instead, and only allows certain supposedly &quot;known-good&quot; TLDs.</p>
<p>(Now, that raises the question of how the registrars determine what characters might be homographs, so they can disallow a registration. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t know; I&#8217;m not sure it&#8217;s possible in general. &nbsp;Sure, there are Unicode code points that have a high likelihood of looking similar to Latin letters, and you can disallow those. &nbsp;But there are lots of other character pairs that may or may not look the same as each other, depending on the font, and it&#8217;s not limited to just Latin letters either.)</p>

<p>Why do we even need unicode urls? I&#8217;m sorry, but too bad if you are using an obsolete language. Internet was invented and pioneered by the west, thus Latin1 should remain the de-facto standard for urls. Sorry, if this seems mean, but seriously, if we didn&#8217;t already have enough to deal with then to remember Kanji or Big5 encoded urls&#8230; Time to enter the 21st century far-east, ideographic languages are dead. We don&#8217;t want your millions of useless glyphs polluting uri namespace!</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
