In the suggestion box, Serge Wautier asked
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#513265">
why accelerators for hidden controls remain active</a>.
He's apparently rather insistent because he
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/09/19/762058.aspx#762297">
asked the question again a few months later</a>.
Asking the same question multiple times reduces the likelihood
that I'll answer it.
Consider yourself lucky that I wrote this answer before I noticed
the duplicate; otherwise I would probably have skipped it.
</p>
<p>
Why are accelerators for hidden controls still active?
Very simple: Keyboard accessibility.
</p>
<p>
The dialog manager considers controls which indicate
that they want characters
(<code>DLGC_WANTCHARS</code>)
to have no keyboard accelerator.
There are a lot of controls that fall into this category,
including such popular ones as edit controls,
combo boxes, and list boxes.
The traditional way of giving these "no accelerator" controls
an accelerator is to stick a static control on front of it
with the desired accelerator:
</p>
<pre>
    LTEXT           "Ca&pacity:",IDC_STATIC,7,6,31,9
    COMBOBOX        IDC_CAPACITY,7,40,150,300,
                    CBS_DROPDOWNLIST | WS_VSCROLL | WS_TABSTOP
</pre>
<p>
But what if you don't want a label to appear in front of
the control?
For example, the General property page of a file
begins with an unlabeled edit control that contains the name
of the file.
You might have a dialog that contains a list view that you don't
want to label because its meaning is implied by other controls
on the page or by the page layout.
</p>
<p>
The answer is to hide the label control but leave it enabled.
This keeps the accelerator active,
allowing the user to press the accelerator to put focus
on the edit control or list view or whatever,
but removes the actual accelerator indicator from the screen.
</p>
<p>
This means that if you want to take a control off the dialog
because you don't want the user to invoke it at all,
merely hiding it won't be enough, since the accelerator is
still active.
In addition to hiding the control, you also have to disable it.
(Alternatively, you could destroy the control.)</p>

		<p>&quot;if you want to prevent Raymond from posting on some topic you don&#8217;t like, just ask him twice and he won&#8217;t write about it &quot;</p>
<p>Ideally.. But today though in the post he mentioned chances of getting an answer by asking the same question are less, indeed he answered twice. So if we follow this approch we might end up getting multiple answers..</p>

<p>Because the previous n versions of the software had a visible Capacity label, and some users now have &quot;Alt-P gets me to the capacity dropdown&quot; ingrained; the fact that it&#8217;s no longer on screen doesn&#8217;t help, because people don&#8217;t actually read what&#8217;s on screen; the fact that the documentation has been updated doesn&#8217;t help, because people don&#8217;t actually read documentation.</p>
<p>If Alt-P stopped working, these users would say the latest version was &#8216;broken&#8217; and hate you.</p>

		<p>Apparantly &quot;hidden&quot; and &quot;disabled&quot; are not synonyms. Who&#8217;ld a thunk it?</p>
<p>Also, the visible control can still have this newfangled thing called a &#8216;tooltip&#8217; that probably has enough space for a word or two, and even an &quot;(Alt-P)&quot; tacked on at the end to indicate that pressing &quot;alt&quot; and &quot;p&quot; would do something useful. Then people who care can experiment and find out what it does, and people who prefer to use the mouse can ignore it. Its a wonderful system.</p>

		<p>I tend to use &quot;quick keys&quot; for the underscored characters in dialogs and menus. And call accelerators the more &quot;global&quot; things like Ctrl+S.</p>
<p>A rule of thumb: an accelerator is stored in an accelerator table.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve heard the underlined characters referred to as access keys. I agree with accelerators being the name of those shortcut keys that are equivalent to menuitems but without having to open the menu, e.g. Alt+F4 for Close.</p>

		<p>Is your GUI disappearing? A worrying trend in UI design. Steveg investigates.</p>
<p>First accelerator underlines, some as young as 18 pixels, &nbsp;were wiped off the face of the screen, disappearing without leaving a trace. Police have yet to file charges, hampered by constant rumours of their fleeting reapperance.</p>
<p>Next in this series of dastardly crimes, entire menus, yes menus, my friends, disappeared off the screen. &quot;Interpol explored every nook and cranny,&quot; explained the Inspector in a winsome voice, &quot;but we have found nothing. The missing menu has devestated people across the world.&quot;</p>
<p>Police say they&#8217;re looking into ALTernative areas of investigation.</p>
<p>Next week, Steveg investigates crop circles in Office 14.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d love to know why someone thought it was a good idea to, in NT5, hide, by default, accelerators until the invocation key (alt) was pressed, but somehow not notice or care that this same key was always also a menu invoker. The end result being, you can&#8217;t ever see the accelerators for menus with this (default) setting.</p>
<p>And you wonder why developers don&#8217;t give a damn about things like accessibility?</p>

		<p>Although the underscores are not visible by default in Windows, they are easy enough to enable, and they work as they always did.</p>
<p>And I think some developers/some companies do care about accessibility.</p>
<p>I have recently moved to Office 2007. Still puzzled by the UI. At some point I wanted to paste something as text. And I could not find the option. But then I realized this is something I did already several times. Just did not know how.</p>
<p>Then I have discovered it: the old quick-keys still work. Alt-E (Edit) S (Past Special), and it&#8217;s ok. I did it mechanically (muscle memory). Never seen the new option (still no clue how to find it).</p>
<p>So: ++ for keeping the quick keys working, &#8212; for the UI design :-)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
