<p>One category of application that people complained about is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/20/9435239.aspx#9436619"> the application launcher which keys off a hotkey</a> and doesn't get the foreground love.</p>
<p> Well, except that windows with registered hotkeys <i>do</i> get the foreground love. </p>
<p> After you call the <code>RegisterHotKey</code> function to register a hotkey, the window manager will send you a <code>WM_HOTKEY</code> message when the user presses that hotkey, and along with it, you will get the foreground love. If you call <code>SetForegroundWindow</code> from inside your hotkey handler, the foreground window will change according to your instructions. </p>
<p> A <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/20/9435239.aspx#9436633"> special administrator-only list of programs which are exempt from <code>SetForegroundWindow</code> rules</a> would just be adding another round to the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/16/73780.aspx"> game of walls and ladders</a>. All that'll happen is that programs, when they install, will place themselves in the <i>Exempt from the normal rules</i> list, and you're back where you started. </p>
<p> "Oh no, I'll super-protect that registry key so that the only way to add an entry to it requires a human being to respond to a dialog box confirming that the entry is being added." </p>
<p> Well, for one thing, that doesn't actually stop installers with administrator privilege, since they can just remove the super-protection and update the key anyway. (Administrator privilege is like that.) And even if you somehow manage to super-protect the setting (how? beats me), the next stage is application vendors (or system administrators attempting to deploy the application across their company) asking for a programmatic way to add their program to your super-protected list of exemptions. And then you're back to where you were. </p>

		<p>This strikes me as a solved problem. We already have code signing tools. What we&#8217;re missing is that oh-so-small leap from &#8220;signed by the developer&#8221; to &#8220;signed by the administrator&#8221;. No one can add the special magic without the admin&#8217;s private key (and passphrase if he chose to protect that key). Programmatic access &#8212; solved (but the app must use a certificate co-signed by the admin or it doesn&#8217;t enable the restricted behavior).</p>
<p>The only catch is that you must lie to the app and prevent it from asking &#8220;Do I have advanced rights enabled&#8221;, otherwise every two-bit developer will demand that you sign their app as part of the install process. &nbsp;(But better yet just make Microsoft products install without the signature and thus set the expectation high for third-party developers&#8230; much of the problem with software not installing and running in a limited account is that the role models don&#8217;t)</p>

		<p>&quot;All somebody has to do is find a program which is already signed for SetForegroundWindow, inject a thread, and call SetForegroundWindow from there.&quot;</p>
<p>Of course, if you can inject a thread, you can get the current foreground process to call AllowSetForegroundWindow for you, too. &nbsp;Not that I&#8217;ve ever done that or anything.</p>

		<p>The amusing thing about this set of rules about foreground taking, etc, is that there are very valid circumstances for doing this. &nbsp;Not in the &quot;home user&quot; type environment, but in the &quot;workflow&quot; type environment. &nbsp;Here you have a suite of applications, not necessarily integrated well, and you have valid business workflow reasons to be adjusting which application is on top.</p>
<p>There does not exist a set of rules which will satisfy all environments and requirements.</p>

		<p>@Anonymous Coward et al: open source let&#8217;s you change stuff by code or download.</p>
<p>Only if you can be bothered, and only until the next update undoes your work. At some point you give up patching stuff and just accept it Out Of The Box(tm). Also, that theory is fine at home, but when you work in a a tightly controlled environment, it becomes less feasible (but not impossible).</p>
<p>Approximately on the topic: Hubris is amazingly common in IT (presumably other fields, I don&#8217;t really know): This new app/website/feature/etc is The Most Important Thing Ever. People seem to, in general, suffer from a lack of perspective about where their app/website/feature/etc fits into the greater whole. Generally, and it&#8217;s sad to say, you&#8217;re just not that important.</p>

		<p>All a program really has to do is sendkey(&quot;%${TAB}&quot;) (I chose ALT+SHIFT+Tab{I think %$ are right I am not looking at the code} because then you scroll from the back side and don&#8217;t have to deal with the crazy push it twice to get out beyond the two most recent apps problem) until you notice the desired form got focus, but that&#8217;s my hack fu and when you sleep for 5ms between each sendkey you don&#8217;t really even notice it happen. &nbsp;Please don&#8217;t break my program! :P</p>

		<p>Perhaps I wasn&#8217;t clear in that last post, but a hotkey (button) was just one example of a legitimate user-configured application launcher.</p>
<p>Even there, I was mostly talking about those magic buttons sitting up at the top of your laptop keyboard that aren&#8217;t even always/usually reported to the OS as keystrokes of any kind, much less registered hotkeys.</p>
<p>In my case, in addition to the above, we have user-configurable TouchPad buttons, tap zones, and/or &quot;press here to temporarily convert your TouchPad into a bunch of lit-up application launcher buttons&quot; with app launcher functionality.</p>
<p>None of which have anything even remotely to do with hotkeys, registered or otherwise.</p>
<p>Now, in theory, I could call RegisterHotKey and then inject that key in using SendInput (assuming that even works, particularly if an elevated app has the keyboard focus). However, whatever hotkey I select to register might be one that the user already has defined for themselves. That&#8217;s pretty baroque, though.</p>
<p>SwitchToThisWindow works a lot better (at least for now :-).</p>

		<p>I too would love to hear the life story of the previously undocumented function SwitchToThisWindow &#8212; how/why it came about, and how it finally ended up becoming a documented and supported method of bypassing all the rules put forth by the other window order functions.</p>
<p>It seems like it might have been a case of &#8220;So many bloody apps depend on this undocumented functionality that we may as well just document it to prevent mass breakage.&#8221; &nbsp;More interesting though would by why it was written in the first place. &nbsp;Any insight Raymond?</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s why I said in the previous post that it should be a blacklist, not a whitelist. &nbsp;Let any program have the foreground love by default, but allow the user to blacklist the suckers if they abuse it.</p>
<p>And yes, a program could explicitly remove itself from the blacklist, but it seems less likely to me that this would occur in the wild, except for programs that are being intentionally evil. &nbsp;And those could be locked out if there was an administrative-level blacklist in addition to the user-level blacklist &#8212; the app running as limited-user (or unelevated admin) wouldn&#8217;t be able to de-blacklist itself from the admin blacklist (although its installer could).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
