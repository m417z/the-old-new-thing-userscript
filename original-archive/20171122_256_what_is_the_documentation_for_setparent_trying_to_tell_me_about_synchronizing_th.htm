<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms633541(v=vs.85).aspx">
The documentation for the
<code>Set&shy;Parent</code> function</a>
says
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
When you change the parent of a window,
you should synchronize the UISTATE of both windows.
For more information, see
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646342(v=vs.85).aspx">
<b>WM_CHANGE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</b></a>
and
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646361(v=vs.85).aspx">
<b>WM_UPDATE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</b></a>.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
What does that mean?
</p>
<p>
Recall
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130516-00/?p=4343">
how the
<code>WM_</code><code>UPDATE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</code> and
<code>WM_</code><code>CHANGE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</code> messages work</a>.
When keyboard indicators need to be shown or hidden,
the control that initiates the change sends itself a
<code>WM_</code><code>UPDATE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</code> message.
This message propages up the window tree.
When it reaches the root of the tree,
the message converts to a
<code>WM_</code><code>CHANGE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</code> message
and propagates down the tree.
</p>
<p>
There is an optimization here:
If the desired keyboard state is already present,
then message propagation stops,
because there's no point telling people to change something
to what it already is.
</p>
<p>
However, this optimization assumes that every window in the tree
has the same state to begin with.
</p>
<p>
Let's see what happens if you violate this assumption.

<p>
Observe that keyboard indicators are shown in A and B,
but they are hidden in C.
This is not a valid window configuration,
but let's run with it and see where it takes us.
</p>
<p>
Suppose focus is on C and you tap the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key
to show keyboard accelerators.
</p>
<p>
Window C sends itself a
<code>WM_</code><code>UPDATE&shy;UI&shy;STATE</code> to request
that keyboard accelerators be turned on.
This message propagates up the tree to window A.
Window A then says,
"You woke me up from my nap for this?
Why are you asking to show accelerators?
Accelerators are already visible!
Stop wasting my time."
And the message processing stops.

Result: C still doesn't get any keyboard accelerators.
C is a sad window.
C makes an appointment with a therapist.

<p>
The remark in the documentation is trying to tell you that
if you are moving windows between parents,
and the new parent has a different UI state from its adopted child,
then you have two problems:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The UI state is inconsistent within the top-level window,
    so your window looks weird.</li>
<li>The UI state will not be properly updated,
    so your window acts weird.</li>
</ol>
<p>
Okay, so you get it.
It's important to get the two UI states in sync.
But how do you do that?
We'll start looking into that next time.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
That section of the documentation was written by someone
who understands the window manager so deeply that they
assume everybody else understands it to the same degree,
expecting that
"synchronize the UI state" is something the reader would
comprehend immediately.
(And as we'll see next time, somebody who has never
actually tried to synchronize the UI states of two windows,
because if they had tried, they would have realized that accomplishing
the task is harder than an offhand remark would suggest.)</p>

		<p>Ooh. I&#8217;d have thought sending WM_QUERYUISTATE to the new parent and then sending two WM_CHANGEUISTATEs to the child (one to clear everything then one to set whatever QUERY returned) should be sufficient. Is there some raciness here that I&#8217;m not considering?</p>

		<p>Why does this optimisation exist? The only time I can see it would avoid unnecessary work is when the UI state is already inconsistent within a window tree, which you said is invalid anyway, and in which situation the optimisation produces the bug you describe. If the whole of the tree is in a consistent state, then whichever window would send the initial WM_UPDATE­UI­STATE knows the state of the whole of the tree just by examining itself and needn&#8217;t send either message in the first place.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about the mechanisms of Windows UI so is there something I am missing?  Is it to allow things that send WM_UPDATE­UI­STATE to be dumber by making the &#8220;root&#8221; window smarter?</p>

		<p>Making every control check its own state (&#8220;Let me send myself a <code>WM_QUERYUISTATE</code> message and see if the thing I want to do is already done&#8221;) would force everyone to do the same bit of work, instead of letting the system do it. If you make things hard for people, they usually won&#8217;t bother doing it.</p>

		<p>Raymond I think you mixed up the WM_UPDATE­UI­STATE and WM_CHANGE­UI­STATE messages, the former travels down and the latter up the tree.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
