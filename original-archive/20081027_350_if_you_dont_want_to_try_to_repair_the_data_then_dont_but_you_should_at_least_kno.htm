<p>When I wrote about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/12/463977.aspx"> understanding the consequences of <code>WAIT_ABANDONED</code></a>, I mentioned that one of the possible responses was to try to repair the damage, but some people are <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/12/463977.aspx#464099"> suspicious of this approach</a>.</p>
<p> Mind you, I'm suspicious of it, too. Repairing corruption is hard. You have to anticipate the possibility, create enough of a trail to be able to reconstruct the original data once the corruption is recognized, and then be able to restore the data to some semblance of consistency. I didn't say that this was mandatory; I didn't even say that it was recommended. I just listed it as one of the options, an option for the over-achievers out there. </p>
<p> For most cases, attempting repair is overkill. But <i>you still have to know that something went wrong</i>; otherwise, one crashed program will lead to more crashed programs as they try to operate on inconsistent data. The purpose of the article was to raise awareness of the issue, based on my observation that most people blindly ignore the possibility that the mutex was abandoned. </p>

		<p>Yep, one of the problems is that a process termination can happen at any instruction, so you&#8217;d have to disassemble the code to see the exact combination of states that the structure can get into. That is why atomic instructions are so important.</p>

		<p>You could also use some transactional system like the following ad-hoc solution:</p>
<ol>
<li>Get the mutex</li>
<li>
<p>If WAIT_ABANDONED, check for any &quot;left over&quot; data structure and repair it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Before doing any changes, just record what you want to do. You have to record the state before, or the state afterwards. When this record has been written successfully, mark it as complete (setting one bit might suffice, or putting a pointer into it into the data structure).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now, perform your changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>release the mutex.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>If you get WAIT_ABANDONED, you know that another user has just crashed. Thus, in step 2, you can either recreate what was there (if the stored state is the state before), or perform the changes &quot;the other one&quot; wanted to perform (if the stored state is what should have been changed). After performing it, mark the information as &quot;incomplete&quot; before proceeding with step 3.</p>
<p>Note, however, that this is an ad-hoc solution; there might still be some race I did not think about yet. Note also that you have to make sure that the compiler does not interfere by its optimisations or changes to the order of executed operations.</p>
<p>Note also that undoing the anticipated changes might be easier than completing them.</p>
<p>This is one solution of the form Raymond named as &quot;transactional&quot; above.</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
