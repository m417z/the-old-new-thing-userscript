Some relatives from Vancouver, British Columbia came to visit,
and we mentioned that when we fly out on vacation for spring break,
we found that the airplane tickets are much cheaper if we drive
up to Canada and fly out of Vancouver International Airport.
On the other hand, they noted that when they fly out on vacation for
spring break,
they found that the
airplane tickets are much cheaper if they drive
down to the United States and
fly out of Bellingham International Airport.
(They don't come all the way down to Seattle, but hey,
work with me on the title, okay?)
</p>
<p>
So how can it be cheaper to drive from the United States to Canada
to catch a flight,
while also being cheaper to drive from Canada to the United States?
</p>
<p>
This violation of the trichotomy of numbers perplexed
one of my relatives.
Did we take the exchange rate into account? (Yes.)
</p>
<p>
And then the light bulb turned on.
</p>
<p>
The Vancouver and Seattle school systems
have spring break at different times!
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_break#Canada">In mid-March</a>,
Vancouver public schools go on spring break,
but Seattle schools are still in session, so there is
higher demand for vacation travel in Vancouver than in Seattle.
And then
<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spring_break#United_States">
a few weeks later</a>,
the Seattle schools go on spring break,
and the demand flips.
In both cases,
you are comparing prices in a
high-demand region to those in a low-demand region,
which is why the prices are lower in the airport far away from you.
</p>
<p>
I'll be on vacation next week for spring break,
but I've left the blog running on autopilot.
To increase the likelihood that it's still working when I get back,
I scheduled a bunch of boring topics for next week.</p>

		<p>It flies on autopilot, but there is usually still a human pilot in the seat. But next week, it&#8217;ll be flying with no human backup.</p>

		<p>When you do that, check out the taxes on your tickets.  A Canadian flying out of the US on an American airline (say from Seattle to Burlington, VT, to visit friends in Montreal) will pay Canadian taxes on that ticket.  Similarly, an American flying from a Canadian airport will pay American taxes.</p>
<p>We&#8217;re ex-Canadians and long-time Texans.  We were visiting relatives in Montreal, and then took a side trip to Nova Scotia on Air Canada.  We were surprised to see American taxes on that flight coupon.  Tax treaties are complicated.</p>

		<p>&#8230; Tax treaties are complicated. &#8230;</p>
<p>We developers call that &#8220;job security.&#8221; As long as legislatures are human they&#8217;ll continue to invent convolutions so illogical that only another meat-CPU can hope to teach silico-CPUs how to handle them mostly correctly.</p>
<p>&#8230;  I hope!!  :)</p>

		<p>Talking about plane fares&#8230;</p>
<p>I heard that sometimes it&#8217;s way cheaper (&gt; HKD3000 difference) to fly from Hong Kong to Shanghai, stay a day or two, then fly to Japan instead of taking direct flight or have transition in Shanghai or Taiwan. It&#8217;s worthwhile to do research for a day or two on all possible routes when you&#8217;re tight on budget, or prefer to spend more on shopping instead of the flights.</p>
<p>Journey planning is difficult.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
