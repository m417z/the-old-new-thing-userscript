In my discussion of the effect of ASLR
on DLL rebasing, I wondered how
vtables and other function pointers were handled
in position-independent code.
Commenter kantos replied,
"<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170120-00/?p=95225#comment-1281115">It appears from a cursory google search that</a>&hellip;"
</p>
<p>
I wanted to find out more, so I did some searching
but couldn't find anything, so I asked for help with that
cursory search.
</p>
<p>
"It was GCC PIC C++ which didn't get me to the answer directly,
I had to go through
<a HREF="http://stackoverflow.com/a/967055/332733">
the SO question that was the second result</a>
to get to
<a HREF="https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/dsohowto.pdf">
this document</a>
by Ulrich Drepper, and then skim through until page 29
where it describes what's done in the virtual table case."
</p>
<p>
Okay, so I had to issue a Google search, click the
<i>second</i> result,
then go to the <i>second answer</i> (not the accepted answer),
click a link enigmatically called
"the document referenced by 0x6adb015",
download the resulting 45-page PDF,
and read through to page 29.
</p>
<p>
This doesn't strike me as a "cursory search".

		<p>Hopefully you now understand that there&#8217;s no value in subcommunicating how easy it was for you to get the answer to a question.  Nobody&#8217;s interested in hearing you brag about your cleverness&#8230;. all you have to do is answer, and provide a link to further details if it&#8217;s suitable.</p>

		<p>I will point out one important thing. Just because kantos found finding what he wanted easy, it is a bit of a push to equate that to bragging about cleverness.<br />
I know that I also had this kind of habit where I would feel that if I could find something easily, then everyone should. This is your subjective view influencing how you see things, nothing more.</p>

		<p>When <i>I</i> use the phrase &#8220;cursory Google search,&#8221; I&#8217;m not trying to make myself look clever at all.  I&#8217;m trying to communicate that I don&#8217;t actually know what I&#8217;m talking about (because I&#8217;m just parroting what Google told me).</p>

		<p>Yes; I suspect what is being attempted to be conveyed here is &#8220;I did some clicking around via search engines, and found some stuff that I&#8217;m copying here, but it was getting to be too much work to actually feel like I could become completely informed on the topic.&#8221; That is, saying &#8220;cursory&#8221; was precisely *because* it was looking like the research wasn&#8217;t simple, and thus one didn&#8217;t feel like it was an exhaustive search.</p>
<p>Now, &#8220;cursory&#8221; may not be the best word to convey that concept. It&#8217;s trying to emphasize &#8220;here&#8217;s what I can find after only a few minutes of research&#8221;, rather than &#8220;it will only take a few minutes of research&#8221;. I&#8217;m not sure what a better single-word choice would be offhand.</p>
<p>Communication is difficult.</p>

		<p>Well, perhaps, you&#8217;d have felt differently about what a &#8220;cursory web search&#8221; is if you had tried researching the notability of a subject for Wikipedia, which entails finding &#8220;significant coverage in reliable secondary sources that are independent of the subject itself.&#8221;</p>
<p>In comparison, yes, that DOES strike as cursory to ME.</p>

		<p>When I studied thermodynamics in the dark ages we used a textbook from the ambitiously named &#8220;Course in Theoretical Physics&#8221; by Landau and Liftshitz, translated from the original Russian. When they said it was easy to show how you got from one equation to the next, you knew you were in for a world of pain trying to replicate their results, and our instructor took perverse pleasure in asking us to do so!</p>

		<p>&gt; This option only makes sense for shared libraries and you&#8217;re telling the OS you&#8217;re using a Global Offset Table, GOT. This means all your address references are relative to the GOT, and the code can be shared accross multiple processes.</p>
<p>It also ensures that the main executable isn&#8217;t subject to ASLR, so yes please keep telling people that so we can always find us some good ROP gadgets at a known address for any not completely trivial program.</p>

		<p>In my mind, &#8220;cursory&#8221; implies &#8220;quick, or simple, and sufficient&#8221;, and is enough to justify what follows.</p>
<p>&#8211; &#8220;That is, saying “cursory” was precisely *because* it was looking like the research wasn’t simple, and thus one didn’t feel like it was an exhaustive search.&#8221;<br />
Then &#8220;cursory&#8221; is not the right word, because the research was not simple or sufficient.  </p>
<p>&#8211; &#8220;When I use the phrase “cursory Google search,” I’m not trying to make myself look clever at all. I’m trying to communicate that I don’t actually know what I’m talking about &#8221;<br />
Using &#8220;cursory&#8221; does not communicate &#8220;I don&#8217;t know what I am talking about&#8221;.  Better to use a word that does not imply &#8220;sufficient&#8221;.  Even better, if one does not know what they are talking about, <b>simply</b> say nothing. </p>
<p>-&#8220;“it appears” and “cursory” are not intended to be literal but as disclaimers &#8221;<br />
&#8220;Cursory&#8221; is not a disclaimer, it is a qualifier, it implies that something can be done quickly, and sufficiently.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
