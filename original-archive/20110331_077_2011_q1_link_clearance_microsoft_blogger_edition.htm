The story reminds me of my own random-neighbor incident     from the time before     I burst onto the public stage with this Web site.     I was chatting with a friend on the front lawn of the house     he recently purchased, and a passer-by stopped by to say hello     to the new neighbor on the street.     My friend casually introduced me as "Raymond" but the     remark drew no particular reaction.     When the conversation concluded,     the gentleman took his leave and headed back down the street,     but he stopped, looked at me, then pointed at me     with a sort of dawning     realization, saying,     "Hey, you're Raymond Chen." </li>

		<p>Wow, that Communicator Team one really had me confused. &nbsp;&quot;IM an Expert for Lync Server 2010 can help connect experts in an organization&#8230;&quot; &nbsp;You are an expert? &nbsp;Why the missing apostrophe? &nbsp;And why the bad syntax and capitalization? &nbsp;Oh, I get it, it&#39;s talking about something called &quot;IM an Expert&quot; where &quot;IM&quot; is a verb and the whole thing is a program title, hence it&#39;s a noun phrase. &nbsp;Wow. &nbsp;My verbal parser just exploded.</p>
<p>Would have been much better to write something like &quot;The &quot;IM an Expert for Lync Server 2010 program&quot; can help &#8230;&quot;</p>

		<p>A couple of links down I ran into another instance of reported Schrödenbug (the guy encountering them logged it as Heisenbug because he doesn&#39;t know what it is). The biggest &quot;what if&quot; I can imagine for us is &quot;what if Schrödenbug is real?&quot;</p>

		<p>@Mike: It&#39;s not, you pronounce it /aɪ ɛm/ (am is /əm/, or maybe /æm/). Although this might be one of those clever written puns that just flies over my head because US speakers use only two vowel sounds.</p>

		<p>Wow, those comments on the &quot;how to file a Visual C++ bug&quot; are &#8230; amazing.</p>
<p>I filed a bug against the free version of Visual C++ once, which was, &quot;This 20 lines of C++ code throws this error and here is why I think the C++ standard says it should work, and if I put in this illegal-by-the-C++-standard workaround, it seems to work but then of course it doesn&#39;t work in my other compilers.&quot;</p>
<p>And I got a response along the lines of, &quot;Yup, we agree: That&#39;s a bug. &nbsp;The code that implements that stuff is intricate and horrid to try to fix bugs in without creating worse bugs, and this is clearly a deep corner case, so this is a wontfix &#8212; sorry.&quot; &nbsp;Which, considering the context, seemed entirely reasonable to me &#8212; I mean, I work for a compiler company, and I *know* how grotty C++-template-parsing code gets, and what kind of support we&#39;re able to give our non-paying users. &nbsp;I really appreciated that the support engineer took the time to confirm that it was a bug, and gave me a clear answer about whether I could expect a fix or would have to depend on my workaround as a permanent thing.</p>
<p>Anyhow, thanks for the links!</p>

		<p>Unfortunately, the one VC++ bug that would bite us occasionally, we could never report. &nbsp;Under some rare circumstances, it seems like the preprocessor or lexical analyzer would back up one character, so a line like:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;foo = bar;</p>
<p>might end up being treated like:</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;foo = baar;</p>
<p>It only happened mid-way down some large file or other. &nbsp;Our solution was that if the build broke because of it, we would add a long comment to the line before, to move the bug into the comment. It still worries me that it might have hit a spot in the code (like a minus sign!) where it would have compiled bad code silently. Looking back, I should have checked the preprocessed file to see if the problem was there.</p>
<p>Is there place I can go to look at fixed bugs to see if it got fixed in VS 2008 or 2010? From the searching I&#39;ve done, I think I&#39;m only seeing the highlights, and this is a minor obscure one.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
