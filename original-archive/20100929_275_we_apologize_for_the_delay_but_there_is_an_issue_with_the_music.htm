<p>After the opening work of the <a href="http://www.seattlesymphony.org/symphony/buy/single/production.aspx?id=9008&amp;src=t&amp;dateid=9008"> Seattle Symphony concert last Saturday night</a>, the orchestra members rearranged themselves to play the Foote, but conductor <a href="http://www.seattlesymphony.org/symphony/meet/conductors/schwarz.aspx"> Gerard Schwarz</a> didn't come out onto the stage. The delay grew and people started wondering what was going on.</p>
<p> An announcement was made over the public address system: "We apologize for the delay, but there is an issue with the music." </p>
<p> This only created more confusion. What does "an issue with the music" mean? </p>
<p> Eventually, Schwarz took the podium and explained what happened. It turned into a game of good news/bad news. "The good news is that one of the orchestra members was so dedicated that even after two concerts, he wanted to practice the piece some more. The bad news is that he left the music at home. Fortunately, he doesn't live far away, and he has his part in the Brahms memorized, so we will play the Brahms now and perform the Foote after the intermission." </p>
<p> And just for the record, my impressions of the concert, since you didn't ask. </p>
<ul>
<li>Schwantner <i>The Poet's Hour</i>:     Calm, soothing music from the orchestra is rudely disturbed     by dissonant music from the violin soloist. </li>
<li>Brahms <i>Symphony #3</i>: No real surprises. </li>
<li>Foote <i>Francesca da Rimini</i>:     I was pleasantly surprised by this piece.     It was actually rather nice. </li>
<li>Prokofiev <i>Piano Concerto #2</i>:     While technically impressive,     I understand why this piece     <a href="http://www.symphonyinc.org/performances/program-notes/february-6-2010">     received a hostile reception at its premiere</a>. </li>
<li>New hairstyles (and colors)     for the concertmaster and principal second violin. </li>
</ul>

		<p>Obligatory Monty-Python-related comment: In an episode of &quot;Fawlty Towers&quot;, Basil is in the hotel office listening to the Brahms 3rd symphony, when Sybil passed through. &nbsp;She is not a fan of classical music. &nbsp;&quot;Honestly, Basil,&quot; she says, &quot;I don&#39;t know how you can listen to that racket,&quot; and she walks out.</p>
<p>He shouts after her, &quot;Racket? &nbsp;RACKET? &nbsp;It&#39;s BRAHMS! &nbsp;Brahms third racket!&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;ve long been a fan of all five Prokofiev piano concerti, each for its own reason. &nbsp;The third is, of course, the most well known and most readily accessible.</p>

<p>Musicians tend to add a crapload of annotations to their own copy; it&#39;s better for everyone involved that they use it.</p>

		<p>I did that once in my community college jazz ensemble.</p>
<p>Better than the time the piano player left his music behind after a gig and was unable to recover it.</p>

		<p>The resulting concert order made much more sense than the original anyway. They used the same order on the Sunday repeat. But I remain impressed by an orchestral player who has Brahms 3 memorized.</p>
<p>I simply cannot understand the Prokoviev, so even this thunderous performance left me cold.</p>

		<p>&gt; I remain impressed by an orchestral player who has Brahms 3 memorized</p>
<p>This is a &quot;workhorse&quot; piece which gets played a *lot* (by contrast, this post is the first I had heard of Arthur Foote.)</p>
<p>Although we&#39;re not given the identity of the player, we can infer they&#39;re not (say) a violist because otherwise they could read off of their neighbour.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
