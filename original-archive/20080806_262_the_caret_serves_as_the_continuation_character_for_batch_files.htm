		<p>I use this ^</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;all ^</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;the ^</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Of course, I have to deal with batch scripts that call binaries with huge numbers of arguments (I&#8217;m looking at you, wttcl.exe)</p>
<p>Wish list: allow a blank line to terminate the chain (putting a caret on the last of the command allows for easy copy/paste/add/delete arguments; much like allowing a comma after the last element of an array in C.)</p>

		<p>kewl! I kinda hoped cmd.exe would have something like that.</p>
<p>Now if only there was a way to use a variable as a name for another variable&#8230; If I enable delayedexpansion, !foo_%bar%! works, but then if I do &quot;echo Error!&quot;, it only prints &quot;Error&quot;&#8230;</p>

		<p>Bryan:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve always viewed Batch as a language that no one man can ever fully understand. There will always be some quirk, some parser exploit-become-feature, or some trick that creates a whole new way of doing things.</p>
<p>Much like the universe, if anyone ever <em>does</em> fully come to understand Batch then the language will instantly be replaced by an infinitely weirder and more complex version of itself. This has obviously happened at least once before ;)</p>

		<p>It is remarkable what the choice of the forward slash for switches in CP/M-80 has caused!</p>
<p>Because of that, MS-DOS used backslashes in pathnames.</p>
<p>Then because of that, backslashes can&#8217;t be used for continuations in batch files.</p>

		<p>@Roger: The &quot;/&quot; wasn&#8217;t used as an option character by CP/M or the programs supplied with it. It <em>was</em> used by Microsoft&#8217;s programming languages for CP/M, but I don&#8217;t know where they got the idea.</p>

		<p>@Roger:</p>
<p>Batch files predate directory hierarchies. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Thanks to Google Books, I find <em>Operating Systems</em> by William Stalling. &nbsp;Page 80 says:</p>
<p>&quot;&#8230;Microsoft developed DOS 2.0, released in 1983. &nbsp;It contained support for the hard disk and provided for hierarchical directories. &nbsp;Heretofore, a disk could contain only one directory of files, supporting a maximum of 64 files.&quot;</p>
<p>DEC lines of computers tended to have &quot;/&quot; as the switch character. &nbsp;Directories were described (roughly) as DISK:[DIR.SUBDIR]FILE.EXE with appropriate defaults to make like simple. &nbsp;The first BASIC that Gates wrote was on a DEC machine, so he may have already had a fondness for / as a switch character.</p>

<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>DCL (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIGITAL_Command_Language" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DIGITAL_Command_Language</a>) also allowed (required? I forget) you to omit a space between a command and its slash-delimited options. &nbsp;Hence &quot;CREATE&quot; created a regular file, while &quot;CREATE/DIRECTORY&quot; created a directory. &nbsp;I suspect that was the inspiration for the similar feature of DOS built-in commands, wherein &quot;dir /w&quot; and &quot;dir/w&quot; are equivalent.</p>

		<p>The reason so many microcomputer operating systems used DEC syntax was that DEC was the most successful and respected maker of minicomputer operating systems. &nbsp;In the late 70s and early 80s, TOPS and VMS set the standard that everyone else copied. &nbsp;It wasn&#8217;t just Bill Gates &#8212; OS designers who&#8217;d never used a Digital machine kept copies of the TOPS manuals on hand to provide guidance.</p>
<p>Whenever discussions of Microsoft&#8217;s design choices come up nowadays, there&#8217;s often this implicit assumption that Unix ruled the world and those micro weirdos flagrantly disregarded the &quot;standard&quot; use of backslash, signals, newlines, etc. &nbsp;Not true &#8212; instead, Unix was considered a bizarre niche product. &nbsp;Hard to use, easy to port (if you didn&#8217;t care about the details), quick to crash, and promising amazing power to those willing to grok its low-level mysteries: in short, Unix was FORTH.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s only because C and shell scripting included so many Unix-specific assumptions (&quot;n denotes the end-of-line character,&quot; etc.), and they spawned so many modern programming languages from Java to Perl, that people have come to imagine that these things are so ubiquitous they must be eternal computer science principles.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s why I really like articles about the batch file language. &nbsp;Cryptic and crippled it may be, but it reflects a true parallel stream of evolution that never copied from Unix. &nbsp;Powershell is great, but it sure looks like it&#8217;s picked up on the Unix assumptions for everything from environment variables to option syntax. &nbsp;Unlike Kildall and Gates, Powershell&#8217;s authors weren&#8217;t running to the DEC Command Language to settle design issues.</p>

		<p>Daev,</p>
<p>Jeffrey Snover has cited VMS DCL as an inspiration for PowerShell; &nbsp;PS owes more to it than to any Unix shell.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m 45 and have been in IT since IBM was the &quot;evil empire&quot; and it is hard if not impossible to overstate Digital&#8217;s influence on the computer world. &nbsp;That&#8217;s something the average twentysomething Linux bigot will never realize.</p>
<p>Also remember that MS *did* hire Dave Cutler.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
