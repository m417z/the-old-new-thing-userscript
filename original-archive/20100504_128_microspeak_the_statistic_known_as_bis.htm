<p>I learned this term from a chart presented at a team meeting. It contained a column labelled <i>BIS</i>. When asked what those letters meant, the team manager explained that it's an abbreviation for <i>butts in seats</i>. Everybody in the room instantly understood. It is the number of <i>actual human beings sitting at desks doing work</i>.</p>
<p> When doing project planning, you sometimes get carried away with the imaginary people who would be working on your project someday, treating them as if they were real people: coming up with features for these imaginary people to work on, projecting how many bugs these imaginary people will fix, looking forward to the funny stories these imaginary people will tell when you go out for a beer after work. </p>
<p> This is all ridiculous, of course, because imaginary people don't write code or fix bugs or buy you a pint of beer after work. </p>
<p> You need to base your calculations on actual human beings and not imaginary people. That's why you work with <i>butts in seats</i> and not <i>empty seats</i>. Sure, you have two open positions on your team, and you have every intention of hiring people to fill them over the next few months, but until there are butts in those seats, those people are still imaginary, and they're not doing any work, so you shouldn't count them in your charts. </p>

		<p>For once an intelligent management term. How many times has someone said we&#8217;ll give these tasks to the new developer. only to find 4 months have gone by with no one hired and the tasks are either left undone, assigned to someone who is already overloaded, etc.</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t tell you how many times over the years that I referred to my imaginary friends in project planning/review meetings w/ my management. It helped them &quot;get&quot; that the plan had two parts, one was the fantasy-based-on-wishful-thinking about what real people already present in the org could do, and the other was the &quot;upside&quot; possible if our imaginary friends were reified somehow. It allowed us to discuss moving features from one bucket to the other, and sometimes made them laugh a little during usually painful discussions.</p>

		<p>@Hardware Junie and David Walker:</p>
<p>I agree that &#8216;reified&#8217; is a great word. I&#8217;ve always liked it. For me it conjures up a combination of magic and science; creating something from nothing (or an idea).</p>
<p>Sorry for the continued thread drift; back to butts in seats&#8230;</p>

		<p>Mark: That episode aired in February 2004, so it predates this post enough to qualify as the possible inspiration for the BIS nomenclature.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Butts in seats&#8221; is an awful term for that metric. Personally, I would use &#8220;actual bodies&#8221; or &#8220;real people.&#8221; </p>
<p>To me, (and surfing around a bit online, I see I&#8217;m not alone), &#8220;butts in seats&#8221; has always meant exactly that and nothing more &#8211; someone sitting in the chair. Not writing code, not debugging or running QA, not buying beers &#8211; just a butt in the seat. </p>
<p>This article: <a href="http://www.certmag.com/read.php?in=2868" rel=nofollow target=_new rel="nofollow">http://www.certmag.com/read.php?in=2868</a></p>
<p>talks about &#8220;butts in seats&#8221; referring to those large services companies whose only goal is to maximize the manpower on a contract &#8211; the number of &#8220;butts in seats&#8221; no matter what they&#8217;re doing. </p>
<p>I also worked with a guy who was positive that our management ran metrics on &#8220;Butt-hours per week&#8221; because all they seemed to care about was how long we were in the office; not what we produced or who did what. The key to advancement was about spending twelve hours a day in the office, not actually writing code. </p>
<p>The inverse of &#8220;butts in seats&#8221; would be &#8220;productivity&#8221; &#8211; actual work done. </p>

		<p>Butts in seats is a pretty common term in workforce management, particularly in the callcenter industry. &nbsp;It refers to those in their seats taking calls &#8211; not on break, lunch, in the bathroom, in training, meetings, etc.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m reminded of another Microspeak I&#8217;ve heard: BOL. It stand for &quot;Butt On Line&quot;, and refers tpo the person who is in charge on a certain project, and would have to provide answers in case it fails &#8211; the person who put his butt on the line for this project.</p>
<p>Project Managers: Remember that even when a theoretical headcount turns into an actual BIS, its contribution isn&#8217;t immediately equal to existing team member. Actually, initially the contribution is negative, as he draws time from team members for ramp-up.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
