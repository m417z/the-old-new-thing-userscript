<p>
A report arrived on an MS-DOS game that crashed
when run on Windows 95.
Mind you, the game ran for quite a while before finally
keeling over.
The repro steps were
"Start the game, then go to City 1,
then City A,
then City Alpha,
then City &#x13000;,
then City &#x26c4;.
When you go to City &#x26c4;,
the game crashes."
</p>
<p>
I gotta say: Our testers were quite thorough.</p>
<p>
<p>
The reason for the failure is that the program
saw too much EMM memory.
</p>
<p>
Well, not exactly.
</p>
<p>
Each time you move to a new
city, the program tries to allocate some more EMM
memory.
Under normal conditions,
it runs out of EMM memory at some point
and presumably starts swapping data out to disk.
</p>
<p>
What happens when run under Windows 95 is that
when you move to the fifth city,
the program makes its 65th request for EMM memory.
And under Windows 95, the call succeeds,
because Windows 95 tries to be all awesome like that.
The program then saves that EMM memory handle into
a table.
The table is a fixed size.
</p>
<p>
That fixed size is 64 EMM handles.
</p>
<p>
The program worked when running under MS-DOS
because the MS-DOS EMM386 driver defaults
to 64 EMM handles,
so when the program makes its 65th request for EMM
memory, it gets the error "no more EMM handles available."
But when run under Windows 95,
the program successfully allocates a 65th EMM handle,
then adds it to the array,
resulting in a buffer overflow.
And just our luck, the variable stored
immediately after the array holds the
location of the EMM page frame.
</p>
<p>
As a result, when the program tries to copy memory
into or out of the EMM page frame,
it instead copies memory into and out of some
random address.
This quickly leads to scrambled memory
and the program crashes spectacularly.
</p>
<p>
Of course, once you know what the problem is,
the fix is simple:
Limit the program to at most 64 EMM handles.</p>

		<p>On a completely unrelated note&#8230; I&#8217;m intrigued why DebugBreak() stopped working in Windows 8. Back in Windows 7 for DebugBreak() to launch Visual Studio debugger we needed to turn off Windows problem reporting but with Windows 8 that doesn&#8217;t help either. Do you know whay it is so? Sometimes when troubleshooting a native Windows or COM service there&#8217;s nothing as eficient as seeding DebugBreak().</p>

		<p>This program could have had a problem with more than just EMM386: according to the spec, 64 handles was the *minimum* required, but up to 255 handles (128 in EMS 3.2) were allowed. Looking at an old issue of PC Magazine from 1989, most EMS boards allowed you to configure up to 255 handles, although there were some broken implementations that supported less than 64 handles (EMM386 can be configured with as few as 2 handles if you really want.)</p>
<p>As to why the program hardcoded a 64-entry array, it appears that EMS 3.2 didn&#8217;t have any way of finding the maximum handle count (<a href="http://nersp.nerdc.ufl.edu/~esi4161/files/dosman/chap10" rel="nofollow">http://nersp.nerdc.ufl.edu/~esi4161/files/dosman/chap10</a>); EMS 4.0 introduced INT 67/5402 (GET HANDLE DIRECTORY/GET TOTAL HANDLES SUBFUNCTION), but it doesn&#8217;t seem to be used much.</p>

		<p>Sure, the app doesn&#8217;t know the maximum, but it could have said &#8220;Whoa, my table is full. Don&#8217;t ask for any more. I won&#8217;t have anywhere to put it!&#8221;</p>

		<p>&gt;I guess you must know different game developers than I do…</p>
<p>That is statistically certain. However I don&#8217;t believe my experience is unique. I&#8217;ve been told that trying to handle unforeseen circumstances is heavily frowned upon by. If you spend time and memory trying to handle a situation that you cannot test then how can you be sure that you&#8217;ve handled it correctly?</p>
<p>The situation is even worse now that a game only needs to barely work before it&#8217;s mastered and the first online update will be published before it hits the shelves. Sometimes the strategy doesn&#8217;t pay off, sometimes it does.</p>

		<p>Maybe the DOS game was intended to be run from a boot disk, and had it configured for the number of handles it wanted.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t uncommon to see multiple boot configurations on DOS.  It wasn&#8217;t uncommon to have to boot off the first disk on DOS.  It was common enough that eventually, Microsoft added a command line tool to load Himem and Emm386, because some things wanted them, some things didn&#8217;t, and some things wanted specific switches.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a while, but I seem to recall a push / pop as well &#8212; but that may have been QEMM and/or PC-DOS as well, IBM had a lot in PC Dos 7 that Microsoft did not.</p>

		<p>Considering that the game involved cities, and what I know of popular DOS games that involved cities, none of them involved boot disks or asked their users to create them (or shipped bootable disks for that matter).</p>

		<p>I had a debugging experience a bit like that. A program that quit almost silently as soon as it was run. I could just tell that something was flashing up before it quit, I eventually ran it enough times quickly enough that I noticed &#8216;buffer overflow&#8217; before it quitting and clearing the screen. Knowing what to look for, I spooled the screen output to disk and noticed the string &#8216;Disk free&#8217; just before it quit.</p>
<p>Turns out it was reading the disk free space and trying to display it as some fixed number of digits. The user just happened to have a huuuuuge 110M drive and the authors hadn&#8217;t anticipated trying to display a free space larger than 99,999,999 bytes. Easy solution: a startup script that created a 10M dummy file to drop the free space below 100M.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
