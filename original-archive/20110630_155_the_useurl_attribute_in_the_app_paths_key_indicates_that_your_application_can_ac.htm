<!-- CONTENT START -->
<p>Setting the <code>UseUrl</code> attribute in your <code>App Paths</code> key indicates that your application can accept a URL on the command line as the document to be opened. The <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/ee872121.aspx"> documentation for this attribute</a> is a confusing blend of raw documentation, guidance, history, and an example. Let's tease the parts apart so you won't confuse the example with the contract.</p>
<p> The raw documentation is simple: Setting <code>UseUrl</code> indicates that your application can accept URLs on the command line. </p>
<p> The guidance is that programs like Web browsers should set this attribute because opening URLs is the primary reason for their existence. But it's not just Web browsers; any program which can open documents directly from the Internet can set this attribute. Another category of programs that often falls into this category is media players, since it is common for media players to play content directly from a URL as well as playing content from a file. </p>
<p> The example given in the documentation of a component which uses this attributes is Web Folders: If you are browsing a WebDAV folder and right-click on a file stored on the Web server, the Open command will be made available if the application registered to handle the file marks itself as <code>UseUrl</code>. If not, then the user will have to download the file and open the downloaded copy. </p>
<p> The history is that this attribute was invented by the Web Folders team, and for a long time, they were the only component which used it. The <code>UseUrl</code> attribute went under-documented for a long time because the shell documentation team <i>didn't know that this attribute existed</i>. The Web folders team simply made it up and didn't tell the shell team that they were extending a shell feature. </p>
<p> The Internet Explorer team discovered this "feature from another planet" when they went about implementing the "Edit" button in their toolbar and wondered why some HTML editors worked and others didn't. The shell team also discovered this feature and retroactively added support for it in a few places, such as in the <code>Shell&shy;Execute</code> function if you try to open a document via URL. If the handler is not marked as <code>UseUrl</code>, the <code>Shell&shy;Execute</code> function will download the document to a local file and invoke the handler on the local copy. </p>

		<p>I was curious as to which applications set the UseUrl attribute, so I peeked in regedit. &nbsp;It seems none of the browsers I have installed (IE, Firefox, Chrome) set this attribute. &nbsp;In fact, no application installed on any of my machines (XP, Vista, and Windows 7) has UseUrl. &nbsp;There are a couple of other undocumented attributes, but no UseUrl.</p>

		<p>Only a single param url?</p>
<p>Or can the args be more complicated with multiple urls, embedded urls, and parts of urls?</p>

		<p>I guess SharePoint had nothing to do with it. :)</p>
<p>But I wish other browsers would pass the URL to Office apps when opening SharePoint docs. It&#39;s a show stopper for using Chrome in our company.</p>

		<p>Shocking! People who work on the OS don&#39;t know things about it. That&#39;s why features get lost probably in &quot;upgrades&quot;. Absolutely shameful. The Web Folders team (does it even exist now) didn&#39;t even create a 64-bit Web Folders component when creating XP Professional x64/Vista x64. They have &quot;deprecated&quot; the component codenamed Rosebud.</p>

		<p>Wonderful! This story reminds me my current job! When I was browsing our subversion repository some days ago, I&#39;ve found undocumented classes that was similar to ones I&#39;ve written in my current project) Interesting that our organisation has two (!) wiki sites with developers&#39; documentation, and there is no any mention about that lost classes.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
