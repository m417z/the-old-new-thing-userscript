<p>
A customer discovered that if their program used the
<code>Set&shy;File&shy;Time</code> function to set a network file's
creation, access, or modified time to the specific value of
"midnight on January 1, 1980",
then the corresponding timestamp is removed.
What's up with that?
</p>
<p>
As you may recall, midnight on January 1, 1980 is
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20051028-29/?p=33573/">
a special sentinel value</a>:
It is the epoch for the MS-DOS time/date format.
</p>
<p>
At this point, I believe the responsible thing to do is
to speculate irresponsibly.
</p>
<p>
It appears that the network server they are using is
trying very hard to accommodate MS-DOS clients.
In particular,
if somebody tries to set a file timestamp to midnight January 1, 1980,
the server assumes that the client is trying to clear
the timestamp.
</p>
<p>
Explorer is one of those accommodating programs.
If it sees a file whose timestamp is exactly
January 1, 1980 at midnight, then it assumes that
the timestamp came from a FAT filesystem
(possibly tunnelled through other file systems along the way,
like a network redirector),
and treats it as equivalent to a missing timestamp.</p>

		<p>I wonder how the customer &#8220;discovered&#8221; this.  Why is he setting the file times to that value in the first place?  </p>
<p>There are more important things to worry about!  Although, I suppose knowledge is always a good thing.</p>

		<p>Nothing nefarious here.  The customer probably just accidentally passed zero to SetFileTime (instead of some real value), observed the weird Explorer behavior, traced it back to SetFileTime, and then gave up and asked Microsoft for help.</p>

		<p>If you check the link you see &#8220;January 1, 1601 = The value 0 as a Win32 FILETIME. &#8221; so January 1, 1980 is a perfectly valid FILETIME. Explorer showing this time as  is a bug in my book.</p>

		<p>If you decide to show January 1, 1980 as a genuine timestamp, then you introduce a new bug: Explorer shows files with no timestamp on FAT volumes as having a bogus timestamp of January 1, 1980. FAT volumes were kind of important in 1995.</p>

		<p>I see this more of a limitation than a bug. But how can a file have &#8220;no timestamp&#8221; anyways? Can you somehow remove the time stamp(s) of files in FAT? Can you have files that are never created/modified/accsessed? It make no sense to me.</p>

		<p>Tell that to the POSIX folks. POSIX doesn&#8217;t have creation timestamps. (It has last access, last modified, and last status change, but no creation.)</p>

<p>If this were really important to deal with, shouldn&#8217;t it be dealt with in the FAT layer, so that Explorer never sees &#8220;January 1, 1980&#8221; for these files?</p>

		<p>There are legitimate reasons why people would like to set a file&#8217;s timestamp pre-1980. For example, users with historical pictures may want to set the file timestamp to match the date that the (original) picture was taken. I believe Explorer&#8217;s details view doesn&#8217;t show pre-1980 timestamps because its cached data doesn&#8217;t have the full information and can&#8217;t retrospectively be changed. Explorer&#8217;s file properties dialog shows the correct range of FILETIME values.</p>

		<p>This post is very confusing. Can you clear the file times with Set­File­Time? Arent&#8217;t the filetimes always there, builtin the file metadata? Docs for Set­File­Time says nothing about clearing.</p>

		<p>They didn&#8217;t clear the timestamp. They basically set it to 0. Raymond said: &#8220;Explorer is one of those accommodating programs. If it sees a file whose timestamp is exactly January 1, 1980 at midnight, &#8230; and treats it as equivalent to a missing timestamp.&#8221;</p>
<p>&gt;Arent’t the filetimes always there<br />
I would hazard to guess that this is dependent on the source file system. Not everything is stored locally, and non-local storage isn&#8217;t always a Windows server with NTFS.</p>

		<p>It may not be available even on local storage. Say, I have ext3fs IFS installed on my system. (File creation time stamp is added on ext4fs <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4#Features" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ext4#Features</a> )</p>

		<p>Similar hypothesis: a number of buggy programs set the timestamp to zero which showed January 1st 1980 for a bunch of files. Someone complained and since it&#8217;s pretty unlikely for a file to have an actual timestamp of zero, someone decided not to show the date in that situation</p>

		<p>BTW: Tried SetFileTime with empty FILETIME for all 3 args. SetFileTime return true but the files time stamps are not changed (bug: SetFileTime should have returned false).<br />
Tried setting with dwLowDateTime = 1 and then times are set to ‎1. ‎januar ‎1601, ‏‎01:00:00.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s been a long time, but I&#8217;m pretty sure this behavior goes back to MS-DOS 5 (and maybe even earlier.)  For files with a date/time stamp of 0, the DIR command would display a blank instead of 1980-01-01 00:00.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
