<p>I'm probably the only person who uses the "News for dummies" links in the navigation pane on this page, and now I'm going to use them even less. The <a href="http://www.sr.se/p4/klartext/"> Swedish news for dummies</a> recently became available <a href="http://www.sr.se/cgi-bin/p4/klartext/artikel.asp?nyheter=1&amp;ProgramID=493&amp;Artikel=829830"> in podcast form</a> [<a href="http://www.sr.se/Podradio/xml/p4_klartext.xml">RSS</a>], joining the <a href="http://www.dw-world.de/dw/0,,2146,00.html"> German news for dummies</a>, which has been available <a href="http://www.dw-world.com/dw/article/0,2144,1833641,00.html"> as a podcast</a> [<a href="http://rss.dw-world.de/xml/podcast_langsam_gesprochene_nachrichten">RSS</a>] since the beginning of the year. (Both the Swedes and Germans have, of course, other <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/07/18/439940.aspx"> podcast</a> offerings beyond the news for dummies.)</p>
<p> Of the two, I prefer the Swedish news for dummies. The German news for dummies is still your standard news report, but spoken m-i-n-d &nbsp; b-o-g-g-l-i-n-g-l-y &nbsp; s-l-o-w-l-y. Which means I can hear every syllable clearly without actually understanding anything, since they still use all that fancy German vocabulary. The Swedish news for dummies, on the other hand, proceeds at a methodical (as opposed to mind-numbing) pace and, more importantly, explains the news using simpler words, words which I am much more likely to know. </p>
<p> (What's the lesson here? I dunno. If you want to speak Swedish with me, talk like those Klartext folks. if you want to speak German with me, do <strong>not</strong> talk like those folks over at Deutsche Welle's Langsam gesprochene Nachrichten because I won't understand you. But your best choice is probably English, since your English will be about twenty times better than my Swedish or German.) </p>

		<p>Hi Raymond,</p>
<p>I just wanted to point out that in German, &nbsp;possesive forms of proper names are built without using an apostrophe. </p>
<p>Now, from the structure of the sentence in question, I&#8217;d say that the German part is probably supposed to begin with &quot;langsam&quot; while the &quot;Deutsche Welle&#8217;s&quot; part is supposed to be English &#8212; but just in case it ain&#8217;t, you should at least change it into &quot;Deutsche Welles&quot;, or, better yet, &quot;der Deutschen Welle&quot;.</p>

		<p>Thanks, Schwallex, but as you noted, the only German part was the &quot;Langsam&#8230;&quot;. If I had wanted the other part to be German as well, I probably should have used the dative case on &quot;gesprochenen&quot;&#8230;</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s fantastic, Raymond, I had never noticed those two links before. &nbsp;I gave up on learning German some time ago, but maybe I should give it another go. &nbsp;You don&#8217;t know of a similar resource for French by any chance, do you?</p>

		<p>If the regular Deutsche Welle news readers aren&#8217;t bad enough, there was one who managed to speak about twice as slowly as the others making it entirely incomprehensible. Each syl-la-ble was pro-nounced se-par-ate-ly so that by the end of the sen-tence the start was en-tire-ly for-got-ten. I suspect someone had a quiet word to her since they&#8217;re all fairly consistent now albeit, as noted, not the quickest.</p>

<p>Actually this is the intended behaviour. But you can switch from the German (Germany) to the German (IBM) keyboard layout, where the number keys aren&#8217;t affected by CAPS LOCK

		<p>Well I gathered it was &quot;intended&quot;, but I still think it is silly. Logical, yes, but from a usability standpoint is a mistake (it depends whether you consider it a caps lock or shift lock, I guess). Thanks for the German (IBM) tip, I&#8217;ll change it right now.</p>

  <br />I remember some english speaking people that happily repeated a phrase a dozen times, but never got the idea of going slower, or use a different wording.</p>

  <br />cool!<br />
  <br />(But I guess the german/germany has this setting because of the ! and ?)

		<p>Watch out, Raymond. &nbsp;The phrase &quot;for Dummies&quot; is a registered trademark of Wiley Publishing and they will most likely send you a threatening letter if they see you using it (see my URL for example).</p>
<p>As for learning German via the Deutsche Welle news, I found it quite easy going. &nbsp;Mind you, living in Germany and hearing the language around me every day is a huge help aswell.<br /></p>

		<p>Raymond Chen compares two radio broadcasts aimed at non-native speakers, one in Swedish and one in German. He observes that the Swedish broadcast focuses on using simple words, while the German one accommodates non-native listeners by speaking really</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
