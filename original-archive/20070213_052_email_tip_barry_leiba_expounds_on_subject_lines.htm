		<p>I would like to add that using abbreviations other than the most extremely common ones for your project in subject lines should be considered an anti-pattern. &nbsp;Think about the fact that the email&#8217;s value to your email archives, desktop search, other people&#8217;s email archives, etc. will probably greatly outweight its value in the immediate term, and the trade-off from taking two seconds to make sure your using canonical forms of words vs. time saved searching archives is worth it.</p>

		<p>In our agency we work on various projects, so i find it useful to write the project title first (one word only, usualy the clients or the brands name) followed by the e-mails subject. That makes it easier to scan the inbox.</p>
<p>Why is it, that the typical &quot;URGENT, URGENT, URGENT&quot;-mail always comes from accounters? Ofcourse they never forget that little extra red flag of urgency. Jeez.</p>

		<p>Agh. Accounts people. A microcosm of the &quot;we don&#8217;t get software, therfore it&#8217;s not important&quot; thinking is when you get a business doc from them ( account codes, expense rules) and it&#8217;s called &quot;Charge Account Codes (Final).xls&quot;. Like they will never change it ever? The next revision is then either the same name again, with a big slice of &quot;I don&#8217;t see what the problem is&quot; or &quot;Charge Account Codes (New).xls&quot;.</p>
<p>Sigh.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
