<p>As I noted <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/04/13/9994760.aspx"> some time ago</a>, there's a mailing list devoted to chatting among people who work in a particular cluster of buildings. It's not a technical support mailing list, but people will often ask a technical question on the off chance that somebody can help, in the same way that you might ask your friends for some help with something.</p>
<p> Of course, one consequence of this is that the quality of the responses is highly variable. While there's a good chance that somebody will help you with your problem, there's also a good chance that a technical question will receive a highly unhelpful response just for fun, in the same way your friend might respond to a question with a funny but unhelpful answer. (And there's also a good chance that a technical question will get <i>both</i> types of replies.) You don't complain about this because, well, that's what you sort of expect when you use this mailing list. </p>
<p> An illustration of this principle comes from the following thread: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> When I do ABC, I get XYZ. How do I get DEF? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> A short while later, the same person replied to his own question. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Nevermind. I found the right mailing list to ask this question. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> That didn't stop somebody from responding: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> This mailing list is the correct place to send all questions. You have to use a different mailing list to get answers, though. </p>
</blockquote>

		<p>I like how the funny response actually mirrors the form of the original question if you read ABC as &quot;post to this mailing list&quot;, XYZ as &quot;a funny response&quot; and DEF as &quot;answers&quot;.</p>

		<p>I remember on one of the internal mailing lists at MSFT for gamers (is gamrchat still up?), many of the replies would be image macros. So not only were they unhelpful but also confusing to people who didn&#39;t follow internet memes.</p>

		<p>On a particular bulletin board during my university days (Groggs if you must know), any question that started &quot;Does anybody know…&quot; would automatically get the simple response &quot;Yes&quot; (or very occasionally, &quot;no&quot;). To avoid this, you had to prefix your question with SWITCH NOBOYDIE (or SNB for short).</p>

		<p>Most requests are framed in such a way that a smart alec can intentionally misinterpret them. Many involve a terse reply of &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.</p>
<p>Request: Could you help me with X?</p>
<p>Response: Yes&#8230; would you like me to?</p>
<p>Request: Do you want to go to the movies or go for a walk?</p>
<p>Response: Yes</p>

		<p>Once upon a time, there is someone who post a question &quot;What is the slave of cards?&quot; (rough translation from Chinese &quot;甚麼是卡奴呢?&quot;) on a Linux board. This lead to all kinds of funny answers like:</p>
<ul>
<li>That&#39;s someone who apply lots of credit card in order to buy Linux books because of his tremendous thirst of Linux knowledge, but later cannot pay the debt?</li>
<li>
<p>Card collection specialist for &quot;Good guy card&quot; (We call the failure of making some girl agreeing to be your girlfriend &quot;receive good man card&quot; because of a very common response of &quot;You are a good guy, but I&#39;m not your cup of tea&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Someone who loves Linux and apply credit cards in order to buy lots of tools in order to write drivers for Linux, but later cannot pay the debt?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Program/Application stuck(&quot;卡住&quot;) so you have to solve the problem like a slave.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There&#39;s more, but just 8 of it marked for the board and it&#39;s very funny.</p>

		<p>@Joshua</p>
<p>Epic confusion time ensues:</p>
<p>A) Would you like a tea or coffee?</p>
<p>B) No.</p>
<p>[&#8230;]</p>
<p>B) Could you grab me a hot drink; either a tea or a coffee, I don&#39;t mind which.</p>
<p>A) I thought you said you didn&#39;t want one.</p>
<p>B) I said I didn&#39;t want a tea OR coffee, you didn&#39;t ask about tea XOR coffee.</p>
<p>I would personally like to avoid one of the outputs of tea OR coffee</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t get it. If tea XOR coffee is true then by definition tea OR coffee is also true.</p>

		<p>Paul is translating &quot;Would you like a tea or coffee&quot; as the following logical query:</p>
<p>T = the event that I am served tea</p>
<p>C = the event that I am served coffee</p>
<p>L = the event that I am happy</p>
<p>A: (T v C) =&gt; L?</p>
<p>B: False, because (T ^ C) =&gt; ~L</p>
<p>On the other hand, XOR is satisfactory</p>
<p>A: (T != C) =&gt; L?</p>
<p>B: True. Both (T ^ ~C) =&gt; L and (~T ^ C) =&gt; L</p>
<p>Logically XOR is still vulnerable to the problem that A might serve B, say, tea, while at the same time stepping on B&#39;s toe&#8230; thus disproving B&#39;s assertion.</p>

		<p>@Maurits:</p>
<p>You just need to redefine L as &quot;the event that I am happy with the state of my beverages&quot;. Specificity is good.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
