<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/22/4500831.aspx"> Holding the shift key when calling up a context menu</a> is a convention for indicating that you want to see additional advanced options which are normally hidden. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/22/4500831.aspx#4510836"> One of those options is <i>Pin to Start menu</i></a>. What is this doing as an extended command?</p>
<p> The <i>Pin to Start menu</i> command normally appears on the context menu of a program or a shortcut to a program. The Start menu pin list was intended to be a launch point for programs, so if the item you pick isn't actually a program, the <i>Pin to Start menu</i> item will be hidden. Furthermore, only items on the local hard drive will show <i>Pin to Start menu</i>. This avoids ugliness if the user accidentally pins <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/12/29/9941779.aspx#9942073"> a file on a network drive</a> or removable media, and the network is down or the removable media is removed. (Or, if the removable media is a floppy drive or CD-ROM, freaking out the user by spinning up the drive to get the properties of the shortcut.) </p>
<p> The shift key override was aded as an escape hatch, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/14/466051.aspx"> like the double-Ctrl+Alt+Del</a>, in case there was some situation discovered after Windows&nbsp;XP shipped where it would be reasonable to pin a non-program or a shortcut on network or removable media to the Start menu. For example, ClickOnce application are not recognized as executables because their extension is not .exe but rather is .appref-ms. But you can use the shift key override to pin them to your Start menu. </p>
<p> With great power comes great responsibility: If you manually override the <i>Pin to Start menu</i> logic, then it's your problem if you pin something that ends up making your life miserable. </p>
<p> <b>Update</b>: Upon closer examination, I've discovered that my characterization of what the shift keys accomplishes was incorrect. The shift key does not let you force-pin files on the network or removable media. It only lets you force-pin files that aren't programs. </p>

		<p>I have an exe on a network drive that I&#39;ve been trying for ages to figure out how to pin (to the taskbar, actually, not the start menu, but&#8230;). When I saw this blog post I thought &quot;Aha! My problem is solved!&quot; But it doesn&#39;t seem to work &#8211; even when I shift-right-click, there&#39;s no &quot;pin to &quot; anything option. I tried right-clicking the exe itself, a shortcut to the exe, and the taskbar button for the application window when it was open. No pin options. Clearly I&#39;m missing something&#8230;</p>

		<p>The extended context menu is a real secret. One day when i was looking for a way to run a program under another user (not administrator though) on Windows 7, i discovered that &quot;Run As User&#8230;&quot; was gone from the context menu, even the help file just told me that it&#39;s gone. Only through a coincidence i found out that when you shift click on a entry you get something like that back. Yes i know there is still the runas command line tool, but left clicking on something is more convenient on Windows.</p>
<p>Thank you for the post, explaining why the shift key override was added. :)</p>

		<p>+1 Stuart! Btw &#8211; there is a workarond. Pin a local program to the taskbar, then close it, then right-click the taskbar icon and right-click again on the program name. Choose properties and from there you&#39;re in business.</p>
<p>However this will leave the icon of the local program in the taskbar. To work around that, you have to create a shortcut somewhere to the local program, change the icon of the shortcut, then start the local program via that shortcut, and from there follow the previous workaround.</p>
<p>I sure wish there was an easier way for doing this &#8211; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s so uncommon that some homebrew application which is often used resides on a network share.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m looking for the best way to make Windows 7 show the Command Prompt option on a simple right-click, rather than having to press shift every time. Any idea what I need to change in the registry?</p>
<p>Also, how can I add my own commands for specific file types, such that they show up only on shift right-clicking?</p>
<p>Off-topic: Raymond, what&#39;s up with April&#39;s Windows Confidential in TechNet (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/gg981675.aspx" rel="nofollow">technet.microsoft.com/&#8230;/gg981675.aspx</a>)?

		<p>I can&#39;t speak for the Windows team, but I imagine they try to discourage users from running programs from network drive for a lot of good reasons. (Running an installer from a network drive is one thing; a program you use every day another.)</p>

		<p>Since discovering &quot;Copy as Path&quot; and &quot;Open Command Window Here&quot; I&#39;ve noticed that I press shift when bringing up the context menu more than not. I generally find the context menu to be full of options that I never/rarely use, especially as time goes on and different applications add their own menu items to the context menu. Is there a way to configure which menu items appear by default in the context menu, and which ones will appear only when I press shift? That way I can pull &quot;Copy as Path&quot; and &quot;Open Command Window Here&quot; into the main explorer context menu, and require pressing shift to see all of the other ones.</p>

		<p>(Note: I haven&#39;t tried this&#8230;) You could always use mklink to create a symbolic link to the folder on the network that has your program. &nbsp;As far as most apps are concerned, it will be a local path. &nbsp;I&#39;ve had to use it to fool some line-of-business installers that insist on some strange locations for folders when applying patches, despite allowing (and sometimes recommending) that you install to different folders in the first place!</p>
<p>mklink /D c:myLinksMyNetworkApp \serverShareMyNetworkApp</p>
<p>Maybe with offline files and a few other tricks it will still behave nicely when your network isn&#39;t available. &nbsp;I can&#39;t be bothered trying it out now (and don&#39;t feel like breaking things at the moment) but if someone else did that&#39;d be great :P</p>

		<p>Ok, so I got the Command Prompt option to show up always by deleting the &quot;Extended&quot; REG_SZ value from 3 locations, namely, HKCRDirectoryBackgroundshellcmd, HKCRDirectoryshellcmd and HKCRDriveshellcmd. Did I miss any? I also added /edited the appropriate runas keys with the &quot;Extended&quot; value to display an Elevated Command Prompt option only on pressing shift. Thing is, now on pressing shift I see *both* options, i.e. Command Prompt and Elevated Command Prompt, whereas I want only the latter to show up. So is there a counterpart to &quot;Extended&quot; (or some value I can set it to) that will cause a menu option to *not* show up on pressing shift? Can anyone help?</p>

		<p>By the way, for those who really want to have ability to pin up things, they may create a folder to store the items and turn it into a toolbar. Then uncheck &quot;Show Text&quot; and &quot;Show Title&quot; to achieve similar effect.</p>
<p>It&#39;d be nice if Win7 can allow user to &quot;undock&quot; individual toolbar to other side, or even better, other window.</p>

		<p>I think MS introduced the Extended value (Shift required) because the context menu was starting to get too cluttered with just few programs installed. Unfortunately, they put all the wrong and frequently needed options in Shift required category.The ideal solution would have been to introduce a GUI to configure which items you want to see in regular menu and which one with Shift pressed (Windows 8, Microsoft?). A GUI to manage context menu verbs (added thru both registry and shell extensions) is desperately needed.</p>
<p>As if hiding things in the context menu isn&#39;t bad enough, now MS has started hiding them with some modifier key required for the Windows 7 taskbar as well. Just displaying the much required context menu for a pinned taskbar app requires Shift because their latest cool whiz-bang jump list feature wanted to take over the context menu! Not only is requiring some modifier key like Shift bad for discoverability, it&#39;s very poor usability. Stop doing this please. If 7 Taskbar Tweaker didn&#39;t allow me to make right click on the Windows 7 taskbar show the good old context menu without pressing some stupid Shift key, I would have dumped Windows 7 right then and there. MS is fooling around with users&#39; muscle memory of right clicking on programs on the taskbar.</p>
<p>I also wish double Ctrl+Alt+Del complete with real Classic logon was back in Windows 8. Winlogon has been dumbed down because you can&#39;t log into a hidden user account any more while still normally using the Welcome screen for convenience most of the times. You can only either make all user account names hidden or use the Welcome screen for all.</p>

		<p>For those who want to edit which menu items require pressing Shift, you can use NirSoft&#39;s ShellMenuView: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://nirsoft.net/utils/shell_menu_view.html" rel="nofollow">nirsoft.net/&#8230;/shell_menu_view.html</a></p>

		<p>Not only is &quot;Pin to Taskbar&quot; hidden if the target is not a program or if it resides on a network path, the option is also hidden if the shortcut&#39;s name matches a hardcoded list of keywords. &nbsp;I&#39;ve noticed &quot;Documentation&quot;, &quot;Readme&quot;, and &quot;Uninstall&quot; are such keywords &#8212; there are probably more. &nbsp;Since I like to PTFM (Pin The &quot;Fine&quot; Manual), my workaround is to rename &quot;Documentation&quot; to &quot;Docs&quot; in the name of the shortcut.</p>
<p>You can see this effect for yourself by creating a shortcut to calc.exe named &quot;Calc Readme&quot; and trying to pin it to the taskbar. &nbsp;(Amusingly, Microsoft actually HAS dutifully created a readme for calc: &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows7/Using-Calculator-in-windows-7" rel="nofollow">windows.microsoft.com/&#8230;/Using-Calculator-in-windows-7</a> &nbsp;).</p>

		<p>I wasn&#39;t aware of the extended context menu until now, there is some pretty useful commands on there. I guess there are a lot of people unaware of it just like the left click safely remove hardware menu as everyone is used to right click for a menu.</p>

		<p>&quot;Configuration of extended verbs is not possible due to the way they are implemented (CMF_EXTENDEDVERBS is processed in code rather than declaratively).&quot;</p>
<p>Certainly a GUI to add or remove the &quot;extended&quot; value from the registry per verb is possible i.e. do what ShellMenuView does.</p>
<p>&quot;And you can log into hidden accounts by clicking &quot;Other user&quot;.</p>
<p>On a workgroup joined PC, you can&#39;t log into hidden accounts by clicking &quot;Other user&#8230; *while the Welcome screen is enabled*&quot;. The &quot;Always Use Classic Logon&quot; needs to be enabled to be able to log in as other user but then the convenience of clicking on a user name and typing JUST the password is lost. Or you need to be joined to a domain. That ability was last present in Windows XP (have the Welcome screen enabled normally, but Ctrl+Alt+Del twice to logon to a hidden user account where you have to type both user name and password).</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Fiddling the Extended value works only for certain types of verbs. Are you saying Windows should have a feature that you know ahead of time will work only some of the time? (And sorry about the non-domain-joined case.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

<p>Thanks gary, but I stay miles away from all such &#39;tweakers&#39;. As mentioned above, I did it manually by editing the registry, such that &quot;Open Command Prompt Here&quot; shows up always, and &quot;Open Elevated Command Prompt Here&quot; shows up only on pressing Shift. I wanted them to be exclusive though, i.e. &quot;Open Command Prompt Here&quot; should *not* show up on pressing Shift, however that doesn&#39;t seem to be possible I guess (unless someone knows better and can help me).</p>

		<p>Thanks for this, Raymond; are there other resources which might explain a few other oddities about the Pinning system under Windows 7?</p>
<p>I have one app I use that doesn&#39;t give the option to pin to either Start Menu or Taskbar (except via the Shift context menu &#8211; and then only for Start Menu), but it&#39;s not on the network &#8211; it&#39;s stored locally under Program Files (x86), but the shortcut is for an installed program so I&#39;m not 100% clear what is being run. I believe the app calls a VBS script which runs an updater, and then only once the app is confirmed up-to-date does it run the real app.</p>
<p>I have another app that is similar, but is written in Python; attempting to pin that to the Taskbar results in pinning a link only the Python executable, and not the parameters which are appended to call the actual app; it&#39;s as though it treats the Python code being run as a document, which means I need to run it from the Recent Documents pick-list instead. Not exactly what I want it to do, but I may be out of luck on that one, I think.</p>

		<p>Why this kind of things are not in FAQ/some guide is a mystery to me. There are eleven hundred thousand of these things that are not in a plain sight, yet are not documented anywhere, like shift+space combination in browser.</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
