<p>
Assuming there isn't another schedule slip,
the Redmond Costco should be opening today.
So I'm going to celebrate by sharing some Costco trivia.
</p>
<p>
If you shop three times in a row at a particular
Costco location, then that location is treated
as your "home" Costco.
When you make an online purchase, the sale is credited
to your "home" Costco for bookkeeping purposes.
</p>
<p>
This little detail doesn't really have any effect on
you, the customer.
You can just go about your Costco day as you always did.
The people who care about this are the accountants
back at Costco headquarters who want to do things like
identify which locations are most profitable.
</p>
<p>
But it does mean that if you are on vacation and shop
at Costco a few times,
that will flip a bit somewhere in a data center
so it thinks you've moved.</p>

		<p>Interesting. I guess that means that even though I live NY, the Costco in Anchorage Alaska is currently my home store.</p>

		<p>Wait, Costco is HQ&#8217;d in Kirkland, right ? And that&#8217;s literally next door to Redwood .. So does this mean it&#8217;s now around the corner, vs a 10-15 minute drive ? Or was the HQ there, but no store ?</p>

		<p>The Costco headquarters are in Issaquah, jut a little south of Kirkland. There&#8217;s a Costco there, and AFIACT they do some of there &#8220;will this new product sell&#8221; testing there.  The month or two that they had a donut-glazing machine was heaven :-).  That store is alway ssuper-crowded. They also have a store in Kirkland (mostly crowded), and now one in Redmond.</p>

		<p>Besides the warehouse there, the original HQ was in Kirkland.</p>

		<p>Also &#8211; the original Costco is on Fourth in the SODO district of Seattle.  They retained a small piece of the original building wall that looks quite silly but is an interesting reminder of what things used to be like.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noticing that the original Costco, while large, is much much smaller than the average Costco nowadays.</p>

		<p>Sometimes I forget which name survived the merger and thus often still refer to it as Price Club.</p>

		<p>wonder if that applies to gas station purchases as well&#8230; seems that a few fillups shouldn&#8217;t change the creditation of an online purchase.</p>

		<p>The home warehouse is also the one they charge for rewards.<br />
Note that your home warehouse only changes if your zip code is in the warehouse&#8217;s assigned area &#8211; going on vacation won&#8217;t change it unless you update your address too.  This ends up affecting some snowbirds from Canada who winter in Florida, since they update their address, and then get their rewards issued in US dollars instead of Canadian dollars (which you can&#8217;t use cross-border).</p>

		<p>For various reasons we only shop at Costco about three times a year, two of which are at one branch and the third at another (which are roughly equidistant from us).  According to the stated algorithm, that must mean we don&#8217;t have a &#8216;home&#8217; Costco at all!  I&#8217;ve always wanted to try our (UK) membership card at a store in another country, like they say you can, but have never had the opportunity.</p>

		<p>Many (many many) years ago I was with my Dad in Atlanta and we visited CostCo on his UK-issued-and-only-ever-used-there-card. The teller swiped it through the machine, it thought for a few seconds and popped &#8220;CostCo welcomes &#8230;..&#8221; &#8211; impressive! Especially when a Blockbuster video card couldn&#8217;t be used at the store 10 minutes away!</p>

		<p>Richard,</p>
<p>It works &#8211; at least in North America. We spent the summer driving from New York to Alaska and back. With a vehicle that only gets 6 miles to the gallon, and 10,500 miles, we stopped at every Costco along the way throughout both US and Canada to buy gas. No issue using my card.</p>

		<p>The US and Canada are both in the same database.  More interesting are the Costcos in other countries, which are on separate systems; in order for all of them to talk, the US system acts as a hub.</p>
<p>And the home warehouse is set during initial signup (to the warehouse you shop at), since the membership still represents income.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
