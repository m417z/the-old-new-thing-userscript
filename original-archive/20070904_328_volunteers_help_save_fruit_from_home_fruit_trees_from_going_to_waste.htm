<p>It's the season where people with fruit trees in their yard are drowning in fresh fruit, be they pears, apples, plums, whatever. It's not long before you find yourself desperately looking for people to give it away to, having pretty much run out of things you can make plums into.</p>
<p> This is where <a href="http://www.fremontpublic.org/client/fruittrees.html"> Community Fruit Tree Harvest</a> steps in. (Coverage in <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/homegarden/2003226033_marygarden26.html"> <i>The Seattle Times</i></a> and <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/local/328216_fruit19.html"> <i>The Seattle Post-Intelligencer</i></a>. There's also <a href="http://www.fremontpublic.org/client/food.html#LettuceLink"> Lettuce Link</a> for donating produce from your home garden.) </p>
<p> The volunteers at Community Fruit Tree Harvest will visit your house and pick the fruit from your tree, donating it to local food banks. Everybody wins: You don't have to deal with all the extra fruit, the food banks get fresh fruit, nothing goes to waste. (This is one of those "Why didn't somebody think of this sooner?" type of programs.) Contact telephone numbers are on the web pages. It appears that they currently cover the Wallingford, Phinney Ridge, and Green Lake neighborhoods. </p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a good explanation of why &quot;somebody didn&#8217;t think of this sooner&quot; in Steinbeck&#8217;s Grapes of Wrath.</p>

		<p>Odds are there is a reason no one has thought of it first. It may be different on the west coast, but most &#8216;home&#8217; fruit trees are poorly maintained. They aren&#8217;t pruned appropriately, aren&#8217;t treated for diseases and insects (nor are the fruit treated). Thus the resulting fruit is often full of worms, very seedy, sour/poorly developed, rarely ripe, undersized (pears the size of small walnuts?). Essentially poor fruit that no one wants in the first place.</p>
<p>Me ? I go to local orchards and support them. Sure I&#8217;d love a peach tree in my front yard (well, we&#8217;ve got the fig tree/shrub/bush growing, but it&#8217;ll be 2-3 more years before we can harvest). But I know what a headache it is to maintain one.</p>

		<p>Yes, it can be hard to maintain fruit trees, but in the southern US, it only takes a few tomato plants to overfeed a family. &nbsp;That&#8217;s provided they come in properly, of course, which is why you plant more than that. &nbsp;Then if ALL of them come in, you&#8217;re giving tomatoes to everybody you know just to get rid of them.</p>

		<p>When my grandparents were gardening more than they do now when I would water the plants I&#8217;d just grab tomatoes off the vine and devour them there. &nbsp;Didn&#8217;t work as well for the hot peppers though.</p>

		<p>In Serbia, plums are usually turned into a hard liquor similar to brandy. Doble-distilling is common here so expect 60% of alcohol in there:</p>

<p>So, what are you waiting for? Send them over, if they are good we will send you few bottles ;-)</p>

		<p>@Nathan,</p>
<p>I think they&#8217;re hoping that only people who care for their trees to get fruit will call. &nbsp;(i.e. if your tree is producing small fruit, you might just ignore it.) &nbsp;My great uncle grows tomatoes, but by season end he&#8217;s so full of them they crowd every counter in his basement (and he has a complete wrap around wet bar). &nbsp;Even a small well maintained plant can produce more food than most people want.</p>

		<p>But Ray, they say on the link you gave, &quot;We are interested in pesticide-free apples, pears and plums that are in good condition. Remember, if you wouldn&#8217;t want to eat it yourself, we can&#8217;t accept it. We can help you with fruit tree care as well.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m all for pesticide free, but I&#8217;d be really surprised/impressed if some joe-homeowner, even with their help, can produce apples/pears/plums I&#8217;d want to eat myself, with out those chemicals.</p>
<p>Our co-op/CSA (&quot;sustainable organic, but not certified&quot;) had apples last week, and there were worms in some. Sorry, that&#8217;s a turn off for me. I&#8217;ll take cancer and chemicals over worms in my apples. Bug scars on tomatoes don&#8217;t bother me, bad spots in peaches can be cut out, but worms. Ick.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
