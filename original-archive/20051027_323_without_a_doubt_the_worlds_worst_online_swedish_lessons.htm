<p> <a href="http://www.slayradio.org/mastering_swedish_lesson_3.php"> Lesson 3: Schomething schtranger</a> (<a href="http://download.slayradio.org/mastering_swedish_-_lesson_3.mp3">mp3</a>) is part three of a series of four (so far) horrifically bad Swedish lessons. (<strong>Warning</strong>: Off-color content and copious swearing, but nevertheless very funny.) Boz has been living in Sweden since June, and two of his so-called friends have been putting together Swedish language tapes for him. Listen along as he goes through the tapes, trying to repeat each of the phrases. </p>
<p> Each of the lessons does illustrate a genuine detail of the Swedish language, even though Slaygon and Makke choose to illustrate the points using sentences you're unlikely to encounter in your average Swedish textbook... </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.slayradio.org/mastering_swedish.php">Lesson 1: Homographs</a>, words spelled the same     but with different meaning, sometimes with different     pronunciation. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.slayradio.org/mastering_swedish_lesson_2.php">Lesson 2: Inflections and compound words</a>,     where two words change meaning when combined into a single word. </li>
<li><a href="http://www.slayradio.org/mastering_swedish_lesson_3.php">Lesson 3: The sj and tj sounds</a>,     two difficult sounds.     The "sj" sounds like rushing wind,     which I tend to mispronounce as German frontal "ch" because I forget to     lower my tongue and open my mouth cavity     in order to get that echo-ey whistling effect.     The "tj" sound is close to English "sh"     (differing in some subtle way I have yet to learn). </li>
<li><a href="http://www.slayradio.org/mastering_swedish_lesson_4.php">Lesson 4: The letters K, G and Y</a>.     The pronunciations of "K" and "G" vary depending on context.     The "Y" is a tricky rounded vowel. </li>
</ul>
<p> One fine point of pronunciation that doesn't get much attention in textbooks is the Swedish long "i" sound. Most sources just tell you to pronounce it like English "ee", but you're also supposed to push it towards the back of the mouth, so that you sound like Kermit the Frog. I tend to pronounce it like English "ee" and forget to do the Kermit thing. Just like with my problems with "sj", it's not that I don't know how to do it; I just forget. </p>

		<p>&quot;Lesson 1: Homographs, words spelled the same but with different meaning, sometimes with different pronunciation.&quot;<br />
<br />Norwegian and Swedish have a lot similar, but there are some words which make it very hard. Especially for me. E.g. &quot;rolig&quot; in Swedish is the opposite in Norwegian, making it quite confusing. At least the first time :)</p>

		<p>This definately reminds me of when I visited relatives in Sweden two summers ago. While there I asked if I could learn some Swedish. The first phrase out of my relative&#8217;s mouth was this really long and complicated sounding phrase. Of course I&#8217;m completely lost and ask what he just said. Turns out it was, &quot;Excuse me but what is the gross national domestic product of your country?&quot; Nothing like going easy on the newbies.</p>

		<p>Steve: To say &quot;sj&quot; you open your mouth cavity (the space behind your teeth) by lowering your tongue &#8211; not to be confused with the mouth (opening between the lips), which stays relatively closed. Or at least that&#8217;s how I do it. When I remember. Which isn&#8217;t often.</p>

		<p>The &#8216;sj&#8217;-sound is pronounced pretty like the beginnig of the english word &quot;share&quot;, just until the &#8216;a&#8217; is pronounced.</p>

		<p>Uhm, no it&#8217;s not&#8230;consider the word &#8216;sjuk&#8217;, there&#8217;s no &#8216;sh&#8217; in that.<br />
<br />The &#8216;sj&#8217;-sound is pronounced by keeping your tounge in the middle of your mouth with your lips half-open and (possibly) a bit &quot;towards&quot; the following vowel and then simply breathing out with some (a little) force so that a &quot;wind&quot;-sound is produced.<br /></p>

		<p>Heh, funny. I had a hard enough time pronouncing some of those even thought I&#8217;m native myself. ^^</p>
<p>Andreas: Doesn&#8217;t people in Sm&#229;land pronounce &#8216;sj&#8217; like that? I think there are some accents that do at least&#8230;</p>

		<p>Well, you could pronounce all of the sj-, sch-, sk- sounds like the sound in &quot;share&quot;, but you&#8217;d sound like one of those Stockholm snobs (08&#8217;s we call them, 08 being their area code).</p>
<p>It would definitely be easier for foreigners to pronounce &quot;Sk&#246;vde&quot; with the soft sj sound instead of the semiguttural sound so prevalent among the local hillbillies. :)</p>

		<p>Thanks for those great &#8216;tapes&#8217; Raymond! Regarding the &quot;Swedish long &#8216;i&#8217; sound&quot; I think instead of pronouncing it &#8216;ee&#8217; you could say &#8216;eei&#8217;. Subtle difference, but I think it forces you to change the sound enough.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think you have to worry about the difference between English &quot;sh&quot; and Swedish &quot;tj&quot;, Raymond. I can&#8217;t hear a difference, so I presume most Sweedes wouldn&#8217;t. </p>
<p>One useful piece of knowledge is that these sounds are pronounced differently by the Swedish-speaking population of Finland. &quot;Sj&quot; is pronounced like &quot;Tj&quot; is in Sweden, and &quot;Tj&quot; is pronounced like &quot;Tj&quot;, but with a &quot;T&quot;-sound in front of it. (To put it somewhat simplified)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
