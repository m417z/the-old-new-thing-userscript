<p>
A customer reported that they had a system where multiple
processes share a mutex.
Each process calls <code>Create&shy;Mutex</code> to create
the mutex or obtain a handle to the existing one.
But the customer found that sometimes, the call to
<code>Create&shy;Mutex</code> fails, and <code>Get&shy;Last&shy;Error</code>
reports that the reason is
<code>ERROR_ACCESS_DENIED</code>.
What could cause that?
</p>
<p>
Specifically, the two processes are a UI process and a service.
Both processes use <code>Create&shy;Mutex</code> to create or
access the mutex, passing <code>NULL</code> as the security attributes.
</p>
<p>
Okay, so issue is that the two processes are running
under different identities with different privileges.
Even though you think you are creating the mutex in both places
with the same security attributes
(because you're passing <code>NULL</code> both times),
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20040312-00/?p=40273">
the effect of the <code>NULL</code> is different depending on who
is calling</a>.
</p>
<p>
What's probably happening is that most of the time,
the mutex is created by the UI process first,
so the mutex gets the access control list that grants access
to the user under which the UI process is running, and to the
SYSTEM account,
The service is running under the SYSTEM account, so it gets access.
</p>
<p>
But once in a while, it's the service that creates the mutex first.
In that case, the access control list on the mutex grants access
only to the SYSTEM account,
in which case the UI process cannot access the mutex.
</p>
<p>
The customer reported that they saw this behavior only on
builds 14393 and higher and were wondering what could be causing it.
My guess is that something is happening on build 14393
that wakes up the service sooner than it used to,
causing the service to be the one to create the mutex,
and that's what's preventing the UI process from gaining access.
</p>
<p>
In these sorts of cases, where two processes with different
permissions need to share a securable object,
the general principle is to have the high-permission process
create the object and set the permission so that the low-permission
process can access it.
If you let the low-permission process be the one that creates the
mutex, then you have a potential squatting attack.</p>

		<p>You did not mention it in your post but I assume this is a named mutex with the &#8220;Global\&#8221; prefix. If so, this means that multiple accounts in multiple logon sessions might need access (fast user switching) so the only things you can realistically block in the ACL is the Guest account (Guest account is dead on Win10?) and Low integrity processes&#8230;</p>

		<p>The guest account is still there, but it is disabled. It should have been like that for a while now, from way before 10.</p>

		<p>The guest account has been broken since build 10159 AFAIK.</p>

		<p>You should mention that this can also happen if one creates a process with CreateProcessAsUser which on the first logon can fail in CreateMutex and related if they are called too early. The suspicion was that the session is at this point in time not fully initialized and it is therefore not safe to create shared objects.</p>

		<p>It doesn&#8217;t matter, the solution is the same no matter how many ways you can cause the problem: Set the security descriptor, instead of ignoring it like it&#8217;ll never matter. The AppCompat team will thank you for it someday.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
