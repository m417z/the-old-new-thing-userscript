<p> I dreamed that I finished biking home and decided not to take the stairs. Instead I took my bicycle into the elevator to go to my dream-land 31st-floor high-rise condo. (As if.) </p>
<p> For "security reasons" there were no buttons in the elevator. You had to open a secret panel and flip a circuit-breaker switch corresponding to the floor you want to go to. If you open the wrong panel, you are instead faced with a stack of hot-swappable SATA drives with labels like "Windows 95" and "Windows 95 OSR&nbsp;2". And yes, I know that SATA didn't exist in 1995. </p>

		<p>&gt;&gt; And yes, I know that SATA didn&#39;t exist in 1995.</p>
<p>Yes, but Windows 95 didn&#39;t cease to exist when SATA came to life&#8230; We still have customers running Windows 98, and from time to time, we find the odd Windows 95&#8230; in 2013!</p>

		<p>Antonio,</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got an old Win98 machine myself, one that I occasionally fire up for one specific use: To recover old floppy disks. It will soon be retired, but I (and a few of my friends) still have got a few (a few dozen/hundreds, that is) floppies that were bought &quot;preformatted&quot;, but without the proper format code written into the boot sector. Several of the major floppy manufacturers failed to do that.</p>
<p>When DOS/Win16 were fed a floppy without a format code, they didn&#39;t give up immediately, but made an honorable (?) attempt to read the floppy, in all the formats available. If it succeeded, the floppy was accepted (notably: Without writing the proper format code on the disk).</p>
<p>Win32 developers decided that this is nonsence: We cannot forever out of pure kindness handle badly formatted disks by trial and error this way. Badly formatted is badly formatted! So in Win32, lots of those old floppies report &quot;Not formatted&quot;. (Before you ask: No, it does not help using an external USB floppy drive to read the disks.)</p>
<p>Some of my friends used Win16 far into this millenium; the floppies are typically fire to ten years old. I am surprised by how well those old floppies keep up; usually they can be read without any problems. We have had most of them converted by now, but &quot;new&quot; ones pop up every now and then and need to be rescued. Besides, booting up a Win98 machine with a gang of kids around you is a nice way to shut their mouth when they complain about their new 6-core 4 GHz machine with 16 GByte of RAM being untolerably slow&#8230; (One of my friends converted an old Win98 a 700 MHz CPU with 256 MByte of RAM machine to run XP &nbsp;a printer server; he communicates with it through a USB wireless adapter (USB 1.1 only!). It &quot;sort of&quot; works, but it is so slow that Windows Update fails on a timeout.)</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve always thought it&#39;d be fun to have quirky elevator controls in a building full of technical types. &nbsp;For example, a row of toggle switches that you use to enter the floor number in binary with a GO button.</p>
<p>Well, fun for the first little bit and then a gimmick afterwards for visitors I suppose.</p>

		<p>I once worked in a commercial building that, when after 9pm, all people who want to use lift have to open a secret panel to reveal and Octopus(a type of non-contact payment card in Hong Kong) card reader. You tap the card and the elevator will go the the floor pre-registered (or go back to ground floor if already on that floor). If you forgot to bring your card or is a visitor that does not have card registered, you have to go to the counter and apply for a temporary card.</p>

		<p>@JB &#8211; My P2 350 MHz was retired this May from my kids hands &#8211; was used to watch Tom&amp;Jerry from youtube mainly. XP SP3 with 256 MB SDRAM on it / 8 GB HDD and 64 MB video card. It&#39;s from 2001. From gaming perspective last game I was able to play on it was Serious Sam &#8211; The Second Encounter. But was able to run Delphi 7 on it and used as performance test machine last years. If an app was running nice from user perspective on it, I knew there is no more improvement to be done. Eh, but it was Compaq with components made in Taiwan and assembled in Italy, not like today &quot;made in China&quot; that you get.</p>

		<p>How do you know they were hot-swap SATA drives and not some other hot-swap technology which would have been around at the time?</p>
<p>@Antonio But I doubt you&#39;ll be running it in SATA mode.</p>
<p>@Danny I still have a Pentium Pro although all I use it for these days is as a thin client (but not for watching videos, as it tends to run out of resources when I try).</p>

		<p>No, you&#39;re all wrong. SATA of course existed in 1995. It&#39;s all part of the industry&#39;s evil plan to drip feed us all the improvements over a longer period of time to maximize profits. EVERYONE knows that. Mwaahahahaa&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
