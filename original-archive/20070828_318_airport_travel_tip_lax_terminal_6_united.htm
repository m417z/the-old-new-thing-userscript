When you enter Terminal&nbsp;6 and turn right to enter
the security queue,
there are two sets of security equipment.
If you are directed to the far set of equipment,
you will find three lines for screening.
At the point at which you have to choose which line to take,
you can't see how your decision is going to play out.
The arrangement is
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/10/12/480065.aspx">
effectively the same as at Newark</a>:
You want to take the rightmost line,
number three in the diagram below.

		<p>Wait&#8230; isn&#8217;t the number 1 the rightmost line in the diagram? Or is it somehow reversed/switched/whatever?</p>

		<p>Are you crazy? &nbsp;Not only are you discussing an airport, you posted a diagram of how to navigate it. &nbsp;This is clearly a violation of the Patriot Act, and it&#8217;s probably a coded message to terrorists. &nbsp;I&#8217;m reporting you to Homeland Security. &nbsp;Then they&#8217;ll put you in the front of the line to get on the plane to Gitmo.</p>
<p>That is all.</p>

		<p>but if you like wathcing people in lines, &nbsp;and listening to your musoc-player, &nbsp;and your flicht isn&#8217;t for ages yet than maybe you actually want line one, &nbsp;where you can see the effect of the horror of having to wait a little longer dawning on the faces of the people who think that time is very valuable and has been stolen from them. &nbsp;Should I go to Nitpokcers corner now or later? &nbsp;I&#8217;m not in a hurry, &nbsp;I dont mind&#8230; &nbsp;no really i don.. &nbsp;tra la la-la la&#8230;</p>

		<p>Another LAX tip: Avoid terminal 1 at all costs. I liked flying United before (because of channel 9, the cockpit audio) but I like them more so now because they aren&#8217;t in terminal 1.</p>

<p>And about time too! &nbsp;I was getting sick and tired of not being able to see diagrams with my browser of choice: telnet. &nbsp;Everything else is just too bloated, and I can run telnet on my trusty old 5150.</p>

		<p>No, Darkstar, you have to walk *on top* of those in queue 3 to get into queue 2. And likewise for for queue 1. So even though queue 1 is longer, it&#8217;s decidedly less painful.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Another LAX tip: Avoid terminal 1 at all costs.
</p></blockquote>
<p>A more comprehensive tip: Avoid LAX at all costs. &nbsp;If you&#8217;re taking an international flight (transpacific), fly via SFO. &nbsp;I do this route frequently (or at least used to), and from long experience I&#8217;d rate LAX as the most painful airport in the world (although Heathrow after their security-paranoia-created bottleneck is a close second). &nbsp;Even places like Pulkovo or Domodedovo, which you&#8217;d expect to be somewhat painful, are a pleasure compared to going through LAX.</p>

		<p>Hurrah for ascii art diagrams.</p>
<p>In general, then, on seeing three queues with no visible endpoint, the centre queue is likely the best &quot;safe bet&quot;. This explains a lot of the driving I see on 3-lane motorways (&quot;interstates&quot;? &quot;highways&quot;?) in the UK.</p>

		<p>I fly out of LAX Terminal 1 all the time, and I rarely wait more than 30 min or so for the security lines. The &#8216;trick&#8217; is to sleep in and let all you early risers inflict pain on each other. They opened up two more screening areas last year too &#8211; they used parts of what used to be gate 1 and gate 2 &#8211; helps keep the lines a bit shorter.</p>
<p>Terminal 3 is my favorite one though. The concessions are better, the gates are close together, and when I&#8217;m there I&#8217;m usually going to Hawaii. I like going to Hawaii.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
