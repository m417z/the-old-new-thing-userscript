		<p>I really like ProFont &#8211; I&#8217;ve used it in my editor for a two years or so now. The readability at small size is amazing.</p>

		<p>Profont user for two years, ever since it appeared on Joel on Software. Smaller is better!</p>
<p>(tip: play SkiFree with the number pad, not the mouse, and reduce the keyboard repeat delay. The tricks earn you loads of points.)</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;m the only one, but if there&#8217;s anything I approve fully and love about Microsoft, it&#8217;s their default font selection. And this goes for the Visual Studio IDE as well.</p>
<p> Who knows, maybe I&#8217;m just too used to it&#8230; </p>
<p> I tried the pro font for about an hour, and then reverted back to the original Courier New.</p>

		<p>I stayed with Courier until I found the truetype version of the One True Font, misc-fixed-semicondensed. &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.twoevils.org/html/files.html&gt;" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://www.twoevils.org/html/files.html&#038;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.twoevils.org/html/files.html&#038;gt</a>;<br />
<br />Other people have created bitmap versions of it which can be used in console windows.</p>

		<p>The downloadable files for ProFont look pretty small.  They&#8217;re even smaller than the BOOTFONT.BIN file that Windows puts in the root directory of C: (along with NTLDR, BOOT.INI, etc.).  This arouses suspicion that ProFont would likely only be usable for code that contains no comments or character strings.</p>

		<p>Being an old ex-Microsoftee, I have used the old &quot;MSMAIL3.FON&quot; font for more than 10 years. The best programming font in my opinion! This profont is cool thought :-)</p>

		<p>Oh man, that ProFont makes me feel so leet. And the Windows Principal code is high-larious.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
