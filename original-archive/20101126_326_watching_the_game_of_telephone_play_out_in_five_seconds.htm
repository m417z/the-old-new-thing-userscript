		<p>@kinokijuf: No worry. If merchants found these festivals good for their sales, they&#39;ll import them.</p>
<p>Hint: In Hong Kong we have many many non-holiday festivals here (imported mostly form U.K., U.S and Japan), so in every 1-2 months you can see new themes in major shopping arcades.</p>

		<p>Cheong: no kidding, Amazon UK were advertising a &#39;Black Friday&#39; sale last week. The thing is, that has no relevance at all in this country. If &#39;Black &lt;dayname&gt;&#39; has any meaning to most of us, it&#39;s association with &#39;Black Wednesday&#39;, when our currency took a major beating from traders determined to force us out of the Exchange Rate Mechanism: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_Wednesday" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Black_Wednesday</a></p>

		<p>kinokijuf: why should Raymond not post something humorous just because it mentions something american? &nbsp;It&#39;s his blog, he can post whatever he wants. &nbsp;No one is forcing you to read it. &nbsp;If it seriously offends you that much, replace Thanksgiving with November and be done with it, or simply ignore any post marked non-computer.</p>

		<p>The dialog style is confusingly close to the</p>
<p>Something witty</p>
<p>&#8212; Person who said it</p>
<p>style.</p>
<p>A more usual dialog style would be:</p>
<p>Niece 1: Thanksgiving is over.</p>
<p>Niece 2: Christmas is coming!</p>
<p>Niece 1: It&#39;s Christmas time!</p>
<p>Niece 2: Today is Christmas!</p>
<p>Or even better</p>
<p>Sophie: Thanksgiving is over.</p>
<p>Ada: Christmas is coming!</p>
<p>Sophie: It&#39;s Christmas time!</p>
<p>Ada: Today is Christmas!</p>
<div class="post">[<i>The Sophie/Ada style creates problems if Sophie or Ada says anything longer than one line, since the second line is not indented to begin after the colon of the first line. And since I don&#39;t control the width of your screen, any line can potentially wrap. I could fix it with tables, but that&#39;s far too much work. I chose the style I did specifically because it lets me sidestep the wrapping problem. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Writing &quot;I dont know wtf Thankgiving[sic] is&quot; on an *Internet blog*? Really? Yeah, I guess there&#39;s no way for us non-Americans to find out anything about it&#8230; :-p</p>
<p>Here&#39;s a bizarre holiday for you: in Melbourne, Australia, we have Melbourne Cup day &#8211; <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melbourne_cup" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Melbourne_cup</a> &#8211; a public holiday for a horse race! It&#39;s the first Tuesday of November, but some businesses give time off on the Monday as well, making it a fairly long weekend for some! Weird or not, who&#39;s complaining?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
