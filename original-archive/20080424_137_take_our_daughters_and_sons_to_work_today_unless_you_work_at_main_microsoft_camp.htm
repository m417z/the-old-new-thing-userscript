<p>Today is the fourth thursday of April, which is national <a href="http://www.daughtersandsonstowork.org/"> Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day</a>. The main Microsoft campus is not participating today, but there's a good reason for this.</p>
<p> The <a href="http://www.k12.wa.us/assessment/WASL/"> Washington State Assessment of Student Learning</a>, better known as the WASL (pronounced "WAH-s'l"), is a four-day battery of standardized tests administered to all elementary school and high school students starting from grade&nbsp;3. You can <a href="http://www.k12.wa.us/assessment/WASL/WASLPractice-ParentStudent.aspx"> download sample tests and answer keys for the reading and mathematics sections of the test</a> to see whether you would have passed high school had you gone to school in Washington. (<a href="http://www.k12.wa.us/Assessment/WASL/testquestions.aspx">Sample questions for other grades are also available</a>, including <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/03/27/1956484.aspx"> calibration</a> samples for the writing test.) </p>
<p> The problem is that the WASL is administered... at the end of April. Elementary schools have some discretion in choosing exactly which days they administer the test, and if they happen to choose a date that conflicts with Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day, then children in that school district are unable to participate in the event. Microsoft employees indicated that they would prefer to <a href="http://www.thearchitect.co.uk/weblog/archives/2006/07/000427.html"> have the event</a> <a href="http://labman68.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!D8C22EE313F5C00B!248.entry"> in the summer</a> to avoid the schedule conflict. </p>

		<p>Middle and high schools have absolutely no choice in when they give the test, so there is extra reason not to honor this today. &nbsp;Any kid who misses class will have to take the test during make-ups, if you&#8217;re sick/absent during make-ups you&#8217;re just SOL. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Isn&#8217;t that more of a reson to go and beat the officials in the scool board who fixed the WASL date?</p>
<p>I mean, the TODASTW (Kids day) is the fourth thursday in April. Ever. For years now. Internationally. Planetwide.</p>
<p>So its the school board responsibility to shift the tests to fir in both. Or am I missing (in my low-detail-view of matters) anything?</p>

<p>Using words like &quot;internationally&quot; and &quot;planetwide&quot; might fool some people into thinking this goes beyond America. I don&#8217;t think it does.</p>

		<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that Take Our Daughters to Work Day had officially been transformed to being co-ed. &nbsp;I knew some companies encouraged both girls and boys to join in, but I didn&#8217;t realize that was universal now.</p>

		<p>Wow&#8230; the WASL is such a waste of time. &nbsp;I never quite understood why people think that more standardized tests == better education. &nbsp;I was in the first class who had to take the WASL, and it was a waste of a whole week of school.</p>
<p>Of course, nobody took it seriously and we all made a conscious effort to fill in all the squares in the areas marked &quot;Do not write in this area&quot;</p>

<p>Never heard of it (UK). Just made use of the &quot;Google is your friend&quot; philosophy, and apparently it IS done in the UK, but in my last 15 years working I&#8217;ve *never* seen it happen in practice. And I have kids.</p>
<p>Besides, according to Google hits, this is organised by the Girl Guides. Do the school boards really have to organise things around the GG calendar???</p>

		<p>I took a look at the math sample exam for curiosity sake and found it a bit basic.</p>
<p>Is it really the level of math high school students in the US achieve before entering the University?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;s just a bare basics assessment test, which doesn&#8217;t really show the true level of pre-university math students, but makes me wonder.</p>

		<p>Jesse, I don&#8217;t think standardized tests are designed to help your education, just measure it for accountabililty purposes.</p>
<p>When I was in high school in California, they stuck a $1000 carrot at the end of the standardized test (among other carrots for other tests) if you were in the top 25% or something. From memory, I seem to recall news stories about test scores improving, though that didn&#8217;t help prevent Gray Davis from getting &quot;terminated&quot; by the fake energy crisis.</p>

		<p>although the superintendent&#8217;s letter alludes to the question about how long the tests take (the time given to students to complete each section of each test), i could not locate this information anywhere in the sample test documents?</p>
<p>any ideas?</p>

		<p>Interesting. One of my colleagues brought his daughter in to work yesterday, but I didn&#8217;t register the link until now. Of course, it might have been a coincidence.</p>

		<p>@divil</p>
<p>At least here in Germany (and in France, by hearsay), we have a moral equivalent of the &quot;Take Our Daughters and Sons to Work Day.&quot;</p>
<p>Many companys have a real program for the kids, &#8216;showing off&#8217; what they do and what positions are needed in the company.</p>
<p>Idiotically, the German event is officially called with the english word &quot;Girlsday&quot;, as the focus is on bringing girls in contact with technics and science.</p>
<p>But in the last years, the German word &quot;Zukunftstag&quot; (en. Futureday) seems to gain use.</p>
<p>The boys are more ethusiastic when not being herded to a &quot;Girls day&quot;&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Raymond</p>
<p>Yes, I understood that they were high school graduation exams, but they seemed a bit basic even so.</p>
<p>On the other hand, if they are given to every high school student, whatever their academic options (at least here one can choose between more or less math in the last high school years), most probably they are the exact level needed.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
