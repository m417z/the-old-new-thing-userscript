<p>Today is the tenth anniversary of Windows Live Messenger. My colleague Danny Glasser <a href="http://messengersays.spaces.live.com/blog/cns!5B410F7FD930829E!77942.entry"> provides some history behind the product</a>, and you can watch a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNBplwf9N-M"> tenth anniversary celebration video</a> created for the occasion. And thus is inspired today's Microspeak: <i>Whale Boy</i>.</p>
<p> <i>Whale Boy</i> is the nickname for the pawn-shaped Messenger buddy icon. His normal state is green, but he changes color or picks up a piece of flair to indicate various changes in status, such as <i>busy</i> or <i>away</i>. </p>
<p> I don't know the etymology of the term, but I suspect it came from his somewhat rotund appearance. </p>
<p> Sample usage (which I made up just now; not from an actual document): "Why don't we light up Whale Boy when the user regains connectivity?" </p>
<p> Bonus Microsoft trivia: At timecode 3:40 in the video (spoiler alert!) Steve Liffick presents Whale Boy with a strange glass object. That is the Microsoft ten-year service award. Stick around for 25 years and <a href="http://www.proudlyserving.com/archives/2006/01/upgrade_to_the.html"> collect the entire set</a>! </p>

		<p>Whale Boy must be the child of the nicely diverse couple who make up the User Accounts icon.</p>

		<p>LOL, that&#8217;s funny. &nbsp;I guess &quot;Whale Boy&quot; is modeled after the constantly-growing waistlines of average Americans.</p>
<p>Maybe Whale Boy needs a stint on The Biggest Loser?!?</p>

		<p>Great. Considering my oh-so-nice avatar I carefully picked out doesn&#8217;t show up on one of my coworker&#8217;s MSN IM windows&#8230; I&#8217;ll be one of his many Whale Boys. (For some reason he upgraded and promptly lost practically everyone&#8217;s avatars.)</p>
<p>While he sits pretty with an icon.</p>

		<p>I thought the thing was called &quot;doughboy&quot;. At least that&#8217;s the name of it in the messenger derived source that I&#8217;ve seen.</p>

		<p>By using a green character icon Microsoft is promoting Martian dominance and discriminating against humans everywhere.</p>

		<p>Didn&#8217;t they get rid of this icon in this year&#8217;s live messenger, and switch to using colors instead of different pawn icons to show status?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m surprised that there wasn&#8217;t more outrage when Windows Live Messenger switched to using color jewels instead of different shapes to signify away/busy/blocked.</p>
<p>But more to subject, perhaps as a non-native english speaker, I don&#8217;t understand why this guy is called Whale Boy. &nbsp;What is this a reference to?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
