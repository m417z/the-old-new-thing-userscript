<p>Foreshadowing:  This information will actually be useful in a future discussion. Well, not the fine details, but you may notice something that explains... um... it's hard to describe. Just wait for it.</p>
<p> Curiously, it is only the 8086 and x86 platforms that have multiple calling conventions. All the others have only one! </p>
<p> Now we're going deep into trivia that absolutely nobody remembers or even cares about: The 32-bit calling conventions you don't see any more. </p>
<dl>
<dt>All</dt>
<dd>
<p> All of the processors listed here are RISC-style, which means there are lots of registers, none of which have any particular meaning.  Well, aside from the zero register which is hard-wired to zero. (It turns out zero is a very handy number to have readily available.) Any meanings attached to the registers are those imposed by the calling convention. </p>
<p> As a throwback to the processors of old, the "call" instruction stores the return address in a register instead of being pushed onto the stack. A good thing, too, since the processor doesn't officially know about a "stack", it being a construction of the calling convention. </p>
<p> As always, registers or stack space used to pass parameters may be used as scratch by the called function, as can the return value register. </p>
<p> You may notice that all of the RISC calling conventions are basically the same. Once again, evidence that the 8086/x86 is the weirdo. A wildly popular weirdo, mind you. </p>
</dd>
<dt>The Alpha AXP</dt>
<dd>
<p> The Alpha AXP ("AXP" being yet another of those faux-acronyms that officially doesn't stand for anything) has 32 integer registers, one of which is hard-wired to zero. By convention, one of the registers is the "stack pointer", one is the "return address" register; and two others have special meanings unrelated to parameter passing. </p>
<p> The first six parameters are passed in registers, with the remaining parameters on the stack.  If the function is variadic, the parameters can be spilled onto the stack so they can be accessed as an array. </p>
<p> Seven other registers are preserved across calls, one is the return value, and the remaining thirteen are scratch. 1 zero register + 1 stack pointer + 1 return address + 2 special + 6 parameters + 7 preserved + 1 return value +  13 scratch = 32 total integer registers. </p>
<p> Function names on the Alpha AXP are completely undecorated. </p>
</dd>
<dt>The MIPS R4000</dt>
<dd>
<p> The first four parameters are passed in a0, a1, a2 and a3; the remainder are spilled onto the stack. What's more, there are four "dead spaces" on the stack where the four register parameters "would have been" if they had been passed on the stack. These are for use by the callee to spill the register parameters back onto the stack if desired.  (Particularly handy for variadic functions.) </p>
<p> Function names on the MIPS are completely undecorated. </p>
</dd>
<dt>The PowerPC</dt>
<dd>
<p> The first eight parameters are passed in registers (r3 through r10), and the return address is managed manually. </p>
<p> I forget what happens to parameters nine and up... </p>
<p> Function names on the PowerPC are decorated by prepending two periods. </p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p> Postclaimer: I haven't had personal experience with the MIPS or PPC processors, so my discussion of those processors may be a tad off, but the basic idea I think is sound. </p>

<p>The 680&#215;0 Macintosh also had numerous calling conventions. We breathed quite a sigh of relief when PowerPC shipped with a standard calling convention and runtime model. Unfortunately, Mac OS X&#8217;s Mach-O runtime model is slightly-different than standard. Sigh.

		<p>Florian: You don&#8217;t see these calling conventions any more because NT stopped supporting the Alpha AXP, MIPS and PPC years ago.</p>
<p>acronym vs. abbreviation: I know the distinction and considered being more precise but ultimately decided against it for stylistic reasons.</p>

		<p>Well, you do see MIPS and PPC calling conventions on a Microsoft platform: Windows CE.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll admit that PowerPC is no longer supported for CE.NET 4.x, but various varieties of MIPS are still supported. While the Pocket PC may now be ARM-only, some custom platforms still use MIPS. I&#8217;ve got a MIPS-based Pocket PC (2000) on my desk right now; my own Pocket PC (a Jornada 525) uses a Hitachi SH3 processor.</p>
<p>SHx and ARM calling conventions are much like the other RISC processors Raymond mentions.</p>

		<p>At one point at DEC we were told that AXP was pronounced Alpha Chi Rho.  Marketing eventually gave up on that and just kept the &quot;acronym&quot; because they thought any acronym with an X in it was sexy.</p>
<p>The entire naming of the architecture was a fiasco.  Marketing spent a large pile of money to hire a firm to come up with a name and the best that they could come up with was ARA.  Everyone I knew in Engineering hated it, but marketing stuck by it, since they had to justify the money they spent.  Then someone discovered that ARA means something nasty in Arabic.</p>

		<p>Oh, I see. Yes, you had me confused there a bit since I see the PPC calling convention quite regularily as we program for PPC, though not running under NT of course. And we even have a MIPS on some boards.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
