<p>A customer reported a problem with the <code>Task&shy;Dialog</code> function.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  We've encountered a strange behavior in the <code>Task&shy;Dialog</code> function. A user reported that when exiting our application, our program played an error beep that didn't appear to be associated with an error. After investigating, we found that the sound is coming from our application trying to display an error dialog before closing by calling <code>Task&shy;Dialog</code>. The error beep is played but no dialog appears. </p>
<p> Some background on the error condition that we're trying to report: We're calling <code>Create&shy;Window&shy;Ex</code>, and the window procedure creates another window in its <code>WM_<wbr>CREATE</wbr></code> handler. It looks like the original window is destroyed before <code>WM_<wbr>CREATE</wbr></code> is finished, so <code>Create&shy;Window&shy;Ex</code> returns <code>ERROR_<wbr>INVALID_<wbr>WINDOW_<wbr>HANDLE</wbr></wbr></wbr></code>. It's not clear why this is causing <code>Task&shy;Dialog</code> to fail, but this is the only scenario where we see this behavior. All other calls to <code>Task&shy;Dialog</code> work as expected. We know how to fix the original problem with <code>Create&shy;Window&shy;Ex</code>, but we would like to understand what's going on with <code>Task&shy;Dialog</code> in case there's another bug here. </p>

<p> With a little bit of psychic powers, you can solve this customer's problem too. </p>
<p> (If you have a good memory, you may have noticed that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/20/8520129.aspx"> it's a variation on a previous puzzle</a>. But I get to keep recycling it because every year, a new batch of developers stumbles across the problem.) </p>

		<p>I don&#39;t want to spoil the party with the answer, but looking back on the variation you link to, it&#39;s interesting to see that when you click on &quot;the answer is revealed&quot; you get sent to a different page.</p>
<p>So, here&#39;s a new way to get link publicity: &nbsp;Get Raymond to link to your blog, then when he&#39;s not looking, redirect it to what you&#39;re trying to sell!</p>

		<p>@Anthony Wieser:</p>
<p>It seems Adrian McCarthy (the one with the question and the answer for the previous puzzle) had some problems with his blog (not only with his blog :)). Since this post was probably in the queue for a while, the link presumably did work when it was entered. Unfortunatly the wayback machine doesn&#39;t seem to have a copy.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve got only a basic grasp of Win32 programming, but isn&#39;t it the same problem? If they couldn&#39;t call CreateWindowEx from their WM_CREATE handler (probably because of a bad parent HWND), then why should TaskDialog succeed where they failed? Underneath it still calls the same CreateWindowEx with the same bad parent HWND. And fails.</p>
<p>The beep though seems to be played before the CreateWindowEx call, so that gets through.</p>

		<p>Or is it that there&#39;s no message loop left to drive the TaskDialog, because the program is on the way to exiting?</p>

		<p>This is why you should use MessageBox and NOT TaskDialog.</p>

		<p>@640k: No, the only reason to use MessageBox over TaskDialog is if you still want your app to run on XP or below and you&#39;re too lazy to write code that will work properly in both cases.</p>
<p>MessageBox would have the same problem: invalid parent window handle.</p>

		<p>MessageBOX doesn&#39;t need a parent HWND &#8211; NULL works just fine.</p>
<p>It happens when quitting is the problem I&#39;m guessing. PostQuitMessage is not a wrapper around PostMessage(WM_QUIT, &#8230;), as nothing generates WM_QUIT. Instead, it sets a flag inside the message queue that causes all sorts of things to happen. One of those is that WM_QUIT is returned on an empty message queue. So right after the window is created and the message loop continues, you get WM_QUIT.</p>

<p>At least, that&#39;s what I&#39;m guessing based on Raymond&#39;s reference.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
