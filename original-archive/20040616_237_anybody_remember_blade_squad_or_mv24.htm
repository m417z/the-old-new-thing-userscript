<p>  It's often fun to go back and see  <a href="http://www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edu/~aaron2/fox/fox-news.html#develop97">  the kooky ideas for television shows that floated around years ago</a>.  Here are some from 1997:  </p>
<ul>
<li><i>Blade Squad</i> -  An action series set in the year 2001  about a cop who gets around on jet-powered roller skates.   </li>
<li><i>My Beautiful World</i> -  A comedy whose characters include a Marilyn Monroe impersonator  and a child with the body of a 10-month-old baby  and the head of a Queens cab driver.   </li>
<li><i>The Notorious</i> -  A drama about seven crime families,  each representing one of the seven deadly sins.   </li>
<li><i>MV24</i> -  A sitcom about a music video channel, starring Peter Scolari.   </li>
</ul>
<p>  Plenty more on the linked web site.  What's really scary is that a lot of these kooky ideas  turned into actual television programs!  </p>

		<p>Gah, those torturous days where TV stations were trying everything to get viewers back as the internet started pulling them away.</p>
<p>What scary is some of the ones that made it to the air, like the sitcom of the family of genies that live with a divorcee and her two kids.</p>
<p>Then, &quot;reality&quot; took it&#8217;s hold&#8230;</p>
<p>I had forgotten that there was a Dilbert show. Gotta see if they plan to Box Set DVD-ize it.</p>

		<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s unfair to judge a show only on its concept. Think, for example, about that one show about a blonde cheerleader who goes to high school by day and kills vampires by night&#8230;</p>

		<p>PaulJ: The thing is, that one at least sounds reasonable.</p>
<p>Mind you, so does The Notorious and MV24 by that metric.</p>

		<p>The other side of the leaf &#8212; and not to change the subject &#8212; are those shows that were cool, but never really caught on or were canceled prematurely</p>
<p>My favs in this category:<br />
<br />Seaquest DSV<br />
<br />Viper<br />
<br />Space: Above and Beyond<br />
<br />Alien Nation<br />
<br />Bill and Ted&#8217;s Excellent Adventures&#8230;</p>

		<p>Why would someone set a future show in 2001 when &quot;reality&quot; is already in 1997?</p>
<p>Oooh, we get to see&#8230; the beginning of the next presidential administration!  I guess 2001 still sounded REALLY far away back in 1997.</p>
<p>And where the heck are MY jet powered rollerskates?<br /></p>

		<p>Forget jet powered rollerskates.  If TV is to believed, by now should all have flying cars, get our meals in pill form, live on the moon, and god alone knows what else.  Anyone fancy starting a class action lawsuit?  &quot;TV lied to me, and now it shall PAY!&quot;</p>

		<p>(this matches Sean&#8217;s criteria, too)</p>
<p>I always thought VR5 was freaky.  The only way this magic acoustic coupler thing would even make sense to you is if you were a phreak back in the day&#8230; so I&#8217;m amazed anyone bought into the concept.</p>
<p>But it was a very pretty show. ;-)</p>

		<p>Talking about living on the moon&#8230;</p>
<p>Space 1999 was such a GREAT programme. I only saw it in 1998 and early 1999 (as I&#8217;m only 19 and didn&#8217;t see the originals) and I thought it was pretty damn cool! I remember watching in late-1998, one of the episodes said something (I don&#8217;t remember what, now) was going to happen on September 22 1999 and I tried to rememebr it for pretty much the whole of 1999 but then Sep 22 passed me by and I realised  afew days laters whatever it was I was supposed to point out to people on the day.</p>
<p>That was a really boring anecdote. Sorry!</p>
<p>Now I will go.</p>

		<p>I remember watching Terminator 2 on the day that SkyNet was supposed to take over&#8230; September 27, 1997 or something like that.  But it didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>A boring follow-up to a boring anecdote!<br /></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
