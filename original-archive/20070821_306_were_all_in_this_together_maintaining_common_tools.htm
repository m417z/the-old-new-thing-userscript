<p>In the Windows division, as with any other product group, there is a common "bag of tools" that people tend to rely on to get through the day. Occasionally, somebody will encounter a problem with one of these tools.</p>

		<p>A few years ago I was bemoaning the lack of some hypothetical tool that would have been helpful. The guy in the cube next to me remarked &quot;Lucky you&#8217;re a programmer!&quot; I was embarassed because for whatever reason, I hadn&#8217;t even thought of just writing the thing.</p>

		<p>And on the good side, there are the people who email out a specific detailed problem they&#8217;re having with error messages (not in the form of an image pasted into a word document, either) and a potential repro.</p>
<p>By the time you read their message, there are 3 more replies, all from them, with further elaboration on the repro, a potential fix, and an apology for wasting your time, everything&#8217;s fine.</p>

		<p>it&#8217;s still pretty frustrating to send out a mail to a team and have absolutely no one reply back. &nbsp;That eply wasn&#8217;t helpful either. &nbsp;From the gist of the story I would guess the answer is something like &quot;X used to take care of the tool, now he&#8217;s gone so there is no owner&quot;. &nbsp;Typically team leaders should reply to these mails. &nbsp;&quot;Resending&quot; does work sometime when everyone is expecting someone else to reply. &nbsp;Or the person who knows is on vacation. The &quot;we&#8217;re in this together&quot; doesn&#8217;t just apply to writing code!</p>

		<p>Can&#8217;t you just add &#8220;nothing on this blog constitutes an official statement from Microsoft Corporation&#8221; to the page template somehow, so that it shows up under every post? &nbsp;It seems like it would be easier for you, and it would retroactively apply the disclaimer to old posts.</p>

		<p>Nitpicker&#8217;s corner: Raymond, if you plan to publish another edition of &quot;Old New Thing&quot; with the new articles, (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.amazon.com/Old-New-Thing-Development-Throughout/dp/0321440307/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-5828417-9750557?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1187738993&amp;sr=8-1" rel="nofollow">http://www.amazon.com/Old-New-Thing-Development-Throughout/dp/0321440307/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1/102-5828417-9750557?ie=UTF8&#038;s=books&#038;qid=1187738993&#038;sr=8-1</a>)</p>
<p>will it contain the disclaimer on every single</p>
<p>article? I think it should &#8211; if we web readers</p>
<p>were subjected to the disclaimer I think all future readers, including paper-based readers, should be subjected as well.</p>
<p>But seriously: the disclaimer turns what used</p>
<p>to be a pleasant and extremely educational reading into a strange experience. To be honest, people that obsess and keep saying the same thing over and over again scare me&#8230;</p>
<p>With much admiration for all your knowledge and work,</p>
<p>Daniel.</p>

		<p>God, I hate it when people point this out. &nbsp;Because they&#8217;re right. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, then you end up dealing with &quot;internal quality&quot; code, which is utterly appalling. &nbsp;Single letter variables? Check. &nbsp;Functions that cover pages? Check. &nbsp;Redundant code that does nothing at all? Double check and check. &nbsp;Even better when it&#8217;s perl scripts, that are inevitably written to the point where they work once, and then never touched again. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Good times&#8230;</p>

		<p>Regarding this topic: I regularly come across this quite a few times. Saying &quot;Hi, I tried running your xyz tool, it is saying some thing&quot;. They don&#8217;t even read the error message. But I am so passionate about my tools (and confident about them), I usually end up going to their seats, showing where they wrongly configured the tool or the wrong inputs given. By that time I usually loose 0.5 hour ÔÅå.</p>

		<p>Firstly, regarding the disclaimer, I think you should say &quot;does not *necessarily* constitute an official position&quot;. &nbsp;Otherwise you&#8217;ll get plagued with the nitwits who think you&#8217;re saying that Microsoft&#8217;s official position is the exact opposite of whatever you say. &nbsp;(Crazy, I know, but I know they&#8217;re out there.)</p>
<p>Regarding this topic: I&#8217;ve had this happen a few times. &nbsp;On the other hand, I&#8217;m occasionally a little possessive about the tools that I do write, so often I end up being the one making changes to them even though we have a similar shared-ownership policy.</p>

		<p>Yes, it is amazingly annoying when people just say &quot;it&#8217;s throwing up an error box&quot;.</p>
<p>And what does it say, exactly?</p>
<p>A lot of the time it&#8217;ll be something like &quot;you are not allowed to enter numbers&quot; or something. Basically something they can fix themselves if they just read the damn error!</p>

		<p>I have nearly the opposite problem here. &nbsp;The &quot;common&quot; tools just means that everyone uses them. &nbsp;The person who wrote them (we&#8217;ll call him X) closely guards the source code. &nbsp;I can&#8217;t step through the code myself and it&#8217;s hit-or-miss whether X will take a bug report or feature suggestion. &nbsp;:/ &nbsp;Requests to get access to the source code have been met with &quot;Why do you want access?&quot; &nbsp;When I say &quot;There&#8217;s a bug I want to track down.&quot; or &quot;There&#8217;s a feature I want to implement.&quot; are followed by &quot;That&#8217;s not your job. &nbsp;Send an email to X.&quot;</p>

		<p>The problem with &quot;If you found the bug, you should fix it,&quot; is that it can be incredibly inefficient. It falls into the same balderdash of, &quot;If you don&#8217;t like the shoe store in your town, you should start your own or quit complaining.&quot;</p>
<p>No, I need shoes so I can run my hardware store. I need this program to work so I can do my job. And while I CAN hack on that program to make it work, I don&#8217;t know the program and it&#8217;s inefficient for me to stop the work I know well and am assigned and expected to complete to start work on something else. Since most programs HAVE an owner, it&#8217;s worthwhile to ask for help. Why bother hacking on something for a day and a half only for someone to later tell you, &quot;Oh, yeah, Bob&#8217;s had a patch for that, we just never applied it.&quot;</p>
<p>Asking for help is never a bad thing. Being a dick to those people is.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
