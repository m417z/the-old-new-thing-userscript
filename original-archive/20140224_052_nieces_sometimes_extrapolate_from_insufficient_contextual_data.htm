<p>My brother-in-law enjoys greeting his nieces when they come over to visit by throwing them into the air and asking, "&#21483;&#32882;&#25105;?" (Who am I?)</p>
<p> The nieces happily reply, "&#33285;&#33285;." (Uncle.) </p>
<p> He then tosses them up into the air a second time and says, "&#22823;&#32882;&#21874;!" (Louder!) </p>
<p> And the nieces happily shout, "&#33285;&#33285;!" </p>
<p> One time, my wife was talking with her brother at a normal volume, and his niece came into the room and said to my wife, "&#22823;&#32882;&#21874;! &#33285;&#33285;&#32893;&#21780;&#21040;!" (Louder! Uncle can't hear you!) </p>
<p> <b>Update</b>: Per <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/02/24/10502480.aspx#10502650"> Frank's suggestion below</a>, changed the niece's outburst from "&#33285;&#33285;&#20871;&#32893;&#21040;!" The incident occurred many years ago, and I cannot remember exactly what was said, so I'll go with what's funnier. </p>

		<p>Kids always extrapolate from what is already known to them. It&#39;s part of the way they learn. They are, if I may say it, the most interesting experiment in diffuse logic :-) .</p>

		<p>Just wondering. What&#39;s the difference between 舅舅 and a single 舅, which, according to Google Translate, also means &quot;Uncle&quot;? Is it a kid expression?</p>

		<p>@Lev, as I understand, doubling a word in Japanese is an affectionate colloquialism &#8211; perhaps most closely represented in American by something like &quot;Unca&quot; or the use of &quot;Gramps&quot; instead of &quot;Grandfather&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Unsure, you mean Chinese, right? While Japanese do double some things when speaking affectionately (like 父 (chi-chi) or 母 (ha-ha)), they don&#39;t double the kanji usually. &nbsp;They also don&#39;t double with 舅 in this case, possibly because it&#39;s outside of the bloodline (it technically means father-in-law). I don&#39;t know how Chinese works, so I can&#39;t say anything regarding that language and doubled ideograms.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>In Cantonese, doubling is common in child-speak. For close family relations, it changes &quot;Aunt&quot; to &quot;Auntie&quot;, for example. -Raymond</em>]</div>

<p>Glad Raymond chimed in &#8211; sounds like I was mixing my Chinese and Japanese idioms.</p>

		<p>Between 舅舅 and a single 舅 is no essential difference. just like &quot;叔叔&quot; (also Uncle, but means father&#39;s young brother) or &quot;爷爷&quot;(Grandfather), but single &quot;爷&quot; is different.</p>
<p>It is very complex. </p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
