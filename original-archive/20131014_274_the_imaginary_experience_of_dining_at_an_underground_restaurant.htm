<p>I dreamed that my brother complained, "Dude, you didn't leave room for my car in the garage." Well yeah, because I didn't know you were coming. We decide to go out for dinner, and I see that he squeezed a third car into our two-car garage. We back out, and I watch the car fit through a gap of two feet between my car and the garage door.</p>
<p> We drive around and decide to eat at an <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underground_restaurant"> underground restaurant</a> at the home of my retired next-door neighbors (across the street in real life at my old house). </p>
<p> At this point, my dinner partner changes to a former work colleague. Without prompting, she tilts her head back, and her right eye bulges a bit. I'm about to say something when it pops clean out into her hand. I'm quietly freaking out, but she casually pops it back in. It takes a while because it caught on her scarf, so she has to tug the edge of her scarf out of her eye socket. This is her real eye, not a glass eye. </p>
<p> She says, "I was afraid that would happen. But from your reaction, it sounds like it was pretty cool. I want to see it for myself." She leaves for the bathroom where she can pop her eye out in front of a mirror. </p>
<p> While I'm waiting for her to return, the waitress sashays to our table in a billowing green hoop skirt to refill our water. I would have paid more attention to remembering the details of the dress, except that I'm still shaking about that eye thing. </p>
<p> At this point, I was awake and couldn't get back to sleep because, y'know, the eye thing. </p>
<p> I was so shaken, I didn't even bother submitting a review on Yelp. </p>

		<p>I wonder if your subconscious is somehow getting into the Halloween spirit? &nbsp;My sig other and I tend to watch more scary movies and read more horror books in the weeks leading up to Halloween compared to the rest of the year. &nbsp;This dream is quite the departure from your usual dreams (if your dreams could be said to be &quot;usual&quot;).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
