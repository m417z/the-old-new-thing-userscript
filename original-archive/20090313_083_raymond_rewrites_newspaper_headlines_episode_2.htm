		<p>It seems to me that junior high was the classic stuff-em-in-the-locker period, when one encountered 7th graders with muscles like a linebacker&#8217;s and a 5 o&#8217;clock shadow like Nixon&#8217;s.</p>
<p>Of course, kids are bigger in this generation, and with middle schools the 6th graders can be in with some giants.</p>

		<p>How do you rate a 12 year old as the state&#8217;s top safety patrol students?</p>
<p>Are there enough deaths and other accidents at other crossing that they can build a worthwhile list?</p>

		<p>@Gossard &#8212; not safety monitor, just safety patrol. All they do is hold up flags to stop traffic.</p>
<p>As for rating &quot;top safety patrol student,&quot; I think it would have to be based on the least number of fellow-pupils killed or maimed [by traffic] during this kid&#8217;s shift.</p>

		<p>When I was coming up through high school I always wondered why movies and such showed lockers, kids getting stuffed into lockers, etc.</p>
<p>All the lockers in every high school I have ever been to (including those that I merely played an &quot;away game&quot; at) were sealed shut until the school could afford to rip them out, and several schools (particularly the newer ones) didn&#8217;t have lockers at all. The only lockers were in the P.E., and those were just drawers. So we never had locker stuffings, but the stated reason for no-lockers was because of the threat from school shootings.</p>
<p>Do high schools elsewhere in the country still have lockers?</p>

		<p>My little brother just graduated high school, and they still had lockers. &nbsp;School shootings is a pretty silly reason to ban lockers, considering no school shooter in history has ever stored his guns in his locker. &nbsp;Normally they are stored in the trunk of his car.</p>

<p>As far as I know, yes. I&#8217;ve never even heard of a high school (in the US) without lockers&#8230;</p>

		<p>All the High Schools I&#8217;ve been at in the US had lockers, but they were way too small to fit a human being inside (or even some of the books we had, for that matter)</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I never claimed the administrators of our school unions were intelligent. They do tend to&#8230; overreact. As do parents, admittedly.</p>
<blockquote><p>

<p>Well, now you have. Come on down to sunny San Diego, home of the Chargers, world famous San Diego Zoo, and crazy school administrators.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t aware that lockers were responsible for all the shootings. I would have thought we might have spotted some malcontent lockers smoking and using drugs, too.</p>
<p>Because clearly they didn&#8217;t mean they thought that by getting rid of lockers, they could actually stop any determined malicious students from hiding guns at all.</p>
<p>Or maybe they do. I keep a locker here in my home, in which I store all the contraband that I would not like the police to find if they were to raid my house. Hmm. Maybe they ARE genius!</p>

		<p>Why was the safety patrol student walking behind the other student? &nbsp;Seems he should be in front. &nbsp;Or, have one safety patrol student with a flag in front, and one behind. &nbsp;:-)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
