<p>Work on Windows occurs in several different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_(software)"> branches</a> of the source code, and changes in one branch propagate to other branches. When talking about a feature or other task becoming visible in a branch, the preferred jargon word at Microsoft is <i>landing</i>. In its purest form:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We expect the feature to <u>land</u> in the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/07/04/10431671.aspx"> trunk</a> early next week. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The term <i>land</i> when used in this way is typically used to describe a feature arriving in a branch different from its home branch. </p>
<p> From this basic meaning, extended usages arise. </p>
<p> The term <i>landing</i> is often accompanied by additional aviation adjectives to describe how smoothly the feature will arrive or the task will be completed. In these extended usages, the location of landing is often the feature's home branch. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We're coming in for a <u>hard landing</u> on bugs. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> A <i>hard landing</i> is one that is rather inelegant. An example would be a feature that arrives fully functional but rather unpolished, or in the above example, that the bugs are all resolved, but perhaps with more bugs marked <i>Won't fix</i> or <i>Postponed</i> than management would have liked. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The feature is going to <u>land hot</u>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> A feature with a <i>hot landing</i> barely makes its deadline. You can also say that a feature is <i>coming in hot</i> if it is headed for a hot landing, and a feature is <i>running hot</i> if its current trajectory suggests that it's going to land hot. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The last thing that <u>came in hot</u> was Feature&nbsp;X and we did not <u>land</u> it well. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I like the above citation because it employs both metaphors. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We did not have a good process in place for managing the specs that <u>came in hot</u>. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Several deployments are <u>coming in hot</u> due to other resource commitments. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> More generally, something is <i>coming in hot</i> if it is running right up against a deadline and is at risk for being late. </p>

		<p>I quite like the purest form. It&#39;s clear what the meaning is. I wouldn&#39;t consider that usage microspeak at all.</p>
<p>The other examples are all classic microspeak; you&#39;d have no idea what the person was talking about if you weren&#39;t already &quot;in the know&quot;. They&#39;re all beautiful examples of how a person can obfuscate a message in order to make themselves feel smarter/more important.</p>

		<p>@Raymond: You&#39;ve done two little bits on source code management, one on the &quot;Blue Line&quot; and this one on &quot;Landing&quot;, and it got me thinking: is there a chance that you might ever do a an article or series on source code management at Microsoft? &nbsp;I&#39;m not talking about a super-detailed investigation, but a high-level overview. &nbsp;Source code management is rarely spoken of exception in generalities, and I&#39;d be interested in seeing some real-world implementations.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: Works well for a team of 10-20. Doesn&#39;t scale for a team of 10,000. Any small error causes the whole team to be held up. Safer to develop in a branch and push when the feature is completed, but does mean that cross-feature dependencies can end up waiting a while for bug fixes.</p>
<p>@ipoverscsi: Mark Lucovsky made a presentation to Usenix in 2000, detailing the new methods they were using for Windows 2000 and XP. Brian Harry wrote how Developer Division were using source control in 2005 <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2005/11/12/492198.aspx">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/492198.aspx</a> and <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/bharry/archive/2005/11/13/492258.aspx">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/492258.aspx</a> . <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.windowswiki.info/2010/05/18/a-little-story-about-feature-build-labs/">http://www.windowswiki.info/&#8230;/a-little-story-about-feature-build-labs</a> mentions that Windows 7 changed from &#39;virtual build labs&#39; to &#39;feature build labs&#39; &#8211; that instead of doing a &#39;round robin&#39; push from each VBL in turn, that the feature is pushed from the FBL when it&#39;s stable.</p>

		<p>@Mike Dimmick, @Joshua: Actually, may not even work for a team of 4, if they&#39;re split in 2 groups of 2 working on 2 different releases. I&#39;ve been in exactly the kind of hell you describe, on a very small team.</p>

		<p>Whoever The Smurf is grasps it well I think. It probably works just fine until you have two teams working on two release targets and the shorter-range release target is more than a bugfix.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
