<p>I've been informed that the Redmond branch of the Microsoft Company Store has begun stocking the dead tree edition of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/07/1233002.aspx"> my book</a>.</p>
<p> "But wait, your book isn't printed by Microsoft Press; it's published by Addison-Wesley Professional. I thought the company store only stocked Microsoft Press titles." </p>
<p> I'm told that this is a pilot program. (And no, I don't know what the success criteria are.) </p>
<p> When I stopped by the store a few days ago, they were in the process of reorganizing the book section, so not only was my book not up, neither were any others! But it should be there "any day now." </p>
<p> And remember, I'll gladly sign your book <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/01/31/1565656.aspx"> but you have to tell me what to write</a>. </p>

		<p>An easy way to make sure your antecedents are clear is to make your pronouns demonstrative adjectives or just the original noun itself (or more importantly, the noun you _really_ meant). &nbsp;I hate ambiguous bug reports and technical documentation. &nbsp;For example,</p>
<p>Ambiguous:</p>
<p>Program XYZ is popping up an odd window and then it freezes, but when I click OK, then it starts responding. &nbsp;Is that a known problem?</p>
<p>Pronouns replaced:</p>
<p>Program XYZ is popping up an odd window and then [the main window] freezes, but when I click OK [on the odd window], then [the main window] starts responding. &nbsp;Is [that freezing behavior] a known problem?</p>
<p>Ahh, much better.</p>

		<p>This has got to be one of the biggest problems I face with my clients. &nbsp;Pronouns without antecedants. &nbsp;</p>
<p>All to often have I had clients call me up and use the word it in a string of five sentences with no antecedant whatsoever.</p>
<p>&quot;I had opened it up when it said this error and I thought I had done it wrong but maybe it was just being buggy.&quot;</p>
<p>And then they get pissed off when I tell them I have no idea what they are talking about.</p>

		<p>&gt; And then they get pissed off when I tell them I have no idea what they are talking about.</p>
<p>If you have no idea what person X is talking about, the chances are that person X doesn&#8217;t know either. Far too many people just blather on in vague terms rather than simply admit that they don&#8217;t really understand something.</p>

		<p>Ian,</p>
<p>Sometimes that is the case but in others the person is just talking to fast or making assumptions (or doesn&#8217;t want to take the time to type out a well-formed email).</p>

		<p>The worst is when you get some kind of problem report and it consists of &quot;When I try to do X, it doesn&#8217;t work&quot;.</p>
<p>ARRRRRGGGGHHHH!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious it doesn&#8217;t work. &nbsp;If it worked, you wouldn&#8217;t be calling! &nbsp;What isn&#8217;t obvious is why it doesn&#8217;t work for you!</p>

		<p>Ian,</p>
<p>A big problem in computing is that a lot of users don&#8217;t know the terminology. Imagine trying to describe a problem in Word&#8217;s UI if you don&#8217;t know the terms &quot;toolbar&quot; or &quot;icon.&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
