		<p>&quot;So why establish a convention contrary to existing practice?&quot;</p>
<p>Adding the -Ex suffix is much better than adding the Ext- prefix because it keeps closely related functions together in alphabetically sorted indices (or &quot;indexes&quot; if you prefer).</p>
<p>My guess is that the problem with Ext- prefixes quickly became apparent as the Windows API documentation grew and became more organised, although I wasn&#8217;t there and may be wrong.</p>
<p>(Of course, MSDN could use a special sorting algorithm on its index but why go to that trouble just to preserve a convention that hasn&#8217;t been used much and is of little other consequence?)</p>

		<p>The DirectX team has the best solution, in my opinion: IDirect3D, IDirect3D2, &#8230;, IDirect3Dx with x being the interface version.</p>
<p>Simple, understandable, and avoids the -Ex suffix which only works once and must then be turned into ExX with X being the version anyway.</p>

		<p>IIRC many of the -Ex functions instead of a regular parameter list takes a pointer to a struct with parameters, and often the first field of that struct is a &quot;size of struct&quot; one. This essentially makes it possible to use the size field as a &quot;version&quot; field and upgrade the struct without changing the function, and let newer implementations of the function accept several versions of the struct.</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;m not sure what an older implementation of the function should do if it receives an unknown version of the struct.</p>

<p>Good luck with that. I think Raymond has covered many cases where that can&#8217;t be done because some big names didn&#8217;t understand the size field.</p>

		<p>I think newer implementations *do* accept several versions of the struct. Otherwise, applications written with an older SDK will fail to run ot newer OS versions.</p>

		<p>Narr: That works fine provided the very first implementation (and subsequent ones, of course) enforce the size value. Then, any code which passes an incorrect size value will never have worked anyway, neatly avoiding the need to compensate for author incompetence there.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
