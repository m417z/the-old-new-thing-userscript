<p>While it's true that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/01/01/9942741.aspx#9942950"> the cheesy Steve Ballmer Windows video had bad music, bad hair, and bad acting</a>, it's also true that all that cheese was intentional.</p>
<p> That video was produced for and shown at the Company Meeting, back when a mainstay of the Company Meeting was spoofs of popular television advertisements&mdash;what today would be called "virally popular"&mdash;with Bill Gates and other senior executives taking the starring roles. The "Crazy Steve" video was a spoof of late-night television advertisements, the most direct influence being the popular-at-the-time <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/09/15/9895185.aspx"> Crazy Eddie</a> commercials. </p>
<p> So enjoy the "Crazy Steve" video, but don't fool yourself into thinking this was a real commercial. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus commercial chatter</b>: I don't know the story behind the commercial <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/01/01/9942741.aspx#9942969"> produced by crack-smoking monkeys</a>. It was shot in one of the Microsoft old-campus buildings, but I don't recognize any of the actors. This leaves open the horrific possibility that the advertisement was for real! </p>
<p> <b>Extra bonus chatter</b>: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4A_Kkb9w5bw"> The original Windows&nbsp;XP commercial</a>, featuring Madonna's <i>Ray of Light</i>, had to be abandoned less than two months before launch thanks to the events of September 11, 2001: A commercial featuring people flying was deemed to be in bad taste so soon after the event. I don't know how they did it, but the marketing department managed to put together a new ad campaign in less than two months. (This also explains why some online ads for Windows&nbsp;XP employed the song <i>Ray of Light</i>, even though the song had nothing to do with the new Windows&nbsp;XP ad campaign: They were leftovers which could be salvaged because they didn't depict flying.) </p>
<p> Too bad, because I liked the original campaign. </p>
<p> <b>Double secret bonus chatter</b>: Could this be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VPFKnBYOSI#t=56.7s"> proto-Kylie</a>? </p>
<p> <b>Update</b>: an article which includes another story about <a href="http://www.crn.com/crn/special/supplement/763/763p15_hof.jhtml"> the filming of the spoof commercial</a>. </p>

		<p>The &quot;w-w-w-windows&quot; lady went on to do ads for a local eyeware chain (think LensCrafters). &nbsp;Every time it went on my wife and I went &quot;hey, it&#8217;s w-w-w-windows!&quot;.</p>
<p>At the very end of the video the man she walks off with is Adrian King who was also the voice of &quot;real networks&quot;. &nbsp;I believe that Scott Oki is the person whose shakes her hand just before she walks off with Adrian.</p>
<p>Several of the people in the lobby were Microsoft employees, many of them in human resources (the video was filmed in the human resources corridor).</p>
<p>I wrote about that video when it first surfaced: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2007/01/29/nostalgia-waxes.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2007/01/29/nostalgia-waxes.aspx</a></p>

		<p>The Script writers for the w-w-w-w&#8211;windows video (I guess these would be the crack-smoking monkeys) are listed as Tom Corddry &nbsp;and Adrian King. &nbsp;Larry already points out that Adrian &quot;was the head of the OS division at the time. &nbsp;He later left Microsoft with Rob Glaser to found Real Networks&quot;. &nbsp;Tom apparently ran the team that created Encarta.</p>

		<p>&quot;Brian Boy&quot; (starring Brian Valentine) is my favorite movie of all time. &nbsp;It&#8217;s even better than &quot;Tommy Boy&quot; on which it&#8217;s based.</p>

		<p>Hi,</p>
<p>There was a funny &quot;matrix-like&quot; video by MS as well, it was created in 2000 (shortly after releasing Win2000) and was shown in Hungary during the preparation for the &quot;Competition 2000&quot; competition. It was said by the MS employees that it would not be released for the &quot;public&quot;.</p>
<p>Ah, I can see &quot;jon&quot; also mentioned this video. So is it true that it was not for the public?</p>

		<p>I prefer the Apple advert with the girl who&#8217;s clearly stoned.</p>
<p>As for internal company type stuff &#8211; the Shell song is (unintentionally) funny beyond belief. It&#8217;s set to the tune of &#8216;We are the World&#8217; and includes the lyrics &quot;We have moved on, growing day by day/Sharing strengths, we practise what is best/We are all a part of Shell’s global family/Doing work aligned with everyone.&quot;</p>

		<p>Funny enough, the only commercials about Windows XP I remember *were* those flying ones &#8211; I don&#8217;t remember the others, nor noticed that they disappeared after 9/11.</p>
<p>I also remember the webcomic User Friendly spoofing that, and people on Slashdot threatening to &quot;sue&quot; because they couldn&#8217;t fly.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
