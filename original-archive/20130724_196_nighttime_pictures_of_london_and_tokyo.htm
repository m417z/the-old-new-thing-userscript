		<p>@Matteo: I can assure you, the roundabouts are going the right way. Us Brits would feel uncomfortable with them the other way around!</p>

		<p>@Dave: if it&#39;s of any consolation to you, here in Italy the situation before the 30s was completely crazy:</p>
<p>«In Vicenza they kept right, but in the province of Verona they kept left. Interrogated about it, the prefect explained that the decision was took in 1907 to ease the installation of tramways. Unfortunately, after 15 years, still people didn&#39;t follow strictly the ordinance, and accidents happened every day [&#8230;]</p>
<p>In Ravenna they kept right but, in the street for Porto Corsini, for «ancient tradition» they stayed on the left. In Bergamo they kept left, in Brescia right. In the province of Como they kept left, but in the surroundings of Varese and Lecco «they mostly kept right». [&#8230;]</p>
<p>In some towns near Catalnissetta they drove on the left, while the prefect of Trapani declared that in his city they «usually» kept right «but not always»; indeed, the cart drivers feared motorized vehicles and, when these got nearby, they moved towards the center of the road, thus on the left, to reduce the risk that the animals, scared by the cars, got out of the road [&#8230;] but they risked to get into the faster cars coming from the other direction, with the predictable catastrophic consequences. The province of Perugia, for this reason, had an extremely high mortality. [&#8230;]</p>
<p>In Milan, Turin, Genoa, La Spezia, Savona, Parma and even in Rome they decided to drive on the left; at the edge of the city, though, a sign warned the drivers to move immediately on the right.»</p>
<p>(here the original article in Italian: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2011/07/24/quando-italia-si-butto-destra.html">ricerca.repubblica.it/&#8230;/quando-italia-si-butto-destra.html</a> )</p>

		<p>I found these Ferris Wheels always a nice addition to the night views of a city.</p>

		<p>@Matteo: funny you&#39;d mention that. &nbsp;I&#39;m in Australia, where we also drive on the left (something about nations that were conquered by or allied with the French driving on the right, vs all the rest driving on the left) and I was most annoyed with Google Maps in its early years. &nbsp;The directions for driving on roundabouts all assumed you were driving on the right, so going counter-clockwise on the roundabouts. &nbsp;Suppose you&#39;re on the south road heading north to a roundabout with exists in all four cardinal directions. &nbsp;If your journey required you to turn right, Google Maps would say &quot;take the first exit&quot;, which is incorrect. &nbsp;They fixed it some time in the mid-noughties, I believe, because it&#39;s fine now.</p>

		<p>Well at least nobody here is calling them traffic circles.</p>

		<p>Traffic circles? Is that what UFOs create when they land in a road rather than a field?</p>

		<p>@Eric: I always found those indications in roundabouts confusing anyway &#8211; if they tell me &quot;take the third exit&quot; I still have to look at the screen to get what direction it actually is. For me, the solution would be to tell the angle you have to cover over the roundabout (&quot;at the next roundabout, take the exit at 120 degrees&quot;), bonus points for indications in radians; but I can see that not many people would find such a system intuitive. :)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
