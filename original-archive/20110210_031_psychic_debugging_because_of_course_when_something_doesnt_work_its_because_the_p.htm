When something stops working, you begin developing theories
for why it doesn't work,
and normally, you start with simple theories that involve
things close to you, and only after you exhaust those
possibilities do you expand your scope.
Typically, you don't consider that there is
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/10/05/9903476.aspx#9903930">
a global conspiracy against you</a>,
or at least that's not usually your first theory.

I'm trying to use the XYZ.DLL that comes with your product.
I have successfully registered this DLL (as specified in the
documentation) by performing a
<code>regsvr32 C:\path\to\XYZ.DLL</code>.
</p>
<p>
According to the documentation, I should now be able to create
a <code>Xyz.Xyz&shy;Widgetizer</code> object,
but when I try to do so from C#, I get the exception
</p>
<pre>
Retrieving the COM class factory for component with CLSID
{...} failed due to the following error: 80040154.
</pre>
<p>
I tried using the Visual Basic code sample which comes with
the documentation, which contains only two lines:
</p>
<pre>
Dim oXyzWidgetizer
Set oXyzWidgetizer = WScript.CreateObject("Xyz.XyzWidgetizer")
</pre>
<p>
However, it still fails with the following error:
</p>
<pre>
Microsoft (R) Windows Script Host Version 5.7
Copyright (C) Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.
C:\test.vbs(2, 1) WScript.CreateObject: Could not create object
                  named "Xyz.XyzWidgetizer".
</pre>
<p>
Has support for the XyzWidgetizer been silently dropped?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Let's look at the error message more closely.
Error 80040154 is <code>REGDB_<wbr>E_<wbr>CLASSNOTREG</wbr></wbr></code>:
The class is not registered.
Therefore, whatever <code>regsvr32</code> did,
it didn't register the class.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
My psychic powers tell me that you registered the 32-bit version of
XYZ.DLL on a 64-bit machine.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Registering the 32-bit DLL records the entries into the 32-bit registry
(because
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/12/22/9244582.aspx">
32-bit programs run in an emulator</a>),
and the 32-bit registry
is not consulted when you try to create a COM object
from a 64-bit application.
Letting 64-bit applications see the registration for 32-bit DLLs
doesn't actually accomplish anything because
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/10/20/9006720.aspx">
you cannot load a 32-bit DLL into a 64-bit process and vice
versa</a>&mdash;even if a 64-bit process can figure out what DLL it wants,
it won't able to load it.
</p>
<p>
It so happens that my psychic powers were correct.
How did I know that the person asking the question was running
the 32-bit version of XYZ on a 64-bit version of Windows?
I didn't, but it was the simplest theory that fit the (extremely
limited) data.
And it didn't involve a global conspiracy.</p>

		<p>Possibly not relevant here, but given all the bad side-effects of the inability to load a DLL of the wrong bitness, I&#39;ve often wondered why there isn&#39;t some sort of setting that would allow a nominally inproc COM server to be loaded in a surrogate process of the appropriate bitness when it can&#39;t be loaded inproc. Or maybe there is such a setting and I just don&#39;t know about it?</p>

<p>The problem has obviously nothing to do with DirectX or the user mode still image APIs, so it&#39;s most likely REGDB_E_CLASSNOTREG. (You could also argue that one doesn&#39;t need to know about the concrete APIs since each listed error code implies that something isn&#39;t registered.)</p>

		<p>Mr. Rosenfield is correct. Yes, this error is easy to Google, but more often that not, you end up finding a bunch of posts asking what the error means, with a bunch of people replying to the post who haven&#39;t read the post to begin with, with the thread finally ending with an MVP saying &quot;I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m just an MVP, I don&#39;t work for Microsoft.&quot;</p>

<p>We still COM-interop to office but otherwise no 64 bit COM.</p>
<p>One VB6 COM component still survives. The EXE that uses it is compiled 32 bit.</p>

		<p>@Adam etc.</p>
<p>If you have Visual Studio then you already have an Error Lookup tool in the Tools menu (by default). Type 0x80040154 in and it&#39;ll tell you the error is &quot;class not registered&quot;. (Don&#39;t forget the 0x part.)</p>
<p>I also wrote my own little error-lookup tool which can do the reverse lookup, i.e. find error codes based on some or all of their error messages. (It can also do number-&gt;message lookups. It saves you having to know/care whether the error code is hex/signed/unsigned but apart from that is no better than the other tools; that wasn&#39;t why I wrote it.) I wrote it to make it easier to find a suitable error code values to return when writing code. e.g. Type &#39;access&#39; and &#39;denied&#39; into it and it&#39;ll show you all the error codes that have those words in their messages. It only knows about the errors from the main SDK headers but the source is there if anyone wants to add more:</p>

		<p>I assume you see problems from the field which may require changes to Microsoft code, as well as programming errors.</p>
<p>What&#39;s the ratio of (&quot;true bug&quot;) code change problems to problems solvable by consulting an experienced programmer or even just RTFM?</p>
<p>I&#39;m wondering about setting up an &quot;agent&quot; or &quot;screening&quot; business, where It&#39;s statically cheaper to have me look over problems, forwarding to Microsoft only the problems that can&#39;t be handled by user education, good debugging techniques, and/or psychic debugging&#8230;</p>

		<p>My favorite global conspiracy theory is &quot;This security hole is so unusually difficult to trigger that MS must have intentionally put it in as a backdoor&quot;. As if it&#39;s so unusual that bugs are difficult to trigger &#8212; of course *most* bugs are difficult to trigger, which is why they weren&#39;t found before the product was released!</p>

		<p>&quot;Has support for the XyzWidgetizer been silently dropped?&quot;</p>
<p>You know, he wasn&#39;t far off the mark there. There *is* no support for the XyzWidgetizer on his new platform and XyzWidgetizer users weren&#39;t specifically warned of the change. :)</p>

		<p>Presumably the vbscript code sample would have worked if he&#39;d used C:WINDOWSSysWOW64cscript.exe to launch it. (I was surprised to find that the 32-bit version lives in a folder with a 64 suffix&#8230;)</p>

		<p>16 to 32 bit migration was easy.</p>
<p>32 to 64 bit migration will be part of our lives for the next decade.</p>

<p>The err.exe lookup tool: you can get the best / latest version from the Windows SDK install (it&#39;s in the bin directory) rather than using the Exchange download. Not that these things change at any great rate.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
