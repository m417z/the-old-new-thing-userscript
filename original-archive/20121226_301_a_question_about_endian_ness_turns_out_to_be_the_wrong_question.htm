<p>Via a customer liaison, we received what seemed like a simple question: "How can I detect whether a Windows machine is <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/robunoki/archive/2006/04/05/568737.aspx"> big-endian or little-endian</a>?"</p>
<p> You could actually answer this question (say by coughing up a code fragment that stores a 16-bit value to memory and then takes it apart into bytes to see how it got stored, or by simply hard-coding it based on the target architecture you are compiling for), but you'd be making the mistake of answering the question instead of solving the problem. </p>
<p> The customer liaison explained, "My customer is having a problem that is caused by a bug in the SAP BI connector. According to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/973292"> the Knowledge Base article</a>, the problem occurs when the SAP BI server is installed on a big-endian system." </p>
<p> Okay, with that background, we immediately recognize that the question is wrong. The problem occurs when the <i>SAP BI server</i> is running on a big-endian system. It doesn't matter what the endian-ness of the Windows machine is, so any mechanism for detecting whether the Windows machine is big-endian or little-endian is barking up the wrong tree. </p>
<p> But it turns out that the customer never even had to do this detection at all. If you read the Knowledge Base article, it says that the problem is already fixed. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The fix for this issue was first released in Cumulative Update 4 for SQL Server 2008 Service Pack 1.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> So just make sure you're running Cumulative Update 4 for SQL Server 2008 Service Pack 1 or higher (which, if you've been making any attempt at keeping your server up to date, you've been doing for <i>three years</i>), and the problem will go away. </p>
<p> The customer liaison thanked us for our assistance, but nevertheless asked for the code that would detect the endian-ness of the Windows system. I asked, "How will that help you solve your problem?" but before the customer liaison answered, some other people just gave the customer code that detects the machine endian-ness. </p>
<p> Even though that will do absolutely nothing to solve the customer's problem. </p>
<p> That was the last we heard from the customer liaison. I'm hoping that they actually installed the service pack and solved their problem. And I'm afraid what they're going to do with that code fragment. </p>

<p>That makes me think of an explosion in the horizon as the customer deploys the irrelevant Endianess-detection code where it doesn&#39;t belong.</p>

<p>It&#39;s more likly the customer liason was focused on answering the customers question and not the customers problem. I doubt it was about learning something new.</p>

		<p>Did Windows ever run on any big-endian hardware ? &nbsp;I thought it was all little-endian. x86 x64 and Alpha are all little-endian. IA64, MIPS and PowerPC can use either endianness, but I think Windows always uses little-endian.</p>

		<p>@Nikolas Gloy: There is also ARM, which AFAIK can also be either endian, but most people seem to use in little-endian mode. I do not know which mode Windows uses, but I can guess it uses little-endian there too, like everybody else does.</p>

		<p>Re Mikki: Yes the customer learnt something. When troubleshooting don&#39;t make up random solutions until you understand the root cause. Which they didn&#39;t. They also learnt they should read the knowledge base more carefully endian-ness problem relates to the &quot;SAP BI Server&quot; is running on, and in future they don&#39;t take to take this into consideration for the Windows machine &#8230;</p>

		<p>@Maurits: actually, type-punning via unions is not guaranteed by the standard (although I have yet to see a compiler that doesn&#39;t allow it); still, it&#39;s more portable (and also more compact) just to do a memcpy from an integer to an array of chars:</p>
<p>unsigned int i=1;</p>
<p>char buf[sizeof(i)];</p>
<p>memcpy(buf, &amp;i, sizeof(i));</p>
<p>if(buf[0])</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;puts(&quot;Little-endian&quot;);</p>
<p>else if(buf[sizeof(i)-1])</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;puts(&quot;Big-endian&quot;);</p>
<p>else</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;puts(&quot;May God have mercy of your soul.&quot;)</p>
<p>(actually, a more through check would compare all the bytes of buf against the known pattern for big-endian and little-endian, but there&#39;s a limit to paranoia against mixed-endian architectures)</p>

		<p>@Matteo: True, though you can also do the following:</p>
<p>int i = 1;</p>
<p>char *ptr = (char*)i;</p>
<p>bool little_endian = *ptr; // MSVC gives a &quot;performance warning&quot; here, so use &quot;*ptr == 1&quot;; although obviously paranoid people can check for mixed endian, etc.</p>

		<p>What on Earth would you even do given that the server was Big or Little-Endian? &nbsp;Just install the update!!!</p>
<p>I&#39;m not even sure why they were wondering how to detect if the system was big or little endian&#8230; it&#39;s actually quite trivial to check. &nbsp;Maybe they checked it themselves, were unable to get the answer they were after (because the question was wrong in the first place) and then decided to double-check by asking MS.</p>

		<p>I seem to recall Raymond answering the similar question of &quot;how do I tell at runtime if my 64 bit app is running on 64 bit Windows?&quot; (Answer: It is. On anything other than a 64 bit system, it won&#39;t run at all!); with the possible corner case of the Xbox 360, it seems &quot;how do I tell if my Windows application is on a little-endian machine?&quot; is another &quot;yes, it is&quot;. I can&#39;t imagine too many Xboxes connect to SAP servers directly.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  what seemed like a simple question
</p></blockquote>
<p>Obviously answering that simple question (on any system) in a bug free way is not trivial as it seems: the bug with the connector production code is not being able to detect this correctly.</p>
<p>Also it makes me wonder how such a bug survives testing, or if any were done at all.</p>

		<p>I know that they should have installed the Cumulative update, but there&#39;s some MIS that I know refrain from install patches to their system, fearing it&#39;ll break their programs. Given that they haven&#39;t installed something they should have installed 3 years ago, I&#39;m afraid that they&#39;ll go to the &quot;code route&quot; if someone said it&#39;s possible.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t laugh&#8230; at my previous company, we have a client that is a bank still doing UAT for 20+ earlier release of our company&#39;s flagship server software&#8230; Things are like dead water that won&#39;t move forward&#8230;</p>

		<p>Testing the endianess of the server provides the evidence that the patch upgrade is worth the risk to the (otherwise) working system.</p>
<p>On high reliability standalone (non-internet connected) systems that have been working for years, changing software can be a very arduous (tedious) process, proving to risk averse people responsible that change is necessary.</p>

		<p>@jas88, &quot;Answer: It is.&quot;</p>
<p>When 32 bit Windows came out, it was the only thing running 32 bit applications. That is, until Win32s and Windows XP x64.</p>
<p>Who knows until when will it be true that 64 bit applications are only running on a 64 bit Windows? Who knows how can we check for other combinations? Who knows what we might need to do different? Do we need to do anything different?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>But what would you do if the answer is &quot;You are running on a version of Windows you have never heard of and know nothing about&quot;? -Raymond</em>]</div>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
