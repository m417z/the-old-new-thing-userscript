<p> The winner completes the race in just ten minutes and seven seconds, but the vertical climb is a killer: Straight up the 1576 steps of the <a href="http://www.esbnyc.com/"> Empire State Building</a> to the Observation deck.

<p> And when it's over, everybody goes to work. </p>

No, you  slink into work and you sit at your desk, and you work all day, and when you're done you stand up and your back is stiff, and you call your wife, and you get yelled at, and you go home to your three kids. Just like another day. </p>

		<p>1576 steps / 10 minutes = 157.6 steps a minute = 2.63 steps / second. &nbsp;Basically 5 steps every 2 seconds. &nbsp;For 10 minutes straight. &nbsp;I am sucking wind after 2 flights of stairs; I am pretty sure I would die if I tried this.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s hard core. I love the stair machine at my gym, and I take the stairs at work, but I can&#8217;t imagine 1567 steps in 10 minutes.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s a pretty funny comment about the apres-event routine too :)</p>

<p>Geez, there&#8217;s a bad attitude. &nbsp;Of course you&#8217;d go celebrate with martinis after climbing that much.</p>

		<p>10:07? Meh. The fastest time was 9:33. Of course that was in 2003 so it was probably under the influence of EPO.</p>

		<p>He should have said &quot;What else am I going to do, like go celebrate? Am I going to go have a tank of oxygen and an ice bath for my legs at 11:30 in the morning?&quot;</p>

		<p>@John: This event was covered recently in Runners World UK; they said one should take one&#8217;s 5k time as a reasonable guide. The current 5k *world record* is 12-something, I think &#8211; so no one&#8217;s expecting normal people to do this in 10 minutes.</p>

<p>No. At least it does seems legimitate to do some cool-down exercise and take some good rest later&#8230; Anything but going to work, I&#8217;ll say. :)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
