<p>A customer wanted to prevent users from copying files to certain locations, and they did it by hooking functions like <code>SHFileOperation</code> and failing the operation if the parameters were not to its liking. The customer found that the hooks stopped working in Windows Vista because Explorer in Windows Vista uses the new <code>IFileOperation</code> COM interface instead of using the old <code>SHFileOperation</code> function. The customer wanted assistance in getting their hook working again so they could prevent users from copying files to directories they wanted to block.</p>
<p> Well, first of all, arbitrary function hooking is not supported by any version of Windows, so the customer was already in unsupported territory right off the bat. (There are some components which have an infrastructure for hooks, such as <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/whdc/driver/filterdrv/default.mspx"> file system filter drivers</a> or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msj/0599/LayeredService/LayeredService.aspx"> Winsock Layered Service Providers</a>.) </p>
<p> Second, attempting to hook <code>SHFileOperation</code> to prevent the user from copying files into specific directories is looking at the problem at the wrong level, similar to the people who <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/04/10/9541813.aspx"> want to block drag/drop when what they really want to block is accidental drag/drop</a>. If you block copying files via drag/drop in Explorer, that won't stop the user from copying files by other means, or by doing the "poor man's copy" by opening the document from the source location and doing a <i>Save As</i> to create a duplicate in the destination. </p>
<p> If you want to prevent the user from copying files to a directory, use the NTFS security model. Withhold <i>Create files</i> permission in the folder, and users will be blocked from copying files into the directory in Explorer, Notepad, or any other program. </p>

		<p>For goodness sake, don&#8217;t create new Layered Service Providers! &nbsp;It&#8217;s really hard to write one correctly, and when you make a bad one, it causes many, many customer issues (like, &#8220;I can&#8217;t connect to the internet&#8221;)</p>
<p>Heck, Layered Service Providers cause enough problems that there&#8217;s knowledge base articles on how to reset your Winsock catalog (It turns out the command to use is &#8220;netsh winsock reset&#8221;)(but don&#8217;t just run it to see what it does &#8212; some Layered Service Providers are essential)</p>
<p>The &#8220;Windows Filtering Platform&#8221; provides much of the same functionality without the danger to your customers. &nbsp;Many companies that used to provide Layered Service Providers have switched to the Windows Filtering Platform.</p>

		<p>To me this is one of those &quot;restating the obvious&quot;, and more proof to what I said earlier: Just because it&#8217;s obvious doesn&#8217;t mean people realize it.</p>
<p>If you want to prevent copying and creating files, why not do the obvious and revoke creation permission? Because to them, it&#8217;s not obvious, and they think, &quot;Hmm, may a shell hook?&quot; and then go off on that tangent without ever thinking that there is an optimal solution.</p>

		<p>I know nothing about the history, but as they have written it before Windows Vista, I might think that maybe they used FAT32 at the time, thus permissions wouldn&#8217;t work.</p>
<p>That doesn&#8217;t make arbitrary unsupported hooking any better, but it may reduce their sentence from death penalty to lifelong imprisonment instead.</p>

		<p>Yeah, they might have wanted to have some kind of smart filtering on it (you can copy these things, but not these other things; this application however can do whatever it wants on your behalf). &nbsp;The NTFS security model isn&#8217;t capable of doing that sort of thing; you need some kind of hook somewhere.</p>

		<p>The difficult problem here is that they wanted to prevent *certain* files from being copied. That&#8217;s incredibly hard to do (like the Halting Problem).</p>
<p>Hooking drag-n-drop to accomplish this is like hooking right-click on a web page to prevent people from &quot;downloading your copyrighted images&quot;.</p>

		<p>What if you don&#8217;t know that the file copy shouldn&#8217;t be allowed until it&#8217;s attempted? &nbsp;Or if the user should be allowed to copy anything into the folder *except* certain files? &nbsp;Granted the hook won&#8217;t cover other copying methods but if you&#8217;re only concerned about casual/easy copying&#8230;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but wonder if it&#8217;s time to take a step back and re-think the data persistence model. &nbsp;If there are files that shouldn&#8217;t be copied by the user should the user be able to see them at all?</p>

		<p>The only solution to the problem of information isolation is to separate runtime environment and/or security context for protected and unprotected information. When you run in a context where you can read classified information, you should not be able to write to unprotected storage. And vice versa.</p>

		<p>[How do you prevent somebody from taking a digital picture of the monitor? -Raymond]</p>
<p>This is the ultimate question. But not all information to be protected has graphical or human-readable representation. And usually the amount of it takes many many screens.</p>
<p>In the end, the purpose of the exercise is to make a accidental information leak impossible, and make a data theft difficult to the point when such attempts can be detected by external (non-computer) means, such as observation.</p>

		<p>&quot;&#8230;Though I find it interesting that people can&#8217;t even get the documented API hooking method right;&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>All the issues I encountered with Layered Service Providers were a result of two layered providers conflicting with each other. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The API that installs a layered provider asks the developer of the provider to build a stack of providers starting with a base provider. &nbsp; When no other provider is present this is not problem, but when a stack with a layered provider is already present in the system the developer has to decide where in that stack to put his layered provider. &nbsp; Without knowing anything about the other providers there&#8217;s no way to know what is the right order.</p>

<p>Yes, and then security guards can take out recorded videos of the information they were supposed to save instead of see.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
