<p>Occasionally, I see someone ask a question like the following.</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> I have the handle to a dialog window. How can I get the original dialog resource ID that the dialog was created from? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> As we saw in our <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/06/18/159248.aspx"> in-depth discussion of how dialogs are created from dialog templates</a>, the dialog template itself is not saved anywhere. The purpose of a template is to act as the... well... "template" for creating a dialog box. Once the dialog box has been created, there is no need for the template any more. Consequently, there is no reason why the system should remember it. </p>
<p> Besides, if <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/29/412577.aspx"> the dialog were created from a runtime-generated template</a>, saving the original parameters would leave pointers to freed memory. Furthermore, the code that created the dialog box almost certainly modified the dialog box during its <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/dialogboxes/dialogboxreference/dialogboxmessages/wm_initdialog.asp"> <code>WM_INITDIALOG</code> message</a> processing (filling list boxes with data, maybe enabling or disabling some buttons), so the dialog box you see on screen doesn't correspond to a template anywhere. </p>
<p> It's like asking, "Given a plate of food, how do I recover the original cookbook and page number for the recipe?" By doing a chemical analysis of the food, you might be able to recover "a" recipe, but there is nothing in the food itself that says, "I came from The Joy of Cooking, page 253." </p>

		<p>Considering the number of editions JoC has been through, could be anything from Rabbit Stew (first, catch a rabbit) to microwave popcorn ;)</p>

		<p>In my edition it&#8217;s your choice of: &quot;Creamed Chipped Beef&quot;, &quot;Chipped Beef in Creole Sauce&quot;, &quot;Chipped Beef in Cheese Sauce&quot;, &quot;Chipped Beef and Sweet Potato Casserole&quot; or &quot;Chipped Beef or Corned Beef in Canned Soup.&quot;</p>

		<p>Early editions of The Joy Of Cooking only had 200 pages. The reference to page 253, exploits a well-known buffer overrun error which causes the end of each edition to be corrupted with pictures of ham sandwiches. Later editions corrected this error by expanding the number of pages to 928:</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
