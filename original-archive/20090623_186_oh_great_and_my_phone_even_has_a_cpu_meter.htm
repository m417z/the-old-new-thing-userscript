<p>These fancy-dancy IP phones never cease to make me wonder what our world has come to. I remember when a telephone was a bucket of carbon granules and a momentary switch, and the rotary dial was just a mechanism for going on and off hook at a precise frequency. (Indeed, sometimes for fun, I'll pulse-dial a phone by tapping on the hook.)</p>
<p> The other day, somebody sent out an email message: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I'm amusing myself watching the "CPU Load" graph on the phone. Then again, I'm easily amused. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Naturally, the CPU meter is useless, because you can only switch to it when you're not using the phone. Once you pick up the handset, the CPU meter dismisses itself so you can see information about the call you're on. </p>
<p> Oh wait, you can go through the menus to switch back to the CPU meter after it auto-dismisses itself. Woo-hoo, now I can tell people, "Sorry, can you talk slower? My phone's CPU is maxing out." </p>
<p> This what-barely-qualifies-as-amusement didn't last long. A year later, the units were replaced with a different model phone that didn't have a CPU meter. Progress. </p>

		<p>That&#8217;s funny. &nbsp;I can think of several extended amusements. &nbsp;For instance, telling someone &quot;My phone CPU used to max out with a three-way call. &nbsp;That&#8217;s why I overclocked it and added liquid cooling. &nbsp;Now she hums along at 20%&#8230;&quot;</p>

		<p>The sad thing is that the company spent time developing and testing that CPU meter when, at least in my opinion, it doesn&#8217;t do anything to improve the usability or reliability of the phone. It&#8217;s a feature that unnecessarily increases the price of the phone.</p>

		<p>Aren&#8217;t phones real-time applications anyway? So the maximum cpu load should have been known even before compilation (or at least before deployment)!</p>
<p>The CPU meter does seem quite useless, then.</p>

<p>The maximum cpu load should have been PREDICTED.</p>
<p>But yeah, if it&#8217;s a diagnostic tool, it seems odd that the meter would have been deployed to consumers.</p>

		<p>Tapping the hang-up button. &nbsp;I remember a place that would put a lock on the dial, so that no un-authorized long distance calls could be made by say, the cleaning staff. &nbsp; Well, guess what. . . &nbsp;just for fun. . .</p>

		<p>&quot;The sad thing is that the company spent time developing and testing that CPU meter when, at least in my opinion, it doesn&#8217;t do anything to improve the usability or reliability of the phone.&quot;</p>
<p>Meh. &nbsp;You&#8217;d be surprised how much lag time there can be between software code complete and production-level hardware. &nbsp;on the phone products I worked on, I filled that time implementing new features, refactoring code, and improving usability. &nbsp;You may not be able to re-allocate the engineers and test group while you wait for hardware because you might not be able to re-allocate them back easily when you need them again.</p>
<p>and</p>
<p>&quot;So the maximum cpu load should have been known&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe like 10+ years ago. &nbsp;These days you buy a chip from a vendor and say &quot;Hey, how many concurrent calls can this support?&quot; and they tell you. &nbsp;It&#8217;s the DSP doing the real time work, and your vendor is the one who knows how much load it can support (usually in MIPS). &nbsp;When you implement the non real-time stuff, you know how many MIPS you have to work with, but pre-calculating exactly what the CPU load would be once you implement your call-control logic is pretty much equivalent to cycle counting a Windows program. &nbsp;Unnecessary.</p>
<p>That being said, the CPU load meter probably wasn&#8217;t a real diagnostic tool, but rather something an engineer just killed time doing. &nbsp;There are just simpler ways of tracking CPU load if you&#8217;re diagnosing a problem rather than implementing a CPU meter. &nbsp;Or it could have been vendor-supplied code that the vendor used to show off how cool their platform was that they just included in their product.</p>

		<p>I remember having a Windows 2000-like task manager for an old Windows Mobile phone. It had a CPU usage column. Useful for seeing why your battery was only lasting 10 minutes&#8230; that program hogging the CPU was probably to blame.</p>
<p>But yes a fullscreen meter is pointless, and probably uses some fancy graphics that actually use more CPU power than it would be using otherwise.</p>

		<p>Emergency calls made by the telephone network itself is the reason that the emergency number was changed from 111 to 999 (in the UK at least) &#8211; telephone wires knocking against each other in high winds resulted in 111 calls.</p>
<p>999 was subsequently chosen even though it is almost the slowest 3 digit number you could dial on a rotary dial of the day (000 being the only slower one) because when dialling, it was considered the easiest to find if blind or in the dark whilst being the LEAST likely to occur as the result of a wind-storm induced false dial made by the telephone network itself.</p>
<p>112, 222 etc were presumably also (more) likely to occur spontaneously/spuriously.</p>
<p>Or so I seem to remember once being told.</p>

		<p>Jolyon: I&#8217;ve heard the same thing. In New Zealand the dials were backwards for some reason (9 sent 1 pulse&#8230;) and hence the emergency number is 111.</p>
<p>I have no explanation for where 911 comes from though&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Peter:</p>
<p>Probably the 9 doesn&#8217;t occur naturally very much (hence the 999 in the UK), and if the first one doesn&#8217;t occur, then the next 2 can be the fastest possible (1).</p>
<p>I think.</p>

		<p>Way back when Bell Labs divided up the phone number space, x11 was reserved for system related services &#8212; 411 was information, 611 was repair, etc. &nbsp;It was from this set that 911 was chosen for local emergency.</p>
<p>Note also that all exchanges used to start with digits 2-9, as they all had names. 0 &amp; 1 on the dial had no letters, so could not be used as the first two exchange digits because no name could be generated for the exchange. &nbsp;</p>
<p>0 was the escape number for the attendant. &nbsp;1 was used as the escape to long distance direct dialing.</p>
<p>Area codes were defined as x0n or x1n, (x being 2-9) as they could not be legal exchanges, and x00 &amp; x01 were reserved for &quot;special area codes&quot; like the 800 &amp; 900 service. &nbsp;8nn codes (888, 877, 866, etc.) are being held for additional toll free numbers.</p>
<p>I do not remember when 555 was restricted as an exchange. &nbsp;A couple of other exchange values, like 947, were also never assigned. &nbsp;</p>
<p>555 is now a dead prefix (except for 555-1212 for information) useful for dummy phone numbers in books and TV scripts. &nbsp;</p>
<p>947 got picked up when a &quot;caller pays extra&quot; 900 type number was needed that could be easily blocked by equipment that was hard-wired to let area codes (x0x/x1x) automatically pass as legitimate long distance.</p>

		<p>@Smart Ass:</p>
<p>Well &#8230; no. System load may pass 100% (e.g. two thread with a deadline of 3 cycles when you have only 4 left). Of course, this will cause (hard) real-time apps to fail.</p>

		<p>The classic Bjarne Stroustrup quote is &quot;I have always wished for a computer that would be as easy to use as my telephone. My wish came true. I no longer know how to use my telephone.&quot;</p>
<p>I can never get over the fact that the phone on my desk has an IP address. &nbsp;It even has a button marked LOCIP that causes it to read the IP address aloud in a mechanical monotone.</p>

		<p>I picked up a rotary phone for my mom about a year ago &#8212; with working bell ringer and everything and she loves it.</p>
<p>The only problem is when she can&#8217;t get through an automated menu because it won&#8217;t even auto-connect to a human when no tones are produced.</p>

		<p>You might be having a phone that is running WinCE. So, it might ship with a CPU meter app just to make things easy to debug, for eg, when you are experiencing packet loss. If the CPu is pegged, it might lead to dropped audio packets, which causes audio clipping.</p>

		<p>It would be cool with a graphical realtime spectrum analyzer in the phone&#8217;s display.</p>

		<p>In high school the phones were locked with a rotary lock that prevented you turning the dial. With practice we could dial using the hook switch, but even easier was hitting it 10 times quickly. &quot;Operator, I&#8217;ve been trying to reach 555-1212 for the past half hour and I can&#8217;t seem to get through, could you try the number for me?&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
