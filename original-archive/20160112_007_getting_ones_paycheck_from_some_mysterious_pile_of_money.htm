<p>
My colleague who
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20120124-00/?p=8473">
seems to get involved in all sorts of money-related shenanigans</a>
once found himself wrapped up in a money mystery not of his own devising.
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20080526-00/?p=22193">
Back in the days before direct deposit</a>,
you received your pay in the form of a paper check.
The group administrator would go through the halls with a handful
of checks and personally hand them to each employee.
(This was therefore an important reason to be nice to
your group administrator.)
</p>
<p>
For some reason, my colleague didn't get a visit from the group
administrator.
Instead, at every pay period he got a piece of email
from the Building&nbsp;1 receptionist
that went something like this:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
Hi.
For some reason, I have your paycheck.
Can you come by and pick it up?
Thanks.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Twice a month, my colleague would walk over to Building&nbsp;1
and make some small talk with the receptionist as he picked up
his paycheck.
</p>
<p>
We never did figure out why my colleague's paycheck was being
sent to the wrong place.
His guess was that although Microsoft knew he was an employee
and had to pay him,
some database glitch prevented his salary from being assigned
to the appropriate organization.
Faced with this conflict
("I have to pay this guy, but I don't know where to send the check"),
the payroll system used a fallback rule of
"When all else fails, send it to the Building&nbsp;1 receptionist."
</p>
<p>
If this theory were true, then it also meant that the ledger
for the Windows division
was not being charged for his salary.
He was instead being paid out of some mysterious pile of money
in the payroll department.
</p>
<p>
My colleague was the sort of person who enjoyed these sorts of glitches
and preferred not to interfere so that he could see how they
manage to resolve themselves.
How long would it take the payroll department to realize that
the Windows division was getting a free employee?
</p>
<p>
Or maybe the Building&nbsp;1 receptionist was cute.
</p>
<p>
(I don't believe I ever learned how the issue finally resolved itself.
I didn't realize that there would be a quiz 20 years later.)
</p>

Although the story is fake,
the phenomenon of ghost employees is real.</p>

		<p>I think I can beat it.  After I quit Microsoft, they kept paying me.  I didn&#8217;t have the guts to keep up the pretense.  I do have a nice, humble letter from them politely requesting a reimbursement.</p>

		<p>At least in Austria if you receive the wrong salary you are required to pay it back, as long as you couldn&#8217;t unintentionally think that the payment was valid.</p>
<p>Meaning if you stop working and still receive a paycheck you&#8217;re on the hook to pay it back.</p>

		<p>If he did receive a paycheck and either the amount of check was correct or his first and last name was on it (or both), then they perfectly knew who he was and what was his job. For one thing, the Building 1 receptionist had the knowledge that the check was his, and had his contact info too. For another, didn&#8217;t you have FICA and payroll tax there in Redmond? Or does Microsoft never audits its accounts book? (Especially when Bill Gates was around?)</p>

		<p>In contrast to the fictional forgotten employee story, I prefer the true story of Apple&#8217;s Graphing Calculator, featuring people who had been fired and weren&#8217;t being paid, but who kept showing up to do the job anyway.[0]</p>
<p>Also, it&#8217;s not really a punchline, so this isn&#8217;t really a spoiler, but: &#8220;We wanted to release a Windows version as part of Windows 98, but sadly, Microsoft has effective building security.&#8221;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
