<li>Martha Stewart will sign only the baking book.     No other books or memorabilia. </li>
<li>Do not make eye contact with Martha Stewart. </li>
<li>Do not speak to Martha Stewart unless spoken to. </li>
<li>Do not ask Martha to write anything other than her name. </li>

		<p>It wasn&#8217;t hard to figure out which items were real. &nbsp;The point of a book signing is to sell the book and to a lesser extent market the author. &nbsp;Anything that gets in the way of that or takes control away from the marketing firm running the show is not allowed.</p>

		<p>I like &quot;The line will start forming at 10:00.&quot;</p>
<p>I wonder what the penalty is for line-forming at say, 9:45? &nbsp;What happens if no one wants to line-up until say, 10:45? &nbsp;</p>
<p>What&#8217;s the BFD about autographs anyway?<br /></p>

		<p>I didn&#8217;t see them mentioned, but I&#8217;m sure there are a couple rule like &quot;Do not ask why Martha Steward got just a slap of the proverbial wrist for insider trading.&quot; and &quot;Do not ask if she realized that keeping ImClone would have made her more money than she lost from the scandal.&quot;</p>
<p>P.S. Is it just me or does she remind you of &quot;Mom&quot; from the show &quot;Futurama?&quot; &#8212; nice old lady on the outside, but, well, if you watch the show, you would know what I mean&#8230;</p>

		<p>Michael,</p>
<p>no, because if it says &quot;To Bob, Love, Martha&quot; instead of &quot;Love, Martha&quot;, the value is lower. &nbsp;If it doesn&#8217;t have a name on it, a buyer can pretend it was signed for them.</p>

		<p>&quot;Ms. Stewart will sign her name only and will not be able to personalize copies.&quot;</p>
<p>I can understand she&#8217;s unwilling to personalize copies.. but not able to? &nbsp;Has she lost the ability to write anything but her name?<br /></p>

<p>She wasn&#8217;t sent down for insider trading. &nbsp;She was put away for lying to the government (or &quot;obstruction of justice&quot; as they call it).</p>
<p>The government tried a civil suit for insider trading, but it was thrown out of court. &nbsp;The claim was unsubstantiated and unproven.</p>
<p>So ultimately, she was imprisoned for lying about something that she didn&#8217;t do wrong. &nbsp;Which is pretty absurd, really, as there was evidently no obstruction of justice.<br /></p>

		<p>Re: DrPizza&#8217;s statement.</p>
<p>I wonder where all the Clinton defenders are to chime in and say perjury is no big deal. Everyone does it.</p>
<p>My opinion on this matter is that if Martha was a man, they would have never gone after her.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
