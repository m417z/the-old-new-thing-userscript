<p>A customer reported that on Windows Vista, if you hold down the shift key and repeatedly click the <i>View</i> button in the command bar of an Explorer window, you will eventually reach a state where all the labels under the icons have disappeared! Where did they go, and how do I get them back?</p>
<p> Congratulations, you stumbled across a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/09/13/4886108.aspx"> rogue feature</a>. </p>
<p> One of the developers who worked on Windows&nbsp;XP decided to add a cute shortcut: <a href="http://pcworld.about.com/magazine/2401p138id123406.htm"> Holding down the shift key when switching to Thumbnail mode</a> will cause the labels to disappear. (At least, that was the intent of the rogue feature, but it so happens that as a side effect, the <i>hold the shift key to remove labels</i> shortcut also takes effect during certain other operations, because the shift key test was made in a shared worker function.) </p>
<p> Great, now that they're gone, how do you get them back? The way to restore item labels in Windows&nbsp;XP was to repeat the operation and hold the shift key when switching into Thumbnail mode. But wait, Windows&nbsp;Vista doesn't have an explicit Thumbnail mode any more. Since the <i>hold the shift key to hide the labels</i> feature was a rogue feature, nobody knew that the Thumbnail menu item was secretly being overloaded as an escape hatch! </p>
<p> Okay, here's how you get the labels back: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/05/07/2453927.aspx"> Right-click</a> in the background of the folder and select <i>Customize This folder</i>. From the customization dialog, change the template to <i>Pictures and Videos</i>, then <i>OK</i>. Now go back to the Explorer folder window and right-click in the background of the folder a second time, then go to the <i>View</i> submenu. (Alternatively, type Alt+V.) There will be a new <i>Hide File Names</i> option: Uncheck it. (If it's already unchecked, then check it, and then uncheck it again.) If you want, you can go back and uncustomize the folder so it has the <i>All files</i> template again. </p>
<p> The customer support people are probably relieved to learn that this rogue feature no longer exists in Windows&nbsp;7. </p>

		<p>Joseph: look up the article on &quot;Rogue Feature.&quot; Basically, someone added it to Windows without telling his manager about it. Thus the guys working on Explorer changes for Vista didn&#8217;t know about it, either. Thus the bug.</p>

		<p>I tried this on a random folder, and had to check it and then uncheck it.</p>
<p>The undo formula does not work on the &quot;My computer&quot; screen though &#8211; I was able to get the labels to disappear, but there is no &quot;customize this folder&quot; menu to undo it.</p>

		<p>I used scraps once, only after accidentally discovering them. &nbsp;There was this one application I was using, but because I didn&#8217;t have a license (too much for a college student at the time) it wouldn&#8217;t let you save any documents you created. &nbsp;I discovered you could save your documents by copying them to a scrap, and then you could load them by copying the scrap back into the application. &nbsp;Having never heard of scraps at the time, I found this behavior to be fascinating.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been using XP since forever and never stumbled upon this one&#8230; is the worker function in XP only used by the miniature menu? May one inquire as to why that developer thought hiding file names would be a useful customization?</p>
<p>Regarding scraps, I&#8217;ve known about them since I first played around with drag and drop in Windows 95, you know, ‘hm, this should work, I wonder if it does&#8230;’ and it did, but since it uses a different file format than what the document normally uses I haven&#8217;t found it as useful. The only real use I can imagine is if you would want to reorganize a document and want to cut pieces from multiple locations to somewhere else. Of course then came Office XP with its multiple clipboards.</p>
<p>Still, I would favour keeping the feature, if implemented right, because even though drag and drop is one of the most intuitive ways to operate a computer, people will not automatically try it if it has a habit not to work. If you use a computer long enough, you will hit upon cases that are uncommon, and when they don&#8217;t work that reinforces the ‘works only for specific sources and destinations’ feeling and that&#8217;s bad for drag and drop because if it has a downside, it is that contrary to menus and buttons there is no neon sign shouting ‘you can do stuff’ on screen. So drag and drop has to a) always work and b) be predictable.</p>

		<p>I found a solution to C: and &quot;Computer&quot; special folder: Switch to Details view. Then press and hold the SHIFT key, and from the “Views” drop-down, select &quot;Medium Icons&quot;. Close and reopen the folder.</p>

		<p>This all stems back to two things waaay back to Windows 1.0. a) user-interface expectations of 198x and b) the way WM_LBUTTONDOWN was documented and used.</p>
<p>In the good old days, and today, in MANY MANY if not 99.9% of all applications, most controls react the same way to mouse-click with or without modifiers.</p>
<p>Arguably all controls should ONLY respond to well-specified keyboard modifiers when clicked, and for 99.9% of cases this is &quot;no modifiers&quot;, and any controls that exhibit the same behaviour for Click and (say) Shift+Click are buggy.</p>
<p>Cast your mind back&#8230; imagine if there had been no WM_LBUTTON down message, but instead a plethora of modifier messages: WM_LBUTTONDOWN_NO_MOD and WM_LBUTTON_LMOD1 and WM_LBUTTON_RMOD1 and WM_LBUTTON_MOD1 and WM_LBUTTON_LMOD1_MOD2_RMOD3_LHAND_BEHIND_BACK and so on (whazzat? integers are cheap, plenty of room for another gazillion messages (where gazillion is defined as 2^16)) we wouldn&#8217;t&#8217;ve seen this bug &#8212; because the explicit nature of the interface would have caused a very different behaviour in design and implementation and user expectation over the last 20 odd years (my argument is the behaviour for only valid actions would be specified).</p>
<p>Sure, it&#8217;s very much on the preposterous side of things, and involves Raymond&#8217;s beloved time machine, but hey, sue me.</p>

		<p>I knew about this since it&#8217;s mentioned in the excellent TweakUI 2.0 tips &amp; tricks. Then again, Vista completely screwed up the shell, so there&#8217;s no point discussing over this rogue feature when real working features are missing and broken.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
