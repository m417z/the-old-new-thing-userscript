		<p>best line from one of the BBC commentators was along the lines of &quot;If the French football team had as much commitment as their Tennis players they&#39;d still be in the world cup&quot; :D</p>

		<p>The Grauniad journo&#39;s faux descent into madness reminded me of Donald Crowhurst&#39;s real deal: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Crowhurst" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Donald_Crowhurst</a></p>
<p>He entered a single-handed round the world yacht race in a (then) novel trimaran. The prototype boat turned out to be hopelessly slow. Instead of limping round the course, or simply giving up, he went round in circles off Brazil, making up false logs. His fake logs pushed a competitor, who thought he was in a race for the line, too far and resulted in a sinking, and left Crowhurst in danger of winning the fastest time prize. This wasn&#39;t good for his mental state. The log entries got more and more erratic: they detailed a sane man leaving Teignmouth, and his gradual loss of sanity over a period of several months. They finished on 1 July &#39;69, and so presumably did Crowhurst.</p>

		<p>It was only after playing Wii tennis that I observed that real tennis matches are mostly serves. Does anybody know what percentage of the hits in this match were serves? I imagine that it would be somewhat higher than normal.</p>

		<p>Clearly tennis matches score are too high scoring so they should make the rackets half the size they currently are. &nbsp;Oh, and if the game ends in a tie, they can flip a coin to see who wins!</p>
<p>Of course, to offset the absurdity of such a game, it should only be held every 3 years or so; otherwise people would get sick of it really quickly.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s amazing how both of them endured for so long but that doesn&#39;t make any of them necessarily better tennis players. It just shows how Isner is a dumb American with all-serve-and-no-game. The reason it went on and on and on is because he simply can fire aces to win his own service game which makes it very very difficult to break his serve but apart from that, he doesn&#39;t really have any game. The only time I have seen him play really well besides firing those aces is in the 2009 US Open when he defeated Roddick. What&#39;s with the modern Americans tennis players? Sam Querrey is another similar mostly-serve-but-no-game player and everyone knows that Roddick played without a brain with only his serve for seven years before Larry Stefansky revived his carrier (Roddick 2.0).</p>

		<p>This reminds me of the time when Australian petrol prices passed the $1.00 per litre mark &#8211; the prices were shown on the boards in cents per litre (still are, actually), using two digits, a dot and another digit. To display numbers &gt;=100, the stations used 2-digit cards.</p>

		<p>@Falcon: &nbsp;In Canada, they just painted a 1 in front of the digital signs. &nbsp;Then, when it slipped back under, the painted back over the 1.</p>
<p>(In the first little while after the transition before they could paint over it, they just had things marked with $0.05 for $1.05, and vice-versa on the way down).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
