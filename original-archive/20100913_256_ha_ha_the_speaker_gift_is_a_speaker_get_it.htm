<p>As a thank-you for <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/22/10041191.aspx"> presenting at TechReady11</a>, the conference organizers gave me (and presumably the other speakers) a portable speaker with the Windows logo printed on it.</p>
<p> The speaker underneath the logo is the <a href="http://www.x-mini.com/online-shop?page=shop.product_details&amp;category_id=1&amp;flypage=flypage.tpl&amp;product_id=5"> X-Mini II Capsule Speaker</a>, and I have to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/stevecla01/archive/2010/08/15/mini-speaker.aspx"> agree with Steve Clayton</a> that they pack a lot of sound in a compact size. Great for taking on trips, or even picnics. </p>
<p> It's been a long time since I <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/07/31/684106.aspx"> last recommended a Christmas gift for geeks</a>, so maybe I'll make up for it by giving two suggestions this year. </p>
<p> The second suggestion is a response to a comment from that old article: My bicycle lock is just a laptop combination lock that I repurposed as a bicycle lock. It's a pretty clumsy design for a laptop lock, since <a href="http://dealsproshop.auctivacommerce.com/Laptop-Lock-with-retractable-cable-and-safe-combination-P611913.aspx"> it comes in two parts, one of which is easy to lose</a>, but if you just "accidentally" lose the clip part, what's left is a simple cable combination lock that easily tucks into a side pocket of my bicycle trunk bag. Yes, that lock isn't going to stop a dedicated thief for very long, but fortunately, the Microsoft parking garage is not crawling with dedicated thieves because, as a rule, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/11/26/9928892.aspx#9929126"> Microsoft tries not to hire dishonest people</a>. </p>
<p> So, um, that's a suggestion for a bicycle lock for somebody who lives in a low-crime area. Hm, maybe that's not a very good suggestion after all. </p>

		<p>I live in Cambridge (UK), where a lot of people cycle, and it is a generally accepted rule that you should spend as much on your lock as you did on your bike :)</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve got one of the speakers and its great for travelling, or just around the house. I get around 3 months use, at about 15 minutes per day playing spoken word podcasts, before it needs a recharge. And the blue LED on the base is so bright it doubles as a torch. The standard mini USB socket to charge it also commends it. On the minus side, the battery is captive, but the cost of the whole unit doesn&#39;t make that too bad a drawback.</p>

		<p>If you spend the same on your lock and your bike, you either have a ridiculously expensive lock or a 10-year-old bike from a garage sale. &nbsp;There&#39;s nothing wrong with riding an old beater bike; that&#39;s what I do when I need to park in public places. &nbsp;But my nice bike gets parked in an indoor rack at work with a cheap lock; I figure an opportunistic thief would just grab one of the other bikes that isn&#39;t locked at all, and a dedicated thief would steal the bike regardless of the lock I used.</p>
<p>The difference between a cheap lock and an expensive lock is what, 30 seconds?</p>

		<p>@JS</p>
<p>In reality you just need a better lock than the bicycle parked next to yours. &nbsp;I also live in Cambridge and the bicycle theft significantly skews the crime figures &#8211; spending 10-20% of your bicycle cost on the lock is considered prudent.</p>

		<p>I believe the proper formula for a bike lock is that its weight should vary inversely with that of the bike. In other words, if you have an extremely light bike, it&#39;s very expensive, so you need a heavy chain/lock to protect it. If you have a cheap bike, it will be rather heavy, so you only need a lightweight chain/lock to protect it.</p>
<p>The corollary is that all bikes in New York City weigh 40 pounds.</p>

		<p>I currently can&#39;t find my bike lock keys, so I just hang my bike at work and drape one of those locks people leave behind over my bike. Looks like it&#39;s locked.</p>

		<p>@Chris Lineker</p>
<p>&quot;Locks only stop honest people.&quot;</p>
<p>The corollary to that is &quot;that locks only buy you time with the dishonest people&quot;.</p>
<p>ie. a good quality lock will take more time and effort, than a cheap lock.</p>
<p>Thus encouraging thieves to move along to the next (easier) target.</p>

		<p>Heh, this reminds me of the time when I got back from university, stepped off the bus, walked to my bike and found that someone had stolen the lock (but not the bike).</p>

		<p>During college, I got back to my dorm one day and left my bike unlocked. I was inside only for a few minutes, but during that time someone had stolen it (pretty unusual for our town, lots of people don&#39;t lock anything). Three months later I happened to see it parked at the student union bike rack, and it still had my lock locked to the frame for storage. So I took it back.</p>
<p>I didn&#39;t have it long after that. Had a freak accident where I went off a curb going at most two miles per hour and my rear wheel tilted a bit, part of the drive mechanism spoke-jammed it, and parts snapped and the tire popped. I can&#39;t imagine what the person who stole it did to it. Thankfully it was only a $60 bike to begin with.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
