<p>Reader <a href="http://www.codexxi.com/">asmguru62</a> asks <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#644958"> why a custom format rectangle of a multi-line edit control is lost when the edit control is resized</a>. That's right, the format rectangle is recalculated whenever the window resizes, and that's a good thing.</p>
<p> Imagine if it weren't recalculated. You create a multi-line edit control. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx"> Like many programs</a>, you might create it at a temporary size while you try to figure out what its real size should be. You might even resize the control dynamically as the container is resized. (After all, everybody wants resizable dialogs.) What you definitely don't want is the format rectangle of the edit control to be locked to the size the window was originally created at. </p>
<p> "Well, yeah," asmguru62 says, "sure that may be desirable if the application is using the default margins, but if the margins have been customized, then shouldn't those margins be preserved?" </p>
<p> First, who says that your call to <code>EM_SETRECT</code> was to established fixed-size margins? All the function knows is that you said "Put the text inside this rectangle." It has no idea how you computed that rectangle. Did you subtract a fixed number of pixels? Did you use a percentage? Did you set the rectangle to force the text into a rectangle whose width and height form the <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/GoldenRatio.html"> golden mean</a>? </p>
<p> Second, if you want to set the margins, then set the margins. The <code>EM_SETMARGINS</code> message lets you specify the size of the left and right margins of a multi-line edit control. The edit control will take your margins into account when it recalculates its format rectangle after a resize. </p>
<p> In other words, <code>EM_SETRECT</code> is the low-level function that lets you manipulate the edit control's internal formatting rectangle, the same rectangle that the edit control itself manipulates in response to the things that edit controls naturally respond to. There is no fancy inference engine here that says, "Let me attempt to reverse-engineer how this rectangle is related to the client rectangle so I can carry forward this computation when I recalculate the format rectangle." Think of it as reaching in and directly whacking one of the edit control's private member variables. </p>
<p> If you want something higher-level, then use <code>EM_SETMARGINS</code>. </p>

		<p>Now we just need to invent a time machine so AsmGuru62 can go back in time to a point when knowing that answer would have been helpful.</p>

		<p>@John: If it&#8217;s just useful to AsmGuru62, then it&#8217;s not useful. The point here is that other people might benefit from the answer.</p>
<p>And little control, keep your private parts to yourself :D</p>

		<p>I guess you are right; perhaps AsmGuru62&#8217;s grandchildren are Windows developers.</p>

		<p>Guys! You making me look old!.. Being fair, I needed all margins to be set and EM_SETMARGINS set only Left and Right, but not Top/Bottom. I needed the text appear in a middle (vertically) of the field in my resizable dialog. I tried all possible alignment options (for both Static and Edit controls) in VS Dialog Editor &#8211; none worked as I wanted.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
