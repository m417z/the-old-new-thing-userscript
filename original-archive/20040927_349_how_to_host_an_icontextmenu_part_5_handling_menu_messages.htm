One bug that was called out immediately in
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/09/22/232836.aspx">
our first attempt at displaying the context menu to the user</a>
is that the Open With and Send To submenus don't work.
</p>
<p>
The reason for this is that these submenus are delay-generated
(which explains why they don't contain anything interesting when
you expand them) and owner-drawn (which you can't notice yet
because of the first problem, but trust me, they are).
</p>
<p>
This is where the
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/ifaces/icontextmenu2/handlemenumsg.asp">
IContextMenu2::HandleMenuMsg</a> and
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/ifaces/icontextmenu3/handlemenumsg2.asp">
IContextMenu3::HandleMenuMsg2</a> methods
are used.
</p>
<p>
Historical note:
IContextMenu2::HandleMenuMessage
is on its own interface rather than being merged with
the base interface
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/ifaces/icontextmenu/icontextmenu.asp">
IContextMenu</a>
because it was added late in Windows&nbsp;95 development,
so it was considered safer to add a derived interface than
to make everybody who had been writing Windows&nbsp;95 shell
extensions go back and rewrite their code.
IContextMenu3::HandleMenuMessage2
was added in Internet Explorer&nbsp;4 (I think)
when it became clear that the ability for a context menu extension
to override the default message return value was necessary
in order to support keyboard accessibility in owner-drawn context menus.
</p>
<p>
In a "real program", these two variables would be class members
associated with the window, but this is just a sample program,
so they are globals.
<strong>When you write your own programs, don't use global variables
here</strong> because they will result in mass mayhem once you get
a second window, since both of them will try to talk to the interface
even though only the window displaying the context menu should be
doing so.
</p>
<pre>
<font COLOR=blue>IContextMenu2 *g_pcm2;
IContextMenu3 *g_pcm3;</font>
</pre>
<p>
These two new variables track the IContextMenu2 and IContextMenu3
interfaces of the active tracked popup menu.  We need to initialize
and uninitalize them around our call to TrackPopupMenuEx:
</p>
<pre>
      <font COLOR=blue>pcm-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_IContextMenu2, (void**)&amp;g_pcm2);
      pcm-&gt;QueryInterface(IID_IContextMenu3, (void**)&amp;g_pcm3);</font>
      int iCmd = TrackPopupMenuEx(hmenu, TPM_RETURNCMD, pt.x, pt.y, hwnd, NULL);
      <font COLOR=blue>if (g_pcm2) {
        g_pcm2-&gt;Release();
        g_pcm2 = NULL;
      }
      if (g_pcm3) {
        g_pcm3-&gt;Release();
        g_pcm3 = NULL;
      }</font>
</pre>
<p>
And finally we need to invoke the HandleMenuMessage/HandleMenuMessage
methods in the window procedure:
</p>
<pre>
LRESULT CALLBACK
WndProc(HWND hwnd, UINT uiMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
    <font COLOR=blue>if (g_pcm3) {
        LRESULT lres;
        if (SUCCEEDED(g_pcm3-&gt;HandleMenuMsg2(uiMsg, wParam, lParam, &amp;lres))) {
          return lres;
        }
    } else if (g_pcm2) {
        if (SUCCEEDED(g_pcm2-&gt;HandleMenuMsg(uiMsg, wParam, lParam))) {
          return 0;
        }
    }</font>

    switch (uiMsg) {
    ....
</pre>
<p>
In the window procedure, we ask the context menu whether it
wishes to handle the menu message.  If so, then we stop and
return the desired value (if HandleMenuMsg2) or just zero
(if HandleMenuMsg).
</p>
<p>
With these changes, run the scratch program again and observe
that the Open With and Send To submenus now operate as expected.
</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
