		<p>I found that clip barely watchable&#8230; maybe it&#8217;s because I&#8217;m not from the UK and am not accustomed.</p>
<p>The dancing was great, but the camera kept showing everything else but the dance: the audience, the jury, the guys backstage etc. Irritating!</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m from the UK, and it&#8217;s not just you. I think it&#8217;s largely because that clip is from the audition stage and presumably they haven&#8217;t choreographed the camera movements in advance &#8211; the same act from the show&#8217;s final ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4sGmnKuIjU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4sGmnKuIjU</a> ) does a much better job. But looking at the semi-final ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d31_aQEQwU" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2d31_aQEQwU</a> ) the show seems to like doing swooshy camera moves rather than showing the action, and it&#8217;s slightly worse than in other similar programmes I&#8217;ve seen.</p>
<p>The bhangra dance group ended up in second place, behind a 14-year old street dancer ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKKdvyTd4rg" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TKKdvyTd4rg</a> ). Sadly the dancing dog ( <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEVYvN4Qces" rel="nofollow">http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tEVYvN4Qces</a> ) only reached 5th place in the final.</p>

		<p>They are currently touring with the X-Factor finalists appearing with JLS (X-Factor is the UK version of American Idol for the uninitiated). My wife and daughter went to see them the other day. I remember them well from Britain&#8217;s Got Talent &#8211; they were very good.</p>
<p>The act was called Signature.</p>

		<p>@Neil:</p>
<p>Not quite. It started off in New Zealand with Popstars, then after that spread to the UK it was mutated into Pop Idol which was then exported to the USA as American Idol, then they did it all over again in the UK but as &quot;X-Factor&quot; due to a dispute with Simon Cowell.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
