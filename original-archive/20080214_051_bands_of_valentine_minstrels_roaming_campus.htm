<p> One of the minor Valentine's Day traditions at Microsoft is the charity fundraiser based on identifying targets and embarrassing them in front of all their colleagues. In exchange for a charitable donation to the <a href="http://www.americanheart.org/"> American Heart Association</a> (get it?) an <i lang="it">a cappella</i> group will travel to an office or conference room of your designation (conference room is much better, of course) and sing a sappy song to your Valentine. (Singing Valentines are also common on college campuses.) </p>
<p> This can get tricky when the victim's <nobr>spouse/<wbr>boyfriend/<wbr>girlfriend/<wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></nobr><i>whatever you want to call it</i> doesn't work at Microsoft, because said potential prankster (1)&nbsp;needs to know about this tradition in the first place, and (2)&nbsp;needs to know some other Microsoft employee who can arrange the prank on their behalf. </p>

		<p>Hopefully when you register for this prank you can give them any name you want. &nbsp;Because I know that if I worked there, I would probably have to give a valentine from Ballmer to Gates.</p>
<p>Twice.</p>
<p>Then I would be fired.</p>
<p>But it would be worth it. :)</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve heard this called &quot;significant other&quot;, which does an acceptable job of covering the possibilities.</p>
<p>Though for roaming a cappella groups, perhaps the term &quot;target&quot; or &quot;mark&quot; would be more appropriate&#8230;</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  &gt; I&#8217;ve heard this called &quot;significant other&quot;, which does an acceptable job of covering the possibilities. &lt;&lt;
</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes, probably more than you realize. &nbsp;The term originated in psycho-analysis circles, to describe any person that had a significant influence on another person. &nbsp;This included spouse/ boyfriend/ girlfriend, but could also be parents, siblings, roomates, co-workers etc. &nbsp;Eventually, popular culture ceased on the term, because it was a good euphormism for &quot;person you are living with but aren&#8217;t married to&quot;, and it&#8217;s meaning got limited to just romantic partners.</p>

		<p>Significant other? What ever happened to just plain-old living in sin? I have yet to be punched in the face for saying it.</p>

		<p>Does the a cappella group consist of Microsoft employee volunteers? That would be interesting.</p>
<p>I think you&#8217;ve solved the problem of people not knowing about this tradition&#8230;</p>

<p>How many times have you been serenaded in this fashion by your spouse/boyfriend/girlfriend/whatever you want to call it?</p>

		<p>Funny &#8211; I heard an a capella group singing down our hallway earlier this afternoon and wondered what it was. That explains it!</p>

		<p>Does this apply to v dashers as well? (I think that&#8217;s the Microsoft term for people at Microsoft who aren&#8217;t contractors, but belong to other companies working with Microsoft.</p>
<p>If so, this may be interesting (we did have at one time several people at Microsoft).</p>

		<p>So *that* is what that was! A group of them interrupted a daily meeting of ours (there were 8-9 of us meeting in someone&#8217;s office) and sang to a blushing co-worker. The rest of us giggled (or at least I did). Now I know.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
