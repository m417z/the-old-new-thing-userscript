<p> When in Ballard for <a href="http://www.seafoodfest.org/"> SeafoodFest</a>, I was saddened to discover that one of the last remaining Scandinavian businesses in Ballard, the Scandinavian Gift Shop, <a href="http://inballard.com/detail.php?id=scandinaviangiftshop"> is closing</a>. They were in their final stages of "everything must go!", and I picked up a small number of <i>Glad P&aring;sk</i> greeting cards, some pretty napkins (including a set that would be illegal if U.S. law applied to the Swedish flag), and a dozen tiny Swedish flag stick-pins. Fortunately, <a href="http://www.scandinavianfoods.net/"> Olsen's Scandinavian Foods</a> is still there, because you never know when you're going to get a hankering for some homemade pickled herring. </p>
<p> I don't get to Ballard very often during business hours, but when I do, I try to make a point of vising Olsen's just to browse around the store, amuse myself at all the Norwegian packaging (most of the stuff comes from Norway), and maybe pick up an item or two. I think the previous time I was there, one of the Endresen sisters was working the register, because she very politely translated the instructions on the back of a package of asparagus soup for me. I would have waved her off and saved her the trouble, except I didn't know what <i>vann</i> was. (I now know that it is <i>vatten</i> = water.) </p>

		<p>Hey &#8211; here&#8217;s a non-software nitpick!</p>
<p>Saying flag napkins &quot;would be illegal if U.S. law applied to the Swedish flag&quot; is a bit strong. &nbsp; While there is a US Flag Code in Federal Law, there are no penalties for violating it and any attempts to enforce it (or enact penalties) would be unconstitutional under the 1st Amendment.</p>
<p>So until the Flag Desecration Amendment is actually passed, you can legally do pretty much anything you want to the US Flag and its images (though that doesn&#8217;t mean you won&#8217;t get hassled by &#8216;the Man&#8217;).</p>

		<p>I just moved to the Greater Seattle Area from southern California (to work at Microsoft, what else?). It&#8217;s unfortunate to hear that the Scandinavian influence is waning. Still, I&#8217;m pleased to learn that I&#8217;ll have lutefisk and the aforementioned pickled herring within a short drive. Thanks for posting about Olsen&#8217;s!</p>

		<p>I can find a bunch of American flag napkin designs online, though admittedly they&#8217;ve got pictures of a flapping flag rather than the flag pattern itself laid flat on the napkin.</p>

		<p>You could also just ask if any of your readers knew what &quot;vann&quot; was, I would of course be able to answer. :) Mostly because I&#8217;m Norwegian&#8230; ;)</p>

		<p>[nitpick]should read &quot;make a pointing of visiting Olsen&#8217;s&quot; at the start of the second paragraph.[/nitpick]</p>
<p>I always find it curious when shops that are closing have &quot;everything must go&quot; signs in the window. Surely that&#8217;s the whole point of a shop anyway, to sell all the stock? Perhaps if they&#8217;d stuck to that maxim for the whole life of the business, they wouldn&#8217;t be closing down now.</p>

		<p>You won&#8217;t get hassled by anyone for being disrepectful in marketing U.S. flag based products. &nbsp;It happens all the time.</p>
<p>I was at Valley Forge&#8217;s gift shop&#8230; a gift shop in a national park&#8230; and found Flag foldable fans, flag glasses, flag blankets, flag throws, flag pillows. &nbsp;I mean, you would never fan yourself with the flag, drink from the flag, sleep on the flag, or throw the flag in a laundry hamper, but people wear shirts with the U.S. flag as the primary and only symbol on it all the time.</p>
<p>Obviously it is easy to split hairs, and there are depictions that are respectful, but the general rule of respect is: &quot;would you do x with a flag?&quot; &nbsp;If you wouldn&#8217;t throw it on your couch, you shouldn&#8217;t throw a flag couch &quot;throw&quot; on your couch either.</p>
<p>And yes, there are no civil penalties. &nbsp;The Flag Code is a code of respect and the Supreme Court has interpreted the 1st amendment also allows for the use of the flag in symbolic protest&#8230; which I agree with. &nbsp;I pretty much ignore anyone who is protesting by desecrating the flag, because I think it is a sign of disrespect, so any protester has lost their message on me. &nbsp;But I defend their right to trample what is really just a piece of cloth. &nbsp;The flag itself as a symbol can not be destroyed.</p>
<p>Still, I pay proper respect to that symbol&#8230; fold it properly, raise it properly, lower it properly, display it properly, and refrain from buying products whose only use can possibly be disrespectful (i.e. a foldable Flag fan).</p>
<p>I think most Americans do not realize that a T-Shirt that has the flag displayed horizontally with the field in the upper left (at least displayed properly) with the only other words on the front &quot;Old Navy&quot; is not patriotic, but disrespectful to the flag. &nbsp;After all, you wouldn&#8217;t throw that flag in the laundry hamper when you are done nor wear a flag. &nbsp;But marketers have little respect for anything but money and convince us we are patriotic for doing so.</p>

		<p>Speaking of swedish customs, have you ever tried &quot;surstr&#246;mming&quot;? I don&#8217;t even know if you have the kind of bread &quot;required&quot; for it (&quot;h&#229;rt tunnbr&#246;d&quot;). While it indeed smells worse than a male cat pissing in territory, when not used to it, it is a delicacy with no comparison when properly prepared:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hard thin bread (&quot;h&#229;rt tunnbr&#246;d&quot;). Break it in half.</li>
<li>
<p>Cooked potato.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Raw onion, finely chopped.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>&quot;Surstr&#246;mming&quot;.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Apply whatever ratio you prefer of mashed potato, onion and top it with &quot;surstr&#246;mming&quot; you like on one half of the &quot;tunnbr&#246;d&quot;. Use the other half as top. Chew. Enjoy. Drink beer, and often to celebrate the occasion (tradition is august, and I think it is originally to celebrate that food was plenty after harvest; and if so it&#8217;s probably from the 1870&#8217;s or before) you have more than one &quot;snaps&quot; (I believe most can see that heritage, and think &quot;schnaps&quot; and see it&#8217;s &quot;on the rocks&quot;, without rocks).</p>
<p>Some really hard-core &quot;surstr&#246;mming&quot;-lovers refuse any kind of alcohol to numb the taste buds and drink milk. I don&#8217;t recommend this to beginners.</p>
<p>In a week or two it&#8217;s also time for &quot;kr&#228;ftor&quot; (crayfish). Both have their set dates, called &quot;surstr&#246;mmingspremi&#228;r&quot; and &quot;kr&#228;ftpremi&#228;r&quot; (&quot;premi&#228;r&quot; = &quot;opening night&quot; (though it&#8217;s not night) or simply &quot;premi&#232;re&quot;).</p>
<p>If CreateFile takes too many arguments, I think it&#8217;s due to a lack of surstr&#246;mming and snaps. :-)</p>

<p>Yuck. lutefisk ought to be a criminal offense. If merely wearing clothes with a flag on them can be enough to offend, then lutefisk has to be grounds for immediate invasion. ;)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
