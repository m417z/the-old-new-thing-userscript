There is a small improvement that can be made to
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/09/30/236133.aspx">
to the program we wrote last time</a>.
It involves taking advantage of the last parameter to
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/ifaces/icontextmenu/QueryContextMenu.asp">
the IContextMenu::QueryContextMenu method</a>:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p STYLE="text-indent: -5em; padding-left: 5em">
CMF_DEFAULTONLY<br>
This flag is set when the user is activating the default action,
typically by double-clicking.
This flag provides a hint for the shortcut menu extension
to add nothing if it does not modify the default item in the menu.
A shortcut menu extension or drag-and-drop handler
should not add any menu items if this value is specified.
A namespace extension should add only the default item (if any).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
As the text from MSDN indicates, this flag is a hint to the
IContextMenu implementation
that it should worry only about the default command.
</p>
<pre>
void OnContextMenu(HWND hwnd, HWND hwndContext, UINT xPos, UINT yPos)
{
  IContextMenu *pcm;
  if (SUCCEEDED(GetUIObjectOfFile(hwnd, L"C:\\Windows\\clock.avi",
                   IID_IContextMenu, (void**)&amp;pcm))) {
    HMENU hmenu = CreatePopupMenu();
    if (hmenu) {
      if (SUCCEEDED(pcm-&gt;QueryContextMenu(hmenu, 0,
                             SCRATCH_QCM_FIRST, SCRATCH_QCM_LAST,
                             <font COLOR=blue>CMF_DEFAULTONLY</font>))) {
        UINT id = GetMenuDefaultItem(hmenu, FALSE, 0);
        if (id != (UINT)-1) {
          CMINVOKECOMMANDINFO info = { 0 };
          info.cbSize = sizeof(info);
          info.hwnd = hwnd;
          info.lpVerb = MAKEINTRESOURCEA(id - SCRATCH_QCM_FIRST);</font>
          pcm-&gt;InvokeCommand(&amp;info);
        }
      }
      DestroyMenu(hmenu);
    }
    pcm-&gt;Release();
  }
}
</pre>
<p>
With this change on my machine, the time taken by the call to
IContextMenu::QueryContextMenu dropped from 100ms to 50ms.
Your mileage may vary.
It depends on how many context menu extensions you have and
how well they respect the <code>CMF_DEFAULTONLY</code> flag.
</p>
<p>
(And this exercise highlights how important it is that people
who implement the <code>IContextMenu</code>
interface pay attention to the flags.
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/09/30/55100.aspx#55107">
If your context menu handler doesn't respect the <code>CMF_DEFAULTONLY</code>
flag</a>, then you're part of the problem.)</p>

		<p>Interesting stuff.  I wonder, does this also affect the performance of ShellExecute (with default verb), or has that function been optimized to not even build the context menu?<br /></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
