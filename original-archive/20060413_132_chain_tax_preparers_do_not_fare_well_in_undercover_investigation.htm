<p>The Government Accountability Office paid nineteen visits to chain tax preparers, presented information on two hypothetical families, and asked for assistance in preparing the tax return. "<a href="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/04/AR2006040401863.html">Only two returns showed the correct refund amount, but both of those returns included errors</a>." The article goes into specifics of what sorts of mistakes were made. <a href="http://marketplace.publicradio.org/shows/2006/04/05/AM200604057.html"> A Marketplace report</a> added that mistakes with tax credits were particularly bad because messing them up can render you ineligible for claiming them in the future.</p>
<p> Add to that the plans for the IRS to <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2002911225_irs05.html"> permit tax preparers sell information about their clients to marketers</a> and the fact that major tax preparation firm H&amp;R Block <a href="http://biz.yahoo.com/ap/060224/earns_h_r_block.html"> got its own taxes wrong</a> [found a not-yet-404'd link - 2pm], and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/06/17/430195.aspx"> my decision to do my own taxes by hand</a> doesn't seem so kooky after all, now, does it... </p>
<p> In other <a href="http://www.americaslibrary.gov/cgi-bin/page.cgi/jb/progress/taxday_1"> tax-day</a> news, I will be heading to San Francisco on the 15th for a family event. I don't have a precise agenda, but <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/03/30/564810.aspx"> I left time to be a tourist on Monday the 17th</a>. I'll most likely take the <a href="http://sfwmpac.org/topnav/general_info.html"> War Memorial and Performing Arts Center tour</a> at 10am, then head north to check out the <a href="http://www.nps.gov/prsf/">Presidio</a> (which was still a military base when I lived in the Bay Area). If you want to meet up, you can drop me a message today or tomorrow via the <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/contact.aspx"> contact page</a>. I won't be checking my email much while I'm away (that's why it's called a "vacation", see), but before I leave I'll set up my voicemail to forward to my mobile phone. Call Microsoft Corporate Headquarters, press "2", then say my name. (The voicemail lady will say, "Calling the office". Don't be alarmed.) </p>
<p> When talking to the voicemail lady, be careful to enunciate clearly, because there are also a Raymond Cheng and a Ray Chen at Microsoft. We get each other's stuff occasionally but it usually gets sorted out without too much trouble since we each work on completely different projects. (Bonus trivia: When Raymond Cheng first arrived at Microsoft, I was his mentor!) </p>

		<p>I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s a rather damning indictment of the complexity of our tax code, more than a dig on chain tax preparers.</p>

		<p>Note that the survey only tested &#8216;non-certified&#8217; preparers. &nbsp;How much better (if at all) would certified preparers would fare? &nbsp;I&#8217;m sure that even the IRS can&#8217;t get things 100% correct all the time, given how byzantine the tax code is.</p>

		<p>I never understand why people use paid preparers for any tax return that&#8217;s not enormously complicated. &nbsp;It&#8217;s just an exercise in doing the right thing, based on a set of rules, for what&#8217;s already been done and can&#8217;t be changed. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The part where you want professional advice is the year *before*: where spend your money and where to put it, so that you can deduct the right things next year.<br /></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
