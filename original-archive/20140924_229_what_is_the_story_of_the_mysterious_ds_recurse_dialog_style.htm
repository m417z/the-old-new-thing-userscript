<p>There are a few references to the <code>DS_<wbr>RECURSE</wbr></code> dialog style scattered throughout MSDN, and they are all of the form "Don't use it." But if you look in your copy of <code>winuser.h</code>, there is no sign of <code>DS_<wbr>RECURSE</wbr></code> anywhere. This obviously makes it trivial to avoid using it because you couldn't use it even if you wanted it, seeing as it doesn't exist.</p>
<p> "Do not push the red button on the control panel!" </p>
<p> &mdash; <i>There is no red button on the control panel.</i> </p>
<p> "Well, that makes it easy not to push it." </p>
<p> As with many of these types of stories, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/10/25/5658731.aspx"> the answer is rather mundane</a>. </p>
<p> When nested dialogs were added to Windows&nbsp;95, the flag to indicate that a dialog is a control host was <code>DS_<wbr>RECURSE</wbr></code>. The name was intended to indicate that anybody who is walking a dialog looking for controls should recurse into this window, since it has more controls inside. </p>
<p> The window manager folks later decided to change the name, and they changed it to <code>DS_<wbr>CONTROL</wbr></code>. All documentation that was written before the renaming had to be revised to change all occurrences of <code>DS_<wbr>RECURSE</wbr></code> to <code>DS_<wbr>CONTROL</wbr></code>. </p>
<p> It looks like they didn't quite catch them all: There are two straggling references in the Windows Embedded documentation. My guess is that the Windows Embedded team took a snapshot of the main Windows documentation, and they took their snapshot before the renaming was complete. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, I don't have any contacts in the Windows Embedded documentation team, so I don't know whom to contact to get them to remove the references to flags that don't exist. </p>

		<p>I&#39;d like to see an email exchange consisting of Raymond telling the Embedded folks that they need to remove something from their documentation which doesn&#39;t exist, and them responding that they don&#39;t need to remove it because it doesn&#39;t exist.</p>

		<p>^ Actually, 9 people might be enough. A couple of years back, I read about a study by Microsoft on MSN about an experiment concerning sending a message to a total stranger. The experiment only asked the sender to send it to the most appropriate person he knows. (Say, X, living in Redmond, WA is asked to send the message to Y, living somewhere unknown in Pasadena, CA; X would send it to Z, who lived in LA.) That person would, in turn, send it to the most appropriate person he knew of. Study showed that in most cases, after 9 instances of forwarding, the message reached the intended destination.</p>
<p>Where I work, it has never been more that two hops. And it takes a bit of negotiation.</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command: That experiment was done several times and the underlying idea is that of the &quot;small world&quot;, also known as &quot;six degrees of separation&quot;. In both the email experiment by Columbia University in 2003 and the snail mail experiments by Milgram most mails were never received, for the others the average chain length was both times near six, with outliers up to ten or so. Interestingly Milgram tested only in the US, while the email experiment was worldwide (or what counted for &quot;worldwide&quot; in electronics in 2003 ;-))</p>

		<p>^ I see. Thanks a bunch.</p>
<p>My memory seems to have recorded 6 as 9. Also, &quot;by Microsoft on MSN&quot; is in fact &quot;on Microsoft MSN&quot;, which is the MSN Messenger network.</p>

		<p>@mito, you reminded me my question last year (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15024372/what-is-the-value-of-a-dialog-constant-ds-recurse">stackoverflow.com/&#8230;/what-is-the-value-of-a-dialog-constant-ds-recurse</a>). There Raymond rejected my question on the grounds that this constant is &quot;not exist now&quot;, and I offered to talk about it in this blog :)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
