<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/03/30/10603677.aspx#10604354">
points out</a> that
Windows 95 supported a flag called
<code>TPM_SYS&shy;MENU</code>,
but Windows NT doesn't.
Why not?
</p>
<p>
The
<code>TPM_SYS&shy;MENU</code>
was never documented.
It was used internally by Windows 95
for something-or-other,
but Windows NT didn't need to support it,
so it didn't.
Since it was an internal flag that was never documented,
the Windows NT team
were under no obligation to support it,
and they chose not to.
After all, why go to the extra work of writing code to
support a flag that nobody can legitimately be using?

		<p>A strange response from Raymond, indeed.<br />
But more strangely for me, how come an undocumented enum even has a &#8220;name&#8221;??</p>

		<p>Undocumented means that you may have headers and such for it, but Microsoft doesn&#8217;t support its use.<br />
(there is already several third-party POSIX NT subsystems out there for example, but they can break with near-certainity on each release, as they have to exclusively use undocumented APIs, even if you have most of the functions defined in WDK headers)</p>

		<p>Internal code still needs to have a way of referencing the thing. If it didn&#8217;t have any name, then it still would have had a numeric value and people would have tried to figure out why that stopped working in Windows NT.</p>

		<p>My bet is that they didn&#8217;t remember to remove it from the header files, or they just didn&#8217;t bother. If you let an undocumented item (parameter value, function prototype) in a published header file (let&#8217;s say, in a beta version of the SDK), it&#8217;s a bad idea to remove it later, because it can break working code. Raymond has alerady written about other cases.</p>
<p>As I understand it, &#8220;undocumented&#8221; means that the item is neither described in the official documentation, nor supported. It would be expected that undocumented items were defined in Microsoft&#8217;s internal header files and they didn&#8217;t make to the public ones, but from time to time something escapes this rule.</p>

		<p>So here&#8217;s my question.  I find many situations where .NET has 2-3 constants enumerated, MSDN has 8-9 described, and the SDK has 24-25 declared.  Does that mean 2/3 of the SDK is off limits to my adventuring through interop land?</p>

		<p>No, it&#8217;s more likely that .NET only describes the constants that are required for its provided classes to work properly; truthfully, .NET wouldn&#8217;t need any exposed Win32 constants if the designers wanted to go that direction. If you want to talk to Win32 on your own, you also have to describe the constants that you need.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s simple, independent of you using.net or win32. Check the API documentation to see what is available. In your case that means stick to the 8-9 enums if you&#8217;re writing your own wrapper.</p>
<p>If you use the existing one that only documents 2-3 you should usually stick to that, but in that&#8217;s case if it&#8217;s a thin wrapper you&#8217;re probably fine.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
