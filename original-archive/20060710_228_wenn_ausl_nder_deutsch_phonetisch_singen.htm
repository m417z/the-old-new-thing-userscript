<p> Listening to the recording brought back painful memories of my high school German class, where there were those students who simply couldn't lose their thick American accents. It has been twenty years since I last studied German formally, and I'm certain that my own German pronunciation has picked up a Swedish accent in the meantime. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/12/16/317158.aspx"> My vocabulary has also deteriorated</a> (on that page I get the gender of the word "Person" wrong), although my grammar at least has thankfully held steady.

		<p>Listening to the song and his difficulties with the German &quot;Umlaute&quot;, it reminded me of one of my early visits to italy.</p>
<p>When you go shopping in Germany and you want a bag, you ask for a &quot;T&#252;te&quot;. In an Italian supermarket some 15 years ago I tried my luck and asked in German for a &quot;T&#252;te&quot;, because the girl at the cashpoint seemed to speak a little bit of German.<br />
<br />I had no luck until one of the Germans nearby said I had to ask for a &quot;Tute&quot;.</p>
<p>Well I got it ;-)</p>

		<p>&nbsp;At my high school, grammer and vocabulary were emphasized over being able to speak the language. When one of my friends finally went to Germany, she ended up speaking German with an English accent, rather than her rather noticable Southern accent.</p>

		<p>Ah yes, the Italian version of Bowie&#8217;s &quot;Space Oddity&quot; (called &quot;Ragazza Solo Ragazza Sola&quot; I think (I&#8217;m a bit of a Bowie fan myself).</p>
<p>As a trivia point, the Italian version isn&#8217;t a strict translation of the English lyrics. If memory serves, back in &#8217;69 when the song was written, nobody realized that the person who &quot;translated&quot; the song into Italian just made up their own lyrics and completely ignored the meaning of the original song. Bowie just sang it phonetically and didn&#8217;t realize that it wasn&#8217;t the song he wrote.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think that is likely to happen today (when you could easily use Babelfish to check the translation), but back then&#8230; owel.</p>

		<p>Then there&#8217;s Elvis Presley&#8217;s &quot;Wooden Heart&quot;, his mixed English-German rendition of a traditional song. It&#8217;s actually not that bad.</p>

		<p>This is dramatic, I&#8217;m french and I couldn&#8217;t discern any french word in the &quot;Get Back&quot; German/French mix&#8230; maybe&#8230; hmm&#8230; Pluton? Not that would make any sense&#8230;</p>

<br />Wer kennt den Weg, den Weg zur&#252;ck&quot;</p>
<p>Das hat ja noch nicht mal mehr thematlich etwas mit dem Original zu tun. In der &#220;bersetzung hat er sein M&#228;dchen verlassen, im Original erz&#228;hlt er, wie gl&#252;cklich er mit seinem M&#228;dchen ist.</p>
<p>Was die Aussprache betrifft, wenn man sich erstmal an den Akzent gew&#246;hnt hat und beim ersten Mal mitliest, kann man es beim zweiten Mal recht gut verstehen.</p>

		<p>There is this English version of &quot;99 Luftballons&quot; by Nena (99 red balloons) sung by an American punk band which is kind of funny since one stanza is sung in German. Kind of badly. But nice.<br />

		<p>The worst (and/or funniest) example I&#8217;ve come accross is the song &quot;Herz aus Stahl&quot; (Heart of steel) from Manowar. Not only does it appear that the lyrics have been translated from English to German by the some Chinese guy, but I still cannot figure out what some words are supposed to mean. And I&#8217;m German.<br />
<br />Still, bonus points for trying.</p>

		<p>I have to recommend Leibach&#8217;s German heavy metal version of Queen&#8217;s &quot;One Vision&quot;, and remind you that at least the Beatles had a good reason for singing in German, since they got much of their start in Germany. &nbsp;&quot;I wanna hold your hand&quot; exists in a German version that isn&#8217;t too bad.</p>

		<p>Peter Gabriel (re)did two albums in German, his third and his fourth (which was <em>Security</em> in the US). &nbsp;He doesn&#8217;t speak German, and did everything phonetically. &nbsp;I also don&#8217;t speak German, so I can&#8217;t vouch for them, but the albums are still pretty neat.</p>

		<p>Actually he refers to the English translation &#8211; obviously &quot;air baloons&quot; or simply &quot;baloons&quot; did not fit the verse size, so they (translators) went with red baloons instead. The funny thing is &#8211; they preserved the german numeral format &#8211; &quot;nine and ninety&quot; &#8211; again, for the same reasons</p>

		<p>Hmmm, you sure about that? When I read that I wondered to myself why I had never noticed that. When I listened to the English version to check, I realised that the reason I hadn&#8217;t noticed it is because she sings &quot;ninety-nine red balloons&quot; all the way through the song&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m spending some of my time hoping that a German tourist &#8211; of which there seems to be quite a few in my town &#8211; will one day assault me with questions about how to get to places or where a nice caf&#233; might be.</p>
<p>Because, secretly, I long to speak German. Even though I think grammatical errors will abound.</p>

		<p>Hey, the beatles&#8217; version of &quot;get back&quot; (first link, npr.org site) is a whole lot more frightening for me (an indian being raised in germany) and reminds me of some kind of ww2 war movie or game&#8230; that&#8217;s the real threat!</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
