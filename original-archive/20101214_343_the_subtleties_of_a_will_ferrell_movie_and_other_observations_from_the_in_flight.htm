<p>My flights to and from Beijing were on Hainan Airlines, a Chinese airline. One consequence of this is that Mandarin Chinese is the primary language of communication; English is a distant second. It also means that the in-flight movies are subtitled in Chinese, so if you can't read Chinese, you are restricted to movies in languages you understand.</p>
<p> I wasn't interested in the English-language movies, although I did watch a little bit of "The Other Guys", a Will Ferrell vehicle. In one scene, Ferrell's character and his friend have dinner in a Chinese restaurant. Ferrell's character says to the waiter, "&#35613;&#35613;" which means "Thank you" in Mandarin. The waiter responds, "&#21780;&#35442;" which means (<a href="http://forum.wordreference.com/showthread.php?t=1113823">in this context</a>) "You're welcome" in Cantonese.&sup1; </p>
<p> Part of my brain wondered if this language mismatch was some sort of subtle commentary about the nature of Will Ferrell's character, that he's perhaps a bit of a poseur, or that he's out of place and doesn't realize it? </p>
<p> And part of my brain couldn't believe that the other part of my brain used "subtle" and "Will Ferrell" in the same sentence. </p>
<p> Anyway, the only other language I knew that was offered by the in-flight entertainment system was German. So I watched <a href="http://www.williunddiewunderdieserwelt.de/"><i>Willi und die Wunder dieser Welt</i></a>, a movie-length version of the German children's television show <a href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willi_wills_wissen"><i>Willi wills wissen</i></a>. And watching the movie reminded me that <a href="http://asecular.com/~scott/misc/toilet.htm">Germans are obsessed with poop</a>. During the course of the movie, you see a flying fox pooping, you see <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8wWs4w6Blo#t=90s"> a polar bear pooping</a>, and you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8wWs4w6Blo#t=78s"> investigate a Japanese toilet</a>. I didn't stick around for the whole movie, but I wouldn't be surprised if you also saw a scorpion pooping in the final segment. </p>
<p> (In the Canadian segment, somebody talks with Willi in heavily Canadian-accented German which was apparently learned phonetically. I could barely understand him. It reminded me of my high school German class and the students who couldn't shake their thick American accents.) </p>
<p> <b>Footnote</b> </p>
<p> &sup1;There are several phrases that roughly mean "Thank you" in Cantonese. The two primary ones are the aforementioned "&#21780;&#35442;" and "&#22810;&#35613;", and the rules governing proper use of each one are <a href="http://daisann.com/2007/03/04/somewhere-between-do-jeh-and-mgoi.aspx"> complicated</a>. </p>

		<p>As a native Cantonese speaker, I must say that 唔該 is the only &quot;thank you&quot; we use. We rarely use 多謝. </p>
<p>Literally, 唔 means &quot;no&quot;, 該 means &quot;should&quot;. The who phrase means &quot;you shouldn&#39;t have&quot;. </p>
<p>The grammar of Chinese is perhaps the easiest one. There is no tense, no irregular verb, no case, no gender, no nothing.</p>
<p>By the way. You might wonder why the capital of China is named &quot;Peking&quot; and &quot;Beijing&quot;. &quot;Peking&quot; is Cantonese and &quot;Beijing&quot; is Mandarin. Mandarin (the language Raymond speaks) is indeed ancient China invader&#39;s language. </p>
<p>(Sorry Raymond. ) </p>
<p>The original Chinese language was Sun Yat-Sen&#39;s mother tongue , the southern &nbsp;chinese dialects.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>For the record, I don&#39;t spea Mandarin to any appreciable extent. And Chinese does have grammar. You just don&#39;t realize it as a native speaker because you don&#39;t say &quot;Oh, that&#39;s a point of grammar&quot;; you say &quot;Well duh of course that&#39;s how you say it.&quot; -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>@David: Personally, I don&#39;t like Will Ferrell movies, or anything with Steve Carrell (I don&#39;t like the mysteriously popular American version of the TV show &quot;The Office&quot;), nor do I like most movies with Jim Carrey. &nbsp;I like most humor, but these three don&#39;t do it for me&#8230; and I am as American as anyone (I claim). &nbsp;Maybe it&#39;s all of those double R&#39;s in their last names&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#39;m a freak I guess, but I thought Evan Almighty was better than the first movie (Bruce Almighty.) I dunno, I really got into it.</p>
<p>Never been a huge Will Ferrell fan, but Anchorman and his Nascar movie (whose title I can&#39;t remember right now) have moments.</p>

		<p>So, you can consider this research: are Will Ferrell movies considered funny or lame by the fellow blog readers?</p>
<p>After hearing a lot of good things from American friends about how &#39;funny&#39; Will Ferrell movies were I tried, repeatedly, and fail, *painfully repeatedly*, to find the fun in them. The closest to &#39;funny&#39; was Anchorman, and even that was below most Steve Carrell movies (and thick strata below actually funny stuff). </p>
<p>Please, tell me if I&#39;m being a terrible American or what!</p>

		<p>David: As an American, I can assure you that I do not find Will Ferrell movies funny. That said, movies where he plays a small part (ideally uncredited) may be found funny. The same goes for Steve Carrell, although I still haven&#39;t figured out if Evan Almighty was actually *supposed* to be funny and wasn&#39;t or it just wasn&#39;t intended to be funny. As an example, even though they&#39;re *both* in Melinda and Melinda, they aren&#39;t main characters, so don&#39;t let their presence stop you from watching it.</p>

		<p>Will Ferrell can be *hilarious* when competently directed (see &quot;Stranger than Fiction&quot;), but most of his movies are rather lazy and unfunny. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>@sumdumgai: I disagree with you. Both pharse are used commonly here.</p>
<p>The simple rule for usage is like this: And you say &quot;唔該&quot; if you want to thank others for do you a favour. For example, it&#39;s what you say when someone hand you table salt bottle. And when someone give way for you when you&#39;re in hurry. Consider it&#39;s the word to say when your &quot;Thank you&quot; is related to the word &quot;Please&quot;.</p>
<p>You say &quot;多謝&quot; if you want to say &quot;Thank you&quot; for accepting something. For example, when you receive a present or get your red envelope. The second usage is when others grant you a favour, so there&#39;s pharse &quot;多謝合作&quot; (Thank you for you cooperation (in advance)). Just consider it&#39;s the word to say when your &quot;Thank you&quot; is not related to the word &quot;Please&quot; &#8211; i.e. when you expect you&#39;ll get the item/favour even if you don&#39;t ask.</p>

		<p>Just for the record, I haven&#39;t seen the so-called German toilet for at least twenty years now. It&#39;s true that they used to be here in the eighties, but then, there were also some rather strange hair cuts back then. And just as the hair cuts, you may see one of the old toilets at rare occasions.</p>
<p>@EbbeK: I can assure you that no children&#39;s book I&#39;ve seen in the last few years (two nephews here) deals with poop. On the other hand, reading the amazon.de reviews for the one you mentioned, it seems that children really love it&#8230;</p>

		<p>The purpose of a German toilet is to eliminate splash, and it does so perfectly.</p>
<p>A good one will have a small layer of water on the shelf as well. Not enough to cause a splash, but enough to ensure flushing once is enough.</p>

		<p>Reading this &quot;And watching the movie reminded me that Germans are obsessed with poop.&quot; made me first think that you are referring to the word that we Germans are saying all the time: Scheiße! Its used much the same as the f-word, but means poop.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
