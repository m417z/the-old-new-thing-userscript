		<p>You have to admit that without people taking bold initiatives with language, we would be stuck with a static and dead language. How much Hittite do you hear spoken? Not very much I would guess. Failure to operationalize a language for change relegates it to wind up being buried inside a tumulus.</p>

		<p>Maybe in all three cases you could use the word &quot;implement&quot;? &nbsp;I dunno. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t really even get the first two uses.</p>
<p>Does operationalizing something mean to set up a process so that it is part of routine operations? &nbsp;I dunno&#8230; I can barely understand what these people mean anymore.</p>

		<p>At my last job at an IT support company, &#8216;operationalize&#8217; meant &#8216;get the process to the point where it can either be automated of reduced to a set of very simple instructions that can be followed by anyone who can type&quot;.</p>

<p>It doesn&#8217;t mean &quot;to carry out&quot; or &quot;to put into effect.&quot; &nbsp;&quot;Operationalization&quot; is the act of defining a concept in a way that can be measured. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The first two examples are arguably correct, but it would depend upon the greater context of the sentences. &nbsp;Are they defining how the success/effectiveness of the plan can be measured? &nbsp;Operationalizing security could mean defining metrics for measuring the effectiveness of security in general.</p>
<p>The third just looks wrong.</p>
<p>In any event, I think it&#8217;s a clumsy word, and I wouldn&#8217;t use it.</p>

		<p>I learned this term in my psyhcology undergraduate degree (possibly without the z and with an s) in the phrase</p>
<p>&quot;Operationalise the variables&quot;</p>
<p>which meant, &nbsp;decide how you are going to measure something. &nbsp;A critical step in studying humans&#8230; &#8230;.deciding how to measure what is likely to be a fuzzy, &nbsp;socially constructed concept.</p>
<p>For (fictional) example, I could decide to measure microsoftie executive dedication to creative use of the language(the variable) by operationalising it as the number of words produced during an exceutive speech that could not be verified by the 1984 Collins English (UK) dictionary. &nbsp;Then encourage some microsoft employee developer friend to attend, &nbsp;meetings, &nbsp;record speeches and write an astoundingly clever program to check speech content against the collins dictionary. &nbsp; And Lo! &nbsp;If the office exec produced 24 and the VP for Windows produced 86 in their respecive big team meetings, &nbsp;then I could get some non-parametric test of significance under my belt, &nbsp;possibly a Chi Square, to demonstrate if this difference is significantly greater than would be expected by chance. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Then I&#8217;d write a fancy article and sell it to some magazine (CNET?) and use the proceeds to pay my developer friend and possibly have a tea party to celebrate. &nbsp; Hoorah!</p>
<p>Are we allowed to waffle on Raymonds comments section?</p>

		<p>&quot;operationalize&quot; v. &#8211; to make it work under real world situations, not just in the lab. &nbsp;</p>
<p>e.g., &quot;operationalize the security posture&quot; &#8212; take your &#8216;best case&#8217; lab findings, test with real world data and produce a result that&#8217;s actually useful. &nbsp;(i.e., not the NSA STIGs: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/index.html" rel="nofollow">http://iase.disa.mil/stigs/index.html</a> )</p>
<p>e.g., &quot;operationalize the &nbsp;demo&quot; &#8212; sure, the demo worked back in the shop, but there are a lot of other details to get it to work on the showroom floor. &nbsp;work those out. &nbsp;</p>
<p>(shrug) &nbsp;my opinion, based of a career of making it work.</p>

		<p>This is another word that actually has a well-defined meaning in science or, in this case, philosophy of science (operationalize = give an operational definition).</p>
<p>One day, it floated by some &lt;dude in need of big words for small things&gt; who tried to reverse-engineer its meaning using folk etymology (&quot;${X}ize&quot; usually means &quot;make $X&quot;) and decided that its probably synonymous to &quot;make&quot; or &quot;do&quot;.</p>
<p>As a result, the word has been reduced to pure fluff in most contexts.</p>

<p>I see &quot;I could care less&quot; on web forums quite a bit and always assumed that it was a typo, hadn&#8217;t realised that people actually say that when it says the opposite of what they mean.</p>

		<p>Couldn&#8217;t it just mean to &quot;make [object] work&quot;? So then to &quot;operationalize the demo&quot; would be to ensure that it actually does what it&#8217;s supposed to do.</p>

		<p>Yup, reading -ize as &quot;make/turn into&quot;, it&#8217;s either &quot;turn it into an operation&quot;, or &quot;make operational&quot;. &nbsp;I suspect it means the former, but the meaning has spread, due to the fact that the former tends to involve the latter, along with a preference to say &quot;operationalize&quot; to &quot;operationize&quot; (an individual&#8217;s grammar rules sufferâ€  from muscle memory).</p>
<p>The problem with -speaks is that it&#8217;s hard (though not impossible) to summarise complex processes in one word, and there is a desire to get people to understand everything in a concise way. &nbsp;Of course, this is only possible when you&#8217;re all on the same wavelength (but the same applies to obscure, well-defined words).</p>
<p>â€  OK, it&#8217;s really analogy.</p>

		<p>Now if enough people use this word enough, maybe it&#8217;ll shorten itself to &quot;op&quot;. &quot;Op the demo&quot;, &quot;A lot of work lies ahead to op this plan&quot;. I&#8217;m not sure if that would be an improvement though.</p>

		<p>A different take on it-</p>
<p>Operationalize means &quot;make ready for an operational environment&quot;, often referring to enterprise production environments which have dedicated operations teams, defined management/escalation processes and SLAs.</p>
<p>So desktop apps need to be &quot;productized&quot; while web apps need to be &quot;operationalized&quot;&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
