<p>The Seattle Times reports that <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003490012_stormname22m.html"> the National Weather Service is inviting suggestions from the public on what to call the recent windstorm</a>. They're baffled because "the storm didn't fall on a holiday."</p>
<p> Huh? </p>
<p> The storm blew in on the evening of the 14th, but its effects weren't really felt until the morning of the 15th, and the first dark night for everyone was... <i>the first night of Hanukkah</i>, the Festival of Lights. Everybody in the Seattle area was lighting candles and celebrating Hanukkah (mostly unwittingly). </p>
<p> Gosh, I wonder what we should call this storm? If you have any ideas, send your suggestion to namethewindstorm@noaa.gov. </p>
<p> (By the way, in case you missed it, here's the picture of <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/ABPub/zoom/html/2003480656.html"> the house that had ten trees fall on it</a>.) </p>

<p>Yup, that exists too. &nbsp;Let there be no mistake about the meanings of these holidays. &nbsp;.com, or as it used to be written before the internet, commercial.</p>
<p>Now to return to the topic.</p>
<p>I saved a printed newspaper headline saying something like &quot;Durian slams into Philippines, 12 killed.&quot; &nbsp;Of course it was really talking the typhoon with that name, but it looked so much better the way the headline was worded.</p>

		<p>Reminds of me the newspaper headline &quot;Isabel pummels Florida coast&quot;. My girlfriend still has a copy of that paper for her niece, Isabel. Some day she&#8217;ll appreciate it&#8230;</p>

		<p>Yup &#8211; that house is up at Trilogy and we were visiting with Bob when the photographer was there. Actually, it has less damage than the two houses right by it, one of which may need partial demolition, but Bob made a better picture. These houses border the golf course and were most vulnerable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not on the golf course, but a Douglas fir made three holes in my roof and crashed through a roof overhang. Perhaps I&#8217;ll call it the Fir Storm.</p>
<p>Or because I had three young men on my roof cutting the tree up in the teeth of the storm, just after a Redmond fire truck was crushed by a tree while evacuating a neighbor, I should call it the Unsung Hero storm.</p>
<p>I do appreciate there are others with much worse damage.</p>

		<p>p.s. the driver of the truck will be OK &#8211; he has some muscle pain (this was the little truck that the marshal drives around in; it was hit just behind the cab). Same with the Redmond Ridge fireman who was hit on the helmet by a tree a little later; he&#8217;s OK.</p>

		<p>Well since they named that hurricane Katrina (and the Waves) properly now it would be the time to call this one &quot;Snap!&quot; a.k.a. &quot;I got the power&quot; (and you don&#8217;t).</p>

		<p>I think they&#8217;re trying to name the wrong thing. The real problem was thinking we could get away with dangling high voltage lines along side trees older than most of the people who live by them, in a stormy climate to boot. Naming the storm focuses the blame on the storm. We&#8217;re the ones to blame. Not that I&#8217;m into the blame game, but come on&#8230; it was the storm back in 2006. If there&#8217;s another one&#8230; it was the first storm back in 2006. Why must we name everything?</p>
<p>FYI, next time the power goes out everywhere, and you find the one starbucks that is still open (such as in Bellevue on 8th!), bring a surge protector and extension cord. The masses will love you for it, and their cell phone batteries shall runeth over.</p>

		<p>Amen Dave. &nbsp;I blogged during the aftermath of the storm on generator power, and it&#8217;s just retarded how poorly designed the power infrastructure is once you cross the lake.</p>

		<p>Since, this was a Hanukah storm why not call it &quot;The Hammer?&quot; &nbsp;The &quot;Maccabee&quot; in Judah Maccabee&#8217;s name means &quot;hammer&quot; in Hebrew.</p>
<p>And we certainly were &quot;hammered&quot; by that windstorm. &nbsp;So why not call it that?</p>
<p>BTW, you&#8217;ll find a link to the post I wrote about my experience of the storm.</p>

		<p>Chanukkah is a celebration of the successful revolt by Judah Maccabee and his group of rebels against the Greek invaders.</p>
<p>So, since the storm occurred so near Chanukkah &#8212; now maybe I&#8217;m a bit biased &#8212; but why not name it Judah? ;-)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
