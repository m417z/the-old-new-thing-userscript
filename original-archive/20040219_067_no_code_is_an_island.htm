<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/22/61647.aspx#62827">  Norman Diamond noted in a comment  that on Windows 2003 Server, the Display Adapter Troubleshooting  slider still lists "full acceleration" as the recommended setting  even though the default for Server is "full minus one".</p>
<p>This is one of those "Oh, that's an easy change" bugs.  The discussion probably went like this:</p>
<p>Some guy whose idea this was:  "For stability reasons, we want to lower the default video acceleration  for Server a notch.  Dear Video Setup team, can you do that for us?"</p>
<p>Video Setup team: "Sure thing, that's no problem.  The default setting is all done by us; it should not have any impact  on anybody else. We'll just do it and be done with it."</p>
<p>Guy: "Sweet. Thanks."</p>
<p>And bingo, the default video acceleration dropped to one notch below full  on Server, and everyone was happy.</p>
<p>Except that there's this text tucked away in the Display control panel  that has the word "(recommended)" next to "full acceleration".  That didn't get updated.  Oops.  (I wouldn't be surprised if there is also some  help text that didn't get updated for this change.)</p>
<p>No code is an island.</p>
<p>  So when you complain, "Aw come on, it's a one-line change.  What's taking so long?" think about the little video acceleration slider.</p>

		<p>Don&#8217;t Repeat Yourself is one of the pragmatic programmer (<a target="_new" href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/</a>) recomendations.</p>
<p>Current tools for programming and documentation are the source of this problem. Whenever you repeat a piece of information, you must keep track of dependecies. We&#8217;re still using text files and ugly scripts for complex work.</p>

		<p>Documentation is a particular problem, though. Even with excellent tools for producing documentation, I think you&#8217;ll always have the case where there is more than one place to touch to make a change. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s a silver bullet here.</p>
<p>The core problem is that writing code and writing good end-user documentation are different skills, and that one cannot reasonably expect all good developers to also be good at writing end-user documentation. Nor would you necessarily expect technical writers to be good developers. So you separate those functions.</p>
<p>The best we can manage is to ensure we have good systems for tracking changes, but even those are prone to human error. It&#8217;s hard to imagine an automated system which would have caught this example of Raymond&#8217;s for instance. Somewhere along the line a human needs to be concientious enough to check what documentation, resource files, and other items are affected by their change. That all takes time (which I think was the original point), and cannot be a 100% reliable process.</p>

		<p>While we&#8217;re on this subject (I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve posted this before), any ideas why StretchBlt should apparently be slower when the Hardware Acceleration setting is set to Full than when it&#8217;s set to none?</p>
<p>A poster on CodeProject originally asked this question a few weeks ago (<a target="_new" href="http://www.codeproject.com/script/comments/forums.asp?msg=731338&amp;forumid=1647#xx731338xx" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/script/comments/forums.asp?msg=731338&#038;forumid=1647#xx731338xx</a>). The best I could do was reproduce the issue on my work system, with an nVidia Riva TNT board. I wondered whether doing the StretchBlt into a compatible DC, then doing a BitBlt to the screen would be any better, but the timings were about the same.</p>

		<p>Mike, do you by chance have an nVidia card? When I was working on a DX7 game way back then I noticed that if you used Blt with MIRRORLEFTRIGHT it would slow the game down to a crawl. And I think there was also another bug with non color keyed images (when mirrored) that would screw it up too in addition to making it slow to render. Disabling hardware acceleration made the game render correctly and at acceptable rates. We added an option at the last minute to create duplicate flipped sprites to work around this since nVidia hadn&#8217;t fixed it yet (and they still haven&#8217;t).</p>

		<p>This might be a little off topic, but anyway:</p>
<p>To fight the DLL hell (no code is an island), app.exe.local was introduced in Windows 2000. But, the MSDN says following:<br />
<br /><a target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/base/dynamic_link_library_redirection.asp" rel="nofollow">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dllproc/base/dynamic_link_library_redirection.asp</a><br />
<br />anyway, so what&#8217;s the sense? The app dir is searched first, so why tell it explicitly?</p>
<p>I only figured the following, but that might be very wrong:<br />
<br />Suppose I have my own CRT DLL. I load MFC, which in turn loads CRT. Since I use the pre-built MFC (from windowssystem32), it loads CRT (in that case from windowssystem32). This would result in my app using the windowssystem32 version of the CRT DLL instead of the other.<br />
<br />Nut this, in my understanding, cotradicts the text in MSDN.</p>
<p>Anyway, if You could clarify the purpose of the .local file, I would be grateful.</p>
<p>LoadLibrary description says, the DLL is only searched for, if no path is specified. Is this the reason for .local? Is in such case the local file loaded?</p>
<p> Thanks for your great blog</p>

		<p>.local also affects CoGetClassFactory (and, I believe, LoadLibrary with an explicit path); you can then use a local version of a COM server DLL, even if the registry points somewhere else (as long as the DLL names are the same).</p>
<p>The briefly-available test version of Internet Explorer which popped up message boxes if the page used ActiveX controls loaded with data from the page used this technique. People spotted this technique and realised that they could in fact run older versions of IE side-by-side with newer versions.</p>

		<p>Raymond, may I report another bug in Windows?<br />
<br />The meaning of the SHFMT_OPT_FULL flag for SHFormatDrive is reverse in Windows 2000 and 2003. That is when SHFMT_OPT_FULL is specified, the dialog opens with the &quot;Quick format&quot; checkbox on.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
