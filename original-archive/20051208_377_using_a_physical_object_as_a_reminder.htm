<p>On our team, we have a mailing list where people can report problems. Those people could be testers from our team or they could be people from elsewhere in the company. Everybody on the team is expected to keep an eye on the messages and debug problems in their area. The job of monitoring the mailing list to ensure that every issue is ultimately addressed rotates according to a predetermined schedule, and in addition to receiving a piece of reminder mail at 4pm the business day before it's your turn, you will also find a Mickey Mouse ears hat on your desk when you arrive in the morning.</p>
<p> I bought this hat in Disneyland a few years ago and somehow managed to convince the person operating the sewing machine to stitch the name "Dev O'Day" on the back. "It's an Irish name," I explained, but it also stands for "Developer of the Day", which is the title we use for the person who monitors the mailing list. </p>
<p> One of our team members went on vacation to Disneyland the following year and brought back a back-up hat, which sits in my office. The back-up hat is occasionally brought into service when the primary Dev O'Day hat goes missing, at which point a Search and Rescue mission is undertaken to locate the hat and restore it to circulation. (It's usually just sitting in the office of someone who was Developer of the Day recently and merely forgot to hand the hat off at the end of the day.)  </p>

		<p>I&#8217;m curious to know if you&#8217;ve ever tried Scrum.  We&#8217;ve been using Scrum for a little while, having daily meetings between team members in which impedements and issues are brought up to the &quot;scrum master&quot; (typically a project manager type).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a pain in the ass, honestly, to have a daily meeting, but it forces us to communicate, which is a good thing.</p>

		<p>When I was briefly in the shell DoD rotation I really liked the MM hat.  I wore it all day; to meetings, lunch, etc.  It saddens me that most DoD&#8217;s don&#8217;t actually wear it.</p>

		<p>Maybe you should use one of these hats as a backup instead so it can be DEVO Day:</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t do that.  If the possessor wants to be Developer of the Day for several days in a row, let them ^u^</p>
<p>As for the person in your other thread who worried about the floppy disk semaphore getting copied, the copy of the hat proves that this is a real physical problem ^_^<br />

		<p>That trick it&#8217;s useful. Once upon a time when we use &quot;sneaker net&quot; (meaning that we had no net, just pass along floppyes) we use a fridge magnet with the image of a little house, to indicate witch PC had the current data. So when someone need to update the &quot;database&quot; (an excel file) would know from witch PC they should took the floppy (and the fridge magnet, of course).<br /></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
