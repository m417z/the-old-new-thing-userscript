		<p>The misused terminology report mostly seems to be fighting back against CEO-speak and verbing everything, but good luck with that. No one who uses them will care what a bunch of grammarians have to say.</p>

		<p>Some of it is genuine misused English. For example, the use of &#8220;actual&#8221; to mean &#8220;current&#8221;,Â because the German word for &#8220;current&#8221; is &#8220;aktuell&#8221;. (False friend.)</p>

		<p>Be that as it may, it becomes very irritating when you actually have to translate them. That&#8217;s what I am doing right now. I have an English document coming from France that use the word &#8220;status&#8221; as a verb. There is the misuse of &#8220;action plan&#8221;, &#8220;escalation&#8221; and &#8220;logistics&#8221; in it. Sometimes the document drops all pretense and writes &#8220;Logistique&#8221;.</p>

		<p>That God-damned Nvidia helper hooking random functions with Detours caused me so many hangs and deadlocks in Firefox, plus a few crashes, and the same thing happened in several other applications. It took ages to finally track it to nvd3d9wrap, but of course raising the issue with Nvidia got me nowhere. I just removed nvd3d9wrap entirely, and so far no ill effects.</p>

		<p>We&#8217;ve had our own problems. I have now a very short snippet that can reliably detect a screwup from one kind of hooking, but not who caused it. On encountering it, we tell the customer to rebuild one of the boxes (funny how they always occur in large batches) from scratch, testing after each component is installed, with the first test being before joining the domain.</p>
<p>The particular problem encountered is calling CreateFile(somefilename, &#8230;, FILE_FLAG_DELETE_ON_CLOSE &#8230;) followed by CreateFile(samefilename, &#8230;, FILE_SHARE_DELETE | &#8230;) doesn&#8217;t work anymore.</p>

		<p>The standard error article was great.  I&#8217;d always kind of assumed that stderr came from wanting to avoid error messages going to a special teletype of some kind, but would never have guessed it was a typesetter designed to be operated by paper tape!</p>
<p>The fact that the nVidia / detours bug is using AppInit_DLLs forces me to assume that they&#8217;re doing it wrong.  AppInit seems like one of those things that should automatically be raised as a red flag in any automatic crash reporting system&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
