		<p>Interesting&#8230; &nbsp;From TFA: &quot;&#8230;Luberto, an Argentina-born Italian-American &#8230; Luberto won&#8217;t say how he made his money.&quot;</p>
<p>Wonder if he&#8217;s an unemployed stockbroker, or ex-mafioso, or son of a former fascist that fled to Argentina with lots of looted nazi gold.. Who knows..</p>

		<p>&#8230;wins ths argument only against stupid people. &nbsp;That could be most of the U.S. though. &nbsp;It is non-sequitur so the argument is still unresolved.</p>
<p>He could try: &quot;I pay for all the electricity. &nbsp;There are no rules on how much you consume.&quot; &nbsp;At least it&#8217;s related to the actual argument.</p>

		<p>There is no such thing as an Italian-American. He would probably be best described as naturalized American Citizen, born in Argentina of Italian parents. This assumes he is a citizen at all&#8230;</p>

		<p>Why not be born to American parents of Italian descent while they are living in Argentina? It&#8217;s likely under US Law he would be a natural born US citizen.</p>
<p>Speculating about the citizenship of someone mentioned in an article over their Christmas display is just as non-sequitur as his pointless argument that the children would suffer or die or have their IQ lowered or whatever.</p>

		<p>Calling him an Argentina Born Italian-American is neat, concise, and gets the point across perfectly. &nbsp;There&#8217;s no need to turn that into a long, awkward sentence just because a few people are going to stomp their feet get huffy about whether &quot;Italian-American&quot; is technically correct.</p>

		<p>This classic argument stopper has some dangerous implications here in Australia. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We are facing the real prospect of internet censorship, which might include everything from information on Euthanasia to gambling, as well as porn. We don&#8217;t really know for sure, as the minister (Sen. Conroy) has been evasive, and in any event the final list would be secret! The false positives (and missed negatives), net slow down and the expense makes this a ridiculous proposal. &nbsp;Made even more so by the technical limitations, security risks (of filtering https), let alone the easy bypasses available. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That only China, Iran and a few other countries have compulsory internet filtering seems to be lost on our government.</p>
<p>Their response is usually something that can be reduced to &quot;Think of the children&quot;.</p>

		<p>I know this is against common usage, but logically speaking, Argentina born people can call themselves &quot;American&quot; (Argentina is in South America, and American &quot;should&quot; means people live in America, right?)</p>

		<p>@Cheong: &quot;American&quot; means &quot;of or pertaining to America&quot;, and if you happen to use &quot;America&quot; to refer to the two continents as opposed to the United States, then there you go.</p>
<p>Anyone who would actually do this when discussing origins would be smacked, though. Or greeted with nerdy assent, depending on the context.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
