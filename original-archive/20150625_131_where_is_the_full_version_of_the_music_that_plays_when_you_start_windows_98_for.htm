<p>A customer was presumably <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/05/13/10524731.aspx"> exercising the <i>unlimited support</i> part of their support contract</a> when they asked, "Where is the full song for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FdPppg5c6YY"> the music that plays when you start Windows 98 for the first time</a>? The Welcome application plays only the first 30 seconds. Can you send us the rest of the song?"</p>
<p> I guess the IT department really likes that music and wants <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4n1PwyADGh8"> the extended dance remix</a> for their late-night raves. (If you stick it out, there's a special appearance in the linked video of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/09/10/10556421.aspx"> the screen I wrote</a>.) </p>
<p> The music was commissioned to be 30 seconds long. There is no extended version of the song, or at least not one that Microsoft acquired the rights to. The original composer could have written a five-minute version and sent Microsoft only the first 30 seconds, or maybe the piece is only 30 seconds long to begin with. All we know is that we have a 30-second music clip. </p>

		<p>&quot;We&#39;re paying for MS support, so let&#39;s troll them with anything that comes to mind.&quot;</p>
<p>Hilarious.</p>
<p>Although them actually having paid for a one-off support ticket is an even better mental image.</p>

		<p>Having moved from 3.1, to NT 3.1, to NT 3.5, to NT 4, to 2000, to XP, i never knew such music existed. I do remember something about &quot;Start me up&quot; for Windows 95 launch event; but i didn&#39;t know Microsoft continued the tradition into later Win9x releases.</p>
<p>I know Windows XP had the song [Like Humans Do](<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://youtu.be/GuY4FR-bmGY">https://youtu.be/GuY4FR-bmGY</a>) tucked away.</p>

		<p>Personally, I was very fond of the introduction video of the &quot;Interactive CD sampler&quot; that was included on the Windows 95 CD. I did not like the Windows 98 version of the CD sampler, though. <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://m.youtube.com/watch?v=wd-sRk1qvF8">m.youtube.com/watch</a></p>

		<p>I still remember discovering the Windows 95 extras and coming across Hover!, which was a lot of fun.</p>
<p>As far as music, I still like the synthy Windows XP setup music (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oNXzMBA9VU4">http://www.youtube.com/watch</a> aka Title.wma), which feels nice and relaxed. &nbsp;I think I only heard it once or twice during actual installs though, as I usually didn&#39;t have sound drivers yet :(</p>

		<p>I never knew there was music during setup! &nbsp;I probably installed Windows XP 100 or more times. &nbsp;I&#39;m sure it was the lack of sound drivers during setup that made me miss the files&#8230;. or, sometimes, the fact that I might not have plugged in any speakers until after setup was done.</p>

		<p>This was bundled with Windows 95 to demonstrate the new multimedia features. It was heavily posterised and dithered, and my powerful &quot;developer&quot; PC stuttered badly when playing it.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, it took a few years, but I eventually tracked down (pre-Internet) the music on the original Guided Tour of Macintosh that I received with my first Mac. &nbsp;I bought Liz Story&#39;s CD that featured the music they used on the Guide, then the rest of her oevre, and eventually a large number of the Wyndham Hill (the label) CD&#39;s.</p>
<p>So, yes, there are people who end up really loving the music based on the clip included with the product&#8230;</p>

		<p>I got very familiar with Title.WMA, because our IT guy was often required to reinstall Windows XP on laptops. And he couldn&#39;t mute it, because the keyboard driver in Setup didn&#39;t include support for the laptops&#39; volume control keys.</p>

		<p>Since we&#39;re sort of talking about weldata.exe, I&#39;ll go ahead and ask:</p>
<p>How come Raymond&#39;s name isn&#39;t listed in the Windows 98 easter egg/credits screen? IIRC he was still considered important enough to be listed in the Windows 95 easter egg.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
