<p>When I joined Microsoft, I had a brand new computer waiting for me. One of the rites of passage for new employees is setting up their computer. A colleague helped me out with this effort, and one of the steps he performed was installing the network card. (Back in the day, network adapters were not integrated into the motherboard. If you wanted one, you had to buy an add-on card.)</p>
<p> Now, when you install a network card, it occupies a slot, and you need to remove the corresponding <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000BSJHRI/?tag=tholneth-20"> slot cover</a> because the card comes with its own integrated slot cover. When my colleague removed the old slot cover from the computer, he didn't just toss it into the garbage. He folded it back on itself with the tab on the top, like this: &#5418; </p>
<p> What the heck was that all about? </p>
<p> He didn't give me time to ask the question because he immediately walked over to my office door, pulled it all the way open, and then jammed the doodad under the door. The tab at the top caught the door, and the angled bottom part dug into the carpet, holding the door open: </p>
<p style="font-size: 20pt; height: 2.1em; width: 2em;           border-bottom: solid 2px black"> &#9608; <span style="position: relative; left: -1ex; top: 2ex">&#5418;</span> </p>
<p> In other words, he took the slot cover and converted it into a doorstop. </p>
<p> Thereafter, I noticed that all of my coworkers used slot covers to hold their office doors open. It was part of the team's tribal knowledge. </p>
<p> (This trick is lost to history not only because computers nowadays come with all the peripherals you would typically need, but also because the new office doors are not spring-loaded.) </p>

		<p>Wait, but isn&#39;t Raymond more the type who&#39;d build or buy an actual doorstop, saving the cover just in case he needed to cover up an empty slot? I distinctly remember the blog post about the misuse of kitchen utensils.</p>
<p>My psychic powers tell me that he would&#39;ve picked up the improvised doorstop, bent it back into shape and stored it somewhere in his office.</p>

		<p>I sometimes build or upgrade computers for people, and I find myself occasionally buying slot covers. &nbsp;It&#39;s hard to find solid (not &quot;vented&quot;) black slot covers, but I finally managed to find some.</p>

		<p>@Marc: Some computer cases are sold with screw fixed slot covers (I think some of them are made by GTR). When you add new cards, just unscrew it and remove the cover to add the card. Some cases made by HP just need you pull the spring connected hinge on the top to take the cover of individual slot away.</p>
<p>Maybe next time when you need to buy a new computer, you&#39;ll want to spend some time to also look at the back of the cases.</p>

		<p>Well, they could still be used for non-office (or non-office room) doors I suppose. There are still doors that tend to swing towards open or close, whether spring loaded or not.</p>
<p>But I wonder if this doodad would be any use for non-carpeted flooring. Say vinyl, tile, hardwood &#8211; suppose it&#39;d probably scratch it up. Bare concrete might be ok.</p>

		<p>No one mentions compatibility. Back in the olden Pentium days the slot covers often fit in other cases. And they came with a screw most of the time. Which was probably the common thing that made them compatible. Now (well, the &quot;now&quot; is for quite some time) they are all slightly different (just by millimeter) with different plastic hinges that make it hard to reuse even if they would fit. I&#39;ve also seen (cheap) cases with one-way slot covers that you had to tear away from a dotted edge.</p>
<p>BTW: there&#39;s also that pile of plastic covers for the front of the PC for Floppy (yeah!), CD-ROM etc.</p>

		<p>Back when I used desktop PCs, I always kept the unneeded slot covers, &quot;just in case&quot; I needed one. &nbsp;I probably had 12 or more in my collection of PC parts over the years. &nbsp;How many did I actually use for their intended purpose, filling a hole in the PC case? &nbsp;Maybe two. &nbsp;I never thought of anything inventive like a door stop. &nbsp;As a consequence, years later, when I was cleaning out my PC parts, the slot covers went in the recycle bin.</p>

		<p>But why did Microsoft developers need doorstops in the first place? I thought the whole point of an office was to shut the door and enjoy working in privacy. How many people would enter and leave per minute? Was it impossible to open the door from the outside without a key(card), making it difficult for the occupant to get up and open them all the time? We need more irrelevant details.</p>

		<p>I think that practically everyone has these collections of these items. Personally, I have several serial cables (both the 9- and 25-pin kind), parallel printer cables, SCSI cables and cables whose purpose I can&#39;t identify anymore but keep &quot;just in case&quot;! In other news, I have many boxes of old PC Magazines and other junk. It&#39;s possibly a coincidence.</p>

		<p>Back in the day when Raymond was a new hire there were two related problems: office ventilation was crap and developers&#39; offices (with multiple PCs) tended to overheat, and fire code required the doors to have self closers. &nbsp;The facilities department would regularly confiscate doorstops to keep the fire department happy, so fabricating replacements out of freely available office supplies became an important skill. &nbsp;Bent slot covers were popular, as were little anchors made from a binder clip and a sharpened pencil.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
