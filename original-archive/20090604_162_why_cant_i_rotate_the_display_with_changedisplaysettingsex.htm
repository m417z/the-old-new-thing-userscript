<p>If you have one of those cool swively LCD displays (or if you decided to <a href="http://www.instructables.com/id/rotate-or-pivot-lcd-monitor/"> build your own</a>), you naturally want to tell your video card to display rotated output, so you can take advantage of the portrait orientation. And naturally you would think that calling the <code>ChangeDisplaySettingsEx</code> and using the <code>dmDisplayOrientation</code> field of the <code>DEVMODE</code> structure would do the trick.</p>
<p> And then you would find that it doesn't work. </p>
<p> Yet the annoying utility program (which gets shoveled onto your computer when you install the driver) can rotate the video output. How come they can do it, but <code>ChangeDisplaySettingsEx</code> can't? </p>
<p> Because the video card vendor decided to do it in a nonstandard way so that you're forced to use their annoying utility program. </p>
<p> I'm told that one of the requirements of the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa480220.aspx"> Windows Vista Display Driver Model</a> is that video drivers which support rotation must do so via the standard rotation interface. No "secret backdoor hidden rotation functionality" allowed. So at least things are getting better. </p>
<p> Of course, this doesn't help if you have a video card that doesn't have WDDM drivers. To the rescue come the clever people at EnTech, who developed the <a href="http://www.entechtaiwan.com/util/irotate.shtm"> iRotate</a> utility which knows the secret backdoor way to convince these annoying video cards to do their rotation. </p>

		<p>I&#8217;d imagine the reason that the &quot;secret backdoor hidden rotation functionality&quot; exists in XP drivers is because manufacurers are using the same drivers for XP as 2000 where the &quot;secret backdoor hidden rotation functionality&quot; was actually needed.</p>

		<p>The same company&#8217;s PowerStrip tool helped me finally get my HTPC to display at 1280&#215;720 on my plasma TV.</p>
<p>(Without it I was stuck at the slightly higher native resolution of 1280&#215;768. That&#8217;s non-square pixels, which the OS and/or video codecs seem not to understand, so everything was squashed until I forced the right resolution. It was really frustrating that I had to find a 3rd party tool in order to get both the major gfx card vendors&#8217; cards/drivers to work properly with the screen. Turns out it&#8217;s just a registry entry, too.)</p>

		<p>Is it me or do the video driver guys seem to be the main ones causing most of the trouble?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m waiting for one of them to come to this blog and either try to lie their way out of it or justify their behavior somehow.</p>

		<p>@JamesNT, the graphics card vendors had an inflated opinion of themselves. &nbsp;They basically took Adobe&#8217;s attitude that people buy computers just so they can buy their product. &nbsp;(The fact that their highest-margin markets were gaming and 3D modeling, where they were indeed the most important system component, reinforced this belief.)</p>
<p>When you have that feeling of entitlement, you don&#8217;t feel the need to be a good Windows citizen. &nbsp;You want your logo plastered all over Windows, in context menus, in the Control Panel, in the Start menu, in the notification area, everywhere. &nbsp;You feel Microsoft should be coding Windows to suit you, not the other way around.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;ve noticed quite a dramatic improvement since Vista came out. &nbsp;Some of it comes from humbler graphics vendors &#8212; perhaps spurred by Intel&#8217;s gains in integrated graphics, and AMD&#8217;s purchase of ATI. &nbsp;And Microsoft has also struck back. &nbsp;Windows Update installing clean drivers without bundled craplets + drivers outside of kernel mode = bliss.</p>

		<p>Oh&#8230; I always thought that you can&#8217;t do this because by default the &quot;Hide modes that this monitor cannot display&quot; is checked. (The &quot;Ctrl-Alt-Left/Right&quot; key combination won&#8217;t work if that setting is checked. Once you unchecked that and click &quot;Apply&quot; the above key combination works. I checked to see at least these work like this way on computers with Intel and NVidia graphic chips.)</p>

		<p>&quot;When [graphics card vendors] have that feeling of entitlement, you don&#8217;t feel the need to be a good Windows citizen.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not wanting to start any mud-slinging here, but don&#8217;t worry, graphics card vendors&#8217; sense of entitlement and arrogance is not limited to Windows. Graphics card vendors fail to be good citizens and generally suck no matter what OS you use.</p>
<p>Except Intel.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve found that these annoying video cards also ignore SetDeviceGammaRamp and ICM profiles when used with some OS versions. Of course, they have no equivalent proprietary function of their own, so you can&#8217;t control the colours displayed on your monitor. The most annoying thing is that this doesn&#8217;t appear to be a conscious design choice but just the result of buggy code that was never actually tested to work, which is par for the course in recent drivers so it would seem. Roll on Intel&#8217;s Larrabee, I say, and let the others see how it ought to be done.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s a little cheap I think to bash the graphic vendors for a glitch here and there, they make some of the most complex pieces of software, and they do struggle with backward comp and need to work around bad application&#8217;s bug the same way this blog often discussed.</p>
<p>Btw, our company doesn&#8217;t support Intel graphic cards due to the problems with them, I&#8217;m a little baffled to read that positive comment above. &nbsp;The thought that Intel just wont freaking give up with graphics terrifies us. &nbsp;I guess if you just browse the web on Linux, they&#8217;re OK.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
