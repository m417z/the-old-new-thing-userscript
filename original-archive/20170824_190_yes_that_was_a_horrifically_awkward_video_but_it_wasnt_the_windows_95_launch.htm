If you search YouTube for "Windows 95 launch",
you'll find many copies of this video:
</p>
<p><iframe
    WIDTH="560" HEIGHT="315"
    SRC="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAkuJXGldrM"
    FRAMEBORDER="0"

<p>
This is commonly identified as having been recorded
at the Windows 95 launch,
but it wasn't.
The Windows 95 launch featured Jay Leno and
<a HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y0CRWAz09r8#t=2m55s">
the stage looked like this</a>.
If nothing else, you can see that Bill is wearing a different shirt.
</p>
<p>
So yes, it's a bunch of people dancing like dorks,
but it wasn't the Windows 95 launch.
My guess is that it was some sort of sales event.
</p>
<p>
One of my friends remarked,
"Sure, the dancing is horrible,
but I don't think the dabbing generation is
in any position to criticize another person's dancing."
</p>
<p>
Windows 95 released to manufacturing on August 24, 1995.
</p>
<p>
We'll return to the Alpha AXP tomorrow.</p>

		<p>I was like &#8220;where&#8217;s part 14 of the AXP series?&#8221;, until I realized that today is August 24th. Happy birthday!</p>
<p>Yes, time flies. But Windows 95 looks surprisingly modern for a piece of software that is 22 years old. Most of the elements introduced in &#8217;95 (the Start button/menu, Explorer-like file manager, control panel, notification [&#8220;tray&#8221;] area&#8230;) are still in use today. Give it to a teenager born ten years after its launch, and they will get up to speed in no time. Then, try the same with Windows 3.x, OS/2&#8217;s Workplace Shell or &#8220;classic&#8221; X-Windows (the versions before the introduction of the &#8220;system bar&#8221;), and see the kid struggle to open a document.</p>

		<p>I would criticize Bill&#8217;s dancing, but I am a far worse dancer.  I worked as a musician for 15 years to pay my way through school and a bunch of other stuff.  When you are the one on stage all the time, you never quite learn how to dance.  Even my youngest granddaughter (3 years old) laughs at the way I dance.</p>

		<p>The top left corner of the video is watermarked with the logo of &#8220;Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen&#8221; (ZDF), one of the state owned television channels/broadcasters in Germany. Since they don&#8217;t broadcast sales events (there are strict regulations on advertisements on state owned television channels), I guess that this is a clip shown as flashback as part of a news segment (which would explain why the video is cut so short).<br />
Interestingly, the logo visible in the video was introduced in 2001 (<a href="https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZDF#Senderlogos" rel="nofollow">https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZDF#Senderlogos</a>), ~6 years after the Windows 95 launch.<br />
Therefore, I would assume something noteworthy happened at that event, though I have no idea what.</p>

		<p>What I don&#8217;t understand is that in a company with so many technically literate employees, that someone there doesn&#8217;t have the entire event in high definition &amp; distribute it yearly.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
