<p>
I sort of forgot to celebrate CLR Week last year,
so let's say that CLR week is "on hiatus" until next year.
To fill the summertime time slot,
I'm going to burn off a busted pilot:
This week is Batch File Week 2012.
Remember, nobody actually <i>enjoys</i>
batch programming.
It's just something you have to put up with
in order to get something done.
Batch programming is the COBOL of Windows.
(Who knows, if people actually like Batch File Week [fat chance],
maybe it'll come back as a regular series.)
</p>
<p>
We'll open Batch File Week with a simple puzzle.
</p>
<p>
A customer reported that after running their batch file,
almost no commands worked any more!
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; awesomebatchfile.bat
... awesome batch file does its work ...

C:\&gt; reg query "HKLM\Software\Clients\Mail" /ve
'reg' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
</pre>
<p>
<i>Wha? Maybe I can run regedit.</i>
</p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; regedit
'regedit' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
</pre>
<p>
<i>OMG OMG OMG OMG.</i></p>
<pre>
C:\&gt; notepad
'notepad' is not recognized as an internal or external command,
operable program or batch file.
</pre>
<p>
Okay, first, sit down and take a deep breath.
Maybe take a
<a HREF="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B004VBIDD0/?tag=tholneth-20">Chill Pill</a>.
</p>
<p>
My first question was 
"Does <code>awesomebatchfile.bat</code> modify the
<code>PATH</code> variable?"
(This was, strictly speaking, a psychic debugging question,
but a rather obvious one.)
</p>
<p>
The customer replied,
"Nope.
Here,
I'll send you the whole thing."
</p>
<p>
And there it was, right there at the top of
<code>awesomebatchfile.bat</code>:
</p>
<pre>
<b>set path=C:\awesomedir</b>
if NOT "%1"=="" set path=%1
cd /d %path%
echo Awesomeness commencing in the %path% directory!
...
</pre>
<p>
The customer figured it would be convenient to have a
variable called <code>path</code>,
unaware that this variable has special meaning to the
command interpreter.
The customer didn't make the connection that their
seemingly private variable called <code>path</code>
was connected to the system variable of the same name
(but by convention capitalized as <code>PATH</code>).</p>

		<p>Here&#39;s a fun puzzle. I once had an installer &quot;kill&quot; my %PATH% as set in the registry. When I tried to run commands that are found in, say, %systemroot%, it didn&#39;t work. Here&#39;s a partial command prompt transcript:</p>
<p>C:&gt;ftp</p>
<p>&#39;ftp&#39; is not recognized as an internal or external command, operable program or batch file.</p>
<p>C:&gt;c:windowssystem32ftp</p>
<p>ftp&gt; (bye)</p>
<p>C:&gt;echo %path%</p>
<p>(the program I just installed that added itself to the path);%SystemRoot%system32;%SystemRoot%;%SystemRoot%System32Wbem;&#8230;</p>
<p>C:&gt;echo %systemroot%</p>
<p>C:Windows</p>

		<p>In Unix, environment variables only apply to a particular process and potentially its children if the variable is exported. As such, you can&#39;t run a shell script that modifies PATH, or any other variable, in the shell that launched the script. Why does Windows allow for modification of variables in this way? It seems a bit dangerous.</p>

		<p>I think the remedy to this may be prefixing batch variables with _, just for the sake of not colliding with anything.</p>

		<p>J: This feature is suppored but as Raymond says it&#39;s opt-in for legacy compatibility reasons.</p>
<p>You use the &quot;setlocal&quot; command to preserve environment variables so they will be restored on batch file exit.</p>
<p>&quot;setlocal enableextensions&quot; is what I use.</p>
<p>Also when I made a batch file for the first time since MSDOS I discovered parenthesis can be used for command grouping with FOR and IF commands, which makes me happy.</p>
<p>Evan: Adding it to the registry is apparently the proper thing to do: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms682653(v=vs.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/ms682653(v=vs.85).aspx</a></p>
<p>But you have to remember to broadcast the WM message! &nbsp;I made a program that does it the &quot;right way&quot; and it works just great.</p>
<p>Lots of legacy installers expected you to drop whatever you were doing and restart the PC after the install (thankfully not too many do that unnecessarily nowadays) so the devs of whatever program that was probably didn&#39;t notice it or thought it was an MS bug or something dumb like that.</p>

		<p>@The MAZZTer:</p>
<p>Adding it there is the right thing to do, but they did it wrong.</p>
<p>[ANSWER] The type of the PATH environment variable in the registry is normally REG_EXPAND_SZ, so that the %systemroot% and such entries get expanded properly when the value of PATH is fetched. However, the installer replaced the key (value? subkey? I forget my terminology) with one just of type REG_SZ. The PATH isn&#39;t expanded further apparently, which meant that it was actually looking in &quot;%systemroot%system32&quot; for software.</p>

		<p>The MAZZTer, You will be happy with the parenthesis being used for grouping until you see what happens when you try to manipulate files/paths with parenthesis in them.</p>
<p>if something (</p>
<p>set path=%path%;newfolder</p>
<p>)</p>
<p>this has issues if the path has a &#39;program files (x86)&#39; in the original path somewhere.</p>

		<p>Really Maurits? You prefer Perl over PowerShell? Have you gone insane? ;)</p>
<p>If it were Python I could perhaps somewhat understand, but for typical shell scripting tasks (the kind of thing that you would normally do in batch files or bash scripts in Unix) it&#39;s pretty hard to beat PowerShell. For anyone here who has never used PowerShell, I strongly recommend checking it out. :)</p>

		<p>@Sven Groot. I think MS is the one who&#39;s gone insane. Killing SFU because [it is failing in the market because] Cygwin is roundly trouncing them &#8212; ok. Making the environment increasingly hostile to Cygwin with every Windows version &#8212; not ok because SFU is dead.</p>

		<p>Well, to be fair, they were modifying %path%, not %PATH%. Not everyone knows Windows is not case-sensitive. Someone coming from Unix could easily make that mistake.</p>
<p>The same with sourcing versus calling (&quot;source&quot; or &quot;.&quot; versus nothing on Unix, and nothing versus &quot;CALL&quot; on Windows). The default is the opposite of what you would get on Unix (when called without anything special, Unix defaults to spawning a subshell, while Windows defaults to sourcing the script), and the Windows default is confusing (the effects are different if the command you are running comes from an executable or a batch file).</p>
<p>A question for the Windows people: is there a better interpreter installed by default on all current Windows versions (that is, XP and above)? I believe you get some Visual Basic thing by default on the older versions, and perhaps there is some PowerShell thing by default on newer versions, but is there anything people can count on being installed by default for *any* current and future supported Windows version (except the most minimal installs of Windows Server, where everything missing unless explicitly installed is expected)?</p>

		<p>&lt;&#8211; would love a Batch File Week</p>
<p>I infer that the awesome batch file did not itself call anything but native commands and things that lived in c:awesomedir</p>
<p>@cesar: the hierarchy of script languages installed by default for &quot;any&quot; current and future supported Windows version (though &quot;any&quot; is a strong word) is:</p>
<p>* Batch files</p>
<p>* WScript (cscript.exe or wscript.exe)</p>
<p>* PowerShell</p>
<p>* Anything you&#39;re willing to install yourself (for me it&#39;s Perl)</p>

		<p>@Sven &#8211; I&#39;d like to move to PowerShell, but 4NT is just so much more powerful for me&#8230;</p>

		<p>I like the idea of a Batch File Week. Many of us write (and sometimes enjoy doing so!) batch files and even small commands or wrappers to ease and automate our work. Learning little tricks may be useful, and is surely fun.</p>
<p>About the PowerShell, on the paper it looks awesome. But IMHO, when you try to actually use it as your command line interpreter, it falls apart. That&#39;s because it negates the main virtue of traditional shell scripts: its simplicity. For more complex things, many of us are programmers and can write external tools in C/C#/VB/whatever. Or at least, we can google for an already made one: there are tons of them.</p>

<p>That would be a feature which restored your computer to an inconsistent state (because programs you installed likely didn&#39;t expect their additions to %path% to get wiped out)</p>

		<p>@Matt, system paths reset to defaults is better than some installed program paths broken. Programs can always use app paths.</p>

		<p>@xpclient: FYI, GlassFish (JSP Application server from Oracle) uses &quot;path&quot; in multiple folders. Try debugging startup problem on that one.</p>

<p>Changing the path variable for programs that set it will cause them to break. It&#39;s better to reinstall them from a clean state. Thankfully Windows8 comes with a &quot;wipe all of my settings and programs&quot; so this problem will be fixable by your grandma who doesn&#39;t know what a path variable is.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
