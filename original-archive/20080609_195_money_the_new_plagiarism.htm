<p>It appears that the country of Burundi <a href="http://www.pdnonline.com/pdn/newswire/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1002425159"> used a freelance photographer's image on their currency without permission</a>. (If the article goes down, <a href="http://www.boingboing.net/2006/07/06/photographer_sues_af.html"> BoingBoing saved a side-by-side comparison</a> for your inspection.) The article adds that</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Fajack says he's talked about his case with several lawyers, editors and people experienced in photography and none of them has heard of any other infringement cases involving currency. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I guess nobody remembered that the initial design for the Euro <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/slideshow/money_talks/slide2.stm"> included images</a> taken from the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0760312346?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tholneth-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0760312346"> <i>Bridges: Three Thousand Years of Defying Nature</i></a>. </p>
<p> The theory must have been that there's no room for footnotes on a banknote. (Though the Bank of England found room for <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/publications/news/2000/093.htm"> a copyright notice</a>.) </p>
<p> (On a tangential note, <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6358691"> Kazakhstan misspelled the word "bank" on their notes</a>.) </p>

		<p>As far as I know, it was not the word “bank”, but the word “Kazakhstan” itself. The inscription “Қазақстан Ұлттық Банкi” (Qazaqstan Ulttıq Banki, The National Bank of Kazakhstan) had a typo: the second “қ” (“q”) in “Qazaqstan” lacked a descender and was rendered as “к” (“q”). This makes a significant change to the pronunciation.</p>

<p>Yup. &nbsp;I think of this everytime I see some foolish job candidate leave the accents off of &quot;r&#233;sum&#233;&quot; (so I&#8217;m looking at their &quot;/rɪˈzum/&quot;)</p>

		<p>The one thing that gets me about the US and its money is that they keep releasing all these new banknotes with the anti-counterfeiting stuff in them but it doesn&#8217;t matter because the counterfeiters will just counterfeit the old notes (of which a large enough number remain to no be suspicious)</p>

		<p>Merus: Singapore also copied the plastic money concept from Australia &#8211; quite neat.</p>
<p>In the center it&#8217;s transparent, and there&#8217;s a hologram there. Given how hard it is to forge a polymer note, it&#8217;s a wonder why more countries don&#8217;t use it on their larger denominations. They&#8217;re also more durable (they can be washed safely).</p>
<p>As for the uncopyable notes &#8211; I&#8217;m told it&#8217;s a binary blob of code that looks for a peculiar pattern of 5 dots in yellow &#8211; one in the center plus 4 dots orbiting it &#8211; paired up. But that&#8217;s all I know about the technology of detecting banknotes. Supposedly if you look carefully, they all have &#8217;em.</p>

		<p>Israel also recently issued plastic notes. They&#8217;re laundry-machine proof and untearable by hand (You could probably cutwith scissors). Oddly, they only did that with the lowest-value ones &#8211; 20 NIS (~$6US).</p>
<p>The media &#8211; all of them &#8211; reported these notes as &#8216;made from a special material called &quot;Polymer&quot;&#8217;. Which is quite a strange thing to say &#8211; kind of like &quot;purely made of molecules!&quot;</p>

		<p>Apparently there was a Russian counterfeiting operation that was foiled because they misspelled &quot;Russia&quot; on their fake Rubles. Quite the opposite effect as here, but still funny (&quot;dumb criminal&quot; is the *original* &quot;dumb government&quot; for punchlines, and moreso now that they tend to behave about the same as each other).</p>
<p>I was quite sure that &#8211; in the US at least &#8211; currency could not be copyrighted because Copyright was intended to cover only what nothing else did, and there is clearly a Treasury law to cover money already. Not that I can find that ruling now… maybe I was thinking of something else.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d love to see what happens in, say, Europe if they decide to change the money slightly and the original designer sues for breach of Moral Rights. I think we&#8217;ll find out then what the true status of Copyright on money is (Moral Rights cannot be waived or assigned and do not expire, so there&#8217;s no question that it could be an issue unless a specific piece of legislation excepts it or the subject is not Copyrightable). Won&#8217;t happen in the US, though &#8211; although agreed to per convention, there&#8217;s no implementation of Moral Rights in law except for selected video works.</p>

		<p>&gt;Steve Loughran:</p>
<p>UK/EU notes have a (c) notice to eliminate the &#8216;nobody told me I couldn&#8217;t copy it&#8217; defence. EU notes also have a funny speckled yellow pattern on it that photocopiers and color printers recognise and change the colour balance slightly on. They care a lot about people copying their artwork.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t really have much to do with artwork, the ECB has rules that *allow* copying of banknotes, including the copying of individual design elements, even for commercial gain.</p>
<p>(See pdf linked here: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.ecb.int/bc/reproduction/html/index.en.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.ecb.int/bc/reproduction/html/index.en.html</a> )</p>
<p>What they do care about, however, is preventing the use of forged currency (which is why the general principle is &quot;Reproductions complying with [&#8230; criteria &#8230;] shall</p>
<p>be deemed lawful since there is no risk that the general public</p>
<p>might mistake them for genuine euro banknotes.&quot;</p>
<p>They use copyright as a tool to do this, but the intent is to prevent crime, not protect artwork.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
