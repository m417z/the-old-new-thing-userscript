<p>At Microsoft, the <i>take-away</i> is the essential message of a presentation or the conclusion that you are expected to draw from a situation. It is something you are expected to remember when the whole thing is over, a piece of information you <i>take away with you</i> as you leave the room.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>XYZ demo take away</b> (title of a document) </p>
</blockquote>
<p> The preferred intensifier is <i>key</i>, and you probably see it attached to the phrase <i>take-away</i> more often than not. This example comes from a presentation on the results of a user study: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>Results: XYZ Tough to Use</b> </p>
<ul>
<li>... </li>
<li>Key take-away:     
<ul>
<li>Migration to XYZ will be difficult     </li>
<li>Need to show value of using the power of DEF     </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p> In fact, every single slide in this presentation had a bullet point at the bottom called <i>Key take-away</i>. (And, as you may have noticed, the heading is the singular <i>take-away</i> even though multiple take-aways were listed.) </p>
<p> Another use of the term <i>take-away</i> follows in the same spirit as the "essential message" usage, but the idea of "taking away" is taken literally: A <i>take-away</i> is a small information card that sales and marketing people give to potential customers. Think of it as the business card for a service rather than for a person. </p>

		<p>This is one of those bits of microspeak that gets to me. About the only thing more annoying would be using &quot;announce&quot; instead of &quot;announcement&quot; (as in the recent &quot;Windows Phone 7 Announce&quot; stupidity) and &quot;ask&quot; instead of &quot;request&quot;. Is it really that hard to stop trying to shoehorn verbs into nouns here?</p>

		<p>Flagging up what the &quot;key take-away&quot; from your presentation is is just an admission that your presentation skills lack the clarity for the audience to figure out the most relevant information on their own. </p>
<p>I&#39;ve seen a similar thing where a presentation ends with a slide captioned &#39;call-to-action&#39;. These presenters have been told that a good, persuasive presentation ends with a call to action for the participants. They haven&#39;t realised that a good call-to-action at the end of a persuasive presentation doesn&#39;t need to be labelled as such.</p>

		<p>I think this language has escaped Microsoft and become &quot;business speak&quot; rather than Microspeak. Either that or every place I&#39;ve worked recently (and that&#39;s a lot as a consultant) is full of ex-Microsoft people.</p>
<p>I&#39;ll admit to using it occasionally. Sometimes no matter what you do there&#39;s execs in the room who just can&#39;t figure out what parts of the presentation are important. Not entirely their fault, as it was written for technical audience and they invited themselves.</p>

		<p>So, if every take-away is a key take-away, doesn&#39;t that make the &#39;key&#39; part redundant?</p>
<p>What happens if there&#39;s a take-away so crucially important, that&#39;s it&#39;s even more important than the regular key take-aways? A key-key take-away? Key^2? :P</p>

		<p>&quot;So, if every take-away is a key take-away, doesn&#39;t that make the &#39;key&#39; part redundant?&quot;</p>
<p>yes, it’s the same logic as making all tasks have a critical priority. when you define all take-aways as having the same importance there is no room for a more import one.</p>

		<p>The conference organizers probably require a &quot;call to action&quot; slide because they&#39;re used to presenters who can&#39;t make their presentations clear.</p>
<p>And when you think about it, most good technical presentations are done by people who know stuff, and not necessarily by people who&#39;s primary job skill is &quot;teaching stuff to other people&quot;. This means the information can be accurate, but not necessarily presented perfectly. This is usually better than a brilliant and memorable presentation of inaccurate information.</p>
<p>If you care about the information, then you may need to make some effort in order to learn, and not just have everything spoon-fed to you.</p>

		<p>As somebody who rarely has time for complete presentations, I prefer to just read the slides. That means I want all pertinent information available in the slideshow. And for reference, I want to be able to skip right to the end and see slides with the &quot;call to action&quot; or &quot;key take-aways&quot; and a table of URLs.</p>
<p>I hate having to filter through an hour of presentation just to figure out what the two new APIs are, or whatever. Saying that a &quot;call to action&quot; slide is unnecessary in a good presentation is like saying that an abstract is unnecessary in a well-written paper. I consider both to be valuable reference material.</p>

		<p>&quot;Key take-away&quot; sounds like a tool of parental discipline. I can remember it being inflicted on an acquaintance for a bad grade in 10th-grade trigonometry, and have used it myself.</p>
<p>The key take-away will last until your grades improve, young man!</p>

		<p>@APardoe</p>
<p>It&#39;s rather ironic that you follow &quot;Don&#39;t start complaining now just because people in the past few hundred years have decided that &#39;ask&#39; should only be a verb.&quot; by &quot;I hate when people claim that English should be a static language.&quot;</p>
<p>Abiding by a centuries old definition of a word is what makes a language static. &nbsp;Dynamic languages lose usages just as often as they gain them. &nbsp;Sure, they can revert too, but there&#39;s also nothing wrong with criticizing forced language for the sake of sounding &#39;businessy&#39; either :)</p>

		<p>@none: You&#39;re correct, I did not disambiguate between two distinct points. My first assertion is that Tim&#39;s specific example does not support his argument. My second assertion is that I generally dislike arguments of this sort, favoring a dynamic language.</p>
<p>First assertion: Tim implies that &quot;ask&quot; is a verb being shoehorned into a noun, and suggests that we use another verb, &quot;request&quot;, in its place. I assert that, based on historical evidence from the OED, no shoehorning is taking place. In fact &quot;ask&quot; as a noun has a grand old tradition.</p>
<p>Second assertion: I dislike complaints that the language is evolving (or, in the case of &quot;ask&quot;, reverting a few hundred years.) I believe that it&#39;s futile to attempt to strictly codify spoken languages over long periods of time. I&#39;ll stop before I start unfairly criticizing the French :)</p>

Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
