<p> Yesterday were held the primary elections in the state of Washington. Most of the partisan positions were uncontested, so there wasn't much to research. The one with the most candidates was for one of the state's Senate seats, and among those candidates were some who might be considered "a bit unorthodox". </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>     <a href="http://vote.wa.gov/Elections/VotersGuide/Statement.aspx?c=9ba97701-3a27-4582-a3fc-42f1d7315287">     Michael Goodspaceguy Nelson</a>.     Since election law requires that candidates file under their legal     names, Mr.&nbsp;Nelson's middle name must really be     Goodspaceguy.     (I will assume that he was not born with that name.)     Mr.&nbsp;Nelson's position appears to be that we should     focus our efforts on constructing orbital space colonies     around the earth, the moon, and Mars.     In     his statement,     he bemoans the lack of progress made along these lines:     </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>     Unfortunately, much of our space money has been wasted.     It is as if our leaders have not been educated in orbital     space colonization.     The waste and destruction of taxpayers space property     show a lack of understanding of space colonization.     </p>
</blockquote>
<p>     Mr.&nbsp;Nelson has not one but two blogs.     I'm not sure what the difference is, but you can     check them out yourself.     <a href="http://colonizespace.blogspot.com/">Blog the first</a>.     <a href="http://colonizeorbitalspace.blogspot.com/">Blog the second</a>.     </p>

<p>     <a href="http://vote.wa.gov/Elections/VotersGuide/Statement.aspx?c=9e956a6b-8eac-45b1-91f6-e866f9bdf55a">     Mike The Mover</a>.     Mr.&nbsp;Mover's position statement is incoherent,     but that's okay, because there's a method to his madness.     You see, Mr.&nbsp;Mover pays     the $1360 filing fee so that he can get     his face and name in front of every registered voter in the state.     The result of this name recognition is     <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2002027646_mover06m.html">     about $150,000 in extra business for his moving company</a>.     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>     <a href="http://vote.wa.gov/Elections/VotersGuide/Statement.aspx?c=7fc4ea7c-688e-4831-8568-99acee663e45">     William Edward Chovil</a>.     Mr.&nbsp;Chovil looks like the cranky old man who lives down the     street, and his statement does nothing to dispel this perception.     His fixation on communism     (oops, sorry, Communism with a capital&nbsp;C)     and the New World Order conspiracy     seems quaintly out of place in today's political climate.     Sort of a throwback to the Cold War years.     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>     <a href="http://vote.wa.gov/Elections/VotersGuide/Statement.aspx?c=aad03c8d-9da0-4ed8-bd31-879aee460915">     Gordon Allen Pross</a>.     Mr.&nbsp;Pross's statement reads like one of those convoluted     math problems you got in school, but with an added obsession     with "red headed Lincoln pennies" and Congress apparently     legislating pennies to people.     I think.     His argument is hard to follow,     but when he starts doing percentages, that's when he loses me completely.     </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>     USA splits the one Taxed Lincoln cent equally three ways Federal,     State and Local Governments receive a third,     33.3% times 3 equals 99.99%.     With 00.01% left over for campaign finance reform.     </p>
</blockquote>
<p>     It's so simple it just might work:     Funding the government through rounding errors.     </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p> None of these candidates appears to have won their respective election, so we won't be seeing much more of them this election season. But that's okay. All four of these candidates are "regulars" on the ballot, so they'll almost certainly be back in two years if not sooner. </p>

		<p>Mike The Mover legally changed his name to make this advertising stunt work. Dunno about Goodspaceguy.</p>

		<p>Look on the bright side&#8211;I lived in Clackamas Oregon for several years before migrating to Washington, and we had the lovely task of dealing with a gentleman who used to sponsor a TON of initiatives&#8211;many being aimed (this is all my own personal opinion)in my own personal opinion) at education/educators, and literally trying to erode what little control schools/teachers had left&#8230;</p>

		<p>Vote for Gordon Allen Pross/Alex Chiu! Together their writing style and grasp of logic and science will save America. As Pross says, &quot;Mind mass and social control, it worked then and it continues to work today.&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
