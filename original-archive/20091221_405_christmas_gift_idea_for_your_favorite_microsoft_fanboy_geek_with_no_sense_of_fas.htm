<p> Perhaps you are so enamored of the Microsoft-branded <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/03/27/LVTI16LG23.DTL"> Snuggie</a> you received <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/94695345@N00/3907945004/"> at the Company Meeting</a> that you can't keep your excitement to yourself and want to share the joy with a friend. No problem. You can now pick one up at the Microsoft Company Store in Redmond, right across the hall from the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/about/companyinformation/visitorcenter/default.aspx"> Visitor Center</a>.

<p>Fashion is like religion, it requires a suspension of reason.</p>

		<p>Not redundant &#8212; fashion and taste are almost opposites, in some ways. Fashion is collective; taste is personal. Fashion is ephemeral; taste is timeless. Etc.</p>

		<p>Nemo: He ment redundant in that Microsoft fanboy geeks never have a sense of fashion OR taste&#8230;</p>

		<p>Huh, when I was down at Microsoft a month ago (about a week prior to US Thanksgiving), the Visitor Center was a dark and foreboding place. This, despite the fact that there was the Microsoft New Employee Orientation taking place at the same time. At least I now know what it looks like when it&#8217;s all lit up.</p>
<p>(I will say, though, the MS Company Store folks know how to get people through the line. The line was nearly to where the MS controlled products were &#8211; you need a pass and had a limit to how much you can buy. Despite that, we got through the line within about 8 minutes.)</p>
<p>I wonder what the online link to the Snuggie is (you can browse the store online, and US/Canadian MS employees can buy from there).</p>

		<p>So the guys that received a Snuggie are now selling them at the store?</p>

		<p>Oh dear :).</p>
<p>Technically that&#8217;s not the best way to keep warm &#8211; &nbsp;a pair of decent trousers and a tight fitting top is more effective than this, which is more akin to a big coat or cloak than anything else.</p>
<p>A thick coat, pair of nice trousers and a stylish hat would look much better and be just as effective.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
