<p>The food known in Mandarin Chinese as <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Youtiao"> &#27833;&#26781; (y&oacute;uti&aacute;o)</a>, but which in Taiwanese goes by the name &#27833;&#28856;&#31935;, is basically a fried stick of dough, similar to a cruller, but puffier rather than cakey. The traditional way of eating it is to wrap it inside a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shaobing"> &#29138;&#39173;</a> (a sesame-coated flatbread), and dip the entire combination into a bowl of hot soy milk. I prefer salty soy milk, but some people prefer sweet. (Those people who prefer the sweet version are clearly wrong.)</p>
<p> Obviously, the <i>donut sandwich</i> was invented before the low-carb diet craze. </p>
<p> <b>Sidebar</b>: Salty soy milk (&#40569;&#35910;&#28479;) is one of those nostalgia breakfasts for me, or more accurately, one of those manufactured nostalgia breakfasts, because I didn't actually eat it that much as a child. </p>
<p> <b>Sidebar&nbsp;2</b>: For authentic Chinese food in Seattle, my choice is <a href="http://www.chiangsgourmet.com/"> Chiang's Gourmet</a>. They have an extensive menu of standard Chinese breakfast foods. The service is surly, but that somehow just adds to the experience. </p>

		<p>Falafel wraps starchy stuff around starchy stuff as well. as well as &#8216;ÁÖéÈ•ºÊûúÂ≠ê&#8217; and some dim sum which is thin rice flour cake wrap around &#8216;Ê≤πÊù°&#8217;. I think people just cant afford meat at that time.</p>

		<p>And for authentic totally-unauthentic Chinese food, I recommend Chen&#8217;s Village on Elliot Ave W, about a half mile north of the P.I. building. &nbsp;It looks like the seediest place on earth from the outside, but it&#8217;s perfectly fine inside. &nbsp;I&#8217;d link to their site but it&#8217;s just an Under Construction page.</p>

		<p>Leave it to the Mexicans to think of wrapping a tamal inside a torta (salty bakery bread high, 100% carbs, just in case you didn&#8217;t get enough with the tamal alone).</p>

		<p>Interesting menu, definitely some items that don&#8217;t appeal to my distinctly American palette.</p>
<p>‰∫îÊõ¥Ëá≠Ë±ÜËÖê &nbsp;Pig Intestine, Bloodcake, Sour Vegetable, Odor Tofu w/Hot Sauce In Hot Pot</p>
<p>Some made me laugh.</p>
<p>Áï∂Ê≠∏ÁæäËÇâ &nbsp;Lamb &amp; Herb In The Soup</p>
<p>And some made me wonder if something got lost in translation,</p>
<p>Ëí∏Ëá≠Ë±ÜËÖê &nbsp;Steamed Tofu Of Strong Odor</p>

		<p>The typical translation for &quot;Ëá≠Ë±ÜËÖê&quot; is &quot;stinky tofu,&quot; but perhaps they chose &quot;tofu of strong odor&quot; and &quot;odor tofu&quot; to be more subtle.</p>

		<p>I think the 401 has been fixed.</p>
<p>Y&#243;uti&#225;o is commonly chopped into small little pieces and put into hot rice porridge. In South East Asia, porridge is actually a tasty dish, enhanced with soya sauce, meat/fish, an occasional egg, pepper, and if you want, fried shallots.</p>
<p>Stinky tofu is really fermented tofu, and is definitely an acquired taste. Think of it as the Chinese equivalent of lutefisk, or blue cheese.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve never been able to stand Ëí∏Ëá≠Ë±ÜËÖê, even though my wife is constantly trying to get me to eat it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like taking out all the good parts of Á¥çË±Ü, and leaving only the stench.</p>
<p>By the way, has anyone else ever felt it odd that &#8216;Packed beans&#8217; is Ë±ÜËÖê, while &#8216;Rotten Beans&#8217; is Á¥çË±Ü?</p>
<p>Makes you wonder where things got mixed up along the way&#8230;</p>

		<p>Chiangs also has a secret &#8216;green&#8217; vegetarian menu which is nice. Raymond if you haven&#8217;t been already, NW Tofu in the CD also serves tasty authentic chinese goodies.</p>

		<p>I love this&#8230;</p>
<p>Though, I prefer to eat it without the wrap, and not dipped. The sweet version is made for eating plain, but the normal one I eat plain &#8211; nicely oily, of course.</p>
<p>The dried hard stuff is for congee. Mmmm.</p>
<p>(I had to look at the link to figure out it was what I thought it was. Mostly because of the English corruption of the Cantonese is how I know it. I only ate the wrapped version a couple of years ago.)</p>

		<p>This method of eating isn&#8217;t Taiwanese. The Mainlanders have been eating this way for a super long time.</p>

		<p>I think Ëá≠Ë±ÜËÖê should be some kind of &#8216;fermented tofu&#8217;. people also call ‚ÄòËá≠ËÖê‰π≥‚Äô ‚ÄòËá≠Ë±ÜËÖê‚Äôin some places. that restaurant&#8217;s menu looks rather &#8216;taiwanese chinese food authentic&#8217; rather than &#8216;mainland chinese food authentic&#8217; to me.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve been to Chiang&#8217;s a number of times &#8212; it&#8217;s about 2 miles from my house. &nbsp;And while I wouldn&#8217;t say the service is overly super-nice, they do just fine. &nbsp;We have a young son (been there with him from ages 2.5 to 3.5), and man, the staff have put up with a fair amount of obnoxiousness from my kid, all with an understanding &quot;yeah, we&#8217;ve had kids, too&quot; air. &nbsp;So the service suits me just fine.</p>
<p>And yeah, the food is pretty dang good.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d only recommand wrapping Ê≤πÁÇ∏Á≤ø with ËÖ∏Á≤â (steammed sheet of rice extract). Best to eat with sweat soy sauce.</p>
<p>Together with white-pepper flavoured minced beef congee, my favourite breakfast is now completed. :)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
