<p>The WM_GETDLCODE message lets you influence the behavior of the dialog manager. <a _href="http://blogs.gotdotnet.com/raymondc/PermaLink.aspx/23f39254-c056-4688-ac7e-18b030d54b05" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/11/14/55678.aspx"> A previous entry on using WM_GETDLGCODE</a> described the <code>DLGC_HASSETSEL</code> flag which controls whether edit control content is auto-selected when focus changes.</p>
<p> I was going to write a bit about the other flags, but it turns out that <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/support/kb/articles/Q83/3/02.ASP"> Knowledge Base Article 83302</a> already covers this, so I'll just call out some highlights. </p>
<p> The <code>DLGC_WANTMESSAGE</code> flag is the most powerful one. It lets your control prevent the dialog manager from handling a message.  So for example if you don't want ESC to dismiss the dialog box when focus is on a particular control but rather be delivered to the control itself, handle the <code>WM_GETDLGCODE</code> message and peek at the <code>lParam</code>. If it is a press of the ESC key, then return <code>DLGC_WANTMESSAGE</code> so the message will not be handled by the dialog manager. </p>
<p> The <code>DLGC_WANTCHARS</code>, <code>DLGC_WANTTAB</code> and <code>DLGC_WANTARROWS</code> flags are just conveniences that save you the trouble of checking certain categories of messages. </p>
<p> As always, consider the consequences of overriding default behavior. Doing so generally makes your program harder to use, since it goes against what people are accustomed to seeing in other programs.  </p>

		<p>Hey Raymond, can you write an article on how to make the trackbar/scrollbars behave more like sliders. For a certain class of widgets, I don&#8217;t like the way the &quot;thumb&quot; pages down instead of going to the exact pixel position when you click on the non-thumb area of a trackbar/scrollbar. Extra bonus points if you can find a way to override that thing in windows to make the thumb jump back to its original position when your mouse cursor is a certain distance away from the scrollbar. Thanks in advance.</p>

		<p>I use the Description RSS element to provide a short summary of the article. If you are interested in the subject matter, then click through. If not, then scroll past. (I use bloglines and am frustrated by descriptions that go on for pages and pages, making it harder for me to skim. Headlines often aren&#8217;t enough to allow me to decide whether an article is worth reading or not; I need a brief summary.)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
