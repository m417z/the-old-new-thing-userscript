Some time ago,
I wrote a document that discusses the design of a new component.
In the document overview, I summarized how the component interacts
with the host.
If the host supports widgets, then the component
uses the host's widget manager.
If the host doesn't support widgets,
then there were several paragraphs that summarized
how we deal with the lack of a widget manager.
The body of the document had a similar pattern:
A short discussion of what we do if a widget manager
is available,
and a long discussion of what we do if it isn't.
</p>
<p>
A piece of feedback I got about the document was
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
Let's not over-index on the no-widget-manager scenario.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To <i>over-index</i> on an attribute means to give
that attribute too much prominence in a discussion or analysis.
In this case, a very large portion of the document overview
was dedicated to discussion of the case where the host
doesn't have a widget manager,
even though in practice that would not be the common case.
Somebody reading the document would get the false impression that
the primary purpose of the component was to compensate for the host's
lack of a widget manager!
</p>
<p>
My guess for the etymology is that it comes from database indexing.
If you incorporate <i>has-a-widget-manager</i> into too many indices,
then it makes your database look like its main purpose in life
is to keep track of which items have a widget manager.
</p>
<p>
Here's another use of <i>over-index</i> from an internal memo:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
We risk over-indexing on solving the immediate problem and
failing to build reusable components.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The non-Microspeak version of that sentence would
be something like
"We risk being so focused on solving the immediate problem
that we fail to build reusable components."
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
Note that there is another sense of the term
<i>over-index</i> that appears to be standard
marketing terminology.
From what I can gather, it means
"to be above average".
Here's an example:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
This demographic over-indexes in tech spending.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter 2</b>:
Some playing around with
<a HREF="https://www.google.com/search?q=%22over%20indexing%22&tbs=bks:1&lr=lang_en&gws_rd=ssl">
Google Ngrams</a>
suggests that the root may be in the field of economic policy.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
When inflation indexing was resumed in October 1983,
shelter-cost increases for the 15-month period
from October 1980 to December 1981 were not reflected in the updated ceiling.
The indexing freeze and the 15-month indexing gap were
intended to compensate for what was felt to be
<a HREF="https://books.google.com/books?id=I4MXAAAAMAAJ&q=%22over+indexing%22&dq=%22over+indexing%22&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjszbmevqjYAhUDS2MKHS3kDMk4ChDoAQg6MAM">
over-indexing</a> of the shelter deduction ceiling prior to 1981,
over-indexing brought about by the inclusion of homeowners' costs
in the CPI-U components that had been used to calculate adjustments
to the ceiling.
</p>
<p>
<a HREF="https://books.google.com/books?id=I4MXAAAAMAAJ">
<i>United States Code Congressional and Administrative News, Volume 2</i></a>,
1998.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
In economic policy,
a value is <i>indexed</i> to another value when it is defined to
increase at the same rate as the other value.
In the above case, the shelter deduction ceiling was supposed to be indexed
to inflation.
However, the way it was calculated was later believed to incorrect,
resulting in a situation called <i>over-indexing</i>,
where a change in the rate of inflation resulted in a outsized change
in the shelter deduction ceiling because the effect of inflation was
being double-counted.</p>

		<p>Interesting guess on the origins of this idiom.  From the title and first paragraph I got the impression that the explanation for its usage would relate to books or other form of longer writing, which usually have an index or table of content, and of which a disproportionately large piece would be devoted to the fringe topic.  I could picture a book editor giving you this same feedback under the circumstances :)</p>
<p>Cheers!</p>

		<p>Let&#8217;s just put &#8220;the no-widget-manager scenarios&#8221; on appendix. (That&#8217;s why we sometimes have Appendix longer than the main article.)</p>

		<p>ISTM the widget example merely demonstrates the fact known to most developers.  In a well-founded design much of the code and most of the intricacy is dealing with the inevitable edge and corner cases.</p>
<p>IOW, if you find lots of intricacy in your main branch logic, that&#8217;s a bad design smell.  If you find lots of intricacy in your corner cases, that just demonstrates for the umpteenth time that the world is a messy place.</p>
<p>So, as cheong00 says, if you find the corner cases overwhelming an explanatory doc, that&#8217;s a sign to split the doc.  Not to curtail the info about the necessarily messy corner cases.  Complex corner cases are the <i>last</i> place you want to gloss over the gotchas.  That&#8217;s true whether it&#8217;s a design doc, code comments, dev-level API docs, or end user how-to docs.</p>

		<p>I think the origin of &#8220;over indexing&#8221; is from polling and surveying. You &#8220;over index&#8221; a group where the sample size wasn&#8217;t large enough. For example, if the population is 20% blue-eyed, and your sample was only 10% blue-eyed you might over index the blue-eyed sample to come up with the population in general. This is similar to &#8220;over sampling&#8221; where you have a larger than population in general sample size (in this example, if your survey sample included 30% blue-eyed).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure someone who is more familiar with sampling design and surveying could give a better explanation.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
