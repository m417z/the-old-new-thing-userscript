With the introduction of junctions,
symbolic links,
and volume mount points,
it is no longer the case that a drive letter corresponds to a drive.
You can
<a HREF="https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753321.aspx">
mount multiple drives into a single drive letter</a>,
you can have
<a HREF="https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/askcore/2008/10/29/configuring-storage-using-volume-guids-in-hyper-v/">
drives with no drive letter</a>,
you can have symbolic links and junctions that graft directory
trees into each other in pecular ways,
possibly resulting in
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20041227-00/?p=36883">
infinitely recursive directory trees</a>.
</p>
<p>
You can ask the kernel to dig through the whole mess and
provide the volume root for a path.
You can then use this volume root for other volume queries.
</p>
<p>
Remember, Little Programs take shortcuts so as to focus on the
algorithm. They do little to no boundary checking.</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int _wmain(int argc, wchar_t** argv)
{
    wchar_t buffer[1024];
    if (GetVolumePathNameW(argv[1], buffer, 1024)) {
        printf("path = %ls, type = %d\n", buffer, GetDriveType(buffer));
    } else {
        printf("failed %d\n", GetLastError());
    }
    return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
The program takes the path from the command line and first asks the kernel
to identify the volume path name for the thing the path refers to.
This will navigate through all the mount points, junctions, soft links,
you name it, and tell you which volume is responsible for that path.
</p>
<p>
That volume root can then be passed to the <code>Get&shy;Drive&shy;Type</code>
function in order to identify what kind of volume it is.
</p>
<p>
More generally, you can pass the volume path
to
<code>Get&shy;Volume&shy;Information</code>
in order to obtain information about the volume.
</p>
<p>
Note that this tells you the information
as far as the volume manager is concerned,
but there are other layers of weirdness that come into play.
For example,
you may have a local virtual drive that was mounted from a VHD
stored on a network server,
or a local virtual drive that is mounted from an iSCSI drive.
These report themselves as local
even though the physical storage is remote.
Conversely, you can use the loopback adapter to connect to
the local machine (<code>\\127.0.0.1\sharename</code>),
and it will report as remote even though it is physically local.</p>

		<p>How does GetVolumePathName deal with relative paths? The docs say &#8220;If either a relative directory or a file is passed without a volume qualifier, the function returns the drive letter of the boot volume.&#8221;. My understanding of this statement is that I would get &#8220;C:\&#8221; for all relative paths. Yet in practice the function returned the correct drive letter &#8211; D:, E: &#8211; for relative paths.<br />
Is the documentation wrong?</p>
<p>I wanted to use GetVolumePathName to predict if MoveFileEx would move a file instead of copying it, but the uncertainty of the documentation turned me to look for other solutions.</p>

		<p>I would play it safe and use GetFullPathName to convert the relative path to absolute.</p>

		<p>GetFullPathName eats trailing whitespace (and who knows what else) so you might have to restore the filename if you are using lstrcmpi against a string that has not been tampered with&#8230;</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s reported on MSDN forum that USB drives, especially those has Win8 compatibility logo, will not be displayed as removable (displayed with same icon as harddisk and no &#8220;Eject&#8221; option in context menu) in Explorer.</p>
<p>Would this function be able to distinguish those drives?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ll add that those askers did not specify which system they&#8217;re on. So it&#8217;s possible that those people were having this problem in WinXP/Vista/7 instead of Win8 or later.</p>

		<p>I have a USB drive like that &#8212; I got it at the Build conference a few years ago &#8212; and GetDriveType returns DRIVE_FIXED for it. That makes sense, since it appears as a hard drive in the disk manager tool, and I presume that Explorer calls GetDriveType as part of deciding how to display the drive.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
