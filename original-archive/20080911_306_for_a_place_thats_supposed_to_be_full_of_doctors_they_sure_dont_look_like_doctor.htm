<p><a href="http://www.tvsquad.com/2008/09/04/anthony-edwards-returning-to-er/"> Anthony Edwards is returning for a guest spot on his old series <i>ER</i></a>. I don't watch <a href="http://www.nbc.com/ER/"><i>ER</i></a>, but when I happen to stumble across it, the thing that strikes me most is that for a where most of the characters are supposed to be doctors, they sure don't look like doctors. They look like models who have been forced to wear scrubs and white lab coats.</p>
<p> Except for Anthony Edwards. He actually looks like a doctor. </p>
<p> One of my cousins is a doctor, and for some reason, we were watching an episode of <i>ER</i> in which the medical student was put in charge of a patient and made a bad medical decision. My cousin's reaction: "There's no way you would leave a med student alone with a patient, much less put them in charge. And never, ever pay any attention to a med student's diagnosis. If you ask med students for a diagnosis, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/02/14/1676656.aspx"> they will tell you that the patient has whatever disease they studied last week</a>." </p>
<p> (Yes, I'm recycling a story, but I like that story, so nyeah.) </p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t believe no one&#8217;s pointed out the missing word in the story. That&#8217;s a first&#8230;</p>
<p>Usually people will jump all over it in order to feel superior over Mr Chen.</p>
<p>ER? Wow it&#8217;s still on? It must be the longest TV series of all time. I remember watching it when I was a kid.</p>

		<p>One word: Nielsen.</p>
<p>I suspect that the success of a show is directly proportional to the amount of boobies (or possibly explosions) in said show.</p>

		<p>On most shows, they&#8217;re usually models-posing-as-X, not just ER.</p>
<p>I especially love CSI for this. &nbsp;Do medical examiners about to get covered in blood and guts wear expensive light-tan suits out in the Florida heat? &nbsp;Do the field criminalists wear high heels&#8230; ON THE BEACH?</p>

		<p>I always liked his character, but had no idea ER was still going. I haven&#8217;t watched an episode for years (I&#8217;d catch it occasionally when my brother was watching, but we don&#8217;t live in the same house any more.) I&#8217;ll keep an eye out for the return, though!</p>
<p>John has a point about the proportionality there; I suppose the logical conclusion is for somebody to produce the ultimate TV show, combining the two: exploding boobies! This could, of course, turn out to be one of those cases where the combination is worth less than the individual elements&#8230;</p>

		<p>Kind of like asking a newly minted CS graduate to come up with an architecture for a software product, you&#8217;ll get whatever hotness they have read about most recently as opposed to something that might actually work.</p>

		<p>The best part of that show when it was still good was when Noah Wylie was *officially* a doctor and some guy comes to the ER in horrible shape, chaos, and he yells &quot;Someone GET A Doctor!&quot;, and the nurse grabs his wrist and says &quot;YOU are the doctor&quot;. Classic. That was back when the show was good.</p>

		<p>Andrew:</p>
<p>As opposed to the highly experienced developer, who will recommend the same thing he always recommends: his own personal specialty.</p>
<p>When the only tool you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. Then you learn that not everything is a nail. But over time, you begin to realise that everything can be /reduced/ to a /series/ of nails&#8230;</p>

		<p>The problem with professional doctors is that most of them just say you have the $mostCommonIllness which out making a real diagnosis.</p>
<p>Most time they are right, but only due to statistical reasons, not because choose what matches the symptoms best.</p>

		<p>Yeah, I thought he had been killed off, maybe it&#8217;s the old identical twin, or Dr. Corday will wake up and find him coming out of the shower and say &#8216;I just had a horrible dream where you died and then everything that happened in the E.R. started happening again every few years with different people but an identical dynamic&#8217;.</p>

		<p>Apparently, anti-youth bias is common in the medical community.</p>
<p>My boss had worked as an IT consultant on a health informatics project, and early on he had to go to meet with some doctors. In the middle of the meeting table was a chart with names and a bunch of gold stars. He asked one of the doctors what the chart was for and was told that they represented how many years of experience each of the doctors had, so they would know how valid a doctor&#8217;s opinion was.</p>

<p>This is why I read the comments here. That&#8217;s hilarious.</p>
<p>re ER: I&#8217;m always struck that they never wear their surgical masks during surgery. (I realize it&#8217;s so you can see the actors&#8217; faces.)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
