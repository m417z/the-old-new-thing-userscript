<p>I've received independent confirmations as to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/11/02/9915989.aspx"> the authorship of Notepad</a>, so I'm inclined to believe it. Sorry you didn't get to go to the award ceremony.</p>
<p> The original author of Notepad also served as the development manager for Windows&nbsp;95. His job was to herd the cats that made up the programmers who worked on Windows&nbsp;95, a job which you can imagine falls into the "not easy" category. </p>
<p> After Windows&nbsp;95, he retired from the software industry and became a high school science teacher. At a social event some years later, I met him again and asked about the transition from software development manager to high school science teacher. </p>
<p> His response: "You'd be surprised how many of the skills transfer." </p>

		<p>&quot;retired&quot; or called in rich ?</p>
<p>As in, I know more than a few CS types who made their millions/called-in-rich/got the &quot;FU&quot; money. They&#8217;d bum around doing whatever for a few years, then started teaching HS science or math as &quot;something to do&quot; that also provides nice benefits (since they didn&#8217;t need the money)</p>

		<p>For which version of Windows did he write Notepad? I&#8217;m guessing that the version that came with Windows 95 wasn&#8217;t written from scratch, but just ported to the Windows 95 API. Is this right? If so, does the current Notepad in modern Windows share it source code heritage all the way back to Windows 1.0?</p>

		<p>@Dean:</p>
<p>Slapping a &quot;File, Edit, View, Help&quot; menu doesn&#8217;t automagically deliver the functionality of the items on those menus.</p>
<p>Nor does it implement the wonderfully specific but kooky &quot;.LOG&quot; functionality that Notepad provides.</p>
<p>@Frank:</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think the person in question wrote the Windows 95 version of Notepad. &nbsp;He wrote Notepad then WENT ON to herd the Windows 95 cats. &nbsp;At least, that&#8217;s how I read it.</p>

		<p>I went from being a software developer (not manager) into teaching for a while. Lots of transference of skills that I can see. A good software manager will often made a good teacher. A poor manager will make a very poor teacher though (generally). Teaching is a lot about people management.</p>

		<p>I would always refer to my favorite HTML authoring tool as &quot;Visual Notepad 200x Professional Edition for Architects&quot; :-)</p>
<p>When I returned to MS fulltime, I was doing a index search of all the places where SetWinEventHook() was called. &nbsp;I was curious how the Active Accessibility technology I worked on in the 90&#8217;s was being used by Windows itself.</p>
<p>Sure enough, Notepad was using it to get column and line number information. &nbsp;A very simple implimentation, but it showed yet a another way MSAA could provide benefits.</p>

		<p>Heck, I used to capture escaped monkeys (true!) for a living and now I design programming languages; you&#8217;d be surprised at how many of the skills transfer.</p>
<p>A word of advice: if you&#8217;re ever in a meeting with someone who gets hostile, just pin their arms behind their back with one hand and hold their teeth away from anything you don&#8217;t want bitten while you open the cage with the other hand. Then toss them towards the cage in one smooth motion; they&#8217;ll totally go for hiding in the cage, at which point, you&#8217;ve got &#8217;em.</p>

		<p>What&#8217;s this obsession with people needing to know meaningless names of random people they&#8217;ve never heard of?</p>
<p>When Deep Throat was announced as being W. Mark Felt, you could hear the collective &quot;Who???&quot; from the US. &nbsp;The more important part is knowing what his relationship was to the Nixon administration.</p>
<p>When the masked magician finally revealed himself on TV, we found out he was Val Valentino! &nbsp;&#8230; Umm, who?</p>
<p>So yeah let me break it to you you about the Windows 95 development manager: &nbsp;You&#8217;ve never heard of him! &nbsp;Luckily Raymond actually knows how to tell a story, despite many people in the audience not knowing how to enjoy a story&#8230;</p>
<p>(And no, I&#8217;m not going to respond to any anal-retentive replies about how we care about many historical names blah blah. &nbsp;Completely missing the point, so don&#8217;t bother.)</p>

		<p>&gt;What&#8217;s this obsession with people needing to know meaningless names of random people they&#8217;ve never heard of?</p>
<p>1) It makes the story more factual.</p>
<p>2) It allows links between stories about the same people.</p>
<p>3) It allows people to exclude people they thought it might be. (IOW, they thought wrong but found that out by realizing the right meaningless name was not him.)</p>
<p>4) It allows people to believe they might see that the person one day and thank/berate him.</p>
<p>5) It allows people who do know him to know another detail.</p>
<p>Moral of the story: One person&#8217;s meaningless is another person&#8217;s treasure.</p>

		<p>Yeah, I was kind of wondering if I know the guy, since I know people who fit your description otherwise.</p>
<p>I mean, odds are it&#8217;s not one of the people I&#8217;m thinking of, but now I can&#8217;t help but be curious!</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not 6, that&#8217;s exactly why you didn&#8217;t say it (1) of the other list). Though i really wish you would ask permission. It&#8217;d be cool. You can say &#8220;I know the guy who wrote notepad!&#8221;. He can say, &#8220;I was mentioned on Raymond Chen&#8217;s blog!&#8221; YMMV.</p>
<p>I only know one guy from the 95 team, and he wasn&#8217;t a manager. He wrote file manager though, does that count? :) </p>
<p>I asked him why his name didn&#8217;t appear in the folder triple-rename easter egg, he gave some excuse. He said there was also a pictorial version (which i never found) to which he said he had his dog appear instead of himself. Claims like that make me wonder what is actually real.</p>

<p>That was evident. I just thought you could ask him anyway. In a similar situation, i might have. But you explained since you haven&#8217;t spoken to him in a while, you didn&#8217;t feel comfortable asking that. That makes sense.</p>
<p>Regardless, i&#8217;m thanking you for giving explanations. In general, you really do explain things when people ask. You may be terse, but you do explain. I appreciate that.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>I couldn&#8217;t have asked him if I wanted to. I don&#8217;t have his phone number. It&#8217;s not like we were ever friends.

		<p>OK it&#8217;s time for the big reveal: the name of the person who wrote notepad is&#8230;.</p>
<p>&#8212; Raymond Luxury-Yacht &#8212;</p>
<p>But take care if you happen to meet him in QFC or something:</p>
<p>His name is pronounced &quot;Throat-Warbler Mangrove&quot;</p>

		<p>What we have here is a failure to communicate.</p>
<p>The proper order of events is that you met him later and he mentioned how the skills transfer to being a high school teacher, and then much later (i.e. when this article was written) you found out he was the writer of notepad. Correct?</p>
<p>The faulty narrative people are reading here is that you had a conversation with him after finding out that he wrote notepad and deciding to write this blog article, wherein you asked him what the transition was like and he said what you quoted about skills transferring.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Right, the order of events is 1995: Development manager. 2000ish: Had a brief conversation with him and learned he was a teacher. November 2 2009: Posted article about not knowing who the author of Notepad was. November 4 2009: Learned who the author of Notepad was. November 17: Used this as an excuse to tell the story from 2000. (I should have opened with &#8220;<u>Since posting the story</u>, I&#8217;ve received independent confirmations as to the authorship of Notepad.&#8221; to make the timeline more clear, but to be honest, I thought the use of the present participle indicated that it was a recent development.)-Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Raymond, &quot;Random832&quot; is right. I seem to have missed the order of events. Sorry about that chief.</p>
<p>I also don&#8217;t think the guy i mentioned wrote it, because he wasn&#8217;t a manager, though reportedly he taught a computer class for a short bit in the Seattle area before coming to my city. I can&#8217;t ask him because he left town. Even if i could ask him, i suspect his stories.</p>
<p>I am curious though, if the authors of 95 did indeed have their pictures in there. And, if there&#8217;s anything like the triple-rename easter egg in other versions of Windows. But, i don&#8217;t expect you to answer this point because it is off-topic. And considering i&#8217;m just rambling now, i&#8217;ll just stop here. :)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
