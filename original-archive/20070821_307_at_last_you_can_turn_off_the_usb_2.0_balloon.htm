<p>One of the more annoying messages in Windows&nbsp;XP&sup1; is the "This USB device can perform faster" balloon that appears whenever you plug in a USB&nbsp;2.0-capable device into a USB&nbsp;1.0 port. When I click on that balooon, I get a message that says, "Sorry, you don't have any USB&nbsp;2.0 ports. You'll have to install one to be able to take full advantage of this device."&sup2;</p>
<p> Yeah, that's really nice, but one of my machines is a laptop, so its USB ports can't be upgraded. And <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/24/868546.aspx"> my desktop computer at the time</a> had an older motherboard that predated USB&nbsp;2.0. The really annoying part was that there was no way to turn off the balloon. "Yes, I know I inserted the device into a USB&nbsp;1.0 port, but this computer doesn't have any USB&nbsp;2.0 ports, so stop bugging me already." </p>
<p> It actually got the point that I went out and bought a USB&nbsp;2.0 adapter card just to shut up the stupid balloon.&sup3; </p>
<p> Thank goodness that in Windows Vista, the USB folks realized how annoying it is to show a balloon that yells at you for something you can't do anything about, and they added a way to disable the pop-up. </p>
<p> <b>Nitpicker's Corner</b> </p>
<p> &sup1;Although this statement takes the grammatical form of a statement of fact, it is actually a statement of opinion. Other people may legitimately disagree with this opinion. Whether the message is in fact "one of the more annoying messages in Windows&nbsp;XP" is irrelevant to the story; the employment of this statement of opinion is rhetorical and serves a useful storytelling purpose, namely to serve as an interesting introduction and to establish a context for elaboration. It <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/10/4315707.aspx#4327521"> does not establish the official position of Microsoft Corporation</a> regarding how annoying that message is. </p>
<p> &sup2;That is not literally what the message says, but the underlying meaning is comparable. The message text has been paraphrased for rhetorical purposes (to create a more informal tone) and for time-saving purposes (to save me the trouble of having to re-create the message and carefully transcribe the message word-for-word). </p>
<p> &sup3;Again, the use of the word "stupid" here is rhetorical, indicating my level of frustration and not attempting to establish the official Microsoft position on the intelligence of the balloon or the people responsible for it. </p>

		<p>Your blog has always been worth reading for being informative and insightful. But it&#8217;s now reached the point where it&#8217;s ALSO worth reading JUST for the Nitpicker&#8217;s Corner. Fantastic work.</p>

		<p>You can turn off all of the balloon tips in WinXP either through Group Policy or via the XP power toy TweakUI. Although this approach turns off all of the balloon tips and not just individual messages (but then that was what I was after anyway!).</p>

		<p>On WinXP there is an option &quot;Don&#8217;t show USB errors&quot; for the USB host controller in the Device Manager. This prevents the balloons (and probably more useful messages as well).</p>

		<p>Um, who would run Vista on an old machine that only has USB 1.1 ports? Virtual PC doesn&#8217;t count. :-)</p>
<p>But I agree, it is very nice to have a way to disable those kinds of &quot;helpful&quot; messages.</p>

		<p>SM, you can disable the check which triggers the &quot;unused icons on your desktop&quot; message so it should only be annoying once per Windows install (or per user, perhaps).</p>

		<p>Well, it actually is a helpful message; the problem is an oversimplified implementation. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The message should only be displayed if the following are all true:</p>
<p>1) Only if there actually are USB 2.0 ports present on the system. &nbsp;</p>
<p>2) Only if the USB device being plugged in would actually benefit from 2.0. It probably should be limited to USB Storage Class devices. Keyboards and mice need not apply.</p>
<p>3) Only twice per USB device. &nbsp;If I&#8217;ve decided to ignore the message, I don&#8217;t need to be reminded every time.</p>

		<p>I tend to feel, as a matter of personal taste, that such rhetorical devices are indeed useful and interesting. But while I may know what I like, I do not feel qualified to judge such matters without some authoritative guidance. Can I cite this as the official position of Microsoft Corporation on literary style?</p>

		<p>David: According to the linked KB article, #2 is already taken into account&#8230; so if you plug a device made for USB 1.1 in it won&#8217;t trigger the balloon (any device made for USB 2.0 though, ev en a keyboard or mouse, will. &nbsp;So #2 is sorta halfway there already).</p>

		<p>Did you ever stop to think that plugging USB 2.0 in this way will definitely help sales :). they got you with their marketing message :) they sold one just so you will not see the error anymore, you should go out and buy one for the laptop as well, I assume that it has a cardbus interface, you can get a cb&lt;-&gt;USB 2.0 connector.</p>

<p>3) Only twice per USB device. &nbsp;If I&#8217;ve decided to ignore the message, I don&#8217;t need to be reminded every time.</p>
<p>{ENDQUOTE}</p>
<p>I think 2 and 3 are valid points, however most people are not even aware that ther are multiple USB versions. So the message probably is for people who plugin their new USB device advertised as being capable of &quot;ludicrous speed&quot;</p>
<p>and then it takes 50 minutes to transfer a picture. So I think 1 should be:</p>
<ol>
<li>Only if the system is capable of being upgraded.</li>
</ol>
<p>PS: You CAN upgrade a laptop if it has PCMCIA slot(s)</p>

		<p>Now if there were only a way to make XP shut up about my network &#8211; when I connect via wifi, it pops up a baloon every 5 minutes to annoy me about examining the cert used by the connection.</p>

		<p>Nitpicking the nitpicking footnote #2 (since nitpicking the nitpicks has apparently become the latest fashion around here):</p>
<p>You can avoid requiring this footnote simply by omitting the quotation marks. Quotation marks imply that you are quoting something verbatim. If you are merely paraphrasing, then it&#8217;s gramatically correct to omit the quotation marks completely.</p>

		<p>This is fun. &nbsp;I already have to disable network update baloons that popup every time the WiFi goes in and out. &nbsp;Change the display settings so that desktop cleanup doesn&#8217;t happen every now and then, and now the USB thing. &nbsp;It sure would be nice if these things were all gathered into one place where I could check off the ones I don&#8217;t want to see anymore.</p>
<p>I wish the on topic posts outnumbered the nitpick posts.</p>

		<p>I am sorry but I have to disagree with many people commenting here, I am sick of the Nitpicker&#8217;s Corner. I read this blog because it gives a fascinating incite into Microsoft and has some excellent details on parts of Microsoft products that would otherwise not be publicly know.

		<p>Add me to the list of people who can&#8217;t wait to see the next Nitpicker&#8217;s Corner!</p>
<p>Since everyone here is being so helpful, how do you turn off the balloon that tells you something&#8217;s been sent to a network printer? I got rid of it on my old machine, but I got a new one, and of course I didn&#8217;t keep the instructions. I promise to keep them this time&#8230;</p>

		<p>Charles, you already have wetware for deleting the Nitpickers&#8217; Corner from your visual field. &nbsp;It&#8217;s accessed in the same fashion as the web ad suppressor in the visual cortex.

<p>I think the Official Position of Microsoft, if I remember correctly is that the most annoying balloon is the one that says, &quot;There are unused icons on your desktop.&quot;&lt;/i&gt;</p>

<p>Maybe people can agree to start their comments with a paragraph saying S, N or O. (Story, Nitpicking and Off-topic). Then a greasemonkey script or a proxy can cut out the irrelevant comments.</p>

		<p>The &quot;nitpicker&#8217;s corner&quot; is a fraction over 50% of the entire post. So why shouldn&#8217;t at least half the comments be discussion of the important legal disclaimer that God himself (apparantly) commanded Raymond to place here?</p>

<p>In order to make XP shut up about the certificate: If you deem the certificate valid, and you trust the source, then add it to the Trusted Publishers folder in your personal certificate store.</p>

		<p>Although Nitpicker&#8217;s Corner is getting all the love (and hate) this time, I think the real miracle of this post is being ignored: Raymond has come up with a way in which Vista is an improvement over XP! &nbsp;That&#8217;s got to be a first.</p>

		<p>So, maybe a post series about &quot;the nitpicker&#8217;s corner&quot; are in order? We could get to comment on them at the same time of being on-topic! ;)</p>
<p>anyways a cool blog both now and also a few years back when it started. seems like the win32 api (and it&#8217;s corresponding users in the form of &quot;well-intentioned&quot; applications) has soooo many things to talk about that you&#8217;ll never have time to finish it! :)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m just counting down the days until Raymond gives up this blog in a huff. &nbsp;He&#8217;s clearly going further and further in the frustration direction, which never ends well.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised though, because I thought the blog entries were pre-written months ahead of time, but the nitpicker&#8217;s corner seems to be a reaction to very recent comments or something.</p>

		<p>Scott,</p>
<p>I agree. &nbsp;It is just a matter of time before Raymond gives up his blog and just shuts it down. &nbsp;And I don&#8217;t blame him.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s sad that so many people with such raging hatred of Microsoft will take the words of a guy who is just trying to make it in this world and help us all become better developers and turn them into the official sanctioned gospel of a multi-billion dollar/multi-national corporation just so they can make some noise.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s ok. &nbsp;Microsoft may have lost many battles, but it has won the war. &nbsp;In fact, the war is long over.</p>
<p>After 10 years of hearing that linux will destroy Windows, Windows still has over 90% desktop market share.</p>
<p>Windows Server is taking over the server room.</p>
<p>SQL Server is now a very serious and very cost effective alternative to Oracle and DB2.</p>
<p>Sharepoint is the collaboration tool of choice.</p>
<p>Small Business Server is the best selling MS product ever.</p>
<p>And Office 2007 sold like hot-cakes despite all the pundits swearing up and down that Office 2000 is &quot;good enough&quot;.</p>
<p>Long Live the Empire.</p>
<p>JamesNT</p>

		<p>Why don&#8217;t we change the page format to a multi-column one so that all comments with the word &quot;Nitpicker&quot; in them are on the right hand side and all other articles are on the left (but still only one comment per &#8216;line&#8217; to keep the sequence correct)?</p>
<p>Raymond already separates the actual article (meat on top, nitpickers corner below), then all the &quot;I hate nitpickers&quot; crowd could just scan the left hand side, the rest could alternate between the two sides.</p>
<p>Those sickos that only want to read the nitpickers corner comments could just read the right-hand side.</p>
<p>That would solve a lot of problems, no? :-).</p>
<p>Note: this comment, although it contains the word &#8216;nitpicker&#8217; should not necessarily be construed as commenting on nitpickers corner.</p>
<p>Caveat: views expressed in this comment are mine and do not represent the views of my employer. &nbsp;To be honest, they wouldn&#8217;t associate with my views with a ten-foot bargepole.</p>

		<p>Tomer: Agreed. It&#8217;d be nice if the Blog team will add feature allow commenter to select a number of blog-owner defined tags to the comments. It&#8217;s useful for not only separate nitpicks and real comments here, also when the blog-owner want to host some kind of survey/vote here.</p>

		<p>i&#8217;m scared of pointing this out but the article Raymond links to about the balloons is one that i would actually considered generally &#8216;authoritive&#8217; on the reason that Microsoft implemented a certain behaviour.</p>
<p>granted it was posted around 4 years ago. life was simpler back then, i guess.</p>

		<p>Is there a way to turn off Nitpickers&#8217; Corner?</p>
<p>But seriously, nitpickers&#8217; corner is actually quite funny sometimes. It is very much a shame you actually have to have it, but at least you try to do something fun with it. It&#8217;s also a shame about the stupid footnote people. I quite liked the random characters.</p>
<p>And yeah, shouldn&#8217;t it be nitpickers&#8217; corner, being as its the corner for all the nitpickers, not just one nitpicker (and my guess is that there are indeed multiple nitpickers)? Maybe someone&#8217;s mentioned this already&#8230;</p>

<p>Unfortunately it seems to be semi brain dead. We have a computer at home with multiple users on it. Som apps put shortcuts on the desktop in some way which shares them between all the users. You can see where I&#8217;m going with this, can&#8217;t you&#8230;</p>

		<p>About balloons being less intrusive than messageboxes(1), they would be IF:</p>
<ul>
<li>they disappeared after a while</li>
<li>
<p>they did not force the task bar to stay &#8216;up&#8217; (for those people that have set it to auto-hide)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Nitpickers Corner(2) :</p>
<p>(1) I&#8217;m not saying that this is/was the intention behind ballons, I don&#8217;t know.</p>
<p>(2) sorry for hijacking Raymonds idea. I didn&#8217;t see a registered trademark behind that phrase yet, perhaps he should ;-)</p>

		<p>&#8220;When the user first attempts to access a drive display a dialog box stating the problem with a progress bar.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just don&#8217;t show the drive until it&#8217;s ready. No need for a progress bar or an alert or whatever. That&#8217;s even worse. If there is an icon for a drive the user should be able to access it. </p>
<p>Sometimes I accidentally click on the &#8216;A&#8217; drive in the save or open dialog, then I&#8217;ll have to wait until windows found out there isn&#8217;t actually a disk in there. Why show the icon at all if there is no disk in the drive ? Same goes for the CD drive.</p>
<p>What exactly does windows show when you click on &#8220;my computer&#8221; ? </p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the physical drives, because if a disk has 2 partitions both show up as separate drive letters. It also isn&#8217;t filesystems, because it shows the A drive and CD drives even though they don&#8217;t always represent an actual filesystem, e.g. when there is no disk in the drive. So what exactly is it supposed to be showing me ?</p>

		<p>The most annoying messages are about stuff that works. e.g. when you pop in a USB drive it notifies you that an USB drive was plugged in is now available. </p>
<p>This also includes *all* &#8220;new hardware detected&#8221; messages. I *know* I got a new hard drive, I just spent half an hour digging out my computer, finding a free spot for the drive, being annoyed by cables that are too short, etc. Windows really doesn&#8217;t need to tell me that. But alas, that only happens once in a while.</p>
<p>Basically: all messages that tell me something that I don&#8217;t need to respond too should go. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s little things like this that make windows so annoying to use. MS shouldn&#8217;t be looking for stuff to add to windows, but for stuff to remove.</p>

		<p>Windows cannot hide the &#8216;A&#8217; drive if it is empty. The operating system cannot see if it is. Similarly, there is no reliable way to know if there is a cd in a cdrom drive. The system gets notifications when you open and close the tray (and that doesn&#8217;t even work with all drives,) but it cannot know for sure if there&#8217;s a cd in it, because there is no stated time for the drive to become &#8216;ready&#8217;. You don&#8217;t want to be left with no way to access the disc, just because it was a bit slow to spin up.</p>
<p>And in response to &#8216;Who displays this dialog box? What window do you use for the parent? Do you kick the user out of their fullscreen game to display it? What if the program that accesses the not-yet-ready drive is a service? -Raymond&#8217;, the system already pops up a dialog for some cds and USB devices, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>

		<p>&quot;When I insert a USB mouse, I don&#8217;t need a &quot;new hardware detected&quot; display. I just want my mouse to start working.&quot;</p>
<p>It only does that the first time you insert the mouse (and maybe if you use a different USB port on a subsequent insertion.) &nbsp;The rest of the time, it just plays a sound to indicate an old device has been reconnected.</p>

		<p>&quot;I guess you prefer to poll for the drive to be ready? -Raymond&quot;</p>
<p>No, I&#8217;d prefer it to work just like my Mac. When I insert a drive an icon is added to the desktop and to the finder representing the drive. that&#8217;s it.</p>
<p>The computer should not alert me at all, it should just make the extra drive available in the explorer, so if you happen to have the &quot;my computer&quot; view open, an icon for the drive should just appear. </p>
<p>When I insert a USB mouse, I don&#8217;t need a &quot;new hardware detected&quot; display. I just want my mouse to start working. </p>
<p>It almost looks like Windows is proud something finally worked. &quot;Look at me!, I detected a mouse!. &#8230; and now, it&#8217;s actually working!&quot;</p>
<p>If I plug something in to the computer it&#8217;s *supposed* to work, it&#8217;s not some huge accomplishment that needs to be reported to the user. Only show me a message if something goes wrong, otherwise just make the new device available for use.</p>

		<p>&gt;About balloons being less intrusive than messageboxes(1), they would be IF:</p>
<p>&gt;</p>
<p>&gt;- they disappeared after a while</p>
<p>They actually do disappear after 30 seconds, but you must be using your system (moving the mouse, typing). There&#8217;s a post about this somewhere in the archives. It&#8217;s just that some people, like me and apparently you, cannot imagine ignoring them for 30 seconds.</p>
<p>In my opinion the main problem with the balloons is that they are not that intrusive, which appears to be seen as an excuse for showing far too much of them. They are most annoying when you use images to install machines:</p>
<p>Take the tour of Windows XP &#8211; Take the tour of Windows XP (it tends to reappear when you close it quickly) &#8211; Click on the start button! &#8211; Your virusscanner is out of date! &#8211; Wireless networks detected! &#8211; Windows updates available! </p>
<p>All accompanied with the cheerfully annoying *pop* sound. Perhaps the balloons should stack, like msn messenger does with its notifications, so you could close them all at once. Or have a &#8216;Disable the really stupid balloons, not the slightly useful ones&#8217; policy setting. The way it is now, it&#8217;s just like clippy, the annoying talking paperclip. At least you can safely remove that one&#8230;</p>

		<p>Dean: On a standard floppy drive, the change line (present on all floppys since the PC/AT) can be used as an indicator that media is inserted. &nbsp;It&#8217;s not 100% accurate &#8211; the media might be inserted but the drive door might be open, but it&#8217;s a reasonable approximation.</p>
<p>AFAIK, every version of DOS and Windows has read the change line indicator since MS-DOS 3.0.</p>

		<p>&gt;My Mac doesn&#8217;t seem to have a problem doing it.</p>
<p>The Mac must have something custom in their hardware because on a standard floppy drive, there is no way to know a disk has been inserted without simply trying to read it (and if there&#8217;s no disk, that&#8217;s when you get all that grinding as it tries to read a non-existant disk). Personally, I used to just always disable my disk drive, because I never used it. In fact, I don&#8217;t think any of my current computers even *have* a disk drive!</p>
<p>CD drives are different &#8212; the operating system gets notifications when the tray is opened and closed, so it could simply scan the drive every time the tray is closed to detect whether to display the icon or not. However, my guess as to why they don&#8217;t that is because you might be running a wizard or something and it asks you to &quot;insert disc 2 now&quot; but if you eject disc 1 the drive letter is going to disappear.</p>
<p>I guess you could make it so that the drive letter is still valid, but *Explorer* just hides the icon while there&#8217;s no disc in there&#8230;</p>

		<p>What annoys me about that balloon is when it pops up when I actually have the device plugged into a USB 2.0 port.</p>
<p>I blame my motherboard&#8217;s chipset manufacturer&#8217;s drivers. Grr.</p>

		<p>In a similar vein, my BlueSoleil bluetooth driver really gets to me. Every time I login I get asked to insert a bluetooth device&#178;.</p>
<p>If I want to use a bluetooth device I&#8217;ll insert it, at which point I expect the drivers to recognise it and do their job. Unless I do, I don&#8217;t expect to be harangued about my failure to insert devices.</p>
<p>Since I boot or login at work on average four times a day, and use a bluetooth device maybe twice a year, the haranging is repeated and particularly unnecessary.</p>
<p>It seems obvious the software designers haven&#8217;t even considered this.</p>

		<p>[Showing no UI at all I can accept. It&#8217;s the &#8220;Show UI in the context of some other application which did not expect UI&#8221; that I was objecting to. -Raymond]</p>
<p>Good point. &nbsp;How about if the balloon is shown only when a program attempts to access the drive before it is ready. &nbsp;The balloon would contain status information about the drive initialization.</p>
<p>I admit this doesn&#8217;t help for services, but shouldn&#8217;t services be able to work without the user having to get notifications and pass them to the service anyways?</p>

		<p>Larry: I may be wrong in my recollection, but I seem to recall that most floppy drives had to have the motor on to set the DSKCHG bit, which means you&#8217;d still have to do a read in order to detect a floppy has been inserted.</p>
<p>Wasn&#8217;t the DSKCHG bit just used so that the OS would know when to flush it&#8217;s read-cache of the disk data? That is, it wasn&#8217;t actually used to detect when a disk was *physically inserted* just that the disk has changed since the last read&#8230;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I ever did anything that low-level with floppy drives, though ;)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
