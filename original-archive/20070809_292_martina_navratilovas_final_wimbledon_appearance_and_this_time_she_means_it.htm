<p>When I was growing up, our family followed professional tennis on television, and Wimbledon was of course <strong>the</strong> tennis tournament of the year. During those years, it seemed always to boil down to Martina Navratilova against Chris Evert in the final, and the family's loyalties were split. (I sided with the old guard and pulled for Chris Evert.)</p>
<p> In <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5510881"> this NPR interview</a>, Martina Navratilova talks about her retirement (she really means it this time), looks back at the years she dominated women's tennis, how she and Chris Evert got along off the court, and how she is disappointed with the current generation of players who seem to spend more time posturing than just hitting the ball. </p>
<p> Although I wasn't a big fan of hers during those years long ago, I've since come around and greatly admire not just Navratilova's accomplishments, but even more her sportsmanship and grace in what has become an increasingly antagonistic sport. So here's a salute to arguably the greatest female tennis player of all time. </p>

		<p>Thanks, I&#8217;m aligned with your appraisal. &nbsp;My ex-wife is a big tennis fan and I learned to appreciate the game through her, though I&#8217;ve never played. &nbsp;She favored Chris Evert, but I though Martina was something special. &nbsp;We got to see each of them (and Jimmy Connors) play various opponents at one U.S. Open.</p>

		<p>Clive James is also a big fan of Martina, and John McEnroe.</p>

		<p>Not many players have *the complete boxed set* of Grand Slam wins (singles, doubles and mixed doubles at Aus. Open, Roland Garros, Wimbledon, US Open)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d wait for DNA evidence before proclaiming Navratilova the best *female* tennis player of all time ;)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
