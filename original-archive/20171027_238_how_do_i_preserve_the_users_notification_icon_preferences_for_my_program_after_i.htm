<p>
When a program creates a notification icon,
the user can set preferences for that icon:
Show icon and notifications,
Hide icon and notifications,
and
Only show notifications.
When you update the program,
what do you have to do to get those preferences to carry over
to the new program?
</p>
<p>
Give your notification icon a GUID.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, in the
<code>NOTIFY&shy;ICON&shy;DATA</code> structure,
set the <code>NIF_</code><code>GUID</code> flag in the <code>uFlags</code>
and put a GUID in the <code>guidItem</code> member.
If the old version of the program
and the updated version use the same GUID,
then the system will recognize that the new icon
should pick up the settings from the old icon.
</p>
<p>
More generally, the GUID is how the system decides which
user preferences apply to which icons.
When the user selects preferences for an icon,
the system associates those preferences with the GUID,
and the next time an icon with the same GUID appears,
the system uses those preferences.
</p>
<p>
But what happens if you don't specify a GUID?
</p>
<p>
In that case, the system starts applying heuristics.
It checks whether the full path to the executable is mostly the same,
where "mostly the same" means that some directories are considered
equivalent; for example,
a file in
<code>Program Files</code> is considered to match
a corresponding file
in <code>Program Files (x86)</code>.
If the executable is mostly the same,
then the system applies additional fuzzy logic based on trying to match
some combination of the <code>uID</code>,
the tooltip provided in the <code>szTip</code> member,
and the pixels in the icon provided in the <code>hIcon</code>.&sup1;
If the fuzzy matcher says "Yeah, they're probably the same,"
then the system will consider the two icons as equivalent
and share their settings.
</p>
<p>
Note that this heuristic is a fallback,
so you shouldn't rely on it in your programs.
You should just set a GUID on your notification icon
so that you get consistent behavior.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
If you generate notification icons dynamically,
you would want to specify a GUID that is deterministically generated
from whatever identity you use to generate your notification icon.
For example, if you create a separate notification icon for each server
that you discover,
then you can hash the server name
in order to produce a
<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_unique_identifier#Versions_3_and_5_.28namespace_name-based.29">
type 3 or type 5 UUID</a>.
That way, when you encounter the same server in the future,
you will regenerate the same GUID.
</p>
<p>
&sup1;
Note that this means that
programs that animate their icon are less likely to have a successful match
because the pixels of the icon that the preferences were saved under
may not match the pixels of the icon that is currently being displayed.</p>

		<p>Cue someone, somewhere, misapplying (or only remembering half of) this advice, and generating a new GUID for each version of their program, thus ensuring that the settings will never carry across. (I suppose this could even be a &#8220;nice bonus for that&#8221; feature, if your program is so awesome that you want to make sure users have the opportunity to see your notifications every time it&#8217;s updated.)</p>

		<p>Even worse. Someone relying on the heuristics shared above without understanding they might be an implementation detail and subject to change at any time. Now that rules are written here, they are part of official contract for shell. Aren&#8217;t they? :P</p>

		<p>Even better, have your program find the GUID of a competitor&#8217;s program&#8217;s (or a Windows component&#8217;s) icon and use that. This way, the user can&#8217;t turn off your icon without interfering with the other one! Nothing says ingenuity like thinking outside the box.</p>

		<p>This might be a problem in .NET land since the NotifyIcon from Windows Forms (also used in WPF apps) doesn&#8217;t use GUIDs</p>

		<p>Most of the .NET Framework is easy to rewrite better than the original. The problem I worry about is somebody using a random GUID every time and clogging up all the automatically saved settings.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
