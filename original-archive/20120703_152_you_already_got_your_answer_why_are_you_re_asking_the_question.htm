<p>Today's rant is a blend of two earlier rants: <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/04/13/2106139.aspx"> People didn't answer your first email for a reason</a> and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/01/20/9341164.aspx"> If you didn't like the answer, asking the same question again is unlikely to help</a>.</p>
<p> A customer submitted a list of questions (via their customer liaison) to the Widgets discussion list, and somebody wrote up a reply, which was sent back to the customer. So far so good. </p>
<p> A few days later, the same list of questions was submitted to the Gizmo discussion list via a different customer liaison. Since the question was about Widgets, the question was forwarded to the Widgets discussion list, at which point the same answer was forwarded back. Okay, so now we have a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/01/20/9341164.aspx"> fishing expedition</a>. </p>
<p> Three weeks later, the same list of question was submitted to the Gizmo discussion list via yet another customer liaison. The fishing expedition continues. The question was once again forwarded to the Widgets discussion list, where the same answer was forwarded back. </p>
<p> When I asked why the same set of questions was being asked three times, the third customer liaison explained, "The customer is looking for more detail." </p>
<p> Asking the same question over and over again is not a way to get more detail. </p>
<p> "By what mechanism does SetWidgetColor inform the widget that its color state has changed?" </p>
<p> &mdash; <i>The widget receives an OnColorChanged event.</i> </p>
<p> "By what mechanism does SetWidgetColor inform the widget that its color state has changed?" </p>

<p> "By what mechanism does SetWidgetColor inform the widget that its color state has changed?" </p>
<p> &mdash; <i>The widget receives an OnColorChanged event.            Why do you keep asking?</i> </p>
<p> "I want more details." </p>
<p> If you want more details, you have to say that you're asking for more details, and you have to say what kind of details you're looking for. </p>
<p> It turns out that this customer didn't even know what kind of details they wanted. They just <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/02/02/10263027.aspx"> wanted to know "everything"</a> about widget color changes. </p>

		<p>The most overlooked step in asking a good question is deciding precisely what you want out of the response. It&#39;s not an easy thing to do, but I find that when I do it, in many cases, the answer becomes more obvious.</p>

		<p>To be fair, sometimes this is just an artifact of the customer being faced with a halting problem.</p>
<p>They need to know how their widget is informed that its color state has changed. &nbsp;So they go post on a web forum. &nbsp;After a day, no responses.</p>
<p>So they send an email to someone they got help from before. &nbsp;After a day, no response.</p>
<p>So they open a new support case.</p>
<p>Then three different support folks pick up the question that was submitted three different ways, and send the question to the widget feature team.</p>

		<p>@Joshua &quot;I keep reporting bugs and they don&#39;t get fixed. Whey do I keep reporting them?&quot;.</p>
<p>I saw that happen this week. &nbsp;Someone reported an issue they were having via our internal help alias and I pointed out to them that it was by design, and gave specific reasoning as to why. &nbsp;I even asked what they were trying to accomplish to see if I could help them do what they wanted. &nbsp;They didn&#39;t respond back with more detail, or disagree, or say &quot;thanks, got it.&quot;. &nbsp;Nothing. &nbsp;Two days later, our program manager assigns me a bug to investigate. &nbsp;Guess what the &quot;bug&quot; was? &nbsp;Yep, exactly the same as the email. &nbsp;Let&#39;s just say it was a very short bug investigation. &nbsp;By design. &nbsp;Yeesh. &nbsp;Talk about passive-agressive. &nbsp;If you didn&#39;t agree with my answer on the alias, how about explaining why you disagreed, instead of just opening a bug? &nbsp;Then I could help you accomplish whatever it was that you were trying to do.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of something that happened years ago, on the CompuServe movies forum. &nbsp;Someone posted a message describing on obscure movie from the 50&#39;s and asking for it&#39;s title and if it&#39;s on video. &nbsp;Someone gave it title (&quot;Blue Denim&quot;) and said it wasn&#39;t available on video. &nbsp; About two weeks later, another message, describing the same movie and asking for it&#39;s title and if it&#39;s on video. &nbsp;Same answer given. &nbsp;Another two weeks go by, and again, a message describing the same file and asking for it&#39;s title, and getting the same response. This went on for a couple months. Eventually, someone challenged the poster, and he said if kept trying to find someone with a copy of the movie &#8212; however, the idea of mentioning the title of the movie in his subsequent messages once he was told it never occurred to him. &nbsp;He just kept posting the description and letting the forum members try to figure out what movie it was.</p>

		<p>@ThomasX: Doesn&#39;t help.</p>
<p>At this point I&#39;m starting to wonder if I could make a killing publishing fixes for some of these bugs. Most of the ones I find and report are not that hard to fix but Microsoft won&#39;t lift a finger. One of them I was able to blind (meaning I didn&#39;t have to read a line of disassembly) binary patch in about 4 hours.</p>

		<p>@Joshua And I hope you&#39;re testing your patch on hundreds of different configurations, with lots of different available software (commercial and free) installed to make sure there are no regressions or security problems introduced? You didn&#39;t think that writing a few lines of code would be the real problem here, would you? That&#39;s almost always the easiest part of the problem..</p>

		<p>@Neil: I would actually expect different reply on about the 2-3 times, containing NSFW words like the third word from RTFM (the ruder interpretation). :P</p>

		<p>@an angry commenter &#8211; the blog software will silently [mostly silently &#8211; it&#39;s distinguishable in that it does not show a confirmation message, but there&#39;s no error message] &quot;eat&quot; comments that were posted a certain amount of time after the form loads. To work around this, copy your content to the clipboard before submitting if you think this may happen.</p>

		<p>@voo: It was obviously unnecessary so far. I am plotting a blind fix for another one that may need significant testing though.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
