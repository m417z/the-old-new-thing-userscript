		<p>I think it would be an excellent idea if Microsoft were to send this kid a free copy of FS2004&#8230;it would make for some really good PR.</p>

		<p>I always find it interesting how people always get fixated on one thing. Sure, terrorists have shown a propensity to blow up airplanes, but only because they&#8217;re so vulnerable. But really, what are the odds that they&#8217;ll try piloting an airplane again? Like electrons, they will follow the path of least resistence. It&#8217;s not unheard of for terrorists to target subways, ships, or underground garages, yet we focus in on people buying flight sims.</p>
<p>Hey! Look over there at that person with the flight sim! (but don&#8217;t pay any attention to me as I stroll into this mall&#8230;)</p>

		<p>If you ask me, they should be focusing on anyone buying a submarine sim. Now *that* would be deadly, and as difficult as hell to track.</p>

		<p>The scary thing is that people actually think it&#8217;s a good idea and don&#8217;t mind, because somehow, they think that they are &quot;more secure&quot;.</p>
<p>Might as well arrest people who read this blog or visit MSDN, since we could learn something that could be used to exploit some vulnerability some day.</p>
<p>This situation is the US government&#8217;s fault for not understanding/implementing security correctly, and forcing their flawed viewes and practices onto even more ignorant people.</p>

		<p>Come on guys, if counterstrike can teach trenchcoat wearing school children to become expert snipers then it makes sense that ms flight simulator can teach terrorists how to fly commercial airliners.</p>

		<p>You seem to know a lot about this Counterstrike game.  Would you mind if we sent some troopers over to your house to talk to you?  The life you save might be your own.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
