<p>Microsoft is required by law to file reports on employees who have sustained injuries on the job. They are also required to post the reports in a location where employees can see them. These reports come out every year on February&nbsp;1.</p>
<p> Back in the old days, these reports were filled out by hand, and reading them was oddly amusing for the details. My favorite from the mid 1990's was a report on an employee who was injured on the job, and the description was simply <i>pencil lead embedded in hand</i>. </p>
<p> Sadly, the reports are now computerized, and there isn't a place to describe the nature of each injury. It's just a bunch of numbers. </p>
<p> Numbers are nice, but they don't tell a story in quite the same way. </p>

		<p>Maybe the numbers are just to hide all those pencil accidents happening, there is surely an estimated number of unknown cases of pencil accidents! Those pencils&#8230;.dangerously sharp and not to underestimate and even the true reason for inventing the paper (and pencil) less office! :)</p>

		<p>Reminds me of an entry in the &quot;accident book&quot; somewhere I used to work. A colleague managed to cut his finger on paper (or something similarly trivial) and had to fill in the book: In the &quot;Treatment administered&quot; column he wrote &quot;Ate a pork pie&quot;.</p>
<p>Not sure how well this travels across the Atlantic, though&#8230;</p>

		<p>I embedded pencil lead in my hand in the mid 90&#39;s! &nbsp;I wonder if I should have visited the school nurse&#8230; My skin at that point retains an ever-so-slight discoloration to this day.</p>

		<p>The only time I ever got pencil lead under my skin was back in the days before mechanical pencils were commonplace.</p>
<p>For the record, that requires impalement.</p>

		<p>I have had a peace from a pencil firmly embedded in my right middle finger since 1968. Still visible if you know where to look. No real suffering to report.</p>

		<p>I worked with Bruce (who got the papercut in the eye). &nbsp;A manager flicked a sheet of paper across a table to him during a meeting and it caught air and flipped up just as it got to him. &nbsp;The rest of us spent the next month involuntarily shielding our eyes while trying not to get queasy thinking about it.</p>

		<p>I didn&#39;t realise so many people have pencil bits embedded in them, I thought I was pretty rare. It&#39;s in my left index finger and can still be seen 30 years later.</p>

		<p>@Greg, @Eric: Yep, happened to me too. In fact, twice.</p>
<p>Once in my left thumb when I was playing with my pencil during class reading time I think 19 years ago. (I&#39;m not actually sure how it happened.) Once in the arch of my foot, I&#39;m not sure when. (That was me being stupid. I stepped on a pencil tip, but that wasn&#39;t enough. I thought &quot;I should get off of this&quot; then &quot;nah, I&#39;ll just be off it another step, and my weight is already on it, so if it was going to jab me, it would have already&quot; and so just kept going&#8230; and kicked the back of the pencil with my other foot.)</p>

		<p>Interesting in the oil industry the nature of each accident is explicitly communicated to stand as a warning to others. In fact the building I work in has a tickertape accross the door that reads something like: &quot;we have been x days since the last accident. on Y 2 people were killed by a rock pulveriser&quot; etc.</p>
<p>Obviously this type of warning might be more applicable in heavy industries than the Microsoft office but an employee developing carpal tunnel might serve as a warnign to others that have disconfort in their work place to have it fixed&#8230;.</p>

		<p>Itâs all the stupid, blanket privacy laws. Thereâs a big difference between keeping an employeeâs medical condition private and posting the idiotic thing someone did to get themselves hurt for everybody to mock. This is the era of embarrassment-discipline; parents donât spank todayâs kids to teach them a lesson anymore, instead they embarrass them in front of their friends, and it is no different at work. Unfortunately the privacy laws make it all too easy for dummies to slink away without punishment, uh, I mean a lesson.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
