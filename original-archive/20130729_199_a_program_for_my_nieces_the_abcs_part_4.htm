Disabling autorepeat in my

ABC program</a>
was largely sufficient to keep my nieces happy,
given their instructions to press only one key at a time.
Once in a while, though, they would hit the context menu key
in the bottom right corner of the keyboard,
and then they'd get stuck because they didn't know
how to dismiss it.
</p>
<p>
So let's disable that key outright.

LRESULT CALLBACK EditSubclassProc(
    HWND hwnd, UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam,
    UINT_PTR uIdSubclass, DWORD_PTR dwRefData)
{
  switch (uMsg) {
  case WM_NCDESTROY:
    RemoveWindowSubclass(hwnd, EditSubclassProc, uIdSubclass);
    break;
  case WM_CHAR:
    if ((lParam &amp; 0x40000000) &amp;&amp; wParam != VK_BACK) return 0;
    break;
  <font COLOR=blue>case WM_CONTEXTMENU:
    return 0;</font>
  }
    return DefSubclassProc(hwnd, uMsg, wParam, lParam);
}
</pre>
<p>
Well, that was awfully anticlimactic, wasn't it.</p>

		<p>@skSdnw,</p>
<p>Pressing the button does nothing, so it isn&#39;t interesting to them. They would rather play with the letters. If it made noise, and if they&#39;re anything like my kids or any others I know, it would quickly become their favorite button.</p>

		<p>@Jon: If you are worried about the sound you could probably flash the background color or something, and yes, if it is _only_ for fun there is no point but learning to use computers/Windows at the same time cannot hurt&#8230;</p>

		<p>&gt; Well, that was awfully anticlimactic, wasn&#39;t it.</p>
<p>Like a spark following the dynamite fuse through the blasting cap and then nothing.</p>
<p>The disappointment leaves you feeling unsatisfied and want to redo it with 3 sticks to make up for the bad one and compensate for the disappointment the first one left you with.</p>
<p>Will there be more parts this week?</p>
<p>Feeling unsatisfied and unable to relieve yourself with equal satisfaction is frustrating.</p>
<p>Like have just watched a flashback filler episode of a good sci-fi tv series. As the credits appear you are left feeling cheated and made a fool of by getting hyped up from the previous episode.</p>
<p>Leaves you with words that would make a censor work for its paycheck.</p>
<p>Tried to do a Stephen Fry word rant and failed.</p>

		<p>JJJ: Have you never seen a toy for a small child? It seems like most toys have no point but to beep or flash when you press some button. If you make a special button that causes a beep or a flash, kids will push that button all day.</p>
<p>If you think that making the beep more annoying will make them learn not to press the button, you&#39;re wrong &#8212; it will only make them push the button more frequently!</p>
<p>And if it were me writing the program, I would make it as boring as possible. If it&#39;s too fun, kids will want to play it constantly, never letting me use my own damn computer. If they end up fighting over it, there&#39;s the risk it could be caught in the cross-fire. The key is to NOT turn the computer into a game.a</p>

		<p>This disables the context menu completely, instead of just the context menu key. It also blocks right-click, and Shift-F10. It&#39;s possible and easy enough to modify this to still allow the context menu to be used with the mouse by checking lParam. If the keyboard is used, the mouse coordinates are reported as (-1, -1), and the message can be suppressed. Otherwise call DefSubclassProc. If Shift-F10 needs to be allowed too, some other approach is needed, probably looking at the keyboard messages. Although, allowing right-click while disallowing the context menu from the keyboard makes sense to me in a few situations, but allowing Shift-F10 while disallowing the context menu key does not.</p>
<p>(I realise that this won&#39;t be necessary for what you have in mind, and blocking the context menu entirely won&#39;t be a problem for you. I&#39;m not trying to suggest it is.)</p>

		<p>The lesson here is &quot;80% of your time will be taken by 20% of the unexpected mid-term requested/required features&quot;.</p>
<p>Imagine if you didn&#39;t know about WM_CONTEXTMENU, a very plausible situation when you haven&#39;t read the whole Win32 reference. What would be your first approach?</p>
<p>Perhaps most people would be interested in muffling the input that pops the context menu, to only find out later that there&#39;s a message dedicated to do it, and now you&#39;ll roll back and replace all that hard work with two lines.</p>
<p>Of Course™, this wouldn&#39;t happen had you read the whole introductory section &quot;About Menus&quot;.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
