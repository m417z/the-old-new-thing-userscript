<p>         Whimsical bug reports, while not a common occurence, aren't exactly unheard of either.         They are a popular way to vent a shared frustration and lighten the mood.      </p>
<p>         Recently, we changed milk suppliers for our cafeterias. Well, more accurately, our         previous milk supplier was bought by another milk company. The problem is that the         single-serving milk cartons from the new company are hard to open.      </p>
<p>         So of course what you do is file a bug.      </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>         Bug: New milk cartons are hard to open.      </p>
<p>     Repro: Go to cafeteria, get milk carton, attempt to open it, get napkins and clean     up mess. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>         (The reason is that the milk company bought a brand new machine which seals the cartons         with too much glue. They are working to adjust the seal.)      </p>
<p>         A few work-arounds were suggested, including bringing your own cow and a three-step         process of freezing the milk, tearing the carton open, then allowing the milk to thaw.         Others explain that the fix is held up in testing: "Currently only 3 testers are handling         this component and they can only drink 8 cartons a day. The team could conduct more         carton-opening tests but carton-tasting, milkflow testing and carton pressure tests         are still remaining." Plus of course a security review needs to be made of the consequences         of a weaker seal.      </p>
<p>         This is a particularly software-oriented joke, because it highlights how hard it is         to make bugfixes in software - by applying the software testing regimen to something         that isn't software. You can't assume that a simple, local change like adjusting the         amount of glue applied to the carton will result in a simple, local change in the         final product (a more acceptable seal strength). Software is nonlinear. A simple change         can have effects (some catastrophic, some subtle) far, far away from the point of         change.      </p>

		<p>When I was on the NAV team at Symantec, circa 1997, it was a couple months before the ship date and the team wanted shirts. The team shirt was something we really looked forward to, and of course we *had* to have cooler shirts than the NU guys on the other side of the floor.<br />
So anyway, it was getting kinda late in the project and still no shirts, so one of the dev guys entered a bug like this:</p>
<p>Defect #: 1234<br />
Severity: 1, high, showstopper<br />
Bug: Missing T-shirts</p>
<p>The team and our managers got a kick out of it, but the product manager at the time wasn&#8217;t as receptive to the morale boost that comes along with tchatchkies, and she set the bug to:</p>
<p>Status: Postponed</p>
<p>This kinda ticked us off, but hey, we tried. So, next year, the same thing happens. This time, I take the initiative and enter this bug:</p>
<p>Defect #: 5678<br />
Severity: 1, high, showstopper<br />
Bug: Missing T-shirts<br />
Note: May be related to bug #1234</p>
<p>Again, we got a laugh out of it, and I think that time we actually got shirts, although as I recall my bug got Postponed too (grr, silly PMs).</p>

		<p>I think that if we tried to file one of those in our database, someone would probably chew us out.  :: sigh ::  I want to file a fun bug&#8230;  Perhaps, &quot;Too many children playing in hallways during work hours.&quot;  Or &quot;building 9 cafeteria looks like a daycare.&quot;  </p>

		<p>Whoa, I was visiting the MS campus the other week, I was wondering why the milk was so @*#&amp;$! hard to open&#8230;and what&#8217;s with people leaving half-finished cartons of chocolate milk in the coolers?</p>

		<p>Yeah, most people put chocolate milk in coffee rather than regular milk. However, some people put the leftover milk back in the cooler rather than the refridgerator. (kind of annoying, but oh well)</p>

		<p>I had no idea this bug (which I opened for a lark) would garner so much attention.<br />
I guess we ARE all geeks.</p>

		<p>We&#8217;re reading Raymond&#8217;s blog, Aakash.  I think that qualifies us for geeks.  </p>
<p>That drives me *nuts* when people leave them open in the fridge.  If you don&#8217;t want the whole thing for your coffee, then just DRINK the darn thing.  It&#8217;s not going to kill anyone to drink some chocolate milk (well, unless they&#8217;re allergic to chocolate, but at that point, I&#8217;d question them putting it in their coffee anyway).  </p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
