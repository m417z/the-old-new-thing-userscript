<p> <a href="http://www.atmos.washington.edu/~cliff/cliff.php"> Cliff Mass</a> is Professor of Atmospheric Sciences at the University of Washington. To those of us in the Seattle area, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/living/2008452574_mass010.html"> he's a weather celebrity</a>, appearing <a href="http://www.kuow.org/program.php?id=20295"> every Friday on local public radio station KUOW</a> to provide a weekend weather forecast and discuss other weather issues. <a href="http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/"> His blog</a> covers similar material, such as his explanation of <a href="http://cliffmass.blogspot.com/2010/05/there-is-bird-in-my-radar.html"> why weather radar shows lots of echoes even though there was no rain</a>. </p>
<p> His articles, while fascinating, are also quite long, so to help you get through them, there is the <a href="http://cliffmasstldr.blogspot.com/"> Cliff Mass TLDR blog</a>. For example, <a href="http://cliffmasstldr.blogspot.com/2010/05/radar-is-picking-up-birds-instead-of.html"> the TLDR version of the mysterious echoes goes like this</a>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> <b>The radar is picking up birds instead of rain</b><br> It's been dry, but the weather radar last night showed lots of echos, suggesting it rained all night. No, it was just birds.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> <b>Explaining the joke in the title</b>: "Cliff Notes" is a pun on <a href="http://www.cliffsnotes.com/">CliffsNotes</a>, a United States producer of study guides. </p>

		<p>For other radar errata, in WWII when radar was still being developed, mysterious blips that came up were called angels before they realized the echos were from birds..</p>

		<p>It seems like that site would be perfect for a Twitter feed, a 140-character limit actually enforcing the delicious brevity.</p>

		<p>Apparently that&#39;s a spinoff of Coles Notes, which is a far more familiar name to me (I got it without the explanation, I just assumed at first that the wordplay was more tenuous that it apparently is).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
