A customer reported that they used
<a HREF="http://windowssecrets.com/top-story/one-quick-trick-prevents-autorun-attacks/">
a registry hack</a>
to disable Autorun,
and it doesn't work.
"Do we have any documentation on the above registry key
so I can check that they applied it properly?"
</p>
<p>
There is no documentation on that registry key
because it's just some people putting together
fragments of information in the hopes that
something interesting will happen.
Sort of like saying,
"I found this Web site that says that
if I take my vacuum cleaner, reverse the power leads,
then plug it into a transformer that steps the voltage down,
I can use it like a hair dryer.
I tried it, but it doesn't work.
Is there any documentation on the Hoover
Web site that goes into the details of this technique
so I can check that I performed the steps properly?"
</p>
<p>
There is a "Disable autorun" group policy.
That is the supported mechanism.</p>

		<p>I hate websites suggesting (unexperienced) people (who tend to mess up) to modify registry rather than using group policy. One might say the registry way is recommended because these users don&#8217;t have a professional edition of Windows which doesn&#8217;t ship with the group policy editor. I say people who don&#8217;t use a home edition of Windows for a reason shouldn&#8217;t do registry editing.<br />
Next step they do: Download a weird, ad-supported bloated WPF tool written in VB.NET which sets the registry key with bad WinAPI interop.</p>

		<p>A few people have created repackaged versions of gpedit.msc for Home editions, but I haven&#8217;t seen a well-supported one that&#8217;s actually kept up to date. Probably violates every license in the book.</p>
<p>It shouldn&#8217;t be difficult for simple 3rd party software to read adm and admx files to properly list and apply group policy for each OS version in the absence of a native editor. (And if a policy-defined feature doesn&#8217;t exist in Home, it doesn&#8217;t exist, oh well.) You&#8217;d think someone could even create an annotated edition that would be a significant improvement on the original. The fact that everyone just wants to &#8220;apply this tweak file but it messed my PC up&#8221; makes me sad for humanity.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I say people who don’t use a home edition of Windows for a reason shouldn’t do registry editing.&#8221;<br />
There seem to be a few negations too many or little in there, but if I get your gist, are you really suggesting that only people who spend extra money should be allowed to disable autorun? </p>
<p>If you don&#8217;t offer people a nice supported way to do something, they will use other ways and cause you headaches. That&#8217;s how it is.</p>

		<p>Oops, yeah, I should proof-read my comments hastily written at work break. It should be &#8220;I say people who use a home edition of Windows for a reason shouldn’t do registry editing.” What I think is that if people use a Home Edition, they sometimes wouldn&#8217;t even care about what Autorun does or what it is. If you are professional enough to know that, and probably know in advance you want to disable it, Home Editions will not make you happy in general, I guess.</p>

		<p>I often finding myself putting registry settings into Group Policy Preferences rather than using the actual group policy setting itself.  (I use gpsearch.azurewebsites.net to look up the details.)  GPP offers very nice item-level targeting options that regular old group policy does not.</p>

&#8220;es saugt und bläst der Heinzelmann, wo Mutti sonst nur saugen kann&#8221; (&#8230;the Heinzelmann (think of a brownie) sucks (vacuums?) and blows, where mother otherwise could only suck). Yes this double entendre is already in the german version.</p>

		<p>Well you&#8217;ve opened a can of worms. Certain vital security and accessibility settings are only accessible from group policy, but group policy does not exist on home editions of Windows. The cognitive dissonance of the tech support staff when I had to call in about one of these was terrible to behold.</p>

		<p>A corporate customer may have employees who use their home computers to connect to a corporate network via VPN. Until recently my personal home machine was able to connect directly to the network. Now, I have to use Remote Desktop to my office machine when connecting from home &#8211; which I guess is for viral/malware/etc security.</p>

		<p>Please aware that lots of laptops that companies use comes with Home version of Windows too.</p>
<p>Say that for one of my ex-companies, they buy &#8220;display machine&#8221; from shops for about 50% off of market price. While the machine still gets 1 year warranty, it doesn&#8217;t get the option to switch to Pro edition of Win7 (and hence the Win7 pro recovery CD).</p>

		<p>Yes, and it&#8217;s a BAD IDEA for companies to buy computers with home versions of Windows.  Regardless of the discount.  I had to repeatedly coach a company I work with, who liked to run down to the local big-box store and buy whatever computer was on sale.  </p>
<p>I told them that if they wanted to contract with me to support a computer that&#8217;s used in a business network, then it needs to have a business operating system.  And I offered to upgrade it to Windows Pro for them.</p>

		<p>Hi Raymond,</p>
<p>I’ve noticed a value named “SlowContextMenuEntries” in the following key in Windows 10:</p>
<p>HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Explorer</p>
<p>It’s not plain-text. Do you know what this key is about, and does OS store the list of slow context menu handlers in that value? I’m not sure if this key existed in previous Windows versions.</p>
<p>I’d appreciate any insight you may give on this matter. </p>
<p>Thanks for your time,</p>

		<p>If I search on a question, I&#8217;m far more likely to get a hit on a highly optimized SEO page with the exact question than any official Microsoft source.  The validity of the article is likely to be just from comments &#8212; Google / Bing don&#8217;t show inbound links, but I&#8217;d be willing to bet there are many link farming links from unrelated sites and very few legitimate links, just because of how Internet works.</p>
<p>Even on Stack Overflow, you can find a lot of bad advice &#8212; and you don&#8217;t have to look very hard for that.</p>

<p>And it&#8217;s hardly a registry hack when it is indeed documented by Microsoft. Sorry Raymond, but for once I think the customer is indeed right.</p>

		<p>The linked KB article specified this registry is for up to Vista and Win2008 only, so maybe it doesn&#8217;t work for Win7+ and Win2008R2+ and hence we have this blog post.</p>

		<p>The article you mentioned is dated from 2007 (and is private, I cannot see the full article). No doubt, it has something to do with Windows XP and its weakness at that time.<br />

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
