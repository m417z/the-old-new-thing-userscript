<dd>     They take many forms, depending on the situation,     but checking a window caption is definitely ill-advised,     since that creates the opportunity both for false positives     (what if an unrelated program happens to have the same caption?)     and false negatives (will the German version of the program have     the same caption?).     On a related note,     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cjacks/">     Chris Jackson</a>     writes about     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/cjacks/archive/2007/07/05/windows-vista-shim-internals-basics-how-shims-work-to-address-compatibility-issues-and-what-are-the-ramifications.aspx">the shim proces itself</a>,     which you might find interesting. </p>

<dd>
<p>Actually, it does.     What the documentation is trying to say is that     it doesn't work is for things like <code>\\server</code>.     That will return <code>FALSE</code> even if the server exists.     (I've sent a clarification to the documentation team.     Who knows whether they'll accept it.) </p>

<p>This wasn't a topic suggestion, just somebody who wanted to     take what I said and argue against it with made-up facts.     "I to enjoy people that display their ignorance in frount of all of us."     You can get a mirror at Ikea for just a few dollars. </p>

<p>Um, I didn't see a topic suggestion in there.     (Not that I really had much incentive to look hard for one.)     It looks like just a bunch of ranting. </p>

How hard is it to search the Suggestion Box page to see if somebody     already asked your question?) </dt>
<dd>
<p>If you set your owner correctly and don't play weird games,     everything will be just fine.     The problem is that the taskbar has to play weird games     because of all the other applications that play <u>even weirder</u>     games.     When you play weird games, things get weird. </p>

<p>No.     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/05/30/423202.aspx">     You can try to fake it but you're going to run into problems</a>. </p>

<p>That's a coding style issue.     Believe it or not, different people have different styles,     and there is no mandated "MSDN coding style".     <a href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=356640">     Some people are more averse to the goto statement than others</a>. </p>

<dd>I already discussed     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/13/131116.aspx">     the feature process</a>.     I happen to know the person responsible for Start menu and taskbar     features in Windows Vista.     The list of design changes and feature requests     was over 200 items long and obviously not all of them     could be addressed.     (And that list was just of the design changes and feature requests     that overcame the starting point of     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ericgu/archive/2004/01/12/57985.aspx">     minus 100 points</a>.) </p>

</dd>
</dl>
<p> And then there are the people who ask questions on things that I explicitly listed as topics I am not inclined to cover. </p>
<ul>
<li>Comments on the blog software itself.     (Like     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#428487">     this one about how the categories are browsed</a>.     Or     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#513533">     this one saying that search doesn't work</a>.     Or     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#680874">     this one complaining about the layout of the navigation area</a>.     The blog software determines the layout of the navigation area.     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#1116786">     Somebody else is having trouble subscribing via email</a>.     Remember, I don't control this stuff.) </li>
<li>Internet Explorer.     (Such as     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#422727">     this one about Internet Explorer context menu extensions</a>     and     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#587954">     this one about the Microsoft Virtual Machine</a>.) </li>
<li>Visual Studio.     (Such as     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#441696">     this one complaining that a project built with Visual Studio 2003     behaves differently from one built with Visual Studio&nbsp;6</a>.     Or     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#647285">     this one asking a question about the C runtime     <code>stat</code> function</a>.) </li>
<li>Non-software Microsoft topics, such as product support policies,     marketing tactics, jobs and careers, legal issues.     (Such as     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#439902">     this one asking for career advice</a>     or     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#649693">     this one asking about the same thing but much more verbosely</a>.) </li>
<li>Microsoft software that isn't Windows.     (Such as     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#472170">     this one that asks about a bug in Access&nbsp;97</a>.     Or     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#511609">     this one that appears to be rant about Small Business Accounting</a>.     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#539789">     This one asks about the Outlook New Mail sound</a>.     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#550263">     This one complains about Windows Installer</a>.     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#777020">     This one complains about MSDN search</a>.) </li>
<li>Windows topics outside user interface programming.     (Such as     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#422312">     this one about power management</a>,     which would be better-posed to the power mangement folks on the     <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/tabletpc/archive/2005/08/18/409450.aspx">     Tablet PC blog</a> and the     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/mobilepc/archive/2005/09/19/471578.aspx">     Mobile PC blog</a>,     though from what I can tell, the feature you're asking for is     already in Vista since it was the power management team's #1 issue!     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#444107">     Here's another misdirected power management question</a>.     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#448774">     This person wants me to discuss OpenGL&nbsp;2.0</a>.     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#453671">     This person wants me to discuss the network redirector</a>.     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#732019">     This person wants details on <code>BeginUpdateResource</code>     and the PE loader</a>.) </li>
<li>User interface programming in anything other than Win32.     (Such as     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#409986">     this one about some application framework that is probably MFC</a>     although the person didn't say so explicitly.     Here's     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#430296">     another one that is probably using MFC though they didn't say so     explicitly</a>.) </li>
<li>Debugging a specific problem.     (Such as     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#456418">     this one asking me to debug something on a forum I don't have     access to anyway</a>.     Or     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#473442">     this one from somebody having trouble with pattern brushes in     some scripting language I've never heard of much less have any     degree of expertise in</a>.) </li>
<li>Predictions for the future.     (Such as     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#429811">     this one that asks me what I think about two acronyms I've     never heard of</a>.     Or     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#471543">     this one that asks me to predict the future of dual core machines</a>.) </li>
</ul>
<p> And then there are the suggestions that are so wildly off topic I don't even know why they bothered to ask me, such as <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#472520"> this person who wants me to discuss a VB6 language feature</a> and another <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#476815"> who wants me to discuss non-short-circuit evaluation in Visual Basic</a>. I have no idea why they chose me to ask these questions. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/10/17/55345.aspx"> In my experience, VB doesn't even stand for Visual Basic</a>! Another person asked <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#481573"> a long, rambling question about Unicode IME</a> that I got tired of reading. </p>
<p> I'm kind of baffled by <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#844104"> this comment asking how to post a comment</a>. </p>
<p> Other topics I am unlikely to cover are <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#452490"> personal biography</a> since that just leads to WikiStalking. </p>

		<p>Wow, thanks for answering my question on focusing w/o raising (I must have been frustrated at the time.. making so many spelling errors).</p>
<p>FWIW, the ability to focus without raising has been in the window manager for years though. TweakUI allows you to turn on the focus-follows-mouse option and it does this by flipping a bit in the registry (Control PanelDesktopUserPreferencesMask). Admittedly, just because the window manager is able to do something doesn’t mean a lowly application should, but clearly the ability is there.</p>
<p>Your answer confirms that I didn’t miss some documented way of accomplishing this though. Good stuff.</p>

<p>the current suggestion box backlog will last at least into 2010. &nbsp;That&#8217;s why it isn&#8217;t open now: suggestions were getting added so fast that had it stayed open, Raymond would have just kept falling farther and farther behind.</p>
<p>Not sure what sort of questions might arise from the Shell_NotifyIcon API that wouldn&#8217;t be covered by a combination of &quot;NEVER do that from a service!&quot; and the documentation, but hey, whatever.</p>

		<p>Fair enough, Raymond. The bit flip is the result of calling SystemParametersInfo() with SPI_SETACTIVEWINDOWTRACKING. Regardless, my point was the window manager still has this (apparently documented) ability.</p>

		<p>MSDN examples probably use gotos for the purpose that they are most useful: Cleaning up after an exception.</p>
<p>C# has try/finally for this. C++ doesn&#8217;t, but that&#8217;s no reason not to use the same structure. Better than risking a memory leak.</p>

		<p>Gazpacho, C++ doesn&#8217;t have try/finally because it doesn&#8217;t need try/finally. &nbsp;Also, MSDN examples, with respect to the Win32 API, are written in C.</p>

		<p>&quot;Why doesn&#8217;t AltGr+Del act like Ctrl+Alt+Del?&quot;</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>IBM programmer David Bradley arbitrarily decided in 1981 to make it that way.</p>

<p>Changing it now would break programs that happen to use AltGr+Del for their own purposes.</p>

		<p>Johnny, you&#8217;re already getting pretty far afield. I don&#8217;t think this is a question of what features a language should or shouldn&#8217;t have, nor what language most of the examples are written in (the question said C and C++). It&#8217;s about why they use goto.</p>
<p>No, C++ does not &quot;need&quot; try/finally, but Windows programs generally need to allocate resources temporarily and make sure they are always properly released. Many MSDN examples use goto for this. The resulting code structure differs only superficially from C# code that uses try/finally for the same purpose.</p>

		<p>The guy commenting on the Access bug wasn&#8217;t complaining. He was merely suggesting it was an amusing failure that you might get some light relief out of mentioning.</p>
<p>He had of course no knowledge of the famous Photo Draw bug, when Photo Draw would not install if you had an odd number of fonts on the machine. Yep, didn&#8217;t matter if it was one or 497, it wouldn&#8217;t install unless there was an even number of fonts in the folder.</p>
<p>The Access bug does touch tangentially on another point. Why are software error messages so totally out. The Access 97 bug, where it wouldn&#8217;t install if you had a particular font (that came with Publisher I believe) on the machine, gave the error message that you didn&#8217;t have a license to install Access on the machine, which led to some unpleasant scenes when I was accused of installing pirated software.</p>
<p>(Actually, maybe error messages like this are written on purpose. I still remember a colleague who returned to the UK from Saudi and went off and while installing one of the pirate CDs he had come back with received about an illegal operation causing the machine to shut down. He immediately went off and spent a few hundred pounds on legal copies before the boys in blue arrived at the door to arrest him!).</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know what to make of the Access 97 bug, but The PhotoDraw installation bug sounds like a case of someone allocating an array one item too short. It&#8217;s an embarrassing bug that should have been caught in testing, but it (like other bugs) has a non-devious explanation.</p>

		<p>&quot;Why can&#8217;t you call SetFocus() on a window in another thread?</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;I covered this in my PDC 2005 talk.</p>
<p>Another category is people who ask a question I&#8217;ve already answered or ask a question that has already been asked.&quot;</p>
<p>So basically, before asking a question, we are not only supposed to have read every article ever posted on this blog, but also watched/listened to/read/etc every other thing that Raymond has ever published/said/etc!?</p>
<p>Seriously Raymond maybe it is slightly annoying if people keep asking questions that have been answered, but pointing people in the right direction is fine, there is no need to be so angry about it. Chill out!</p>

		<p>C(++) *does* have try/finally: it&#8217;s called Structured Exception Handling.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s implemented using the syntax __try/__finally. There&#8217;s also __except.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s supported by MSVC, but not sure about other compilers.</p>
<p>(C++ obviously supports standard exceptions using try, catch, but I believe they are implemented internally using Win32 SEH, see Richter&#8217;s book).</p>

		<p>Scorpion007: SEH is a Windows feature that MSVC exposes through the __try/__except/__finally keywords. Other compilers targeting Windows might support it (not sure), compilers that don&#8217;t target Windows most certainly will not. SEH is *not* in any way part of ISO standard C++.</p>
<p>Gazpacho: goto is not a valid replacement for try/finally, because it is not exception safe. The cleanup code in the finally block gets run regardless of how the try block is exitted, whether that be regular flow, a return statement, or an exception. Using goto will not cover the &quot;early return&quot; scenario and most certainly also not the exception scenario.</p>
<p>However, C++ has a proper mechanism to deal with this, where whatever resource you need to clean up is wrapped in a class which is created on the stack. In this case, the class&#8217;s destructor is responsible for the cleanup. Since exceptions in C++ do proper stack unwinding, this destructor will always get called, regardless of how the function exits. This principle is called Resource Acquisition Is Initialization (RAII). It&#8217;s a little more work than try/finally (and is probably overkill for a code sample on MSDN), but it works very well. See also this article I wrote on the topic a while back: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.ookii.org/post/tryfinally_vs_raii.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.ookii.org/post/tryfinally_vs_raii.aspx</a></p>

		<p>andg &#8212; You can do the same, but you&#8217;d better give the user some way to undo the change. &nbsp;Call SystemParametersInfo with the setting SPI_SETACTIVEWINDOWTRACKING and the appropriate value. &nbsp;That&#8217;s all that TweakUI does (or seems to do).</p>
<p>Note that TweakUI does *NOT* set each window up to get activation without being raised, individually. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a system-level setting; either it&#8217;s off or on for each individual system. &nbsp;(Or each desktop, I&#8217;m not exactly sure. &nbsp;It&#8217;s way less granular than &quot;per window&quot;, in any case.)</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why you&#8217;d better give the user the opportunity to turn it off; if your program turns it on without notification and without the opportunity to cancel (and without any other way to turn it off again), then your program is being antisocial. &nbsp;Or worse.</p>

		<p>Gazpacho: score Internet points? I have no idea what that even means.</p>
<p>The original question was why MSDN uses goto in some samples. Raymond suggested that it was a matter of style, which is fine with me (I have no strong feelings towards goto either way). You suggested that they used it as an alternative to try/finally, which is not fine, because the semantics of try/finally cannot be duplicated with goto in the context of exceptions.</p>
<p>My explanation of a alternate method to do cleanup in C++ that does have the same semantics as try/finally was arguably off-topic, but I didn&#8217;t realize that was a crime these days.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
