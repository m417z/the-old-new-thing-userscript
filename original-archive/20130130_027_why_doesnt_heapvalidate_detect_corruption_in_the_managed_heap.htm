<p>A customer had a program that was corrupting the managed heap by p/invoking incorrectly. The problem didn't show up until the next garbage collection pass, at which point the CLR got all freaked-out-like. "According to <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/286470"> Knowledge Base article 286470</a>, the <code>GFlags</code> tool is supposed to catch heap corruption, but it doesn't catch squat."</p>
<p> Depending on your point of view, this is either a case of the customer <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/01/16/513311.aspx"> not understanding what things mean in context</a> or of the KB article author <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/05/12/10163578.aspx"> looking at the world through kernel-colored glasses</a>. </p>
<p> The <code>GFlags</code> tool, pageheap, full pageheap, and the <code>Heap&shy;Validate</code> function all operate on heaps, but the sense of the word <i>heap</i> here is "heaps created by the <code>Heap&shy;Create</code> function." If your program <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/05/19/420038.aspx"> does a <code>Virtual&shy;Alloc</code> and then carves out sub-allocations from it</a>, well, it's not like <code>GFlags</code> and <code>Heap&shy;Validate</code> are psychic and can magically reverse-engineer your code in order to understand your custom heap implementation and be able to determine whether your custom heap is corrupted. </p>
<p> Clearly no such function could be written, because that's even harder than the Halting Problem! One property of a non-corrupted heap is that it will not send the heap manager into an infinite loop. Therefore, proving that the heap is not corrupted, given no information about the heap implementation other than the code itself, would require proving that the next heap call will return. And that's just <i>one</i> of the things the imaginary <i>ValidateAnyHeap</i> function would have to do. (We try to limit ourselves to one impossible thing at a time.) </p>
<p> The <code>Heap&shy;Validate</code> function only knows how to validate heaps created by the <code>Heap&shy;Create</code> function. It does not have magic insight into custom heap implementations. The <code>GFlags</code> program modifies the behavior of heaps created by the <code>Heap&shy;Create</code> function, because it naturally does not know what debugging features you've added to your custom heap implementation, so it doesn't know what it needs to do to turn them on and off. </p>
<p> As far as the kernel folks are concerned, "heap" means "something created by the <code>Heap&shy;Create</code> function." Anything else is just an imposter. </p>
<p> If you are looking for corruption in a custom heap implementation, then you need to go ask the authors of that custom heap implementation if they provided any debugging facilities for that heap. </p>

		<p>I&#39;m confused.</p>
<p>The problem statement said &quot;managed heap&quot; and &quot;CLR&quot;. &nbsp;I immediately assumed that the customer was talking about .NET and that the heap was being created/used by the language environment. &nbsp;Since this comes from Microsoft, one might think the MS debug tools would assist with this problem.</p>
<p>What I think must be happening is that there is a Kernel provided heap (debugged with GFlags settings), which is not the same heap provided by .NET/runtime. &nbsp;This would make the problem be one of &quot;kernel colored glasses&quot;. (Follow-up: why doesn&#39;t .NET/rt use a kernel created heap?)</p>
<p>A useful response would be information about debugging the runtime heap provided/used by .NET and the language environment.</p>
<p>Nowhere in the problem statement did the customer say they were doing an explicit VirualAlloc and carving sub-allocations, i.e. using a custom heap implementation. &nbsp;Thus most of Raymond&#39;s comments, while true, seem mis-addressed.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>The CLR is one example of a custom heap implementation that calls VirtualAlloc and carves out sub-allocations. (This should be obvious since the CLR uses a moving GC.)

		<p>Althought the halting problem is totally solvable given deterministic transitions (which we presumably have) and non infinite memory (which unless MS Research are punching above their weight we can also assume).</p>

		<p>@HiTechHiTouch: &nbsp;The customer is a programmer, presumably professional. &nbsp;It&#39;s reasonable to expect them to understand that the .NET runtime may or may not use the heap that GFlags can set options for. &nbsp;It isn&#39;t necessarily a case of kernel-colored glasses for GFlags; in fact I&#39;d say it&#39;s more likely a lazy and/or ignorant programmer asking the question.</p>
<p>Or would you suggest that text be added to the GFlags documentation listing all the different heaps that it can&#39;t help debug?</p>

		<p>@Mike: &quot;The halting problem is totally solvable given deterministic transitions and non infinite memory&quot;.</p>
<p>Sure. Using an algorithm provably not faster than O(2^n) where n is the number of bits of memory.</p>
<p>You don&#39;t need a very big N before the difference between &quot;takes O(2^N) operations&quot; and &quot;takes infinite time&quot; is just a matter of academic semantics.</p>

		<p>@ChrisR: &nbsp;If the -NET runtime uses the heap, it should know how to use it correctly. &nbsp;I agree totally with @HiTechHiTouch, this issue hasn&#39;t really been addressed by Raymond, and in fact smacks a little of the elitism, or snobbery that I expect to find on a Solaris forum.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
