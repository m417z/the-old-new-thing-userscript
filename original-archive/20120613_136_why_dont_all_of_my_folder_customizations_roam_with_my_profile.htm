<p>A customer reported some inconsistency in how folder customizations are handled by roaming profiles.</p>
<ol>
<li>Log onto Server1 with a roaming profile. </li>
<li>Open the following folders and in each one,     customize the icon size:     
<ol type="a">
<li>Library\Documents     </li>
<li><code>\\server\share</code>     </li>
<li><code>C:\Temp</code>     </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Log off from Server1. </li>
<li>Log onto Server2 with the same roaming profile. </li>
<li>Open the same folders and observe:     
<ol type="a">
<li>Library\Documents: Icon size roams.     </li>
<li><code>\\server\share</code>: Icon size roams.     </li>
<li><code>C</code>:\Temp: Icon size <i>does not roam</i>.     </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p> Why doesn't the <code>C:\Temp</code> customization roam? </p>
<p> Well, if you think about it, it makes sense that the setting for <code>C:\Temp</code> doesn't roam because <code>C:\Temp</code> doesn't roam either! The <code>C:\Temp</code> on Server1 is not the same directory as the <code>C:\Temp</code> on Server2. </p>
<p> Let's change Step&nbsp;2 slightly: </p>
<ol>
<li>Log onto Server1 with a roaming profile. </li>
<li>Open the following folders and in each one, <span style="border: solid .75pt black">create a file called <code>TEST</code></span>.     
<ol type="a">
<li>Library\Documents     </li>
<li><code>\\server\share</code>     </li>
<li><code>C:\Temp</code>     </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Log off from Server1. </li>
<li>Log onto Server2 with the same roaming profile. </li>
<li>Open the same folders and observe:     
<ol type="a">
<li>Library\Documents: <code>TEST</code> is there.     </li>
<li><code>\\server\share</code>: <code>TEST</code> is there.     </li>
<li><code>C:\Temp</code>: <code>TEST</code> <i>is missing</i>.     </li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p> I think nobody would be surprised at the results of this second experiment. The changes to Library\Documents are there because that folder is part of your roaming profile. The changes to <code>\\server\share</code> are there because it is a global resource. And the changes to <code>C:\Temp</code> are not there because the first one is "<code>C:\Temp</code> on Server1" and the second is "<code>C:\Temp</code> on Server2". </p>
<p> The shell saves icon size customizations in folders differently based on whether it is a global resource (like a network share) or a local resource (available only on the local machine). Settings for local resources do not roam because, well, they're local and have no meaning when roamed to another computer. </p>
<p> The Documents case manages to get the desired effect, but by different means: Settings for libraries are based on how you customized the view via things like the "Arrange by" menu. Those customizations are saved in your roaming profile, and they therefore roam with you. </p>

		<p>Why the H people use C:temp as %TEMP%? Besides from being an eyesore, in a secure enterprise it can be an information disclosure problem.</p>
<p>Although an award for the worst case of using %TEMP% goes to some first-tier brand Security Manager, which INSTALLS a DLL (some garbage collector) there. If the DLL gets deleted (hehe), it is magically recreated! Luckily, precise application of an ACL can prevent its load.</p>

		<p>@alegr1 Raymond probably simplified the path for the purpose of the story. &nbsp;Unless you think the customer also has a server called &quot;server&quot; with a share called &quot;share&quot;&#8230; actually that is a real possibility I suppose.</p>
<p>Also C:Temp probably isn&#39;t %TEMP%, just short for &quot;Temporary folder where I can experiment&quot;.</p>
<p>There&#39;s also the case where an arbitrary directory name is not guaranteed to mean the same thing across PCs, so you have a strong case right there to ignore folder customizations in folders Windows doesn&#39;t control. &nbsp;Example: C:Website as the http root of a website on PC1 could be a different website than the same folder on PC2 so different folder view settings may be desired by the user. &nbsp;Or C:Chips on one PC being designs for microprocessors on one PC, on another its someone&#39;s artistic photos of potato chips, and on Chip&#39;s PC he uses C:Chips as his personal folder.</p>

		<p>For a moment I thought Raymond was talking about my company. We actually have a server called Server1. However we don&#39;t have Server2, Server3, or any other Server[0-9]+</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve never seen roaming profiles do anything. I don&#39;t know what it&#39;s supposed to be syncing, but I have yet to see any setting of mine roam. I do know that it takes a long time to log into computers, because they say they&#39;re setting up my profile, and I see a lot of data in the Roaming section of my AppData directory, but nothing ever seems to come of it. I think that by and large, they should be disabled my default on Windows.</p>

		<p>@jader3rd: Roaming profiles is usually a Active Directory-domain feature. &nbsp;It was originally introduced with Active Directory and the concept of &quot;Zero Administration Windows&quot; in the NT5/Windows 2000 days. &nbsp;If your AD-based user account has a shared profile path, Windows will sync their HKCU registry hive and the contents of %appdata%. &nbsp;That way, when that account logs onto another machine, the roaming settings are synced to that machine &#8211; things like custom spelling dictionaries, colors schemes, etc. &nbsp;Things that don&#39;t make sense to roam &#8211; like Temporary Internet Files and temp files &#8211; are stored in %localappdata%.</p>
<p>So, if you are using Windows without roaming profiles enabled, the distinction between what&#39;s stored in %appdata% and what&#39;s stored in %localappdata% might seem random or arbitrary. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Windows 8 does a limited form of user profile roaming when the account is based on the Microsoft Account(the service previously known as Windows Live ID/Passport) system.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
