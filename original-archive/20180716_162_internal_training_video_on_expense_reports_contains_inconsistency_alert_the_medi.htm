<p>
I was watching an internal training video on proper handling of
expense reports.
The narrator says,
"This is a small expense report, and everything looks good."
</p>
<p>
But everything does not look good.
The expense report says <i>Meals: USD $14</i>,
but the receipt is for a $153 flat-screen monitor.
</p>
<p>
Was this a test?
I'm not sure.</p>

		<p>Perhaps he ate ~10% of the monitor as part of a business meal, but saved the rest for personal consumption.</p>

		<p>From the company&#8217;s POV that <i>is</i> a good expense report.  The employee just donated $139 to the shareholders. Ka-ching!</p>

		<p>&gt;Meals: USD $14, but the receipt is for a $153 flat-screen monitor.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s worse, when he ordered his $14 item (a nice piece of fish), the waiter brought him a flaming phone book&#8230;</p>

		<p>Who in their right mind buys a $153 monitor? It&#8217;s probably a screen with a small TN panel. Instead buy a high quality screen with high resolution and a good panel type (IPS or derivative). Just don&#8217;t buy these cheap crap monitors, if you&#8217;re paying less than $1000 for a screen, you&#8217;re doing it wrong.</p>

		<p>Are you assuming that everyone has specialized requirements on desktop computer displays or a one-size-fits-all home system? There is a huge difference between buying monitors for word processing/internet/coding and gaming/films/computer graphics. Between the various iDevices and a 4K OLED TV, I don&#8217;t even have a current PC at home.</p>

		<p>Spending 1000USD is nuts unless you are graphical designer or similar. For 95% of cases just 200USD is more then enough to get nice IPS or better screen. For 500USD you can get nice 4K calibrated semi-professional monitor</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
