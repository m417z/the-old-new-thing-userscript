<p>Some time ago, the group I was a member of was looking for a conference room in which to hold their weekly team status meeting. The group leader went to the <i>so you want to book a conference room for your weekly meeting</i> internal Web site and, hey wow, there was a slot available in one of the fancy conference rooms for Tuesdays at ten in the morning.</p>
<p> Not all conference rooms are created equal. Most of them are pretty utilitarian in nature with a central table, standard-issue chairs, a speaker phone, a whiteboard against one wall, all the stuff you need for a meeting but nothing particularly noteworthy. But in this particular building were three "fancy" conference rooms right off the lobby with warm wood panelling, a giant flat-screen monitor against one wall, floor-to-ceiling windows on another wall up against the neatly manicured lawn. (I bet these conference rooms were created specifically to impress visitors.) Naturally, these "fancy" conference rooms are snapped up first, and when you try to book a meeting, you nearly always have only the boring rooms to choose from. </p>
<p> "Awesome, we got one of the fancy conference rooms," we thought to ourselves, and we congratulated ourselves on our good fortune. </p>
<p> And then we held our first meeting in the conference room. </p>
<p> The meeting went well at first, but after a few minutes, the roar of landscaping equipment made conversation difficult. </p>
<p> Remember that neatly manicured lawn right outside the window? That lawn doesn't trim itself by magic. It requires a landscaping department to keep the lawn looking neat and green and in good health. And they do that work on&mdash;you guessed it&mdash;Tuesdays at ten in the morning. </p>
<p> It wasn't long before we moved our meeting to one of the boring conference rooms. </p>

		<p>You would think someone would block out the conference room during that time frame to avoid this sort of thing.</p>
<p>Sort of like how we block out our conference rooms on days we&#8217;re using them for parties and potlucks. :)</p>

		<p>I can&#8217;t believe I am the first to tease you about Google using goats instead of lawnmowers. &nbsp;But it is not surprising considering MSFT environmental record:</p>

		<p>Aren&#8217;t goats really icky methane producers? Might as well use (solar-powered?) lawn mowers for that.</p>

		<p>No matter what the topic is, there is ALLWAYS somebody that finds a way to bash Microsoft :-( . I believe (some) people have too much free time.</p>

		<p>We have a fancy new building at the head office. The conference room looks out from underneath a wire-stayed roof on the top floor. When the wind blows, the wires &quot;moan&quot; quite loudly. It makes for interesting comments for anyone at the other end of a phone link.</p>

		<p>Greenpeace is great as a contrary indicator. &nbsp;Microsoft should build a nuclear power plant to power its operations. &nbsp;That&#8217;ll really tick them off.</p>

		<p>That greenpeace article is a joke, right? E-waste, dinging Microsoft for only using 24.4% of it&#8217;s electricity from renewable resources, etc? That can&#8217;t be meant as anything other then a joke?</p>

<p>Google only uses goats on a seasonal basis, to trim fire-prone areas. &nbsp;They do not use them as full-time lawnmowers :-)</p>

		<p>Hmmm. Just like you only ever make the mistake of getting on the empty carriage of an underground train in rush hour once.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a good reason for that carriage being empty. Normally a passed out drunk in need of an adult nappy. It&#8217;s always fun to play &quot;spot the tourists&quot; though :) They only ever last for one stop and then they join the rest of us with our faces crammed up against the window in all the other carriages.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
