<p>
Um, that footer area is where the Back/Next buttons go.
If you remove the navigation buttons, then what you have isn't
really a wizard any more.
</p>
<p>
What you've got there is a dialog box.
</p>
<p>
So use a dialog box.
</p>
<p>
You've ordered a cheeseburger and are trying to remove every last
bit of cheese.
Don't do that. Just order a hamburger if that's what you want.

<p>I would argue that what they serve is false advertising (i.e. how can you call those things hamburgers?).</p>
<p>Go to a place where they grind the meat on site and hand press it into a burger. You will be much more satisfied.</p>

		<p>Setting up a wizard is more work than calling DialogBox() so there has to be some functionality in the wizard dlgproc that they need. I refuse to believe that they don&#39;t know DialogBox/CreateDialog exists.</p>
<p>Killing all child windows can be done with a FindWindowEx+DestroyWindow loop. This leads us back to the real question, why does their dialog have to be based on a wizard?</p>

		<p>My guess would be that they have some kind of general framework that calls up property pages that sometimes act as part of wizards and sometimes standalone, and that the underlying code is structured so that it&#39;s difficult to change the call to PropertySheet(). &nbsp;That said, I love your propensity to call a spade a spade.</p>

		<p>Once, I did just the opposite &#8211; I reimplemented all the structure of PropertySheet based Wizard flow in DHTML. I found many hidden gems in the seemingly simple Wizard framework.</p>

		<p>@The MAZZTer: At In-n-Out Burger you can order odd designs if you know the special names for them (they&#39;re not listed anywhere, a friend with odd tastes told me about them). &nbsp;For example there&#39;s a burger that&#39;s just two buns and a beef patty, nothing else. &nbsp;Unfortunately I can&#39;t remember any of the magic names, I just eat COTS burgers.</p>

		<p>@Azarian Technically the Jewish prohibition on eating meat and dairy is stricter than the prohibition on eating meat which isn&#39;t Kosher. So someone might say &quot;I&#39;ll eat non Kosher meat but not with dairy&quot;. Of course, you then get into the discussion as to whether meat which isn&#39;t Kosher is meat in Jewish law&#8230;.</p>

		<p>sometimes the straightforward way ends up costing more. The dish my wife orders at Taco Bell has been discontinued, yet she is still able to order it by asking for the ingredients, which coincidentally cost LESS than the dish had originally cost.</p>
<p>As far as the analogy goes, perhaps there&#39;s an odd reason why they want to use a wizard.</p>

		<p>Part of the problem is the âwizardâ name, it just sounds like it&#39;ll make everything easy, and people associate it with just clicking âNextâ in installer wizards. I&#39;ve been asked to build wizards, usually including navigation buttons, for use cases where a wizard was a terrible choice of user interface. But people do insist and won&#39;t pay unless you give them a wizard, so you give them a wizard, knowing they&#39;ll like it because it&#39;s a âWizardâ and knowing they&#39;ll never get to compare their situation with alternate reality where they got what they needed so they&#39;ll never realise just how bad your shoddy wizard is.</p>

		<p>@MAZZTer there are actually two different double cheeseburgers on the McDonalds menu, the regular double cheeseburger and the McDouble. The double cheeseburger gets two slices of cheese, the McDouble only one. The McDouble ends up being a few cents cheaper as a result, so that&#39;s the one I order &#8211; minus the cheese.</p>

<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
