<p>One of my colleagues ran across this old news clipping from 20 years ago today.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  <b>Flaw reported in Windows 95</b> </p>
<p> <font size="-1">THE ASSOCIATED PRESS</font> </p>
<p> SAN MATEO, Calif. &mdash; Microsoft Corp.'s long-awaited Windows 95 operating system has a flaw that can freeze up computers when running certain applications, InfoWorld magazine said Friday. </p>
<p> The company is aware of the problem but is shipping 450,000 anyway as part of a preview program, the magazine said. </p>
<p> "I fear that unless Microsoft goes back to the drawing board on this operating system, only light users will get anything out of it," said Nicholas Petreley, the magazine's executive editor. </p>
<p> He said the system's inability to handle several types of sophisticated applications at the same time made it questionable for business use. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I can't find a copy of the original InfoWorld article online; all I can find are citations to it, like <a href="http://articles.latimes.com/1995-03-27/business/fi-47599_1_personal-computer-operating-system"> this one</a> and <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/03/25/business/company-news-flaw-is-pointed-out-early-in-windows-95-software.html"> this one</a>. </p>
<p> The clipping had a handwritten note attached: </p>
<blockquote class="m" style="width: 6em"><div> Bob, </div>
<div style="text-indent: 1em"> You guys may want to respond to this. </div>
<div style="text-indent: 3em"> Mom </div>
</blockquote>
<p> The report was shortly followed by <a href="http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Press+Coverage+of+Windows+95+Bug+is+Overblown%3a+Microsoft+Made+Two...-a016735010"> a rebuttal from Windows Magazine</a>, pointing out that this was a beta release, it is not unusual that an unfinished product has bugs, and that a similar bug in an earlier beta was fixed within two weeks. </p>
<p> ZOMG! A beta product has a bug! </p>
<p> I found it cute that my colleague's mother chose to bring this article to her son's attention. </p>

		<p>I suppose the interesting part for me was to many people in 1995, it was a time when computers and operating systems and software was so new that the idea that it can be shipped with bugs and defects and issues and problems and unexpected behaviors and the like was not understood.</p>
<p>To the point where the Associated Press felt it was newsworthy and threw it on the wire.</p>
<p>That said, I think every media outlet in the world got into bashing the Windows 8 Start &quot;bug,&quot; so I suppose you can keep expecting more gems like this in the future.</p>

		<p>I remember another story that went around the national news that said Win95 was being released with something like 50k known bugs. IIRC: It was conflating incident issues in the tracker (doc misspellings, etc) with functional bugs, but it was still sensationally pushed.</p>

<p>On that same page is an article about IBM licensing an app suite for OS/2. &nbsp;Of the two articles, one of the products became Very successful &#8212; the other, not so much.</p>

		<p>@Keith P:</p>
<p>I remember that incident, though I believe it was NT and not Windows 95. &nbsp;Somebody had leaked the entire DTS, which includes not only document bugs, but every thing ever logged: fixed bugs, duplicate bugs, issues that were by design, etc. &nbsp;The total still got reported as &quot;NT has NNNNN known bugs!&quot; &nbsp;I have learned not to expect too much from the press, but the Open Source crowd on Slashdot had several field days with it, and it seems to me some of them should have known better.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>I remember this incident. The number was taken right after a static code analysis run was made over the entire operating system, so most of the &quot;bugs&quot; were things like &quot;Static analysis thinks there may be a memory leak here. Please confirm.&quot; In other words, they weren&#39;t even defects. They were <span style="text-decoration:underline;">potential</span> defects. (Static analysis had a high false positive rate.) -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>How would it really be news even if a non-beta product with millions of lines of code has a bug? &nbsp;Only if it were of particular severity&#8211;security, particularly damaging, easily triggered, etc.&#8211;would it be newsworthy.</p>
<p>@Anon: More like, the supervisors should never be allowed to do supervision without supervision. &nbsp;Don&#39;t blame user experience designers when bad orders come from above.</p>

		<p>Well even if it *was* a serious bug in the shipped version, Microsoft would&#39;ve denied it anyway, refused a hotfix, called the customer afraid of change, called the bug &quot;By Design&quot; or some absurd insult and fixed it in vNext.</p>

		<p>@Anon I witnessed the hate for Microsoft adding the Start Menu in the first place when Program Manager was considered the height of UX design. The majority of hate comes from people who barely use the Start Menu as it had become unwieldy and instead have short cuts on their desktop, these people shouldn&#39;t be allowed near a computer without supervision. I love Windows 8 and I have no need for emotional crutches like installing Start Menu replacements (Although I am &quot;l337&quot; and use the command line a lot).</p>
<p>&quot;I don&#39;t know that I&#39;d consider Win8&#39;s lack of a start menu to be a &quot;bug,&quot; but I&#39;d definitely argue that the person responsible should never again be allowed to do UX work without supervision.&quot;</p>

		<p>[so I suppose you can keep expecting more gems like this in the future.]</p>
<p>No need to suppose, I remember seeing review on Win10 TP last week that it has so much &quot;flaw&quot; that makes it not a productive choice for consumers. (Basically lots of &quot;old users need to learn where the things are placed&quot; sort of things) Heck, it&#39;s not even a beta release.</p>

		<p>As usual, Raymond is conveniently leaving out incriminating information, but it is described in the linked InfoWorld article, it was an architectural design flaw. Not a fixable bug. The flaw was never fixed in windows 95, because windows 95 was never meant to have this kind of isolation between apps.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>As I noted in the article, I never found the original report, so I didn&#39;t know exactly what they&#39;re complaining about. But the article you refer to doesn&#39;t match the reports. The complaints weren&#39;t about memory safety; they were about apps locking up. Also, the reports were that there was already a fix for the bug. (Though in the article you refer to, I like how people are complaining that a bad driver can corrupt memory. That still hasn&#39;t bee fixed.) -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>OS/2 was running drivers in ring1, that&#39;s a real *fix* compared to NT. In NT (which was destined to become OS/2 3.0) drivers are running in ring0 and can corrupt memory all over. Please fix ASAP.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
