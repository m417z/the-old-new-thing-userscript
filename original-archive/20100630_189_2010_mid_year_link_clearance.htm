		<p>From the Programming Language History:</p>
<p>&quot;1983 &#8211; Bjarne Stroustrup bolts everything he&#39;s ever heard of onto C to create C++. The resulting language is so complex that programs must be sent to the future to be compiled by the Skynet artificial intelligence. Build times suffer.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s the most apt quip about C++ I&#39;ve ever read!</p>

		<p>Too bad about the file associations really.</p>
<p>Most of the programs for which I would have wanted to change the open action *to* expect to have new instances spawned rather than using DDE *and* have no code to register file extensions.</p>

		<p>The main problem with the file types dialogue is that it takes half an eternity to open because it&#39;s busy filling its list box.</p>
<p>But just dropping it was a bad decision. It would have been better to be able to select a file (or other item) and then something like &quot;edit file type&quot; from the menu. Such a dialogue would know exactly where all menu items come from, could edit those that are user-editable, de-register shell extensions in case of trouble, and so on.</p>

		<p>I noticed the new TechNet article has a picture of you in it! &nbsp;I didn&#39;t recognize it, though, is there a way you could get it replaced with a more recognizable picture of you, say e.g., one of your withered hand?</p>
<p>Also, I noticed part of the picture&#39;s name is &quot;en-us&quot; is there a non-English version of you I am unaware of?</p>

		<p>Uh oh, what did I do now&#8230;</p>
<p>*Reads long-forgotten comment*</p>
<p>Okay, that was pretty rantish, must have been in a bad mood that day. I will say, however, that I do still miss being able to easily edit file verbs in Vista/Win7. &nbsp;Your column was interesting and makes its point well, but given the nature of the problems faced it seems like the dialog could have been reworked so that it didn&#39;t pretend to be a &quot;context-menu editor&quot; for a file type, but still allowed for editing and adding custom verbs. </p>
<p>Couldn&#39;t the issues with permissions have been handled by using the HKCU part of the file association mappings? &nbsp;I thought that was a big reason behind the keys at HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareClasses. For kicks I created a new verb under HKCUSoftwareClassestxtfileshellFoocommand and it appeared for me. &nbsp;Is there a reason this wouldn&#39;t work, or is a bad idea?</p>
<p>Of course, if you have a shell extensions that mucks around with the context menu it&#39;s impossible to know what the real end result will be, but it seems like anyone advanced enough to dig through the dialogs to get to the editor should understand that (sadly this is probably a bad assumption).</p>
<p>I&#39;m aware that at some point you have to stop trying to shoehorn something into place and realize it just doesn&#39;t fit &#8212; but it seems like it would be nicer to go buy new shoes instead of going around barefoot. &nbsp;Don&#39;t take this the wrong way; I&#39;m not criticizing or telling anyone how to do their job. I realize I&#39;m not terribly knowledgeable on the subject and don&#39;t have any idea what goes on behind the scenes when features are considered being cut. I just miss them when they are :(</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  If you think like a geek, the Power Options control panel is the logical place for configuring the Power button on the Start menu, because that’s where you control the computer’s power management decisions.
</p></blockquote>
<p>To me it seems like, ironically, Power Options was NOT the logical place. After all, how the button on the start menu works has nothing to do with power configuration. The setting was probably placed there exactly because somebody tried NOT to think like a geek: &quot;who cares that power management and power button user interface are unrelated? They both got &quot;power&quot; in them, so user would expect them to be in one place&quot;. Moving the start menu setting onto start menu settings page was exactly what a geek would do, so I guess everybody benefits from this change.</p>

		<p>Let me tell you that Microsoft also removed parts of the dialog that were NOT broken. Like manually defining a new file extension and *associated file type* without doing it programmatically, defining/editing custom secondary verbs by the user who knows nothing about programming, showing extensions only for specific file types, customizing the file icon and IE related settings like &quot;Confirm open after download&quot;. This is a part of Vista/7 that remains broken by design. A powertoy with all of the functionality of the old dialog/clone of it and the same UI (which no can&#39;t replicate frustratingly) would make millions happier. The whole dumbing down essentially takes away *user* control over command line associated with file types. NOT HAPPY MICROSOFT.</p>

		<p>asdbsd: In the Power Options (Advanced tab) is where you specify things like what happens when you close the lid on your laptop, press the sleep button, or press your computer&#39;s power button. Since that&#39;s where you configure what happens when you press the hardware power button, it&#39;s logical that you would put the configuration for the software power button as well.</p>

		<p>Gabe, it&#39;s logical if you think from a non-geek standpoint. But to a geek how a button in user interface of some random program works (explorer is just another program, after all) has nothing to do with how operating system manages computer&#39;s power. They&#39;re like clouds and stars in the skies: seemingly close for layman, but very unrelated in fact.</p>

		<p>Was it in the design goals of Windows 7 to not support and break compatibility with all 32 bit shell extensions? This is something I feel should change between the majority of the industry has migrated to 64-bit and 32-bit system is too rare to find.</p>

		<p>I mean 64-bit Windows 7 obviously. Why is it not possible any more to run 32-bit Explorer in the RC/RTM when the betas allowed that?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
