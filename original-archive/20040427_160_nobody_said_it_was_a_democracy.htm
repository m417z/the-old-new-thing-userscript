<p>It's proxy season, which means I've been reading through  proxy statement after proxy statement.</p>
<p>  <a href="http://www.allstate.com/investor/proxy/2002/2002proxy.html#toc_de1431_1">  The proxy voting rules for Allstate aren't very democratic</a>.  Scroll down to "How votes are counted and discretionary voting  authority":  </p>
<blockquote class="LeftBorderLine"><p>  The thirteen nominees who receive the most votes  will be elected to the open directorships  even if they get less than a majority of the votes.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p>  Okay, let's see, how many nominees are there?  Oh, exactly thirteen.  </p>
<p>  How convenient.  </p>
<p>  In other words: These thirteen people will be elected to directorships  regardless of what you do.  </p>
<p>  So of course I voted against all of them.  </p>
<p>  Later, I realized that I had fallen into their trap.  </p>
<p>  You see, the only way I could stop these people from becoming  directors was to <strong>withhold my vote and attempt to hinder  a quorum</strong>.  Under these rules, a "no" vote is as good as a "yes" vote!  </p>
<p>  Allstate isn't the only company to rig their elections.  <a href="http://www.baxter.com/about_baxter/investor_information/annual_report/">Baxter</a> and  <a href="http://www.wyeth.com/">Wyeth</a>  (can't find proxy online)  have similarly sham elections.  </p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve taken to withholding my support for all directors and voting the opposite way the directors recommend on most ballot issues.  Not that I own enough shares to make a difference.</p>

		<p>Doesn&#8217;t virtual every single US public corportation handle shareholder elections that same way?   I don&#8217;t recall ever see a BOD slate with more nominees that positions.</p>

		<p>Most of them say that a director must receive at least 50% of the vote to be elected, so that it&#8217;s possible to vote somebody out.</p>

		<p>If you don&#8217;t like the way a company&#8217;s directors are behaving you can sell your shares.  (And if the company isn&#8217;t a monopoly then you can refuse to buy its products.)</p>
<p>How do you do that with a country?  The candidate who gets the second-most votes becomes president, while of course no candidate received at least 50%.</p>
<p>(Then the country invades others whose president got the most votes and more than 50%.  Sure some of those other presidents are nasty, but that still doesn&#8217;t turn the invaders into a democracy.)</p>

		<p>Do you even have the option of not voting?  I&#8217;m not an expert on proxy rules, but in some cases if your shares are held in street name your brokerage firm may vote them if you don&#8217;t mail in the proxy.</p>

		<p>In proxy rules that I&#8217;ve seen for US companies, the proxies have to obey your directions (e.g. withholding votes where you specified withholding), but the proxies are free to vote however they like on issues where you didn&#8217;t give directions.  As far as I can tell, this allows additional issues to be raised and voted on by the proxies, even though the issues were not published in advance and not included on the proxy form.</p>

		<p>The Economist has a good article discussing these issues this week. Apparently the SCC is going to be changing the rules to make things a &quot;little&quot; bit more equitable. Quoting from memory, I believe it was written up as &quot;a good start&quot;.</p>
<p>No point linking to it as it&#8217;s subscription content. You&#8217;ll have to go buy a copy :).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
