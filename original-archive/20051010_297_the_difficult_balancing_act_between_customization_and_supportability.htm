		<p>Are you implying that it should not be Microsoft who revises the icons and graphics in Windows Vista to eliminate remnants of XP and Windows 95? Maybe you are because there are still tons of old icons dating back to Windows 95 in Vista&#8230;</p>

		<p>I think that Raymond is talking about customized Windows XP styles.</p>
<p>It would be the responsibility of whomever made the theme in question.  It is not Microsoft&#8217;s job to fix themes that they themselves did not develop and/or sell.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s my understanding that there are only a handful of signed Visual Styles for WinXP. It&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s going to be a huge job.</p>
<p>Unless, of course, you count the million or so people who use WindowBlinds themes or a hacked uxtheme.dll to accomplish something that XP should&#8217;ve done in the first place.</p>

		<p>Carlos, I&#8217;m willing to be Vista will have all new icons when it ships. It&#8217;s not like Microsoft has a huge army of graphic artists, it takes time to crank out hundreds of 256&#215;256 icons. And if they decide to change the visual look again, all those expensive icons will be out of place.</p>

		<p>Microsoft realized the huge potential of Windows customization back in 2000 or so. I know this because at the time (when XP was still in development) I would get a bunch of referrals from Microsoft every week at Winstep.net, checking out what I was doing.</p>
<p>The single major reason Microsoft did not open the Visual Styles format in XP (which would have caused major grief to Stardock and their, at the time, major cash cow Windowblinds) was because a badly made theme could crash the OS. And, if this happened, the user would of course blame XP and not the theme (as I&#8217;m sure Raymond will agree).</p>
<p>Wonder what will happen now, Microsoft had the time to make a more robust Visual Styles engine for Windows Vista and the market is now ready for commercial themes, as long as they are professionaly made (most of the free stuff is not worth a second look). This is well demonstrated by the existence of companies such as Pixtudio and YellowIcon, something which would have been almost unthinkable when we (Stardock, Winstep, etc&#8230;) pionered Windows customization software back in 1998.</p>

		<p>Vector icons in the future?</p>
<p>Or at least edge-preserving scales.  I know that it&#8217;s not an easy problem, but one can create a high-resolution best-guess of a low-resolution icon.</p>
<p>Anyway, if I had to throw my vote in on this topic, I&#8217;d say that Microsoft has a responsibility to make it *work*, but no responsibility to make it look good.</p>

		<p>And then what happens when Vista+1 comes out with new themable elements? Do people who were using a Stardock-authored visual theme get an &quot;error: this theme was designed for an older version of Windows&quot;? Or shold the theme engine recognize the &quot;theme designed for an older version of Windows&quot; case and magically &quot;fill in the gaps&quot; somehow?</p>

<br />&gt; And then what happens when Vista+1 comes out<br />
<br />&gt; with new themable elements?</p>
<p>Start out with the default Vista+1 theme?</p>
<p>Isn&#8217;t that what Windows XP did?  It doesn&#8217;t default to looking like Windows 2000, I set options to do it (fortunately it only needs around 5 settings).<br /></p>

		<p>You can&#8217;t &#8216;fill in the gaps&#8217; with UI elements (bitmaps) that aren&#8217;t there. So I agree with Norman, it should start with the default Vista+1 theme, but it should also be able to work with older themes &#8211; you just wouldn&#8217;t get the new Vista+1 features. Simple. </p>
<p>The User would get a warning &#8216;This theme was designed for an older version of Windows and some interface elements migh be missing&#8217; when applying older themes. Also, from what I know about the skinning community, you would soon get an updated version of popular older themes.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
