What most people probably don't know is that
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/10/449866.aspx">
Dr.&nbsp;Watson's name</a>
wasn't originally "Dr.&nbsp;Watson".
</p>
<p>
The original name of the diagnostic tool was "Sherlock",
whose icon was a lit drop-stem pipe.
I remember chatting about the Doctor with its author,
<a HREF="http://archives.seattletimes.nwsource.com/cgi-bin/texis.cgi/web/vortex/display?slug=2970862&amp;date=19990709">
the late Don Corbitt</a>, whose office was just a few doors down from mine.
In 1991, he had to change the name from "Sherlock" to "Dr.&nbsp;Watson";
I had forgotten why, but
<a HREF="https://dglasser.wordpress.com/">
Danny Glasser</a> came to my rescue
and reminded me that there was already a debugging tool called
"Sherlock" that had come out a few years previously.
The name had to change,
and the Doctor stepped in to fill Sherlock's shoes.
The icon was originally a doctor's bag, but it changed to the
stethoscope-wielding general practitioner a few months later.

<p>
A note about Don Corbitt.
He was a tall fellow with a deep booming voice,
but he never used it.
Instead, he spoke in a gentle, reassuring tone,
backing it up with code that was always solid.
I consider it an honor to have worked with him.
Taking up the mantle of keeping the Doctor up to date with the
latest forensic techniques,
I updated it (i.e., rewrote it from scratch) for
Windows&nbsp;98.
I was not a member of the Windows&nbsp;98 team but wrote
the program as a favor to them at great personal cost.
(My then-boss didn't approve of my little side project
and made his displeasure known at my next performance review.)</p>

		<p>Was the .WLG file produced by the Dr Watson ever documented? One thing that annoyed me was that newer versions of Windows didn&#8217;t have the ability to display the .WLG files from the Win95/98/Me versions and I had to open the file in my good old XEmacs and find the stack walk which was at least in readable ASCII.</p>

		<p>Well, you may have gotten chewed out on your review, but the rest of us surely thank you :)<br />
<br />I mean, how many bugs (especially internal, but no small number of customer issues as well) are found and fixed from Watson reports? Many could be reported, diagnosed, and fixed without Watson, but it&#8217;d be a lot harder&#8230;</p>

		<p>My first thought when I saw this: &quot;But everyone knows Dr. Watson&#8217;s original name was Ormond Sacker!&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
