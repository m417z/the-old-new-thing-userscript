<p>A customer reported that a shortcut they deployed to their employees' desktops was triggering unwanted server traffic.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  My customer deploys a shortcut on %ALLUSERSPROFILE%\Desktop, and this shortcut points to an EXE file on a remote server. Once a local user logs on, the computer will try logging onto the remote computer to query information and generate a login failure alert on the server. </p>
<p> Is there any way to stop Explorer from querying the shortcut information? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Fortunately, the customer provided context for the question, because the question the customer is asking doesn't actually match the scenario. The customer doesn't want to stop Explorer from querying the shortcut information; the customer just wants to stop Explorer from contacting the server to get the icon. </p>
<p> The default icon for a shortcut is the icon of the target, and in order to get that icon, Explorer needs to contact the target. But you can override that default. Programmatically, you call <code>IShellLink::SetIconLocation</code>; interactively, you view the shortcut's properties and click <i>Change Icon...</i>. In either case, set it to an icon that doesn't reside on the server. Save the changes and deploy the modified shortcut. </p>

		<p>I problem I have seen with IShellLink::SetIconLocation is that the shell tries to be nice and automatically transforms c:program files&#8230; to %programfiles% even on x64 and you end up with a broken icon for x86 apps&#8230;</p>

		<p>Been there done that. &nbsp;I deployed a installer that created a desktop shortcut pointing to a local executable, &nbsp;but the icon image was accidentally pointing at the server. &nbsp; Everything worked fine and nobody noticed. &nbsp; &nbsp;Two years later the server gets decommissioned then after a while lots of complaints about missing icons&#8230; &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Having the icon file included in the shortcut itself doesn&#39;t mean you&#39;re locked in at all. Not to put too fine a point on it, but Macs have a good UI for setting icons. I say this knowing full well this will devolve to Mac vs PC arguments :(</p>
<p>Right now, depending on which media player I installed last, the exact same problem Raymond describes happens to my media files. I&#39;m fairly certain users are already in some kind of icon hell.</p>

		<p>&quot;Right now, depending on which media player I installed last, the exact same problem Raymond describes happens to my media files.&quot; No it doesn&#39;t. All of your files of <em>the same type</em> [where &quot;type&quot; is e.g. &quot;AVI&quot; or &quot;MP3&quot;, not &quot;media files&quot;] have the same icon. And all of your files open with the application implied by the icon.</p>
<p>The Mac (I assume you mean mac classic, I don&#39;t know what OSX does) way, where you can copy an icon to the clipboard and paste it in file properties, puts the icon in the file [I think it&#39;s the actual file, not the alias &#8211; this works because all mac files can have resources] as a resource. The icon will not change if you uninstall the program that can open the file, or install a new program that opens that kind of file. (Even one that takes over the same creator code, such as a new version of the same program). So, yes, you <em>are</em> locked in to that icon.</p>

		<p>How is using IShellLink::SetIconLocation not the same type of lock in as storing icons in shortcuts? Sure it has narrower scope, but depending on what you&#39;re doing with it, could cause exactly the problem Raymond describes.</p>

		<p>One of my pet peeves is installers that create shortcuts with *an icon on the CD itself*. Yes, it exists; some people apparently assume one never switches disks.</p>

		<p>Boris, because the icon that the shortcut points to (&quot;by reference&quot;) can change. You aren&#39;t copying the icon&#39;s bitmap into the shortcut (&quot;by value&quot;).</p>

		<p>&gt; That creates its own problems, because it means that the icon is &quot;locked in&quot; at shortcut creation time.</p>
<p>I think if the &quot;lock in&quot; is only provided for paths that&#39;s clearly network path, people would understand. The &quot;Change Icon&quot; button can be used to refetch the icon if it&#39;s needed to refresh (handly to put in online help).</p>
<p>I think most people concern more about performance than &quot;icons that doesn&#39;t refresh&quot;. And those who&#39;d really concern are likely to be capable of remembering the new rule once it&#39;s been told.</p>

		<p>@Cheong</p>
<p>We weren&#39;t talking about a performance issue. &nbsp;This is about avoiding login failure alerts at the server.</p>
<p>It&#39;s not some blocking call and there is an icon cache already noted. &nbsp;The user isn&#39;t really going to see any real performance problems from this &#8212; being unable to see the icon for a couple seconds would be an extreme circumstance. &nbsp;You could maybe come up with circumstances where a crappy server or crappy network is DOS&#39;d by a bunch of machines booting up simultaneously, but that&#39;s not going to be an issue for &quot;most people&quot;, whereas locked in icons would.</p>

		<p>@Ens: Yes, it&#39;s not about performance. I&#39;m just talking about whether &quot;embedding the icon to shortcut file itself if target is EXE on network&quot; would be acceptable / could be justified.</p>
<p>Also note that any access to non-local resources bears performance cost. Since even the cache may miss, performance benefit would be another reason to favour it behave that way.</p>

<p>Around me people accept the things they can understand: it appears slower because it is on the network is fine. Firefox 3 icons opening Firefox 4 is a lot harder to explain and understand. But maybe that is only us.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
