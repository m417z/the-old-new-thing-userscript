<p>On an internal mailing list, a colleague asked for some recommendations on a webcam.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I was wondering if there are any models I should avoid or defiantly get. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I got this mental image of my colleague giving the salesperson the finger as he handed over his credit card. </p>
<p> My colleague explained, "That's an error I frequently make because Outlook by default autocorrects 'definatly' to 'defiantly' instead of 'definitely'. You should see the reaction from my manager when he asks me to do something and I write back, 'I'll defiantly do that.' I'm a terrible speller. That's why I went into math: Only single letters." </p>
<p> But the kicker was the end of his original message. </p>

		<p>But since Outlook is used mostly in the office, why prefer &#39;defiantly&#39; to &#39;definitely&#39;? Is defiance more common than definitiveness?</p>

		<p>@Boris</p>
<p>My physic powers tell me it’s because &#39;definatly&#39; is closer to &#39;defiantly&#39; then it is to &#39;definitely&#39;. &#39;definatly&#39; and &#39;defiantly&#39; have only 2 letters transposed whereas &#39;definatly’ to &#39;definitely&#39; has an a replaced with an I and extra e. I can definitely see why the algorithm decided to make the choice that it did. You make it sound like someone hard coded every possible misspelling and correct spelling and should have taken the most use case of office into account.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t know about Outlook (which I don&#39;t use), but my psychic powers say that it uses the same autocorrection and spellchecking engine as Word (which I use a lot). In Word, the autocorrection list is a simple list of pairs of words, such that if the first one in the pair is written, it gets silently replaced with the second one. In Spanish it&#39;s almost crazy. I&#39;m a pretty good speller, and most of my spelling mistakes are typing errors. But the autocorrection feature almost always put the wrong word. This is infuriating when it replaces an existing (but uncommon) word or name that isn&#39;t in the spelling checker&#39;s list. So disabling autocorrection is the first thing I do after installing Word. The spellchecker&#39;s red underline is more than enough to catch errors.</p>
<p>Btw: Word&#39;s autocorrection list and spellchecker&#39;s suggestions has been used in my country many times to try to prove that Microsoft is misogynist, homophobic or racist. I know, it&#39;s stupid, but a company of the size of Microsoft should take care with those details (you know, bashing the most successful software company on Earth is such a fun sport!).</p>

		<p>For this and other reasons (mainly that I write mails in two languages and I couldn&#39;t care less to switch the language) I usually turn the automatic corrections off.</p>
<p>However sometimes, auto correction turns on itself again and returns. Just like herpes.</p>

		<p>Since &quot;contact&quot; is down (and I am a bad boy) I wrote a namespace extension like cabview.dll/zipfldr.dll for XP this week. I am depressed that in GetOpenFileName the context menu is missing for the root folder (but it&#39;s fine in Explorer.exe) in all of these cases, and PathFileExists fails even though OFN_FILEMUSTEXIST works.</p>

		<p>@kog999: in fairness, spelling correctors that do not correct &quot;definatly&quot; or &quot;definitely&quot; *are* broken, IMO. This misspelling is so common that it *should* be on an exception list. Or you can tweak the algorithm to take word occurrence into account &#8212; &quot;definitely&quot; is more common than &quot;defiantly&quot; (by far), so misspellings of the former are likewise. You don&#39;t need statistics on usage in Office for that (although Office is as representative as any corpus, presumably).</p>
<p>An algorithm that results in &quot;defiantly&quot; is understandable, but open to improvement. Google, for what it&#39;s worth, gets this right. So does Bing, if we want to keep it fair. In fact, the first hit on Bing is particularly relevant.</p>

		<p>Seriously are people suggesting that a spelling corrector should treat a badly spelled word as the more likely mistake than a mis-typed one?</p>
<p>definatly &#8211; defiantly. &nbsp;All the right letters, simply two adjacent ones exchanged .</p>
<p>definatly &#8211; definitely. &nbsp;1 extraneous letter, and 1 completely wrong letter.</p>
<p>By any reasonable expectation, &quot;defiantly&quot; is the best fit for this mistake. &nbsp;The context of the software in use is irrelevant. &nbsp;The literacy of the user is the bigger factor. &nbsp;A spell checker is never going to be able to cope with someone who not only doesn&#39;t know how to spell a word or has mis-typed it, but who is spelling it phonetically and thus completely wrongly but in a way that makes the word they actually typed appear to be closer to some other word (or possibly even an entirely correct word which simply wasn&#39;t the one they intended).</p>
<p>What next ?</p>
<p>Should it always change &quot;crush&quot; to &quot;crash&quot; because someone is more likely to be writing an email on a computer about a software fault than they are to be writing about a juicer or slushy maker ?</p>
<p>Sheesh.</p>

		<p>Similarly to the &quot;manger&quot;/&quot;manager&quot; one, I recall an e-mail confirming that &quot;Things will go smother after we switch to [component X]&quot;. Seriously, how often do you want things to go &lt;i&gt;smother&lt;/i&gt;? :)</p>

		<p>Current versions of Firefox only give &quot;definitely&quot; as the third possible correction of &quot;definatly&quot;; older versions don&#39;t even offer it as a suggestion. (&quot;definably&quot;, an single-letter correction, comes second.)</p>

		<p>IIRC, most decent spell-checkers (and search engines) use the principle of normalizing text to a pseudo-phonetic form beforehand &#8211; thus &#39;definatly&#39; may easily become &#39;definitely&#39;, even though the letter distance between &#39;definatly&#39; and &#39;defiantly&#39; is smaller.</p>
<p>(of course good spell checkers will take multiple measures of (in)correctness into account, like usage frequency [&#39;definitely&#39; is probably a lot more common in general English than &#39;defiantly&#39;])</p>

		<p>@Jolyon Smith: That&#39;s where statistics come in handy. How often do you recon people want to write definitely vs. defiantly? (especially in business mail). 100 to 1? 1000 to 1? Well something like that. Obviously a good spell checker (or any reasonable AI algorithm) will take that into account.</p>
<p>Also going by hamming distance or similar is a horrible way for spell checkers to work, that&#39;s not how misspell things.</p>

		<p>Search engines (Bing/Google) do an amazing job of spell checking as the approach is based around data-collection rather than algorithmic. Definatly to definitely is very difficult from an algorithmic point of view, and very easy from a &quot;millions of humans hitting my database with a misspelling then picking definitely&quot; point of view. It seems that Google/Bing are capable of correcting almost any misspelling that I am capable of producing. Normally as the only &quot;did you mean&quot;.</p>

		<p>Then again the spellchecker is (imho) more there to correct typing mistakes than to help people who don&#39;t know how to spell the word in the first place.</p>
<p>But that&#39;s just me, maybe because I do know how to spell most words I want to type, and if not I follow Ben&#39;s method of entering it into Google and seeing what that says.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t think it would be a good idea to auto-correct &quot;manger&quot; to &quot;manager&quot;. &nbsp;On the other hand, I would support adding a red squiggly to words that are incredibly rare in business communication and similar to incredibly common words, and letting the user choose &quot;Ignore this word through current document&quot; in the remote case where they are writing a sermon.</p>
<p>On a related note, a Microsoft employee (whom I will not name) once sent out a newsletter which mentioned that on a particular holiday, &quot;the fags were flying at half-mast&quot;. &nbsp;I filed a Word bug claiming this particular F word is totally inappropriate in any business communication, and I was using Office <em>Professional</em> version of Word. &nbsp;(My finger muscle memory didn&#39;t even let me reproduce the error while typing this comment, I went back and changed it) &nbsp;The response from Microsoft was to do nothing&#8230; apparently helping their users correctly write business documents is unimportant.</p>

		<p>@voo &#8211; it&#39;s precisely how I want MY auto-correct to work because in 99.999% of cases I know perfectly well how to spell the word and the greater likelihood is that my fingers fumbled the typing slightly as I am also a comparatively fast touch typist.</p>
<p>Your approach comes at the problem from the point of view that most people are illiterate. &nbsp;Auto-correct is not the correct solution to that problem. &nbsp;The answer you are looking for there is: Education. &nbsp;Having technology act as a crutch for people that simply cannot spell is not going to improve their situation when they don&#39;t have that crutch on which to lean.</p>
<p>I note also that you conveniently failed to address whether &quot;crush&quot; should be auto-corrected to &quot;crash&quot;. &nbsp;While you&#39;re at it, how about &quot;bear&quot; to &quot;bare&quot; when I type &quot;bear in mind&quot;, or &quot;saw&quot; and &quot;sore&quot;&#8230; the list goes on ?</p>
<p>And when the auto-correct FAILS to make these corrections, the poor idiot who has come to believe that the computer will ensure they never make embarrassing &nbsp;mistakes comes to believe that they themselves have not made a mistake in the first place.</p>
<p>Trying to correct for people&#39;s stupidity is bound to run into limitations far sooner and more often than correcting for simple mistakes in digital coordination. &nbsp;By all means have tools for making a *suggestion* that perhaps the wrong word may have been used, using contextual analysis and all sorts of other statistical techniques, but NOT for SPELLING correction, and certainly not AUTOMATIC correction, which is what we&#39;re talking about here.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
