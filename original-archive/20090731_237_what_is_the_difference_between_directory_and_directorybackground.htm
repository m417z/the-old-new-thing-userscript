<p> One item I left off the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/02/4179107.aspx"> list of special progids</a> is <code>Directory\Background</code>. </p>
<p> Recall that <code>Directory</code> is the progid for file system folders (a subset of <code>Folder</code> which represents all shell folders, both file system and virtual). Closely related is <code>Directory\Background</code>, which isn't really a progid, but it is a place where shell extensions can register themselves. Specifically, it's where context menu handlers can register if they want to appear when the user right-clicks on a blank space of a file system folder. </p>

		<p>MadQ: This article was written over a year ago, too!</p>
<p>Heck, maybe two, given the length of Raymond&#8217;s queue.</p>

		<p>Does this work on XP? Because I am using it right now and it appears that only Vista/2008 checks the &quot;Background&quot; setting.</p>

		<p>Of course, on Vista in Details view, it is now very hard to click on the background.</p>
<p>Why has the Explorer team seen fit to make Explorer&#8217;s full row selection impossible to disable via UI? (unless I&#8217;m blind)</p>
<p>Sincerely, A concerned citizen.</p>

		<p>Medinoc: Just goes to show how tastes differ. For XP, I&#8217;ve got a nasty App_Init DLL hack that always enables full row selection for ListViews in detail mode. It also forces TreeViews always show lines, and forces both to always show the selected item(s).</p>

		<p>Oh please tell me how to get lines back in treeview&#8230; it&#8217;s hard to calculate relative paths nor see parentage in large lists&#8230; the eye doesn&#8217;t follow vertically well, and it can be easy to confuse depths in trees.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
