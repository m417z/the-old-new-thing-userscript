<p>One of the problems beginners run into when they start using shell common controls is that they forget to call <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/common/functions/initcommoncontrols.asp"> the <code>InitCommonControls</code> function</a>. But if you were to disassemble the <code>InitCommonControls</code> function itself, you'll see that it, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/08/55954.aspx"> like the <code>FlushInstructionCache</code> function</a>, doesn't actually do anything.</p>
<p> Then why do you need to call it? </p>
<p> As with <code>FlushInstructionCache</code>, what's important is not what it performs, but just the fact that you called it. </p>
<p> Recall that merely listing a lib file in your dependencies doesn't actually cause your program to be bound to the corresponding DLL. You have to call a function in that DLL in order for there to be an import entry for that DLL. And <code>InitCommonControls</code> is that function. </p>
<p> Without the <code>InitCommonControls</code> function, a program that wants to use the shell common controls library would otherwise have no reference to COMCTL32.DLL in its import table. This means that when the program loads, COMCTL32.DLL is not loaded and therefore is not initialized. Which means that it doesn't register its window classes. Which means that your call to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/windows/windowreference/windowfunctions/createwindow.asp"> the <code>CreateWindow</code> function</a> fails because the window class has not been registered. </p>
<p> That's why you have to call a function that does nothing. It's for your own good. </p>
<p> (Of course, there's the new <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/commctls/common/functions/initcommoncontrolsex.asp"> <code>InitCommonControlsEx</code> function</a> that lets you specify which classes you would like to be registered. Only the classic Windows&nbsp;95 classes are registered when COMCTL32.DLL loads. For everything else you have to ask for it explicitly.) </p>

		<p>If I understand correctly, then this implies that even if I have the call to InitCommonControls in a code block that is never executed (but not optimised away by the compiler) or if I use the common controls before calling ICC (by, say, putting it at the end of WinMain), it should still work?</p>

		<p>Because you shouldn&#8217;t be relying on it. Just call InitCommonControlsEx like the documentation says.</p>

		<p>So when are the Win95 classes registered?  In DllMain?</p>
<p>That would mean that the standard classes are always registered, and the non-Win95 ones get registered only when ICCEx() is called.  And that comctl32.dll broke the DllMain rules.</p>
<p>Steven, experiment seems to show that you&#8217;re correct.  Interesting!<br /></p>

		<p>Thanks Seth. That explains why I had some trouble creating window classes with names colliding with the COMCTL32.DLL ones even when I didn&#8217;t actually call ICC. The only way around that was skip to using LoadLibrary.</p>

		<p>For quest:</p>
<p>InitCommonControls doc:<br />
<br />&quot;This function is obsolete. New applications should use the InitCommonControlsEx function.&quot;</p>
<p>InitCommonControlsEx doc:<br />
<br />&quot;Registers specific common control classes from the common control dynamic-link library (DLL).&quot;<br />
<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
<br />Is logical. At the time when InitCommonControls was created and documented, it did load all available (at that time) control window classes.<br />
<br />But if you read the documentation of InitCommonControls, you know is obsolete and you should not use it.</p>

		<p>According to Mike Dimmick (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://mikedimmick.blogspot.com/2004/07/changes-to-win32-api-in-longhorn_11.html" rel="nofollow">http://mikedimmick.blogspot.com/2004/07/changes-to-win32-api-in-longhorn_11.html</a>) there&#8217;s a Histogram control coming in Longhorn&#8217;s common controls.  (Like the Task Manager CPU usage I&#8217;d assume?)</p>
<p>I hope that this ends up being true&#8211;Despite Microsoft&#8217;s shifting emphasis to WinFX/Avalon, there is still a good use for classic Win32 controls provided by the OS.</p>

		<p>Hmmm, but in my opinion if someone who does not know this and reads the documentation for InitCommonControls:</p>
<p>&quot;Registers and initializes the common control window classes.&quot;</p>
<p>One would normally think that it registers *all* available common control window classes.</p>

		<p>Why was &quot;Ex&quot; chosen as the extension for a new version of a function call?  Why not &quot;2nd&quot; or &quot;_2&quot;?  What happens when there&#8217;s a third version?  &quot;ExEx&quot;?  I presume there&#8217;s some bit of interesting history here that *someone* must know.</p>

		<p>Yeah but, there is only written that you *should* use the InitCommonControlsEx function. But there is no word that this is a *must* for window classes other than the Windows 95 classes.<br />
<br />I think there is missing a sentence about it in the documentation, but don&#8217;t lets discuss too much on it. ;-)</p>
<p>Ryan: No need for an InitCommonControlsExEx, the INITCOMMONCONTROLSEX structure has a size field, that means Microsoft can extend the structure if the functions needs more parameters.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
