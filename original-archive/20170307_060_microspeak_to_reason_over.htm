Today's Microspeak is the phrase <i>reason over</i>.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>

and relationships contained in the schema model generated by DACFx.

it,

</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
To <i>reason over</i> something is to be able to make programmatic decisions
about them,
usually to produce a higher-level result.
</p>
<p>
For example, if you have a bunch of digital photos and you can obtain the
date the photo was taken, then you can <i>reason over</i> the photos
and do simple things like sort them chronologically,
or more complex things like
look for date clustering and attempt to infer events.
If you also had location information,
you could reason more confidently over the photos
to identify photos taken at the same event.</p>

		<p>The API doesn&#8217;t reason over things. The API allows <i>you</i> to reason over things. In other words, the API provides information. You use that information to make higher-order decisions.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Learn about&#8221; is less accurate. To learn about something implies that what you learn is true (and also has a connotation of receiving an answer from an external source of truth rather than finding it on your own), while reasoning about it may lead you to an incorrect conclusion. Really what we&#8217;re talking about simply seems to be inductive reasoning, so &#8220;reason over&#8221; is a pretty good shorthand for it in my opinion.</p>

		<p>It feels like there&#8217;s an implication of a collection here: i.e. you couldn&#8217;t reason over a rock, but you could reason over a rockslide.</p>

		<p>I replaced &#8220;reason over&#8221; with &#8220;make decisions about&#8221; in every sentence and it was then not Microspeak but correct English.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ll take &#8220;correct&#8221; and understandable English over the nonsense of &#8220;reason over&#8221; any day, even if some of the finer points of the Microspeak phrase get lost in translation.</p>
<p>What part of &#8220;to reason over&#8221; is not captured in &#8220;make decisions about&#8221;?</p>

		<p>Seems to me that there isn&#8217;t one original meaning, but four slightly different meanings which are ambiguous.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
