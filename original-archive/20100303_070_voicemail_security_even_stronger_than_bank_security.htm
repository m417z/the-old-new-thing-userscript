		<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/12/04/9932270.aspx" rel="nofollow"></a> There have been cases in the past where an outside user (non-employee) with knowledge of your voicemail password and your company phone number can make long-distance phone calls using the company phone system.</p>
<p>So my guess is that your ATM PIN is only 4 digits because it&#8217;s only your money at risk, whereas the voicemail PIN is 8 digits because the company&#8217;s money is at risk.</p>

		<p>Actually, even though the ATM PIN is only 4 characters, it also requires your ATM Card (that thing in your wallet). &nbsp;This combination increases the security greatly. &nbsp;Even if you tell everybody your ATM PIN, if they don&#8217;t have your card, they get nowhere. &nbsp;Compare to Voicemail password. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>I have a very nice piece of black tape over the voicemail light on my phone. &nbsp;Its been there for almost 3 years now (more or less precisely since 45 days after we upgraded phone systems and it demanded a strong password that had to be changed every 45 days). &nbsp;I should remember to mention this fact to my new boss I suppose.</p>

		<p>You could make it stronger still by requiring that no two consecutive digits could be on the same row of the keypad&#8230; which means no repeating digits&#8230;</p>

		<p>PaulS: requiring that no two consecutive digits could be on the same row would probably make the passwords a lot weaker and more prone to brute force since the search space would be greatly reduced.</p>

		<p>I used to work in the company telecom section. The voice mail password reset request was a single biggest job we can have. After the holidays, like labor day etc. you got flood of calls for VM password reset. There were two kinds of reset though, one was to just reset the VM password another to reset the VM mail box which was referred to blow up the VM box. Some of my new hires often blew the senior management VM box and got many angery phone calls as well.</p>

		<p>Leave a door open and no one will come in, lock it up and people will think there is something worth getting in for &nbsp;&#8230;</p>
<p>And then there is the old proverb about killing &nbsp;a mosquito with a cannon</p>
<p>Whatever the case when you lock up everything and it becomes to common place, then people put less importance on the things that really do need to be secure.</p>
<p>I think most people are overwhelmed and buried in passwords for everything in life, phones, web sites, banks, computer logins, luggage you name it. No way you can&#8217;t keep using a few of the same codes which of course leads to less security. &nbsp;One of the biggest security leaks is the overuse of security.</p>

<p>No it doesn&#8217;t. It requires a card with matching account info on the magstrip, which is easy to copy. Couple a skimmer to a camera that records your pin and security goes to hell. It was only last year that my credit union sent me a new card because someone put a skimmer on their ATM.</p>

<p>I use marching passwords for this sort of thing. What sucks is when you have 2-3 password authorities on different schedules &#8211; there&#8217;s often no reason for them to be different, but keeping them in sync is a pain.</p>

		<p>In Microsoft&#8217;s case, the Voicemail password is not just the VM password, it also gives you access to your email, calendar and the company&#8217;s address book. Hence the reason to enforce a strong password, in the same way as Outlook. Exchange Um can be considered a client in the same way Outlook is.</p>

		<p>It also probably helps to pick a different length than most common ones. &nbsp;My bank uses a 4-digit PIN for ATM cards but a 5-digit PIN for phone banking, primarily to force people to pick something different for each one.</p>
<p>(Of course, I suspect a lot of people just use the same number with one digit repeated, or some other silly variation.)</p>

		<p>My organization requires that all passwords be strong and changed every 60 days. *All* passwords. In consequence of which, rather than having the reasonable security offered by writing long, random passwords into scripts used by remote sites, we have all our data on a public, anonymous ftp server.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m actually not opposed to this arrangement, but I suspect it&#8217;s not what the security people would consider ideal.</p>
<p>(Also, my PIN is 8 digits long. It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if your bank let you set yours similarly.)</p>

		<p>Voicemail PINs at our company are five digits. By coincidence, internal desk-to-desk numbers are five digits also. Guess what the default (and recommended not to change) PIN is set to for each user?</p>

		<p>I think the people who set password policies *do* know how users will react, but they also realize they have no incentive to promote actual security, and every incentive to create policies that sound good to management.</p>

		<p>@Aneurin &#8212; I&#8217;ve only very occasionally encountered ATMs that don&#8217;t let me enter an 8-digit PIN (weirdly, cheap off-brand ATMs in Mexican shoppes worked, whereas Chase ATMs in Times Square did not). In other countries, my debit card was usually rejected for other reasons (but when it worked, my PIN was accepted).</p>

<p>I wouldn&#8217;t say copying the magstrip off a card was easy. For starters you need to have a skimmer and a machine to spit out a copy of the card. That&#8217;s far from impossible, but a lot more effort than downloading a free brute-forse password hack tool from the Internet.</p>
<p>You also have to have physical access o the card. This step is a lot harder, especially since it must be done without the owner of the card knowing (or they&#8217;ll cancel the card). Then of course you must know the pin. Getting the camera is easy, filming the person entering their pin without them knowing it shouldn&#8217;t be.</p>
<p>None of those things are impossible, but add them together and you&#8217;ve put up significant barriers. Especially given most cards have a daily limit of $1000 or so (here in Australia anyway).</p>

		<p>In the specific use case, yes, it&#8217;s a pain. Of course, it&#8217;s done regularly. People also set up fake atms that are simple skimmers (since we have people setting up real offbrand atms every damn place in this country.</p>
<p>The point here isn&#8217;t that it&#8217;s a challenge. It&#8217;s that a simple device can read your magstrip and duplicate the 2nd factor with relative ease. There&#8217;s no verification here &#8211; it isn&#8217;t like RSA tokens.</p>

		<p>@Dylan and @Kemp &#8212; I&#8217;m not entirely sure, as this particular security, uh, *solution* was around before I got here. But based on more recent experiences, I think anything using encryption is its own special hell. I don&#8217;t think they require that keys be regenerated every 60 days, but I think they do want any SSH access to be host-restricted by at least two firewalls that&#8211;of course&#8211;they control. Either that, or some sort of VPN solution involving a SecurID synchronized code card that would not work even a little for a nightly rsync script.</p>
<p>We probably could have wrestled with them and come up with some kind of rsync+ssh+keypair solution, but by that point it was just easier to stick it on the public FTP and have done with it.</p>

		<p>While I&#8217;m at it, another thing that annoys me is sites that have all manner of bizarre security requirements (I&#8217;m sorry, your password must contain at least one number; I&#8217;m sorry, your password is too similar to the name of a Simpsons character; I&#8217;m sorry, your password cannot be a sexually explicit anatomical impossibility) and then require that it be *no longer* than 8 characters. It completely nerfs my standard insecure password and, typically, makes me add another entry into ~/passwords &#8212; which, yes, makes me a terrible person.</p>

		<p>&quot;(Also, my PIN is 8 digits long. It wouldn&#8217;t surprise me if your bank let you set yours similarly.)&quot;</p>
<p>Surely this would require updating every cash machine in the world?</p>
<p>One thing that particularly annoys me is mandatory password changes on things I access infrequently enough that I *always* need to change it (eg. ZoneEdit).</p>

		<p>Gechurch, skimming isn&#8217;t expensive. Skimming front panels often look very realistic and are available on the black market in the low two digit range.</p>

		<p>Schneier&#8217;s paper, while chiding people for giving out security advice based on speculative threats, is itself almost entirely based on speculation. (And there are even a few errors/lies in it.) Furthermore, it ignores or misinterprets important effects, like the fact that you&#8217;ve got only one life, or that certain things don&#8217;t happen precisely because we do care about security, or that the costs are often born by the wrong people, or that people in general don&#8217;t behave economically rational in the first place, and there is no reason why they would or should.</p>
<p>Personally, I&#8217;m all for making security as easy as possible, but Scheiner&#8217;s report does nothing but muddy the waters.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
