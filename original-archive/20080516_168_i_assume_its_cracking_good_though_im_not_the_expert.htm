<p>I have many friends who are enamored of all things cheese, enjoying the subtle nuttiness of a fribble-frabble cheese or the elastic grassiness of an imported R&uuml;ckw&auml;rtspilzhaus. To me, on the other hand, they all just taste like cheese.</p>
<p> My friends would probably enjoy this weekend's <a href="http://www.seattlecheesefestival.com/"> Seattle Cheese Festival</a>. (Word on the street is that it gets really crowded by midday, so get there early.) </p>
<p> I, on the other hand, would struggle to come up with commentary even as insightful as "Gee, that's salty." I'd probably start with "Hm, I think this tastes like cheese." For people like me, here are some <a href="http://seattlepi.nwsource.com/food/362943_cheeseplate14.html"> tips on putting together a cheese plate</a>. </p>

		<p>It&#8217;s like wine, I like both wine, and cheese (but not wine&amp;cheese). There&#8217;s distinctions among them, but making it seem inaccessible or getting snooty just turns folks off.</p>
<p>For the time being, R&#252;ckw&#228;rtspilzhaus is a googlenope, until they re-index Raymond&#8217;s page here.. Not knowing any German, but being aware of the penchant for new German nouns to be existing nouns &quot;mashed&quot; together, what&#8217;s R&#252;ckw&#228;rtspilzhaus loosely translate to ? (return something house?)</p>

		<p>Nathan_works,</p>
<p>R&#252;ck is a backpack (R&#252;cksack). &nbsp;Haus is house, as you pointed out. &nbsp;I have no idea what w&#228;rtspilz is, other than made-up German that almost sounds valid.</p>

		<p>You really ought to try some challenging cheeses, &nbsp;like Gjetost, and Sapsago, or even wimpier ones like limburger or chaumes.</p>
<p>You&#8217;d be hard pressed to say nothing but &quot;hmm salty&quot;. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t mix them with Surstr&#246;mming though. &nbsp;Best enjoyed one at a time.</p>

		<p>Well, given the translations of RÃ¼ckwÃ¤rts, Pilz and Haus given above, RÃ¼ckwÃ¤rtspilzhaus means &#8220;Backwards mushroom house&#8221; &#8211; whatever that is supposed to be.</p>
<p>As for cheesy stuff, I hope all of you are familiar with the Chupaqueso <a href="http://www.chupaqueso.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.chupaqueso.com/</a>.</p>

		<p>It could also be Reverse- (or Inverse-) Fungus-House (or the Home thereof.)</p>
<p>As a Dutch guy living in Ohio, good cheese is one of the few things I <em>really</em> miss. No offense, but Gouda made in the US is unpalatable. I had to spit it out when I tried it. Even the imported stuff is barely edible. I wonder if the Dutch only send over the low quality wheels (of cheese) on purpose.</p>
<p>&lt;pet peeve&gt;</p>
<p>BTW, when saying Gouda, the G is properly pronounced like the CH in Loch Ness, and the OU as in Ouch.</p>
<p>&lt;/pet peeve&gt;</p>

		<p>That reminds me of the famous cigarette box warnings in the netherlands, that I&#8217;ve seen</p>

<p>There are few different warnings they put on the cigarette boxes. The one that really cracks me up basically says: smoking can make you infertile.</p>
<p>How is that supposed to stop me from smoking ? It makes me want to go out and buy a few packs. The idiots that designed the warning assumed everyone likes children and has the urge to reproduce.</p>

		<p>&gt; As a Dutch guy living in Ohio, good cheese is one of the few things I _really_ miss. No offense, but Gouda made in the US is unpalatable.</p>
<p>As a dutch guy living in the Netherlands and who just returned from his weekly visit to the local cheese shop 15 minutes ago I can only imagine your pain.</p>
<p>That being said, time to make myself a nice ham &amp; cheese sandwich, with a few extra slices of &#8216;jong belegen&#8217; cheese. *drool*. (I also just visited the local bakery so I have a nice loaf of freshly made &#8216;Waldkorn&#8217; bread to put the cheese on).</p>

<p>You can&#8217;t get kroepoek over there ? WTF! As for kroketten, the difficult/expensive part would be keeping them frozen during transport. It might be easier to just make them yourself.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
