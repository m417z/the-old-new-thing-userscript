<p>The Merriam-Webster dictionary gives as the meaning of <i>scope</i> as a verb <a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scope?show=2&amp;t=1310922336"> <i>to look at for evaluation</i></a>, as in "to scope out the competition." But that's not how we use it at Microsoft.</p>
<p> Here are some fake citations: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> The Widgets pop-up shows the available widgets scoped to the current selection. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="m"><p> The results of the search are scoped to the current folder. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Workflows can be scoped to containers, content types (scopeable to containers, sites, collections, servers, or enterprises), or combinations of these. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Okay, that last one wasn't fake. You can tell it's not fake because it is extra confusing. </p>
<p> To be <i>scoped to</i> something is to be limited to or filtered to that thing, or things which apply to that thing. In other words <i>limited in scope to</i>. Here's an attempt to translate those citations into English: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> The Widgets pop-up shows the available widgets which apply to the current selection. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="m"><p> The results of the search are filtered to those in the current folder. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I'm not going to try to translate that last one on there. It has this sort of Escherian feeling to it. "Workflows can be scoped to A, or to B (which can be scoped to A), or combinations of A and B (which means combinations of A, and B, and A's within B's?)" </p>
<p> Another sense of the verb phase <i>scoped to</i> is <i>altered in scope</i>. Usually, the change is to reduce the scope to meet external constraints: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> The proposal has been scoped to meet our December release. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> To emphasize that the scope has been narrowed, you add the adverb <i>down</i>: "scoped down to." </p>
<p> Translation: "The original proposal was too broad and could not be accomplished within the required time allotted, so we reduced its scope to the point where the parts that remain can be accomplished in time." </p>
<p> On the other hand, sometimes scope expands. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Based on customer feedback, the search results have been scoped to include archived data as well. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> And finally, a citation from <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/hellas/availablejobs/cpm.mspx"> an official Microsoft job description</a>: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Oversees the structuring of consulting <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/01/05/9943678.aspx"> engagements</a> to ensure they are properly scoped to meet the customer's requirements profitably. </p>

		<p>Presumably this came from the programming domain, where the scope of an identifier refers to the part of a program where that identifier is bound to a value. From <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(programming)" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Scope_(programming)</a> here&#39;s an example of such usage: &quot;&#8230; a variable might have block scope, meaning that it&#39;s scoped to just a single block of statements.&quot;</p>

		<p>Looks like another case of verbing a noun, except in this case the noun has already been verbed with a different meaning. &nbsp;Here we say things like, &quot;The proposal has been reduced in scope to meet our December release.&quot; which makes much more sense.</p>

		<p>@Brian I don&#39;t know something you build has a scope. Deciding what that scope should be is &quot;scoping&quot; the project. Things where the scoping has happened have been &quot;scoped&quot;.</p>
<p>Of course features creep. Which is a funny concept too. Not counting features you are already aware of requests for do features that know one has thought of yet exist in some nirvana where all the things that would make your life easier live and gradually crawl into the real world product schedule?</p>

		<p>I was beaten by Gabe, but that first useage just doesn&#39;t seem weird or confusing at all to me, or probably to anyone who has taken and remembers anything about their PLs class. Or, rather, the third one still does, only because I don&#39;t know the specific domain meanings of workflows/containers/content types. I would -personally- be more likely to say that an item &quot;has scope of&quot;, rather than &quot;is scoped to&quot;, but one seems pretty clearly derived from the other.</p>

		<p>I think &#39;down scope&#39; and &#39;up scope&#39; are good expressions of narrowing/expanding scope. They make me think of submarines, and submarines are cool, albeit a bit stuffy.</p>

		<p>Doesn&#39;t this come from naval use in ye olde days, when you use a (tele/peri)scope to take a better look at things, thereby making those clearer, but limiting what of the world you actually saw?</p>
<p>That programmers stole the term centuries later&#8230; well, it&#39;s what we do, apparently. Someone also took the term Sprite (another ancient term) to mean those bits of a video game that moved around, and now apparently a sprite is a collection of icons used for buttons by setting background positions in css. That last use is blasphemy as far as I am concerned :P</p>

<p>&quot;Putting clients first by putting employees first.

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
