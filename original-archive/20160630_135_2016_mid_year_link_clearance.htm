		<p>I&#8217;m not sure why, but for some reason I had always imagined your voice sounding more deep and somewhat gravelly, kind of like Garrison Keillor.  Fun watching the videos though, you&#8217;ve always got great stories to tell!</p>

		<p>So I reducing down the problem that plagued me for a week I end up with this: &#8220;How do I read standard input asynchronously?&#8221; I finally ended up spinning up a new thread just to call ReadFIle and when I need to bail out I call CancelSynchronousIo but that&#8217;s rather memory intensive.</p>

		<p>If you enjoyed the detective story and want to read some past posts from Raymond: <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110202-00/?p=11613/" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110202-00/?p=11613/</a></p>
<p>&#8220;This is even more crazily insidious because the OVERLAPPED structure and the buffer are updated by the I/O subsystem, which means that it happens from kernel mode. This means that  write breakpoints set by your debugger won&#8217;t fire. Even if you manage to narrow down the corruption to &#8220;it happens somewhere in this function&#8221;, your breakpoints will never see it as it happens. You&#8217;re going to see that the value was good, then a little while later, the value was bad, and yet your write breakpoint never fired. You&#8217;re then going to declare that the world has gone mad and seriously consider a different line of work. &#8220;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
