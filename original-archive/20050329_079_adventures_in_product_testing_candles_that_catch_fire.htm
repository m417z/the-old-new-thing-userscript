		<p>Amazing. Just Amazing&#8230; Not to be outdone by frying pans that explode when you use them for frying, Nature&#8217;s Finest Candles has issued a product recall [pdf] because the candles catch fire when you light them. This is not&#8230;</p>

		<p>&quot;Nature’s Finest has received four reports of the surface layer of gel burning, creating high flames. There are two reported burn injuries to consumers’ hands, which required medical treatment&quot;</p>
<p>This seems to indicate that 50% of people, when faced with this situation, thought the right course of action was to put their hand in the flame&#8230;</p>

<p>That&#8217;s a humourous take on it, but I&#8217;m guessing that 50% weren&#8217;t able to pull their hands back fast enough after lighting the candle to avoid being burned. The others probably used a longer instrument to light the candles or the high flames didn&#8217;t start right after the candle was lit.</p>

		<p>This has actually happened to me. It caught fire after a while though, and I extinguished it by putting a ceramic plate on top of it.</p>

		<p>I think that if candles exploded some one can get hurt or burned really bad.So you should make candles a little safer.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
