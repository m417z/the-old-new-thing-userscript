		<p>I saw a couple of these signs at some clients we were picking documents up from. &nbsp;Theirs had an extra line which covers your rewrite:</p>
<p>It has been [47] days since last reportable incident.<br />
<br />Longest time without reportable incident: [257] days.</p>
<p>So, I&#8217;m not sure if they have a policy against unecessary accidents, or simply a policy against reporting them&#8230;</p>

		<p>Even more fun: They should display the all-time top ten longest intervals without a breakdown.</p>
<p>And next to each one, they should post the three-letter initials of the person responsible for the breakdown that ended it.</p>

		<p>Tongue firmly planted in cheek, but wouldn&#8217;t that be sort of like: <br />int(GetTickeCount() / (86400*1000)) <br />? I recall once upon a time being tasked to try to make an Exchange server run without crashing, suking up all memory, or destroying its own data store. Uptime was, by necessity, &nbsp;on average less than 2 days (before a reboot was required). </p>
<p>On the other hand, I think I still hold a record of sorts with 285 days (!) uptime on a Windows 2000 (aka NT5) workstation I among other things used to develop software, play games and connect to the internet (obviously through a NATign firewall &#8211; anything less would be a bordercase of criminal neglience). </p>
<p>Obviously also, if I had a bat and a free stroke for every time I encountered a bug, I&#8217;d by now beaten MS into oblivion&#8230; Wouldn&#8217;t surprise me that MS now are again going for &#8220;as designed&#8221; after calling bugs &#8220;issues&#8221; and rootkits&#8230; whatever PR-spin is put on them-</p>

		<p>Hi,<br />
<br />here are my reliability stats:</p>
<p>Notebook: 3 days, 15 hibernations and counting bc I have so many Mozilla Tabs open with interesting stuff</p>
<p>However, enjoy this:</p>
<p>WristPDA &#8211; running for 14 days without softreset<br />
<br />Tungsten T3 &#8211; one month without hardreset</p>
<p>Maybe its an OS issue =) (*ducks*).</p>
<p>Best regards<br />
<br />Tam Hanna</p>

		<p>You could use 0 for the day after too, just to make it sound like you&#8217;re taking it seriously. &nbsp;Customer demand has coerced stations in England to put up dozens of statistics showing how poorly they&#8217;re performing &#8211; which worked for a while, but now just makes you feel they&#8217;re either proud about it or angling for sympathy.</p>
<p>Alternatively, they could all take the day off.</p>

		<p>Hi,<br />
<br />didnt want to flame or piss you off, sorry.</p>
<p>Basically, a single tasker OS can IMHO always be much more stable than a multitasking one. Memory freeup is easy, etc, all is simple and stable&#8230;</p>
<p>Best regards<br />
<br />Tam Hanna</p>
<p>P.s. Windows is cool&#8230;at least its WAAAY better than all those desktop unixes(dodges)&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
