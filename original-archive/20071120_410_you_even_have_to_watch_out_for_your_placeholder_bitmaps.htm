<p>During the betas of Windows&nbsp;Vista, the final set of sample logon pictures had yet to be determined, so a bunch of placeholder bitmaps were created. These placeholders consisted of the letters <i>FPO</i> in a box. <a href="http://desktoppub.about.com/od/layout/g/fpo.htm"> FPO is a standard term in desktop publishing</a>; it stands for <i>For Position Only</i>. In order to permit designers to perform page layout before final images are ready, a For Position Only image with the correct size and shape (but dummy contents) is used. I learned it as <a href="http://www.ieee.org/services/promolibrary/faq.html#WhatdoestheFPOthewatermarkontheprintadsmean">For Placement Only</a>, but the meaning is the same.</p>
<p> We received a bug report from a beta tester in Austria who was surprised to see what appeared at first glance to be the name of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Austrian_Freedom_Party"> the FP&Ouml; political party</a> as several of the logon picture options. Was Microsoft <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2005/12/17/505062.aspx"> taking sides</a> in the political affairs of Austria? No, it was just a coincidence. </p>
<p> I suspect the designers learned their lesson: Don't use publishing jargon in bitmaps, even if it seems harmless. </p>

		<p>&#8230; and I suppose &quot;lorem ipsum&quot; is a political party in Czechoslovakia somewhere?</p>
<p>I suppose if you just put a big &quot;X&quot; in the bitmaps you&#8217;d be &quot;supporting&quot; some country with a flag like that.</p>
<p>I think assigning any weight or significance to this &quot;bug&quot; report is rather idiotic. Hopefully somebody was intelligent enough that it was closed as &quot;not a bug&quot;</p>

		<p>So did they replace it with one that said &quot;dummy&quot;? &nbsp;That at least has a sensible meaning that&#8217;s more or less in common usage, even if it&#8217;s not the first one the user would think of.</p>

		<p>Even the letter X is suspect. &nbsp;I am reminded of a recent news story about &quot;a black X&quot; appearing over the head of a political candidate during a televised speech. &nbsp;Was the television studio passing judgment on the politician by crossing them out? &nbsp;</p>
<p>It turned that the film editing software displayed this X in the center of a box where film media was to be merged, and the editors had accidentally left it in for few frames.</p>

		<p>Those who live in fear of offending anyone, anywhere, will eventually stop doing anything at all.</p>
<p>Austria has a well-known town named &quot;F**king&quot;. &nbsp;I bet that annoys a few people, and what have they done about it?</p>

		<p>I bet placeholder art gets filed as bugs no matter what caption you place on it. &nbsp;&quot;The header is solid white, is it supposed to be like that?&quot; &nbsp;&quot;You copied this header from the &quot;Placeholder&quot; product and forgot to change the name!!!&quot;</p>

		<p>Worse yet is when placeholder graphics make it to production because no one had time to do proper ones, and the placeholders were &quot;good enough&quot;.</p>
<p>Somewhere out there is a Windows CE device that boots up with graphics Mr. No-artistic-skill-at-all (i.e. me) conjured up in 5 minutes with Paint!</p>

		<p>&quot;Austria has a well-known town named &quot;F**king&quot;. &nbsp;I bet that annoys a few people, and what have they done about it?&quot;</p>
<p>The town&#8217;s sign is frequently stolen, and the city talked about renaming to avoid it, but nothing ever came of it. &nbsp;Still, their sign budget is much larger than it should be. &nbsp;I wonder if Intercourse, PA has the same problem.</p>
<p>FPO seems like a bad party to endorse too, they&#8217;re rigidly isolationist and anti-EU.</p>
<p>At some point we&#8217;ll have to abandon all placeholder text and replace it with something like Simlish (from the Sims). &nbsp;Lorem ipsum, you say? &nbsp;Scandalus, replace it.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
