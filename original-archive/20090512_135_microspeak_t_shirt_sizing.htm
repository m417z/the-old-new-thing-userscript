<p><a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/larryosterman/archive/2007/06/01/missed-metaphors.aspx"> Larry Osterman discussed the buzzword <i>T-shirt sizing</i></a>, which means "making extremely rough estimates in terms of a small number of predefined categories." The term comes from the traditional way T-shirt sizes are specified in the United States. Instead of having T-shirts in sizes 4, 5, 6 and so on, there are only a small number of sizes: Small, medium, large, and extra-large. (Sometimes augmented by extra-small, extra-extra-large, etc.)</p>
<p> Forcing the estimate into one of a fixed set of sizes allows the process to go quickly while still producing a result that is at least within the same zip code as a more detailed answer. The idea is not to pin down the schedule precisely but rather to get a back-of-the-envelope feel for whether a project is a two-week project, a two-month project, or a two-year project. </p>
<p> The size breakdowns vary depending on the scope of the project. For a small project, <i>small</i> might mean "less than a day", whereas for a large project, <i>small</i> might mean "less than a week". People can usually come up with a gut feeling as to whether something will take "less than a week" much more quickly than they can say whether something will take one day, two days, or three days. </p>
<p> As the concept of <i>T-shirt sizing</i> spread through Microsoft, it inevitably became the source of a new set of derived jargon. I've seen <i>T-shirt costing</i> on a meeting agenda. Though thankfully I have yet to see <i>T-shirting</i>. </p>

<p>The title is almost correct, but at least you mentioned &quot;T-shirting&quot; in the post :)</p>

		<p>Next week, perhaps you could explain what it means for two estimates of time to be &quot;in the same zip code&quot;, which seems to be an estimate of area.</p>
<p>(Yes, I actually understand the metaphor).</p>

		<p>This reminds me of extreme programming&#8217;s approach to task estimation: every task is scheduled as either 1, 2 or 3 points (or in some teams 1, 2 or 4). &nbsp;If a task is larger than 3 points it needs to be broken down into subtasks because it&#8217;s too big to estimate exactly. &nbsp;The size of each points is somewhat arbitrarily chosen.</p>

		<p>In our team we use Scrum and have similar costing (or sizing) system: S(4), M(8), L(16), XL(32), XXL(64), (and sometimes even XXXL, but those are broken down into smaller tasks right away). The points aren&#8217;t same as the hours, although I often confuse them while costing. I guess with expereince you start to attach number of hourse (personally can take) to each of these sizes. I.e. A small task (4 pts), I can do that in 8 hours.</p>

		<p>In an old team, I was faced with &#8216;old style T-shirt costing&#8217; and &#8216;new style T-shirt costing&#8217;. I still havent figured out what the differences were :)</p>

		<p>T-shirting sounds remarkably like the companion to pantsing.</p>
<p>I hope we don&#8217;t see it, but if so I need 90 days advance notice for any meeting whose agenda specifies &quot;t-shirting&quot; so I can turn it up a notch at the gym.</p>

		<p>As a complete nerd, I&#8217;ve always been really irritated by the &quot;in the same zip code&quot; analogy.</p>
<p>There are many single buildings that have their own zip codes (some more than 1), and other zip codes (e.g. in Alaska) which are larger than most moderate sized states. </p>
<p>As you can probably tell by the building example (but it&#8217;s true with more traditional zip codes too), there are zip codes entirely contained within another zip code, making it a non-unique mapping. </p>
<p>Finally, numerous large areas have *no* zip code associated with them.</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;ve seen numerous people that don&#8217;t fit into any standard T-shirt sizes. </p>
<p>Or some zip codes.</p>

		<p>Guess it&#8217;s just me then that likes the military-style sizing. (At least I know I fit inside a size 38R flightsuit &#8211; better than the S/M/L choice I was offered and had to guess&#8230;)</p>
<p>Then again, we ballpark in the order of magnitude method &#8211; day/week/month/3months/6months/year, sometimes half that. Then we qualify the estimate &#8211; confident, reasonably confident, risky, just a WAG.</p>
<p>Some things are so classic that we can often estimate in days &#8211; e.g., board bringup is normally a week, save fatal design flaws that make it not work period. But designs from existing designs mean the bootloader can be modified in a day, and hardware checkout can progress, then basic OS (kernel, minimal drivers) in a week. Enough to do hardware verification and validation, while everyone else works to get it all working.</p>
<p>Unknown processors, unknown non-volatile memory add to time and decrease estimate confidence&#8230;</p>

		<p>Places with no zip (or in this case, being in the UK post) code are a pain; for a while my car spent nights in the public car park opposite my brother&#8217;s apartment building. Being a car park, it does not receive mail. Not receiving mail, it has been assigned no post code by the Post Office. Explaining this to the first insurance company call center drone was somewhat frustrating: he could not grasp the concept of a place simply not having a post code. Fortunately, when I called back I got someone who understood this and found a solution after escalating the query two levels.</p>
<p>My biggest headache at the moment is dealing with construction people, who seem to think everything should be planned and scheduled with day by day resolution &#8211; probably viable with construction, where it&#8217;s all been done dozens of times before, but in software development&#8230;</p>

		<p>Nothing to add, except re: within the same zipcode: &nbsp;I once discovered on a database project that you can&#8217;t rely on &quot;State&quot; having a functional dependency on &quot;Zip Code&quot;, as Texhoma, 73949 lies in both TX and OK. &nbsp;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
