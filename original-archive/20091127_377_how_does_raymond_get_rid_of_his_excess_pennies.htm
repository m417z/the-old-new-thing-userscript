<p> I use the self-checkout line at the grocery store. The machine has a slot for accepting coins, and you can drop pennies in there until your arm falls off. I don't do this when the grocery store is crowded, since this holds up the line. </p>
<p> (Yes, banks also have change-counting machines, but using the machine is overkill when you have only thirty pennies to get rid of.) </p>

		<p>Coins are evil. I&#8217;m glad I&#8217;m not living in Denmark where coins galore!. I&#8217;m a total nervous wreck each time coming back home. No, seriously. I am.</p>

		<p>I have two bowls in my kitchen, one for quarters (which get used in the laundry machines) and one for all other coins. Since I don&#8217;t carry coins in my wallet, any coins that I&#8217;m carrying when I get home go straight into the appropriate bowl.</p>
<p>The way I get rid of the non-quarters is easy: Coinstar. Every November, I take them to a Coinstar machine and exchange them for a gift card for an online store (that way I don&#8217;t pay a fee to Coinstar), then use that store to buy Xmas presents. The last time I did this, I had over $40 in that bowl.</p>

		<p>I once purchased a mountain bike with rolled coin. I&#8217;m probably one of the few people in the world who have, pound for pound, paid more for a bike than it weighs.</p>
<p>And mentioning weighing money, I once paid about $50 in coin and the store weighed it rather than count it (using a scale something along these lines: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://counting.centralcarolinascale.com/coin_currency_counting.htm" rel="nofollow">http://counting.centralcarolinascale.com/coin_currency_counting.htm</a>)</p>

		<p>I give my pennies to the charity collectors who come door to door in my neighborhood. This kills several birds with one stone. It gets both the coins and the collectors out of my hair. The charity is happy to have any money it gets. &nbsp;And I consider having to carry $50 in pennies for the rest of the night to be just punishment for ringing my door during dinner :)</p>

		<p>I keep my change count down by spending them.</p>
<p>Also my bank has a self service coin counting machine. Dump your coins in, it counts them and prints a ticket, take ticket to teller and they will either deposit into your account or give you notes</p>

		<p>I have an automatic sorting bank that puts coins into rolls on my dresser. &nbsp;At the end of every day, I dump whatever coins I&#8217;ve accumulated in that day into the bank. &nbsp;Once a roll gets filled, I take it and use it on whatever my next purchase is.</p>
<p>Before I had the bank coins would just accumulate. &nbsp;When I first got it and filled it up for the maiden voyage, I ended up with almost 75 bucks.</p>

		<p>In college, I would leave stacks of five or ten pennies in various obscure, hard-to-see places and keep track of how many hours, days or weeks it would take for them to disappear.</p>

		<p>Even better is to just get rid of the cent altogether. In the Netherlands we stopped using 1 cent coins in 1980, every transaction was rounded to 5 cents. When the Euro was introduced in 2002, we got the cent back and it was quite annoying, so in 2004 it was decided that stores could round to the nearest 5 cents again and 1 and 2 cent coins disappeared from everyday life once again. It&#8217;s still legal to pay with them, but nobody bothers.</p>
<p>Since a dollar-cent is worth even less than a euro-cent, why do you still keep using it ?</p>

		<p>I used to do this when I took the commuter train, where buying tickets every day cost about the same as a monthly ticket. A year ago I moved, and now get a light rail system (where I buy a monthly ticket with a debit card) or walk. As a result, I have now accumulated about a kilo of small unspendable coins. Bah.</p>

		<p>@Voo:</p>
<p>In America, it is indeed illegal in the case of 1 cent and 5 cent pieces, but not larger denominations. This is so because only these two coins (so far) are worth more than their face value.</p>

		<p>I save my loose change (or as it&#8217;s referred to here, shrapnel) in a jar. When the jar fills, I visit the bank and get some coin bags, then bring back the full coin bags as a deposit into my account.</p>
<p>I guess a coin-counting machine (like a vending machine) would be less time-consuming, though.</p>

		<p>We&#8217;re getting off topic here, but&#8230;</p>
<p>Just because it costs more than a penny to make a penny does not mean that melting them down is profitable. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The cost of making a penny is more than the cost of the raw materials, and the cost of melting a penny down is not insignificant when compared to the value of a penny.</p>

		<p>Do people not try to make good change? I mean, I always spend my coins, so I never understood why people had change jars.</p>
<p>If something was $9.51, I&#8217;d pay $10.01 or $20.01 to get 50 cents or $10.50 back. Sometimes it comes out funnier, like I had to pay $9.82. I paid $20.07, and got back a $10 bill and a quarter.</p>
<p>Really &#8211; am I the only one that does this? Everyone else pays with a bill and gets oddball change back that they take home? Or are math skills needed to calculate convenient change too advanced for most people? (This isn&#8217;t even the funny change things a few days ago&#8230;)</p>

		<p>BCS, you&#8217;re not the only person who has paid, pound for pound more for a mountain bike than it weighs.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
