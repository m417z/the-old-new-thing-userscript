<p>
A customer had a Web service that runs processes as specific users.
There may be multiple such processes running at the same time
for a single user account.
Here are the questions.
And just to be nice, I've even included the answers.
(Note: These are not my answers. I'm just recording them for posterity.)
</p>
<p>
"Is there a limit to the number of
<code>Logon&shy;User</code> sessions that can exist at a time
for a particular user?"
</p>
<p>
It is limited by available memory.
</p>
<p>
"Once the process exits, what kind of cleanup do we need to 
perform? We don't see a <code>Logoff&shy;User</code> function."
</p>
<p>
When you are done, take the token handle that you got
from <code>Logon&shy;User</code> and pass it to
<code>Close&shy;Handle</code>.
</p>
<p>
"Is there a recommended way to run multiple processes under the
same user account?"
</p>
<p>
When you get a token from
<code>Logon&shy;User</code>,
use that one token for multiple processes.</p>

		<p>Aw, I was hoping these were going to be interesting questions/answers, not really basic ones. I had to add this functionality to a cron daemon type program in the last six months, and spend 60-70% of my time on the project trying to figure out the correct way to manage Desktops and Window Stations and stuff like that. Figuring out how to manage the token was the easy part :)</p>

		<p>&#8220;Programming Windows Security&#8221; by Keith Brown was one of the best assistants to that I&#8217;ve ever had.  The book is admittedly a bit dated(it mentions NT4 and Windows 2000, ffs), however, it gives extremely useful details and background of the logon process, managing tokens, managing ACLs, desktops, window stations, jobs, etc. that are still quite applicable and very useful today.</p>
<p>Kind of like how many people still find Programming Windows, 5th Edition by Charles Petzold is still one of the best introductions to the concepts and basics of Win32 programming, despite the fact that it focused on Windows 98 and NT 4.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
