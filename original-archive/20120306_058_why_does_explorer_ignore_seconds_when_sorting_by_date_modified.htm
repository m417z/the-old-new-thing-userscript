<p> It appears that Explorer is ignoring the seconds in the Date Modified column and sorting only by the hour and minute. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> It's an interesting theory the customer came up with, but the customer was fooled by the fact that he ran the experiment shortly after modifying the <i>TPS 06-05-2012 Report</i> document, so that the real behavior was masked. </p>
<p> When you copy a file, the system preserves the date-modified timestamp. The <i>Date modified</i> column is not ignoring the seconds; in fact, it's comparing them quite carefully, but since the timestamps of the original and the copy are the same, the timestamps compare equal. And when the items compare equal according to the sort criteria, Explorer falls back to sorting by name, and the fallback sort is always ascending. </p>
<p> The confusion would have been cleared up if the <i>Date modified</i> column used the long time format instead of the short time format, but that only pushes the problem to files whose timestamps are fractional seconds apart. You have two files which show up as "6/12/2012 7:00:12 AM" and don't realize that one of them is "6/12/2012 7:00:12.02 AM" and the other is "6/12/2012 7:00:12.89 AM". My guess is that geeks won't be satisfied until Explorer shows the full 64-bit <code>FILETIME</code> so you can see the difference down to the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724284(VS.85).aspx"> 100-nanosecond interval</a>. </p>
<p> (If you want to see the seconds, you can look on the file's property sheet.) </p>

<p>This argument is invalid because XP shows the seconds and Vista does not, meaning somebody somewhere made a conscious design decision to remove existing functionality.</p>

<p>No, they won&#39;t be satisfied until Windows uses a new arbitrary precision date format to store dates as a multiple of the Planck time (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_time" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Planck_time</a>) (offset from the date of the Big Bang, of course).</p>

		<p>Most people who do not know that copy copies the modification time don&#39;t know that FILETIME is more precise than seconds so there would be astoundingly low chance of that not solving the problem right there.</p>

		<p>@Mike Caron; geez, it looks like even 128-bit integers won&#39;t have the necessary granularity (we&#39;re at about 1.4 * 2^184 Planck times since the Big Bang if I calculate this right.)</p>

		<p>Your instructions to press F5 to refresh the view are unnecessary as there is no way in Windows 7/Vista to not refresh/treating sorting as a verb. It&#39;s always refreshed and it&#39;s always sorted.</p>

		<p>@Mike Caron, Re: Y10K/Planck time. &nbsp;I think we need even better granularity than that. &nbsp;The problem is that you can have two files created at the same Planck time. &nbsp;Or, at least, their metadata could state as much. &nbsp;I think we need at least a 1024-bit GUTS (Globally-unique timestamp) system. &nbsp;The guts of GUTS would be, essentially, a monotonic clock of events in the universe. &nbsp;Now, we get into a problem of two events that cannot be ordered stably in all frames of reference, so we&#39;d have to choose an appropriate frame of reference of course. &nbsp;The beauty of the system would be that every file, syslog event, birthdate, death and TV show air time would be given a unique 1024 bit number.</p>
<p>Now, I figure 1024 bits should be enough because a 256 bit timestamp should handle Planck time through the existence of the universe and the additional 768 bits could be disambiguators. &nbsp;We would, however, need a central server to coordinate the timestamping. &nbsp;I figure once quantum computing is up and running in five or ten years we can just put quantum clients everywhere to handle this though. &nbsp;That should be trivial once we hash out a new RFC.</p>

		<p>Calculating a little more carefully:</p>
<p>1 Planck time = 5.4e-44 seconds</p>
<p>Age of universe = 1.37e10 years * (365.242 days/year) * (24 hours/day) * (60 minutes/hour) * (60 seconds/minute) / (5.4e-44 Planck times/second) = 8.01e60 Planck times</p>
<p>log10(age of universe in Planck times) = 60.9</p>
<p>so log2(age of universe in Planck times) = log10(age of universe in Planck times) / log10(2) = 202.3</p>
<p>So we need 202-203 bits just to store current time stamps. &nbsp;But we should of course future-proof the design; perhaps we should invoke RFC 2550 dates (with particular attention paid to section 2.4.2)</p>

		<p>btw Mr chen should do more blog posts about shell programming.</p>
<p>Like drag and drop. Many programs does it wrong even internet explorer. In windows 7. Try dragging a url from it to chrome and see the desktop and taskbar icons flash and a performance drop (lag, mouse stops responding for about half a second while dragging url). ( And thats on an intel i7 gaming machine, nice job ie team ! Did you work on vista too ? )</p>

		<p>@Mr Planet</p>
<p>Talking about vista reminds me of windows 8. Windows 8 is vista but with a tablet twist. Windows 8 is unusable on a normal keyboard and mouse computer.</p>
<p>No start button !!</p>
<p>No more win key, type app name and enter key :(</p>
<p>Windows 8 is a design disaster for computer users equal to how vista was a performance disaster.</p>
<p>Who&#39;s to blame for these retarded and obviously really bad design decisions ?</p>
<p>Thinking that what does <em>not</em> work for windows phone will work for a computer user.</p>
<p>They might work for tablet with touch but NOT for computers with keyboards and mouse.</p>
<p>I always start to rant when talking about how stupid microsoft can be.</p>
<p>It really irks me, so many work at microsoft and no one are saying how bad this will be for computer users ?!</p>

		<p>In general relativity, there is no such thing as an inertial reference frame &#8211; relative velocities only make sense for point particles at the same point of spacetime.</p>
<p>And having said that, can we please have timestamps in Star Trek stardate format (with *lots* of decimal points).</p>
<p>Anyways, maybe a generic framework can be designed for the next version of Windows where users can create/install add-ins that provide hooks that explorer calls to provide date sorting. A dialog box can be shown every time explorer is launched that allows the user to pick their date sorting preference (with the previous choice being the default, for usability). This would have the advantage of pleasing everybody: those who believe the universe is 13+ billion years old, those who believe it&#39;s 6000 years old, those who believe it&#39;s as old as they are, those who just want to sort by Created Date instead of Modified Date&#8230;</p>

		<p>concerning the various comments about preferred sorting in Explorer. There&#39;s a registry switch for Explorer which allows to switch between two sorting algorithms. I don&#39;t remember in detail, a Google search will tell you more.</p>

<p>@lol: &nbsp;Yep. &nbsp;I suspect there are two (or more) factions within Microsoft and the wrong one (from our perspective) came out on top. &nbsp;I can&#39;t imagine any Microsoft developers actually like doing development work on Windows 8. &nbsp;The transition from the &quot;classic&quot; desktop to the Start screen is far too jarring for my tastes. &nbsp;The &quot;workaround&quot; is to pin your most used apps to the taskbar, but there&#39;s only so much room. &nbsp;Probably better to create a toolbar with all your apps, but at that point you&#39;ve gone and reinvented the &quot;classic&quot; Start menu. &nbsp;Mind boggling, really.</p>

		<p>You are referring to changing the sort order of numerals. And the comments was referring to the completely different problem of Vista/7 always keeping files sorted which makes monitoring folders for new files or sequentially renaming multiple files a usability nightmare. Or copy-pasting multiple files and if you want to do something else with them after the paste, change their selection or extracting many files into a folder already containing many files etc. Apparently, it&#39;s by design and MS is too arrogant about making it optional. It&#39;s a serious usability flaw in Explorer.</p>

		<p>You can turn off the numeric sort in Explorer as follows:</p>
<p>Elevated command prompt | gpedit.msc | Local Computer Policy</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;User Configuration | Administrative Templates | Windows Components</p>
<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Windows Explorer | Turn off numerical sorting in Windows Explorer (enable)</p>
<p>Besides the YYYMMDD vs. YYYYMMDDHHMMSS problem, this also causes issues if you have a directory with a bunch of entries that have GUIDs in their names.</p>

		<p>The article &quot;The checkbox, the mating call of the loser.&quot; is against the very basic principles of UI backward compatibility of Windows from 95 to XP and why it what it is today and why Vista failed. Vista&#39;s UX was FAIL (because Jim Allchin who used to force backward compatibility couldn&#39;t give a 100% to it and because it removed choice.) Never thought I would have to teach UX to the guy who wrote TweakUI.</p>

		<p>THANKS GOODNESS I can still disable &quot;hide extensions of known file types&quot; disastrous setting. Why disastrous? Too many people fell victim of clever viruses disguised as an MP3 or JPEG file, including a friend of mine, who lost his JPG files. I don&#39;t care if Raymond calls me a loser for having that checkbox. It&#39;s a shame MS UI group still have people who come all the time with such ideas as &quot;search animated character&quot;, or &quot;desktop cleanup wizard&quot;, or Win8 server control panel (replacement for the management console), or God forbid, Metro.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
