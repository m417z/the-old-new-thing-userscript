<p>Microsoft has an internal conference known as <a href="http://www.facebook.com/TechReady"> TechReady</a>, the eleventh edition of which will take place in Seattle next week.</p>
<p> Having learned that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/10/07/9904046.aspx"> the way to get me to show up at your conference is to invite me</a>, the TechReady folks invited me to give a talk on advanced debugging techniques. I wasn't their first choice, though. This talk is a regular event at TechReady, but the usual presenter (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/10/21/9008384.aspx">Lav Pivo</a>) will not be available; I'm a substitute. Lav usually knocks everybody dead with his presentation, so I've got big shoes to fill. </p>
<p> I've been trying to squeeze preparing for this talk in amongst the things I actually get paid to do, and I hope I'll get everything done before the conference organizers start yelling at me for not having gone through all the checklist items on schedule. </p>
<p> If you're a Microsoft employee at TechReady, you can watch me sweat and panic on Friday at 1pm. I'll also try to make it to Ask the Experts on Wednesday night. </p>
<p> <b>Update</b>: The presentation is technically a <i>Chalk Talk</i> (code CLICT400, and no I don't know what those letters stand for, though the CT probably stands for Chalk Talk), in case you were wondering why you can't find it in the session list. </p>

		<p>Is &quot;knocking everybody down&quot; a positive or a negative thing? I guess positive, reading the next sentence. Where does it come from?</p>

<p>It&#39;s usually &quot;knock dead&quot;, not &quot;knock down&quot;. It&#39;s more commonly encountered as &quot;Knock &#39;em dead!&quot;, a way of wishing someone good luck before a performance of some kind. The idea is that whatever you do is so fantastic that it completely overwhelms the audience. Similar to calling a very attractive person a &quot;knockout&quot;.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
