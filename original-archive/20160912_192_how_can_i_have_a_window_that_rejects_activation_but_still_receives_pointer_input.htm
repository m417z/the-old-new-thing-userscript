<p>
A customer had a dedicated system with two touch screens.
One screen was covered by the main app window,
and the other was covered by a secondary window.
They needed focus to remain on the main app window
because reasons.&sup1;
</p>
<p>One way of preventing the secondary window from
getting focus is to use the
<code>WS_<wbr>EX_<wbr>NO&shy;ACTIVATE</code>
extended style.
Another way is to disable it.
However, these cause the secondary window to ignore input,
but the customer
also wanted the user to be able to interact
with the secondary window.
Can they have their cake and eat it too?
</p>
<p>
Let's start with the
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20050422-08/?p=35813">
new scratch program</a>
and make these changes.
The first set of changes is basically
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130606-00/?p=4153">
the stuff we did in an earlier article</a>
to turn the main window into a logging window.</p>
<p>
<pre>
<font COLOR=blue>#include &lt;strsafe.h&gt;</font>

class RootWindow : public Window
{
public:
 ...
 <font COLOR=blue>void AppendText(LPCTSTR psz)
 {
  ListBox_SetCurSel(m_hwndChild,
      ListBox_AddString(m_hwndChild, psz));
 }

 void LogMessage(UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
 {
  TCHAR szMsg[80];
  StringCchPrintf(szMsg, 80, TEXT("%d\t0x%04x\t%p\t%p"),
      GetTickCount(),
      uMsg,
      wParam,
      lParam);
  AppendText(szMsg);
 }</font>
 ...
};
</pre>
<p>
The logging comes from the side window:
</p>
<pre>
class SideWindow : public Window
{
public:
 SideWindow(RootWindow* prw) : m_prw(prw) {}
 virtual LPCTSTR ClassName() { return TEXT("SideWindow"); }
 static SideWindow *Create(RootWindow* prw);
protected:
 LRESULT HandleMessage(UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam);
private:
 RootWindow* m_prw;
};

LRESULT SideWindow::HandleMessage(
 UINT uMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
 switch (uMsg) {
 case WM_MOUSEACTIVATE:
  m_prw-&gt;LogMessage(uMsg, wParam, lParam);
  return MA_NOACTIVATE;
 case WM_MOUSEMOVE:
 case WM_LBUTTONDOWN:
 case WM_LBUTTONUP:
  m_prw-&gt;LogMessage(uMsg, wParam, lParam);
  break;
 }

 return __super::HandleMessage(uMsg, wParam, lParam);
}

SideWindow *SideWindow::Create(RootWindow* prw)
{
 SideWindow *self = new SideWindow(prw);
 if (self &amp;&amp; self-&gt;WinCreateWindow(0,
     TEXT("SideWindow"), WS_OVERLAPPEDWINDOW,
     CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT, CW_USEDEFAULT,
     NULL, NULL)) {
     return self;
 }
 delete self;
 return NULL;
}
</pre>
<p>
The side window logs selected mouse messages
so we can see what's going on.
The interesting thing is that it responds to the
<code>WM_<wbr>MOUSE&shy;ACTIVATE</code>
with
<code>MA_<wbr>NO&shy;ACTIVATE</code>,
which means,
"Thanks for your interest in my window,
but I decline your offer to activate me."
Another way to decline activation is to return
<code>MA_<wbr>NO&shy;ACTIVATE&shy;AND&shy;EAT</code>,
which goes a step further and says,
"Throw away the input that caused you to want
to activate this window."
That's not what we want today,
because we want to keep the input;
we simply don't want activation.
</p>
<p>
Let's finish up the program before discussing further.
</p>
<pre>
int PASCAL
WinMain(HINSTANCE hinst, HINSTANCE, LPSTR, int nShowCmd)
{
 ...
  RootWindow *prw = RootWindow::Create();
  if (prw) {
      ShowWindow(prw-&gt;GetHWND(), nShowCmd);
      <font COLOR=blue>SideWindow *sw = SideWindow::Create(prw);
      ShowWindow(sw-&gt;GetHWND(), SW_SHOWNA);</font>
      MSG msg;
      while (GetMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0)) {
          TranslateMessage(&amp;msg);
          DispatchMessage(&amp;msg);
      }
  }
  ...
}
</pre>
<p>
Okay, run this program, and it will open two windows.
(I didn't bother putting each one on a separate monitor.
You can use your imagination.)
While focus is on the main window,
use your finger or moues to click on the second window.
Observe that the second window does not activate,
but the logging window shows that it did receive the
<code>WM_<wbr>LBUTTON&shy;DOWN = 0x0201</code> message.
Drag your finger over the window, or drag the mouse,
and you'll see the
<code>WM_<wbr>MOUSE&shy;MOVE = 0x0200</code> 
messages,
and you'll get a
<code>WM_<wbr>LBUTTON&shy;UP = 0x0202</code> message
when the pointer goes up.
</p>
<p>
So there you have it:
A window that rejects activation but stil receives
touch and mouse input.</p>

		<p>Is the footnote missing? Anyways, the requirement isn&#8217;t so obscure when you have mixed input scenarios, you want keyboard input go to the main application so it should keep focus even if you interact with the secondary window via mouse or touch.</p>

		<p>And a minor error in the second to last paragraph: &#8220;use your finger or moues&#8221;. I&#8217;m amazed the spell checker doesn&#8217;t pick that up, but apparently a &#8216;moue&#8217; is a &#8216;small grimace or expression to convey annoyance&#8217;.

		<p>It&#8217;s a French word. As for selective nit-picking, I assume Kevin didn&#8217;t spot &#8220;stil&#8221;. I didn&#8217;t, either, and I missed &#8220;moues&#8221; as well.</p>

&#8220;If the layered window has the WS_EX_TRANSPARENT extended window style, the shape of the layered window will be ignored and the mouse events will be passed to the other windows underneath the layered window.&#8221;<br />
You can still make the WS_EX_TRANSPARENT window opaque with SetLayeredWindowAttributes(hwnd, 0, 255, LWA_ALPHA);</p>
<p>A neat little application called net meter uses this to create a network usage chart that&#8217;s always on top and you can click through it.</p>

		<p>I can think of many reasons I&#8217;d want to do this&#8230;.<br />
If the second monitor is purely for clicking on things, while the first has text fields for entry for instance.</p>
<p>It could also be they are hosting an external component that fails if the window loses focus. There is obviously something odd going on when they managed to get budget for two touch screens.</p>

		<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be too surprised if this was an ultrasound &#8211; the ones I worked with have a large regular monitor mounted above, and a smaller touchscreen built-in to the control panel, and the touchscreen seems to behave this way.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
