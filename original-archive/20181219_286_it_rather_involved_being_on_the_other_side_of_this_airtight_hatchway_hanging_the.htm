<p>
A security vulnerability report pointed out that
a malicious file can cause the module loader to
enter an infinite loop,
thereby causing a denial of service on the
process doing the loading.
</p>
<p>
This was by itself not interesting.
After all, if you have managed to get the system
to attempt to load your DLL,
and you want to use it to cause a denial of service,
then you don't need to get this fancy.
You can just put
<code>Sleep(INFINITE);</code> in your
<code>DLL_</code><code>PROCESS_</code><code>ATTACH</code>
handler!
</p>
<p>
In other words,
you're already on the other side of the airtight hatchway.
And you're bragging that you can do something annoying like
a denial service,
apparently unaware that being on the other side of the
airtight hatchway gives you the ability to do far more
interesting (and threatening) things.</p>

		<p>Unfortunately there doesn&#8217;t seem to be another way of letting you know other than posting a comment, so feel free to remove this comment once you&#8217;ve seen it: since a day or two the RSS link on the top right no longer points to a valid feed, just to a 404 page. Same for the comment RSS feed for a post.</p>

		<p>Hm, it does work in an incognito window. That&#8217;s weird. Anyway, just ignore me then.</p>

		<p>In the Linux world this would have been until recently a real security vulnerability. A shadow of the loader was invoked by the ldd command.</p>
<p>This was changed afterl somebody found a nasty exploit involving a binary that turned out to be statically linked but looked like it was dynamically linked against the normal loader, resulting in invoking the binary for execution.</p>

		<p>That was always a pretty horrible idea. ELF (at least as a GNU extension) has the &#8220;IRELATIVE&#8221; and &#8220;IFUNC&#8221; relocation types where the dynamic linker calls arbitrary functions doing linking: <a href="https://github.com/robgjansen/elf-loader/blob/master/doc/references/irel-ifunc-2.txt" rel="nofollow">https://github.com/robgjansen/elf-loader/blob/master/doc/references/irel-ifunc-2.txt</a></p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
