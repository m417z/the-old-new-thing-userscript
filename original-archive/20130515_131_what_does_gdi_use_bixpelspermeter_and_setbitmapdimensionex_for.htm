<p>What does GDI use <code>BITMAP&shy;INFO&shy;HEADER.<wbr>biXPels&shy;Per&shy;Meter</wbr></code> and <code>Set&shy;Bitmap&shy;Dimension&shy;Ex</code> for?</p>
<p> Nothing. </p>
<p> The <code>BITMAP&shy;INFO&shy;HEADER.<wbr>biXPels&shy;Per&shy;Meter</wbr></code> and <code>BITMAP&shy;INFO&shy;HEADER.<wbr>biYPels&shy;Per&shy;Meter</wbr></code> are completely ignored by GDI when loading a bitmap. The values are there for the benefit of image-editing programs who want to record additional information about the bitmap, but GDI ignores them. </p>
<p> Similarly, the <code>Set&shy;Bitmap&shy;Dimension&shy;Ex</code> and <code>Get&shy;Bitmap&shy;Dimension&shy;Ex</code> functions update a <code>SIZE</code> structure associated with each bitmap, but GDI does nothing with the values, aside from initializing them to zero when the bitmap is created. </p>
<p> The value is there so that, for example, a program which puts a bitmap on the clipboard can specify the recommended physical dimensions of the bitmap, in order to help another program that reads the bitmap from the clipboard (for example, a word processor) decide how big to resize the bitmap when it is pasted. </p>
<p> Whether any programs actually do this sort of thing I do not know. </p>
<p> But that's what it's there for, in case anybody wanted to do it. </p>

		<p>Random, most people don&#39;t talk about dpi, only graphics experts do. And even then only when resizing the final image for shipping to the printer. Moreover, in Europe (or at least in the DTP circles I&#39;ve been professionally been in contact with) people and especially graphics artists tend to express fuzziness in pixels/cm.</p>
<p>And using metric data in the image header makes calculating the dimensions of the image much easier. Most of the world doesn&#39;t use inches and other oddities, and additionally a lot of software expects page sizes and such to be specified in some metre-derived quantity.</p>
<p>And to answer Raymond&#39;s question, there are a number of high-profile image manipulators whose names I shall not mention that do use those fields.</p>

		<p>Joshua, what did you expect? The only sensible options are 1/L and 1/LÂ² and first seems simpler no?</p>
<p>The only reason to use the second is if you have to express information density of a two-dimensional medium (like a CD or a piece of paper).</p>

		<p>&quot;Initializing it to a derived value results in false confidence. Better to say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; when you don&#39;t know. Imagine the image gets cropped and resized, and the PelsPerMeter is updated to be 2415.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#39;m not proposing updating PelsPerMeter on resize, I&#39;m proposing updating the thing updated by SetBitmapDimensionEx on resize, or rather not having it exist <em>at all</em>, and having it calculated <em>on-demand</em> by the (manually updated if at all) PelsPerMeter.</p>
<p>Having three related quantities invites errors. What&#39;s the application pasting something supposed to do if PelsPerMeter says one thing and GetBitmapDimensionEx says another?</p>

		<p>@Anonymous Coward &quot;And to answer Raymond&#39;s question, there are a number of high-profile image manipulators whose names I shall not mention that do use those fields.&quot;</p>
<p>What do they do if they don&#39;t match? Say, GetBitmapDimensionEx returns 1000&#215;750 (e.g. 100mm x 75mm), the image itself is 640&#215;480, and PelsPerMeter is 3000 (implying 213mm x 160mm)?</p>
<p>My point was that it&#39;s <em>not possible</em> to use <em>both</em> of those fields, so it makes no sense to me that they both exist.</p>

		<p>The documentation says exactly where the information returned by GetBitmapDimensionEx came from: the SetBitmapDimensionEx function. In other words, Windows doesn&#39;t supply the information (your application/someone else does.) If the two sources of information don&#39;t match, blame whoever entered those in the first place!</p>
<p>As to why there are two sources, my guess is that they realized that compatible bitmaps don&#39;t have a PelsPerMeter member, so this is the next best thing.</p>

		<p>The DPI is very handy, if you want to be able to print a picture with certain dimensions. It&#39;s a shame WIA GUI for a scanner ignores the scanner DPI completely, and puts some bogus 72 DPI in the saved image.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s interesting that these values are defined in metric when most people talk about resolution in, well, dpi, to such an extent that &quot;dpi&quot; is the common term. It also seems strange to me that it has a separate size structure (in 0.1-mm units) rather than simply working it out from the pixel dimensions and the *Pels&shy;Per&shy;Meter values. And why does it initialize them to zero instead of initializing them to (e.g.) (width=640)*10000/3780==1693 based on the dimensions of the image?</p>
<p>MS Paint in Windows 7 appears to initialize *PelsPerMeter to zero, I&#39;m not sure if this has always been the case with earlier versions of MS Paint.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>Initializing it to a derived value results in false confidence. Better to say &quot;I don&#39;t know&quot; when you don&#39;t know.

You then put it in a collage with another image that wasn&#39;t resized, and the collage software says, &quot;Oh, I&#39;d better rescale these images so their pelsPerMeter match up&quot;, and then you say &quot;Why are my images all being resized randomly?&quot; -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>Not entirely sure if it&#39;s related, but .Net allows you to set a DPI resolution on a GDI bitmap. If you&#39;re pasting one image onto another, and their DPI resolutions are not the same, you get strange size effects. Took me a while to figure out why one specific image was always resizing while all the others I was testing with did not :)</p>

		<p>@JM, not naming names/companies is a policy in this blog.</p>
<p>@Random, your question is moot.</p>
<p>You either start with a BITMAPINFOHEADER to create a HBITMAP, or you already have the HBITMAP (if you prefer, you either start with a HBITMAP to create a BITMAPINFOHEADER, or you already have the BITMAPINFOHEADER). You only have both values when you&#39;re marshalling between the two.</p>
<p>I&#39;d prefer to use HBITMAPs for an in-proc OLE component, but I&#39;d need a serialized BITMAPINFOHEADER if IPC is required (if you prefer, I&#39;d need a serialized BITMAPINFOHEADER through IPC with an out-of-proc OLE wrapper that runs an in-proc OLE component that uses HBITMAPs, so that this OLE component is isolated and it doesn&#39;t take my app down with it).</p>
<p>At most, you should question why aren&#39;t both values of the same type. As it stands, the translation isn&#39;t symmetric.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
