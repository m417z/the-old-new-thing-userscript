<p>
A customer reported that Explorer was not showing a folder on their hard drive
that they were sure was there.
</p>
<p>
I asked them to check whether the folder really was there,
by going to a command prompt and using the
<code>dir /a</code> command.
</p>
<p>
Turns out the folder really was gone.
</p>
<p>
The customer went back and retraced their steps
and reconstructed what happened.
</p>
<p>
First, the customer created a folder on their
<code>D:</code> called
<code>D:\<wbr>backups\<wbr>fdrive\<wbr>spreadsheets</code>.
</p>
<p>
Next the customer copied two files from their <code>F:</code>
drive to the
<code>D:\<wbr>backups\<wbr>fdrive\<wbr>spreadsheets</code>
folder.
</p>
<p>
So far so good.
</p>
<p>
Next, the customer wanted to copy their entire <code>F:</code>
drive to the 
<code>D:\<wbr>backups\<wbr>fdrive</code>
folder, so they
performed the following command:
</p>
<pre>
robocopy /MIR F: D:\backups\fdrive
</pre>
<p>
The customer let this command run for a while,
but then the operation started encountering
</i>Access denied</i> errors, so they hit
<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> to stop the robocopy command.
</p>
<p>
At this point, the customer noticed that the
<code>spreadsheets</code> folder was gone.
</p>
<p>
The customer theorized,
"I suspect that what happened is that robocopy
was matching the directory structure of the <code>F:</code>
drive against the directory structure of
<code>D:\<wbr>backups\<wbr>fdrive</code>,
and since my important spreadsheet files weren't
present in the <code>F:\<wbr>spreadsheets</code>
folder on the source, it deleted them from the destination.
If I had let the copy run to completion,
it presumably would have eventually
copied the files from their location on the
<code>F:</code> drive to the corresponding
subdirectory of
<code>D:\<wbr>backups\<wbr>fdrive</code>."
</p>
<p>
The customer continued,
"From a user perspective, it seems that I <i>should</i>
have really been alerted by robocopy that the target folder
(in this case, <code>D:\<wbr>backups\<wbr>fdrive</code>)
wasn't empty,
and it should have asked for confirmation that I didn't
really want to lose those files (which I didn't)."
</p>
<p>
Well, um, yeah, because that's what the <code>/MIR</code>
option means.
</p>
<pre>
       /E :: copy subdirectories, including Empty ones.
   /PURGE :: delete dest files/dirs that no longer exist in source.
     /MIR :: MIRror a directory tree (equivalent to /E plus /PURGE).
</pre>
<p>
The <code>/MIR</code> option means that the destination
folder should be an exact copy of the source folder.
The documentation points out that this is the same as
<code>/E</code> (copy recursively) combined with
<code>/PURGE</code> (remove anything from the destination
that is not present in the source).
</p>
<p>
The <code>/PURGE</code> behavior is by definition destructive.
</p>
<p>
If that's not what you want,
then don't pass the <code>/MIR</code> flag.</p>

		<p>If you use /mir along with /xf or /xd to exclude files or folders, not only does it exclude copying those files and folders (like you&#8217;d expect), but if the files/folders are present in the destination they are NOT removed as you might expect. This occurs even with full paths to the source files/folders specified (so it&#8217;s not just matching on a filename if you just provide a filename without a path). It makes sense if you think about it, since it&#8217;s excluding those items from ALL operations, not just the copy.</p>

		<p>That sounds like rsync&#8217;s &#8211;delete-before or &#8211;delete-during. Does robocopy have the equivalent of rsync&#8217;s &#8211;delete-after? That would avoid this problem, at the cost of potentially running out of disk space (but at least, if it runs out of disk space, nothing would be deleted).</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d never heard of robocopy and at first I figured it was a third-party application.  On a lark, I just typed robocopy in a command prompt and discovered that it comes with Windows.  Since I&#8217;d given no options or parameters, robocopy printed some the help text that had a very explicit warning:</p>
<p>&#8220;****  /MIR can DELETE files as well as copy them !&#8221;</p>

		<p>It was a very useful add-on that first showed up in the NT4 resource kit way back in the day.  It&#8217;s been built in to Windows since Vista (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy" rel="nofollow">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robocopy</a>).</p>

		<p>It is still the best tool for copying large data in scripts these days. Which is kind of sad all considered because goodness the flags are anything but intuitive. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there are great third party PowerShell modules available these days though &#8211; I should look into those.</p>

		<p>I think &#8220;best&#8221; is quite a subjective term. If you just need to mirror a directory, robocopy is probably the best choice, but if you&#8217;re trying to copy files with certain properties (like say all image files older than a certain date), powershell will win hands down.</p>
<p>Basically, if it&#8217;s straight up copying and nothing else, use robocopy &#8211; for anything else, use powershell.</p>

		<p>Well I do refer to PowerShell, the problem is that the built-in commands have serious limitations/bugs that require more work than it should take (copy-item recursively with exclude not working correctly is a PITA).</p>
<p>One can indeed write a PowerShell accept that provides the wanted behaviour but that&#8217;s not as easy as one would hope and if I&#8217;m on foreign sever I won&#8217;t have the option.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve always wondered how these sorts of support cases make it to Raymond. Is there some sort of arrangement where all Windows developers are on the line for helping customer support representatives, and it&#8217;s round-robin? So you&#8217;d get the good ones, and then you&#8217;d get &#8230; rtfm.</p>

		<p>Don&#8217;t forget, the original query was &#8220;I definitely have this folder on my hard drive, but Explorer isn&#8217;t showing it for some reason, why is Explorer doing this?&#8221; That sounds like it would be much more up Raymond&#8217;s alley than &#8220;what does this option do again?&#8221;</p>

		<p>While I don&#8217;t have much sympathy for users who don&#8217;t read the documentation, I do feel that having a util with &#8220;copy&#8221; in its name implicitly performing deletions isn&#8217;t the best thing in the world.</p>

		<p>I think a higher level sadness is that the recycle bin is an explorer-only construct&#8230;<br />
Would be nice if deleting things via the command line resulted in moving to the recycle bin by default.  I know a lot of stories that would have had happier endings if that were the case.</p>

<p>Yes it has the warning, but some users would be just oh so happy to get the simple usage working and blindly put the /MIR in there without thinking.  Probably not the best example to include as the simple usage since it&#8217;s no longer just a harmless *copy*</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
