		<p>Does this mean people will eventually notice this trend and start changing their name to Gates, and eventually everyone in Seattle will be called Gates?</p>

		<p>The sales people must be &quot;car guys&quot;. Gates makes a wide range of hoses and belts for the aftermarket. Although I think they are based in Denver, not Seattle.</p>

		<p>Alternative theory â€” natural selection will favour people called Gates due to the aforementioned benefits. People called Gates will then slowly become the dominant part of the population, as they outcompete those not called Gates. This works because names are inherited, like genes (albeit traditionally only on the male side) ;)</p>

		<p>An MVP Summit at Microsoft left me with this viewpoint of the friendliness of Seattleites: &nbsp;The only time no one said &quot;God Bless You&quot; when I sneezed was when I was at Church.</p>

		<p>Do they do that because that Gates guy found all that treasure hidden by Benjamin Franklin?</p>

		<p>Raymond, I DEMAND that you immediately do a survey of everyone at MS with the surname of Jobs, Ellison, Page, Brin, Bezos, Zuckerberg, etc and see what level of politeness they have experienced. &nbsp;Report back immediately. &nbsp;Good lad.</p>
<p>(I won&#39;t ask you to do the same for people like Ballmer. I&#39;d be too frightened of the possible results.)</p>

		<p>Poor woman. You don&#39;t want sales people to be *friendly* to you, you want them to get off the phone so you can get some work done rather than spend the entire day being hawked whatever bit of hardware / software / infrastructure they get the highest commission on that particular week.</p>

		<p>I remember an article about some Swiss farmers who moved to Canada to become farmers. When they arrived in Canada they were inundated by all sort of sales people. Because, you guessed it, the sales people assumed all Swiss people must be rich.</p>

		<p>When I was working on a Data General machine, I always got very long pauses when I called for technical support and introduced myself.</p>
<p>It also made ego-surfing impossible as every university&#39;s &quot;Computer and Society&quot; course had &quot;Soul of a New Machine&quot;, which covered the story of the design of the DG 8000, on the curriculum.</p>

		<p>Everybody knows Americans fake being nice as a social obligation, so this doesn&#39;t really have any meaning. Knowing this, I certainly wouldn&#39;t want my family name to be Gates if I lived in Seattle.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
