		<p>Simple to write an article about, perhaps. The BMP file format is simple, but it isn&#8217;t exactly trivial.</p>

		<p>Well, the bfOffBits member of the BITMAPFILEHEADER does imply that the bitmap bits doesn&#8217;t have to follow directly after the BITMAPINFOHEADER. A bitmap resource on the other hand is strictly a packed bitmap &#8211; one where the bits follow directly after the header.</p>

		<p>Yes, the documentation says: &quot;A BITMAPINFO or BITMAPCOREINFO structure immediately follows the BITMAPFILEHEADER structure in the DIB file.&quot;</p>
<p>So the BITMAPFILEHEADER structure seems pointless. Which raises the question why its used for bitmap files at all.</p>

		<p>Because someone thought when originally defining it that it might be a good idea if it could be extended, but it never has been?</p>
<p>The Windows SDK is littered with unused extension points, as are probably most large systems.</p>

		<p>bfOffBits refers to the beginning of the bitmap bits. &nbsp;That means there can be an arbitrary amount of space between the BITMAPINFO/palette and the actual bits. &nbsp;Which means you could put almost anything you want between the header and the bits, and not break properly written software.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
