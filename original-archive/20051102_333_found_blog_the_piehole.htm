<p>I have no idea <a href="http://liscious.net/piehole/"> who this person is</a>, but she's all attitude all the time. Like <a href="http://www.liscious.net/piehole/archives/2005_10.php#006252"> this entry from October 18, 2005 when Jennifer was recovering from a foot injury</a>:</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  <b>Men love a girl who can't run away quickly</b> </p>
<p> I got "wooey!"-ed by a garbage man on my way back to the office from lunch today... Because I'm so HAWT hobbling down the street. He could not resist my hobbling! I am hobbleicious! Sssssssss! * </p>
<p> And just so you know, being followed down the street by a garbage truck with someone screaming "YEAH BABY!" and "what's your phone number?" is TOTALLY CLASSY! </p>
<p> * This is the sound of me sizzling! </p>
</blockquote>
<p> It's the asterisk that's the icing on the cake. </p>
<p> From that web site's blogroll you can springboard to a whole new world of outrageous content. Like <a href="http://users.pandora.be/quarsan/zoe/index.html"> My Boyfriend is a Twat</a> or <a href="http://inappropriatelydressed.com/"> Inappropriately Dressed</a>. </p>

<p>Raymond = I just can&#8217;t believe you wrote &quot;Tw@t&quot; in your blog! I&#8217;ve re-read it 3 times to make sure (refreshing each time).</p>

<p>&#8211; I&#8217;m still blinking in disbelief!</p>
<p>great stuff</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not obscene in a lot of parts of the world, especially where it is not quite understood or equated with the North American counterpart which is generally taken to be quite obsceneâ€”specifically by women.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve known Jennifer for a while now and she is quite possibly the funniest person you will ever meet. Her kid is hysterical too. I&#8217;ll let her know you linked her and maybe she&#8217;ll stop by and say hello.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
