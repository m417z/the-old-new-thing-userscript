<p> In the month since my last report, there have been a few developments in the county council race between an accused drunk (the incumbent) and a fringe candidate (the challenger). </p>
<ul>
<li>     The incumbent admitted     <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003895009_hague21m.html">     having approved biographical information in which a bachelor's degree     was claimed</a>,     shortly after previously vehemently denying that any such     r&eacute;sum&eacute; inflation had taken place. </li>
<li>     The incumbent     filed a campaign disclosure notice     revealing a $50,000 contribution to the campaign.     The challenger then filed a complaint on the grounds that     the contribution exceeded the legal limit.     The incumbent then claimed     <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003903446_hague26m.html">     that the notice was filed in error and no such contribution was made</a>. </li>
<li>     The challenger     <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/election2007/2003906450_pope27m.html">     will not have the support of the party he nominally belongs to</a>. </li>
<li>     The incumbent     <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=cache:seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/election2007/2003906447_hague27m.html">     agreed to pay a $8,000 fine</a>     for campaign finance violations. </li>
<li>     The incumbent's pretrial hearing for drunk driving     <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003917421_webhague01.html">     has been delayed until after the election</a>. </li>
<li>     The incumbent's party     <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003930983_elexotherpope07m.html">     tries to draw attention away from their candidate for a little while</a>. </li>

<p> <a href="http://www.seattletimes.com/"> <i>The Seattle Times</i></a> tries to summarize the state of the race with a series of articles: </p>

		<p>Why do you even care about that garbage? &nbsp;I&#8217;m not old enough to remember how things were 20 years ago, but politicians today are a disgrace to the human race, even more so than lawyers. &nbsp;Every once in a while a couple of them manage to get something right; this is the precious rare exception. &nbsp;The other 99.9% of the time you get genius ideas like &quot;Freedom Fries&quot; (I think I just rolled my eyes out of the back of my head). &nbsp;These people should be absolutely ashamed of their very existence.</p>
<p>This is why I like Japan. &nbsp;Sure, they have their own scandals over there, but at least they understand the concepts of honor and shame (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUST34716820070528" rel="nofollow">http://www.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUST34716820070528</a>).</p>

		<p>As weird as it is, I have to respect Pope&#8217;s resourcefulness. &nbsp;If I were in a campaign, I would hire him. &nbsp;It seems like finding dirt is his specialty. &nbsp;Or I&#8217;m sure he could make some money setting up a blog to post his findings.</p>

		<p>I believe that there is an old Soviet saying about politicians. &nbsp;Something like, &quot;Politicians around the world are all the same. &nbsp;Mostly idiots.&quot;</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  &gt; at least they understand the concepts of honor and shame
</p></blockquote>
<p>This is something that US politics could certainly stand more of. &nbsp;It seems to me that there&#8217;s decidedly less honor (or shame) in today&#8217;s US political life, but then when I try to think back, I can&#8217;t really say there ever was very much (at least in my lifetime).</p>

		<p>Politicians are much like whores, anything they say sounds good, the only difference is that the whores actually deliver. Legalize prostitution, forbid politics!</p>

		<p>How did that go&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
