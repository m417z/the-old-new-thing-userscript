<p>Back in the days of Windows&nbsp;95, one of my colleagues paid a visit to his counterparts over in the Windows&nbsp;NT team as part of a continuing <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/10/11/479588.aspx"> informal</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/01/05/9943678.aspx"> engagement</a> to keep the Windows&nbsp;NT developers aware of the crazy stuff we've been doing on the Windows&nbsp;95 side.</p>
<p> One particular time, his visit occurred in late morning, and it ran longer than usual, so the Windows&nbsp;NT folks said, "Hey, it's lunchtime. Do you want to join us for lunch? It's sort of our tradition to go to <a href="http://www.yelp.com/biz/chilis-grill-and-bar-bellevue"> Chili</a>'s for lunch on Thursdays." </p>
<p> My colleague cheerfully accepted their offer. </p>
<p> The group were shown to their table, and the Windows&nbsp;NT folks didn't even look at the menus. After all, they've been here every week for who-knows-how-long, so they know the menu inside-out. </p>
<p> When the server came to take the orders, they naturally let my colleague order first, seeing as he was their special guest. </p>
<p> "I'll have a chicken ranch sandwich." </p>
<p> The folks from the Windows&nbsp;NT team then placed their orders. </p>
<p> "I'll have the turkey sandwich." </p>
<p> "Turkey sandwich." </p>
<p> "A turkey sandwich for me, please." </p>
<p> Every single person ordered a turkey sandwich. </p>
<p> After the server left, my colleague asked, "Why do you all order the turkey sandwich?" </p>
<p> They explained, "We've been coming here for a long time, and we eventually figured out that, at least at this restaurant, the turkey sandwich takes the least time to prepare." </p>
<p> What my colleague forgot to ask was, "Well, since I already ordered something else, I naturally screwed up your highly-optimized algorithm. So why didn't you order something else?" </p>
<p> <b>Note</b>: I actually don't know who ordered first. I just made up that part of the story to make it funnier. (Note that I make up parts of other stories, too. I'm not a historian. I'm a storyteller.) </p>

		<p>IMO, &quot;optimizing a dining experience&quot; does not mean &quot;get your food the fastest&quot;. &nbsp;For me, the optimal dining experience is the food that tastes best (and, I suppose, isn&#39;t TOO unhealthy). &nbsp;:-)</p>
<p>But I understand if these particular programmers were more interested in speed than in quality and taste!</p>

		<p>That Chili&#39;s in Bellevue was actually the first Chili&#39;s I ever saw. Apparently it has since closed (according to the Yelp link). I can&#39;t really say I&#39;m sad to see it go, however, as I&#39;d call it a &quot;dining experience&quot; only in the ironic sense.</p>

Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
