<p>It's been quite a while, but a winner in <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/03/25/9505722.aspx"> the caption contest</a> has been selected and the prize finally reached its destination. (Mostly due to procrastination on my part. Don't blame the postal service.)</p>
<p> The winner is <a href="http://www.guidedbycharts.com/"> Scott</a> from Australia with <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/03/25/9505722.aspx#9509354"> his entry</a> </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Only 5,000 more referrals until MULTIBALL </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Even though it's kind of low-brow, it made me laugh spontaneously. </p>
<p> For his efforts, Scott wins a deluxe prize package consisting of </p>
<ul>
<li>     <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/exchange/2010/">     Exchange 2010</a> laptop skin </li>
<li>I'm a PC sticker and yoyo </li>
<li>Windows 7 stress ball </li>
<li>Assorted logo pens (Microsoft, Xbox 360, Microsoft Office) </li>
<li>TSA-approved Microsoft travel lock (so he can travel to our country     should he be so inspired) </li>
<li>Miscellaneous historical items from the wayback drawer 
<ul>
<li>Windows Me pen     </li>
<li>Microsoft Bob lapel pin     </li>
<li>Microsoft 20th anniversary kazoo     </li>
<li>Temporary tattoos: Windows 2000, Windows 95,     OLE (who knew they even had a logo!),     Microsoft Visual Tools,     MSN,     Microsoft BackOffice. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> Here's Scott's acceptance speech: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> I'd like to thank all the letters that made the caption possible - the&nbsp;O, the&nbsp;N, the&nbsp;R, and especially the&nbsp;L - that little guy really pulled his weight. And thank you to the 1990's, for coming up with blogs, so that I could one day win a caption contest. </p>

		<p>That isn&#8217;t the best part &#8211; there was a &quot;Windows &#8211; 20 Years&quot; kazoo! My wife asked what OLE was, and I really couldn&#8217;t, so the kazoo was a great way to distract her.</p>
<p>The stress ball unfortunately has had the Windows 7 logo fall off &#8211; Hopefully that is a known issue that will be fixed in the RTM Ball</p>

		<p>Um&#8230; For us non-native speakers, would it be possible to reveal the point a little bit?</p>
<p>I enjoyed captions thrown in by Raymond as a starter, but this one is probably a true winner as the humor is a bit hard to conceive.</p>

		<p>@GSerg: I think it is more a pinball joke &#8211; most modern pinball games have a &quot;multiball&quot; mode, when you get to a certain high score or complete some series of shots multiball is enabled which allows you to maximise your bonus.</p>

		<p>Bravo Scott, I think your acceptance speech says it all.</p>

<p>Someone was digging very deep into the back of his desk to assemble such an assortment of swaggity swag.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
