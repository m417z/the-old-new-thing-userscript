<p>I guess they're not doing a particularly good job of creating awareness because it wasn't until I consulted <a href="http://www.healthfinder.gov/library/nho/nho.asp"> the 2006 National Health Observances calendar</a> that the month of July is International Group B Strep Awareness Month.</p>
<p> For some reason, July and August are pretty light on the health observances calendar. Maybe because people are on summer vacation. </p>
<p> Who decides whether a particular health observance merits a day, a week, or a month? You'd think they'd save the months for the really big issues, seeing as there are only twelve of them. And for some reason, ultraviolet radiation gets <strong>two</strong> months. May is Ultraviolet Awareness Month, and July is UV Safety Month. That's one sixth of the year dedicated to ultraviolet radiation. </p>
<p> (I'm not belittling the health causes themselves, just the way they get assigned days on the calendar.) </p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve heard it suggested that the significance of an event is inversely proportional to the time required to commemorate it.</p>
<p>Data points to add to the two months for UV awareness and full month for Group B Strep are Hiroshima day (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.betterworldlinks.org/book80.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.betterworldlinks.org/book80.htm</a>) and the single minute of silence signifying the end of World War I.</p>

<p>Not exactly apples to apples here. &nbsp;The dropping of the atom bomb and the WWI armistice occurred on an actual day, where &quot;awareness&quot; days or months are not tied to an actual event.

<p>Well, May and June is the part of the year where tards like myself go get sunburns because we can&#8217;t be bothered to use sunblock.

		<p>There&#8217;s also International Talk Like A Pirate Day, which is apparently as significant as Hiroshima. Of course we know that the lack of pirates is responsible for global warming (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.venganza.org/piratesarecool4.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.venganza.org/piratesarecool4.jpg</a>), so maybe it should be Talk Like A Pirate Month&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
