<p>
By default, when the user TABs to an edit control in a dialog box,
the entire contents of the edit control are autoselected.
This occurs because the edit control responds with the
<code>DLGC_HASSETSEL</code> flag in response to the
<code>WM_GETDLGCODE</code> message.
To prevent it from happening, remove that flag.
</p>
<pre>
LRESULT CALLBACK RemoveHasSetSelSubclassProc
    (HWND hwnd, UINT uiMsg, WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam,
     UINT_PTR uIdSubclass, DWORD_PTR dwRefData)
{
    switch (uiMsg) {
    case WM_NCDESTROY:
        RemoveWindowSubclass(hwnd, RemoveHasSetSelSubclassProc,
                             uIdSubclass);
        break;
    case WM_GETDLGCODE:
        return DefSubclassProc(hwnd, uiMsg, wParam, lParam)
                             & ~DLGC_HASSETSEL;
    }
    return DefSubclassProc(hwnd, uiMsg, wParam, lParam);
}
</pre>
<p>
All this subclass procedure does is remove the
<code>DLGC_HASSETSEL</code> flag from the return value
of the <code>WM_GETDLGCODE</code> message.
</p>
<pre>
INT_PTR CALLBACK DlgProc(HWND hdlg, UINT uiMsg,
                         WPARAM wParam, LPARAM lParam)
{
    switch (uiMsg) {
    case WM_INITDIALOG:
        SetWindowSubclass(GetDlgItem(hdlg, 100),
                          RemoveHasSetSelSubclassProc, 0, 0);
        break;
    case WM_COMMAND:
        switch (GET_WM_COMMAND_ID(wParam, lParam)) {
        case IDCANCEL:
            EndDialog(hdlg, 1);
            break;
        }
    }
    return FALSE;
}
</pre>
<p>
The subclass procedure is installed when the dialog box is
initialized.
</p>
<pre>
int WINAPI WinMain(HINSTANCE hinst, HINSTANCE hinstPrev,
                   LPSTR lpCmdLine, int nShowCmd)
{
    DialogBox(hinst, MAKEINTRESOURCE(1), NULL, DlgProc);
    return 0;
}

1 DIALOGEX DISCARDABLE  0, 0, 200,200
STYLE DS_SHELLFONT | WS_POPUP | WS_VISIBLE | WS_CAPTION | WS_SYSMENU
CAPTION "sample"
FONT 8, "MS Shell Dlg"
BEGIN
  CONTROL         "Blah blah",100,"Edit",WS_TABSTOP,7,4,100,10
    DEFPUSHBUTTON "&Bye", IDCANCEL, 7,24,50,14, WS_TABSTOP
END
</pre>
<p>
And here is the dialog box that we display.
</p>
<p>There really isn't much to it, but I figured a complete sample
program might help somebody out. Plus it lets me show off the
<code>SetWindowSubclass</code> function.</p>

		<p>(I hope people understand that this is really only acceptable for multi-line edit controls, ala Notepad or this blog, or possibly read-only controls (there may be other, special case exceptions).  Having the text of an edit control become selected is a consistent user-experience across Windows &#8212; when I tab to a single-line edit control I expect the text to be highlighted so that if I start typing a new value, the old value disappears.  To change this behavior, even if you don&#8217;t agree with it, just confuses users.</p>
<p>In my opinion, of course.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
