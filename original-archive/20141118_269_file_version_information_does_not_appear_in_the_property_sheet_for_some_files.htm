<p>
A customer reported that file version information
does not appear on the Details page of the property sheet
which appears when you right-click the file and select
<i>Properties</i>.
They reported that the problem began in Windows&nbsp;7.
</p>
<p>
The reason that the file version information was not appearing
is that the file's extension was <code>.xyz</code>.
Older versions of Windows attempted to extract file version information
for all files regardless of type.
I believe it was Windows Vista that changed this behavior
and extracted version information only for known file types
for Win32 modules,
specifically
<code>.cpl</code>,
<code>.dll</code>,
<code>.exe</code>,
<code>.ocx</code>,
<code>.rll</code>,
and
<code>.sys</code>.
If the file's extension is not on the list above,
then the shell will not sniff for version information.
</p>
<p>
If you want to register a file type as eligible for file version
extraction, you can add the following registry key:
</p>
<pre>
<b>HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE
 \Software
  \Microsoft
    \Windows
      \CurrentVersion
        \PropertySystem
          \PropertyHandlers
            \<i>.XYZ</i></b>
             (Default) = REG_SZ:"{66742402-F9B9-11D1-A202-0000F81FEDEE}"
</pre>
<p>
(Thanks in advance for complaining about this change in behavior.
This always happens whenever I post in the Tips/Support
category about how to deal with a bad situation.
Maybe I should stop trying to explain how to deal with bad situations.)</p>

		<p>@Gabe: Resource library used by various Windows programs; contains program resource information, such as program data and global parameters; typically stores resources for a corresponding dynamic link library (.DLL) file.</p>
<p>RLL files may be used for application extensions. For example, an RLL file can store localization information for a program, such as foreign language support.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s odd that .cpl (control panel) is on the list, but not .scr (screen saver). I verified that on my system. Probably a minor oversight.</p>
<p>I bet &nbsp;there are other file types with resources not on the list, but I can&#39;t think of any right now.</p>

		<p>This change makes a lot of sense from a security point of view. Trying to extract version information from all files can make Explorer crash with files that look &quot;just like&quot; an executable, and that crash could potentially be used as a code execution attack. Just put this crafted file called &quot;Important Document.asd&quot; for download and wait for someone to download it. As they can not open it, chances are that at least some users will try to get more information about it with Explorer&#39;s Properties command. Gotcha!</p>

		<p>I remember using the old trick of getting the file properties and taking the presence of version information as a sign that I was dealing with a PE file with a weird extension, but I honestly can&#39;t remember the last time I used it, let alone noticing that it stopped working. Good to know I shouldn&#39;t rely on it in the future, though&#8230;</p>
<p>Can&#39;t say I disagree. Scanning arbitrary files for potentially useful stuff to display is a recipe for disaster &#8212; for security, stability, performance, you name it. As a feature, this never made much sense to begin with, occasionally useful though it might have been.</p>

		<p>@anon: &nbsp;In a related test when I was working on SMB/CIFS I tested how many round trips Explorer needed to show the contents of a specimen zip file. &nbsp;A human writing the protocol would use 4 although one was two combined so lets call it 5. &nbsp;XP&#39;s Explorer made 3,000 roundtrip requests, while Vista made double that number although many of the additional ones were asynchronous. &nbsp;This kind of &quot;inefficiency&quot; is what provides product opportunities.</p>

		<p>@JamesJohnston: Because it seems like an incredbly stupid idea* to begin with (*searching through all files).</p>
<p>I&#39;m going to take a WAG* and say that 90% of files on a computer system don&#39;t contain .exe-style version structures. (*WAG == Wild-@$$-Guess).</p>
<p>So Windows should waste all those cycles on every file for a few file types that support this? And what if all those files are on a network server halfway around the world?</p>

		<p>@Frank: except that strange .exes come with stern warnings or outright blocks on every system that cares about security; getting file properties understandably does not. Nobody but the hapless victim is surprised if strange executables steal your credit card info, while there would be outrage if it could happen just from looking at the properties of &quot;cutekitten.jpg&quot;. Not to say the version information parser contains a bug this severe, of course&#8230; In other words: if a malicious file is an executable, problems with the version info are the least of your worries. If it&#39;s not an executable, problems with the version info have no right of being there at all. Even if this change wasn&#39;t done to reduce potential attack vectors, it still makes sense from a security standpoint.</p>

		<p>@Antonio &#39;Grijan&#39;: Consider that attacker could name his file any way he likes, including any of the white-listed file extensions. Hence for security, it is really required that Explorer inspects the inspected file carefully. Period. Writing secured code simply is more work and there is rarely a shortcut unless you count not implementing the feature altogether as a viable option. </p>

		<p>In Vista they really pushed the new property system and two of the casualties were the version tab and IColumnProvider. The attack surface is still there but it is smaller because only certain extensions are scanned. The details tab has fewer entries because it will only display the version strings exposed by the property system. (The undocumented API that enumerates all version strings was also removed from version.dll)</p>
<p>The really sad part is of course that you cannot copy the strings anymore.</p>

		<p>Mityador: it&#39;s everything to do with security &#8211; known &quot;risky&quot; files (including .exe) are filtered on various download sites and email clients. It&#39;s the same reason the &quot;mark of the internet&quot; exists &#8211; to catch people who aren&#39;t aware they&#39;re doing something dangerous.</p>
<p>In fact, not implementing the feature altogether is exactly what happened here. There was a choice between rewriting the version property pages to process data securely, taking into account security models and user expectations, and the decision was to can a marginal feature in exchange for a considerable amount of time saved.</p>

		<p>A thing that always bugged me about versions in properties is that the properties of a MSI list a number of things that DON&#39;T include the product version.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
