<p>
If you use the Remote Desktop Connection client to connect
to another computer,
you have the option of making your local drives available
to the remote computer.
</p>
<p>
<p>
A customer wanted to know how to enumerate all the drives
on the local machine.
The were able to get the volumes mapped to drive letters,
but they also wanted to get the redirected drives injected
by Terminal Services.
(Mind you, these aren't volumes that are assigned drive
letters, so it's not clear why they are interested in them,
but whatever.)
</p>
<p>
With the <code>NET USE</code> command, they see the Terminal
Services volumes in Explorer, and they can be browsed via
<code>\\tsclient\d</code>:
</p>
<pre>
Status       Local     Remote                    Network

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       \\TSCLIENT\D              Microsoft Terminal Services
The command completed successfully.
</pre>
<p>
The customer wanted to enumerate these Terminal Services client
volumes.
"How does the <code>NET USE</code> command enumerate these volumes?"
</p>
<p>
Let's write that program.
Remember, Little Programs do little to no error checking.
</p>
<p>
<pre>
#define UNICODE
#define _UNICODE
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;winnetwk.h&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

void report(PCWSTR pszLabel, PCWSTR pszValue)
{
 printf("%ls = %ls\n", pszLabel, pszValue ? pszValue : L"(null)");
}

int __cdecl main(int, char **)
{
 HANDLE hEnum;
 WNetOpenEnum(RESOURCE_CONNECTED,
              RESOURCETYPE_DISK,
              0,
              NULL,
              &amp;hEnum);

 DWORD cbBuffer = 65536;
 void *buffer = LocalAlloc(LMEM_FIXED, cbBuffer);
 LPNETRESOURCE pnr = (LPNETRESOURCE)buffer;

 DWORD err;
 do {
  DWORD cEntries = INFINITE;
  DWORD cb = cbBuffer;
  err = WNetEnumResource(hEnum, &amp;cEntries, buffer, &amp;cb);
  if (err == NO_ERROR || err == ERROR_MORE_DATA) {
   for (DWORD i = 0; i &lt; cEntries; i++) {
    report(L"localName", pnr[i].lpLocalName);
    report(L"remoteName", pnr[i].lpRemoteName);
    report(L"provider", pnr[i].lpProvider);
    printf("\n");
   }
  }
 } while (err == ERROR_MORE_DATA);

 LocalFree(buffer);
 WNetCloseEnum(hEnum);
 return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
We open an enumeration for connected disks
and then start enumerating out of it.
The usage pattern for
<code>WNet&shy;Enum&shy;Resources</code> is kind of messy,
with a bunch of in/out parameters that need to get reset
each time.
Each time, we say
"Enumerate as much as you can into this
64<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/11/9725386.aspx">KB</a>
buffer"
and then print what we got.
If we were told,
"There's still more,"
then we go back and ask for more.
</p>
<p>
That's all.
Nothing particularly fancy.</p>

		<p>&gt; [Wait, you said man 2 readdir, and man 2 readdir does require two loops. (Since it can return multiple dirents.) -Raymond]</p>
<p>The readdir(2) page reads &quot;The argument count is ignored; at most one old_linux_dirent structure is read.&quot; The API appears as if it has been different in the past. If it was different in the past, then the API suggests that an inner loop could have been avoided, even for old kernels, by setting count to 1, which would ensure that at most one entry got returned.</p>
<p>The same applies to WNetEnumResource: the inner loop should be avoidable by setting lpcCount to 1. That would probably be a subobtimal use of the function, but if someone (such as Joshua) is more comfortable calling it like that, there does not appear to be anything stopping such use.</p>

		<p>That&#39;s kind of weird to see a function that takes an array of NETRESOURCE to fill as LPVOID instead of LPNETRESOURCE, and the size is counted in bytes, not in NETRESOURCEs. It&#39;s not that NETRESOURCE has variable length, so why is this the way it is? </p>

		<p>&gt; Why the hell would ERROR_MORE_DATA status have word &quot;error&quot; in it&#39;s name?</p>
<p>Because ERROR_MORE_DATA indicates that the function was unable to fulfill your request. You requested all items. You didn&#39;t get all items. The reason why you didn&#39;t get all items is because there is more data that could not be written into the provided buffer.</p>

		<p>In the extreme case you can ask how big the buffer should be and the provider will say &quot;dunno&#8230; you need at least N to fit in the array itself&quot; so you ask it &quot;will a buffer of size N do&quot; and it says &quot;no, you need this much for all the strings too&quot;.</p>

<p>The docs say that the buffer stores not only the NETRESOURCE structures, but also the strings pointed to by those structures, so the size of the buffer is greater than simply sizeof(NETRESOURCE) * cEntries. I would guess it&#39;s done that way to avoid needing a separate &quot;free the strings in the returned NETRESOURCE&quot; structures.</p>
<p>The function could simply allocate the strings, keep track of the allocations and return an array of just NETRESOURCEs as you suggest, and then free all the strings during the call to WNetCloseEnum, but I suspect this function dates from the Windows 3.1 times when memory was really precious, and keeping a copy of everything the application enumerated (if you&#39;re enumerating all the computers in a domain, it can be a *lot* of data) was a bad idea.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
