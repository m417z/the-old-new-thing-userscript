<p>The media simply can't resist a good panic story, even when there is no panic to be found. <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org"> <i>On the Media</i></a></p>
<p> interviews sociology professor <a href="http://sociology.fas.nyu.edu/object/ericklinenberg.html"> Eric Klinenberg</a> on <a href="http://www.onthemedia.org/transcripts/2009/05/01/01"> what happens when the media ask you to talk about the nonexistent widespread panic over H1N1</a>. </p>
<p> Klinenberg says to the reporter, effectively, "There is no panic." Undaunted by the lack of support for his thesis, the reporter places Klinenberg's remarks on the last page of the story, under the subhead <i>Not Enough Panic?</i> </p>
<p> Read the article to learn about the White House press conference where a reporter repeatedly asks whether the flu outbreak is a bioterrorist attack and won't take No for an answer. Or, my favorite, where one news agency sends out a reporter in a mask and has him cough on people to get their reaction. (The reaction was, basically, "What's up with this guy?") Meanwhile, another news crew spots the guy and interviews him. So you have one news crew interviewing what they think is a man on the street, but is actually another reporter trying to create a story. It's so absurd it's almost art. </p>

		<p>Well, apparently there&#8217;s canine flu popping up this season as well &#8211; H3N8. Humans can&#8217;t catch it, but it&#8217;s extremely contagious between dogs. Vaccine is available, though.</p>

		<p>The funny thing about swine flu is that is was indeed cause for concern amongst the learned biologists of the world, but the media has only two ways they report on science: not a threat/EVERYBODY PANIC. Swine flu was a potential threat, worth keeping in mind, but wasn&#8217;t much more severe than the common cold right now, so it didn&#8217;t fit into those two boxes.</p>
<p>What this tells you is that you are a sucker for using the mainstream media as your only source of news. (Although the risk of being a sucker if you eschew mainstream news for your choice of ideologically compatible blogs is also high.)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
