<p>Amit wonders <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/20/10040074.aspx#10040372"> how Windows chooses where to place a newly-opened window</a> on a multiple-monitor system and gives as an example an application whose monitor choice appears inconsistent.</p>
<p> The easy part is if the application specifies where it wants the window to be. In that case, the window is placed at the requested location. How the application chooses those coordinates is up to the application. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if the application passes <code>CW_<wbr>USE&shy;DEFAULT</wbr></code>, this means that the application is saying, "I have no opinion where the window should go. Please pick a place for me." </p>
<p> If this is the first top-level window created by the application with <code>CW_<wbr>USE&shy;DEFAULT</wbr></code> as its position, and the <code>STARTF_<wbr>USE&shy;POSITION</wbr></code> flag is set in the <code>STARTUP&shy;INFO</code>, then use the position provided in the <code>dwX</code> and <code>dwY</code> members. </p>
<p> Officially, that's all you're going to see in the documentation. Past this point is all implementation detail. I'm providing it here to satisfy your curiosity, but please don't write code that relies on it. (This is, I realize, a meaningless request, but I must go through the motions of making it anyway.) </p>
<p> Okay, now let's dive into the various levels of automatic window positioning the window manager performs. Remember, these algorithms are not contractual and can change at any time. (In fact, they <i>have</i> changed in the past.) Just to make it harder to rely on this algorithm, I will not tell you which operating system implements the algorithm described below. </p>
<p> From now on, assume that the application has specified <code>CW_<wbr>USE&shy;DEFAULT</wbr></code> as its position. Also assume that the window is a top-level window. </p>
<p> First we have to choose a monitor. </p>
<ul>
<li>     If the window was created with an owner,     then the window goes onto the monitor associated with the owner window.     This tends to keep related windows together on the same monitor. </li>
<li>     Else, if the process was created by the     <code>Shell&shy;Execute&shy;Ex</code> function,     and the     <code>SEE_<wbr>MASK_<wbr>HMONITOR</wbr></wbr></code> flag was passed     in the <code>SHELL&shy;EXECUTE&shy;INFO</code> structure,     then the window goes onto the specified monitor. </li>
<li>     Else, the window goes on the primary monitor. </li>
</ul>
<p> Next, we have to choose a location on that monitor. </p>
<ul>
<li>If this is the first time we need to choose a default location     on a monitor,     or if the previous default location is too close to the bottom     right corner of the monitor,     then act as if the previous default location for the     monitor was the upper left corner of the monitor. </li>
<li>The next default location on a monitor is offset from the     previous default location, diagonally down and to the right.     
<ul>
<li>The vertical offset is chosen so that the top edge of the new         window lines up against the bottom of the previous window's         caption.     </li>
<li>The horizontal offset is chosen so that the left edge of the new         window lines up against the right edge of the caption icon         of the previous window.     </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p> The effect of this algorithm is that if you open a bunch of default-positioned windows on a monitor, they line up in a pretty cascade marching down and to the right, until the cascade goes too far, and then they return to the upper left and resume cascading. </p>
<p> Finally, after choosing a monitor and a location on the monitor, the selected location is adjusted (if possible) so that the window does not span monitors. </p>
<p> And that's it, the default-window-positioning algorithm, as it existed in an unspecified version of Windows. Remember, this algorithm has been tweaked in the past, and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/24/10178386.aspx"> it will get tweaked more in the future</a>, so don't rely on it. </p>

		<p>I assume this means that SQL Server Management Studio does not create its Filter Settings dialog with an owner as it is consistently positioned on my primary monitor. Which in turn results in me being confused as to why the dialog didn&#39;t appear for a few seconds since I don&#39;t see it pop in my periphery.</p>

		<p>Speaking of poor multi-monitor support, why can&#39;t we have the Start Screen stay up on one monitor while we work with apps on another? Instead the screen disappears whether you like it or no. What gives?</p>

		<p>[The next default location on a monitor is offset from the previous default location, diagonally down and to the right.]</p>

		<p>@Kevin &#8211; Sadly, that&#39;s not a lot of windows. That&#39;s one window being drawn repeatedly on another window who is actively ignoring requests to redraw itself.</p>

		<p>@Mike Caron &#8211; I thought this was what happened when the background window was non-responsive, and a process kept crashing. A new crash dialog would kill the old dialog, and create a new one. The new one would get positioned to offset the old window before the old window was destroyed.</p>
<p>I&#39;m aware you can create something similar by dragging a window around and leaving trails behind, but I&#39;ve also seen exactly this happen completely on its own, which is what I was assuming happened there.</p>

		<p>Kevin, you can tell this is a dragged-around window by the curvy, irregular, draggy trail like positions of the window images.</p>
<p>When the crash dialogue itself crashes you usually don&#39;t get anything special since the standard crash dialogue is centred, not positioned relatively to some other window. Although about five years ago an application with a custom crash handler managed to create a nice staircase pattern.</p>

		<p>Thinking about the pretty diagonal pattern of many default-open windows reminds me of a time I accidentally triggered the Open action on hundreds of files at once and basically hosed my system for a few minutes while it was busy drawing such pretty patterns with whatever program was responsible for those files. I don&#39;t recall which, but since it&#39;s the default behavior I was observing I don&#39;t suppose it matters.</p>

		<p>Console windows seem to have their own rules; compared to other applications I get a different number of windows in the cascade when I try. There also seems to have been an incompatible behaviour change (or bug, as I like to call it) starting with Windows XP whereby a console window refuses to automatically position at (0, 0) instead opening offset at the same position as the next one will. (You can easily demonstrate this by opening a number of command prompts in a row.)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
