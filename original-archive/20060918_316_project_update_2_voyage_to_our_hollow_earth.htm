		<p>If you are interested in Theravada Buddhism, there is an interesting passage in one of the major suttas, although it is of miniscule importance to most Theravada Buddhists.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/dn/dn.16.1-6.vaji.html</a></p>
<p>12. And the Venerable Ananda approached the Blessed One, and respectfully greeting him, sat down at one side. Then he spoke to the Blessed One, saying: &quot;Marvellous it is indeed, and most wonderful! The earth shakes mightily, tremendously! Dreadful and astonishing it is how the thunders roll across the heavens! What could be the reason, what the cause, that so mighty an earthquake should arise?&quot;</p>
<p>13. Then the Blessed One said: &quot;There are eight reasons, Ananda, eight causes for a mighty earthquake to arise. What are those eight?</p>
<p>14. &quot;This great earth, Ananda, is established upon liquid, the liquid upon the atmosphere, and the atmosphere upon space. And when, Ananda, mighty atmospheric disturbances take place, the liquid is agitated. And with the agitation of the liquid, tremors of the earth arise. This is the first reason, the first cause for the arising of mighty earthquakes.<br />
<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>A hollow Earth? Yes, according to the Buddha.</p>

<p>If the Buddha said that peanut butter can make you fly, would you believe that?<br /></p>

		<p>Hollow Planets Theory</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.hollowplanets.com/" rel="nofollow">http://www.hollowplanets.com/</a></p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
<br />Could it be that beyond a certain point density again decreases thereby refracting seismic waves around a cavity? There is a shadow area which occurs 7,000 miles from earthquake epicentres. This shadow area can be easily explained if we assume that a hollow shell&#8217;s density increases up to a point and thereafter decreases again. This will cause seismic waves to be split with some being refracted back up to the surface while others are refracted around a cavity. This would result in the exact characteristics seen in the shadow area.</p>
<p>Could the erratic rotation of the Earth, and perhaps even the Chandler Wobble be caused by huge oceans of water which are hidden deep inside the crust of a cool hollow Earth?<br />
<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>I am thinking that the decrease in density is due to some form of liquid below the crust. It may not be water.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-<br />
<br />Stars, like our Sun, are driven by nuclear fusion. This is a process where very light elements are combined and this releases vast amounts of energy. One needs a considerable mass for such a reaction to actually work. But what of nuclear fission? This is where very heavy elements like uranium are split and this also causes a release of energy. The critical mass required for a nuclear fission reaction to work is actually very little. Could a little nuclear fission star exist inside a Hollow Planet?<br />
<br />&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Could there be some form of nuclear reaction taking place inside the hollow earth that accounts for the &quot;atmospheric disturbances&quot;?</p>
<p>Maybe our Earth is an inverted Sun?</p>

		<p>&gt; A hollow Earth? Yes, according to the Buddha. </p>
<p>Actually, I don&#8217;t see at all where in the passage nidive quoted that describes the earth being hollow, unless &quot;filled with liquid&quot; is considered a form of hollowness.</p>
<p>&#8211;in which case, do note that the &quot;outer core&quot; layer of the earth *is* actually liquid, and while the mantel (the layer that actually directly causes tectonic movement)is technically solid, it does flow due to the pressure and heat involved.</p>
<p>Now the passage quoted is more likely referring to the oceans when it says &quot;liquid&quot;, and most of it (especially the thing about the &quot;atmospheric disturbances&quot; causing earthquakes) isn&#8217;t scientific accurate under even a generous interpretation, but I still don&#8217;t see where it talks about hollow-earth</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
