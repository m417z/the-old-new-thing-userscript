<p>
One of the things you can do with an internal tool
I've been calling
<i>Program&nbsp;Q</i>
is run a program any time somebody
wants to add or modify a record.
The program has wide latitude in what it can do.
It can inspect the record being added/modified,
maybe record side information in another table,
and one of the things it can decide to do is
to reject the operation.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
We have set up a validator in our main
table to ensure that the widget being added
or modified is priced within the approver's limit.
But sometimes, there is an urgent widget request
and we want to be able to bypass the validation
temporarily.
Is there a way to disable the validator just
for a specific record,
or to disable it for all records temporarily?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
If you can set up a program to validate a record,
you can also set up a program to <i>not</i> validate
a record.
</p>
<p>
Suppose your current validator for adding a
widget goes like this:
</p>
<pre>
if (record.approver.limit &lt; record.price) {
 record.Reject("Price exceeds approver's limit");
 return;
}
... other tests go here ...
</pre>
<p>
And say you want to be able to 
allow emergency requests to go through
even though, say, all approvers are unavailable.
Because, maybe, the widget is on fire.
</p>
<p>
You could decide that a widget whose description
begins with the word EMERGENCY is exempt
from all validation,
but it generates email to a special mailing list.
</p>
<pre>
<font COLOR=blue>if (record.description.beginsWith("EMERGENCY"))
{
 // emergency override: send email
 // and bypass the rest of validation
 generateNotificationEmail(record);
 return;
}</font>
if (record.approver.limit &lt; record.price) {
 record.Reject("Price exceeds approver's limit");
 return;
}
... other tests go here ...
</pre>
<p>
Of course, the EMERGENCY rule was completely
arbitrary.
You can come up with whatever rules you like.
The point is:
If you wrote the rules,
you can also write the rules so that they
have exceptions.</p>

		<p>Hmm&#8230; There wasn&#39;t by any chance a startup overhead to running the program in question, which would&#39;ve remained the same even if the validation rule = don&#39;t validate? It could&#39;ve been the reason they wanted to remove the validation in the first place.</p>

		<p>@DebugErr: There&#39;s nothing physically stopping you from pressing the fire alarm button at your office. &nbsp;If you see smoke, pressing it is fine and you will be praised for it. &nbsp;However, if you repeatedly press it without good reason, that will be career-limiting.</p>
<p>An emergency change process could be dealt with by management in the same way &#8211; using it for genuine emergencies is fine and you will be praised for it; abusing it for non-emergencies should have consequences.</p>
<p>Even if management won&#39;t take it seriously, it&#39;s possible to have more technical limits on an EMERGENCY process &#8211; e.g. if you abuse it then your access to the EMERGENCY process is revoked:</p>
<p>&gt; if (record.description.beginsWith(&quot;EMERGENCY&quot;) and record.author != &#39;DebugErr&#39;)</p>

<p>Emmm&#8230; I thought it&#39;s sent to some senior management above according to approval path settings, instead of database administrators.</p>
<p>There will also be reason and a link of approval page provided.</p>
<p>Virtually all Accounting (for adjust of past months data) / HR (for leave and OT approval) / Purchasing Dept. applications I worked for have this kind of settings.</p>

		<p>@Raymond</p>
<p>This is why I find the term DBA to be ambiguous. &nbsp;First, you have the database operator who keeps the server running, applies patches, makes sure there&#39;s enough disk for everybody&#39;s databases, and babysits the DBMS if/when it decides to wet the bed at 2AM. &nbsp;Then there&#39;s the database developer, who writes and tunes schemas and application queries, perhaps assisting with reporting as well depending on the database in question, and works with the database operator to troubleshoot failures. &nbsp;Finally, there&#39;s what I&#39;ll call a &quot;data custodian&quot; &#8212; someone, usually from the business side, who has responsibility for making sure that the data in the database is satisfactory from a business standpoint.</p>

		<p>@Raymond: At my workplace, filing critical-severity change requests is considered part of a normal workflow which is used multiple times per week. &nbsp;This is generally not the result of a bug or anything like that; it is &quot;I want to roll my code out by Thursday&quot;-type requests.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#39;m just too cynical.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
