		<p>Do the British really talk about the Mexican-American War a lot? I couldn&#39;t tell you the last time I had a conversation about (to reach back to a comparable period) the wars between Austria, Piedmont, and France. This is not because I&#39;m out to spare the feelings of Italians, Austrians, or French tourists, it just sort of works out that way.</p>
<p>(Hums the Radetzky march, goes about his business.)</p>

		<p>@Z. Taylor: As a Brit, I&#39;d volunteer that no it&#39;s not a frequent topic of conversation.</p>
<p>In view of fairness, I&#39;d contribute to this list that British people enjoy copious amounts of tea (I&#39;ve had 6 cups today) and complaining (in private but rarely in public).</p>

		<p>@James Schend: Ah, the Pig War. Virginians really hadn&#39;t figured out this sea power thing in the years that had elapsed since the battle of Long Island, had they?</p>
<p>For what it&#39;s worth, the Austrians or rather Austro-Hungarians fought a similarly bloodless &quot;Pig War&quot; against Serbia, embargoing Serbian pig exports around 1910. If only all parties had left it at that&#8230;</p>

		<p>&quot;Good conversational topics are Mexican culture, history, museums. Never discuss the Mexican American War, poverty, aliens, or earthquakes.&quot;</p>
<p>Or Top Gear.</p>

		<p>@KDeacon:</p>
<p>Not being British myself (but greatly enjoying Top Gear nevertheless), I would guess, just from the content on the show, that you&#39;re probably better off not mentioning Top Gear regardless of the nationality of your companions. &nbsp;Unless they&#39;re all British, of course :).</p>
<p>My favorite was the last one:</p>
<p>&quot;Koreans are not Chinese.&quot;</p>

		<p>Raymond is apparently a Fawlty Towers fan, as well as Monty Python. When Germans are guests at Basil&#39;s hotel, his preoccupation with not mentioning the war results in him referring to it all the time, hence &quot;I think I got away with it&quot;. I won&#39;t spoil the punchline.</p>

		<p>&quot;In America, time is a very important commodity. People “save” time and “spend” time as if it were money in the bank.&quot;</p>
<p>Are the expressions &quot;save time&quot; and &quot;spend time&quot; really not used outside the United States?</p>

		<p>&quot;Koreans are not Chinese.&quot;</p>
<p>Funny this line goes without actually stating any difference at all.</p>
<p>Bonus point when one of my friends got misrecognized as Japanese before.</p>
<p>It does sound more like a joke than official instruction.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

  The Dutch hardly ever invite people with whom they are not closely acquainted for dinner.

<p>This is true.</p>

  The Dutch do not believe in lining up and show almost no consideration in public for a person’s status, gender, or age.

<p>Huh? We queue almost as well as the English. Not as neat, but functional. The second part is true though, in a queue everyone is equal.</p>

		<p>Weirdly &quot;save time&quot; is a common phrase in the UK, as is &quot;spend time&quot; to lesser extent, so I&#39;ve no idea why they&#39;re in there. A few of the others may (or may not) be good advice, but most of them seem fairly obvious. It&#39;s good to see the UK government aren&#39;t wasting our taxes on stupid &quot;research&quot; I suppose&#8230;.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
