<p>
A lot of project management tasks are simply
<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Housekeeping_(computing)">
housekeeping</a>:
Maintenance tasks that keep things running smoothly.
For a project, that could be doing things like
closing out old work items that were successfully completed,
but which the developer failed to mark as complete
in the work item tracker.
Or it could be verifying that all the milestones for open
work items are set correctly.
Or it could be looking for work items that are assigned
to people who have since left the team.
Or it could be closing out stale pull requests.
</p>
<p>
You get the idea.
There are always some housekeeping tasks that need to be
done to ensure that the project runs smoothly.
The Microspeak for performing these housekeeping tasks is
<i>gardening</i>,
as in,
"I did some gardening over lunch and moved all the unfinished
work items from the previous milestone into the current milestone."
Or
"Bob,
can you do some gardening on the wiki and delete the outdated information?"
</p>
<p>
As with most housekeeping tasks,
gardening tasks are largely mechanical and do not
require the person performing them to make any decisions
that alter the project.
Gardening is primarly about getting the bookkeeping
up to date with the current reality.
</p>
<p>
I suspect that this Microspeak term is not in use in the UK.
In the UK, if you ask a work colleague to
<a HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garden_leave">
do some gardening</a>,
that is a euphemism for asking them to resign.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m fairly certain that that one has made the rounds across the globe for awhile. I&#8217;ve heard many a politician use that expression/excuse (at least in Canada) for a long time; sometimes it&#8217;s even true!</p>

		<p>The only Canadianism that I&#8217;m aware of for someone considering resigning is &#8220;Going for a walk in the snow&#8221; (based on something that Pierre Trudeau said), and that&#8217;s only a euphemism that reporters use regarding politicians.</p>

		<p>&#8220;Gardening Leave&#8221; isn&#8217;t being asked to resign &#8211; its being told to stay away from work while still getting paid (either pending a disciplinary, or while working your notice.)</p>

		<p>True. If you are placed on gardening leave, then you are on disciplinary suspension or working your notice. But if somebody asks you to go on gardening leave, then presumably they are asking you to submit your notice (as opposed asking you to do something that would put you on disciplinary suspension).</p>

		<p>No, that&#8217;s not how notice works.  If a company wants to make me unemployed, they don&#8217;t ask me to resign (i.e. submit my notice) &#8211; they give me my notice.  Either of us can terminate our employment, subject to the notice period (modulo things which legally justify immediate dismissals, such as Gross Misconduct).  Usually, when someone is on gardening leave its because they&#8217;ve been fired, legally very different process from being asked to resign (for example, notice periods may be assymetric, and eligibility for unemployment benefits, payoff, rights to claim unfair/constructive dismissal are very different depending on how employment terminated).</p>

		<p>I was taking it in more of the oblique hint way, not the explicit hint. &#8220;So, how&#8217;s the garden?&#8221; &#8220;No, please, I&#8217;ll do better next time!&#8221;</p>

		<p>&#8220;Usually, when someone is on gardening leave its because they’ve been fired,&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s done in any case when the employer is worried the employee is going to be hostile and has the ability to do damage.</p>
<p>Which is more likely to happen if the employee isn&#8217;t leaving willingly.</p>
<p>Employees aren&#8217;t normally asked to resign, although it can happen if they are about to be sacked. But then you need to negotiate because you have more rights if you&#8217;re sacked. </p>
<p>Depending on which country you are in, some contractual clauses can disappear if you are sacked. Like if you agree that you won&#8217;t work for a competitor but then get sacked, then you can argue that your experience means you can only realistically gain employment at your competitor and that it&#8217;s unfair for you to be held to it.</p>

		<p>One interesting difference between the US and NZ is that in NZ a bunch of contractual limitations only apply while you&#8217;re being paid. Most importantly, control over who you can work for by your previous employer. Some companies were very unhappy with that court case (late 20th century), and I wouldn&#8217;t be too surprised if it&#8217;s been changed. Not that many employees know about it. But the basic rule is &#8220;they can only tell you what to do while they&#8217;re paying you&#8221;.</p>

		<p>I see. Let&#8217;s if I can use it right:</p>
<p>&gt; Windows 10 is an operating system that remains in the state of perpetual gardening, until October 2020, when – according to Microsoft Support policy – the whole Windows platform would be sent to do some gardening.</p>
<p>Did I do it right? What I wanted to write was:</p>
<p>&gt; Windows 10 is an operating system that remains in the state of being constantly maintained, until October 2020, when – according to Microsoft Support policy – the whole Windows platform would be retired.</p>

		<p>Obligatory notice: I&#8217;ll be adding the French version of the phrase to Wikipedia article on &#8220;The pot calling the kettle black&#8221;.</p>
<p>Of course, if it were possible to edit my comment, I&#8217;d do it now, changing it to a safer example. How did I know this example was unsafe and attracts the accusation of trolling? I though three years ago, when Microsoft announced its support policy, Microsoft fanboys did their crying and mourning and are done by now. (Maybe I am not wrong though. A person who seeks to harass other would eventually find an excuse regardless.)</p>

		<p>Because that&#8217;s how language works across geographical boundaries.</p>
<p>When I was doing linguistic studies about the variations of English language across the United States, I realized that a place so large as Microsoft can develop its own language variety. Sure, I&#8217;ve seen lot&#8217;s of trolls would accuse Microsoft of isolating itself from the reset of the world, but until then I didn&#8217;t realize that it actually can happen naturally, instead of deliberately and maliciously.</p>
<p>It is not just housekeeping-&gt;gardening. We have lots of other things that Microsoft says differently. e.g. use of &#8220;software counterfeiting&#8221; instead of &#8220;software piracy&#8221; (remember WGA), &#8220;x86&#8221; instead of &#8220;IA-32&#8221;, &#8220;favorites&#8221; instead of &#8220;bookmarks&#8221;, and their radically different definition of &#8220;system partition&#8221; and &#8220;boot partition&#8221;.</p>
<p>And it is not just Microsoft. For example, Square-Enix uses &#8220;status affinity&#8221; and &#8220;status ailment&#8221; instead of &#8220;buff&#8221; and &#8220;debuff&#8221;. It once used &#8220;junctioning&#8221; instead of &#8220;linking&#8221; or &#8220;association&#8221;.</p>

		<p>My guess is that it started with somebody being humorous, and then it spread and became established Microspeak. Language is like that. See: OK.</p>

		<p>In Canada when I was young there used to be a phrase about a team getting an early chance to play golf (exiting the playoffs early via a loss presumably meant they could fly south or southwest (Hawai&#8217;i) a week or so earlier than they were going to anyway and golf in the US) and at least have some enjoyment of their situation I think Trudeau&#8217;s reference was from an old Inuit saying.</p>

		<p>At my work, our backlog is primarily driven by user requests, but some activities need to be done at certain times of the year and if we wait for a user request, we don&#8217;t have enough lead time to get it done, so I created what I called a &#8220;gardening calendar&#8221; so that we know what repeated activities have to start when. It is much akin to planting your seeds in early spring for a summer harvest, etc.</p>

		<p>I tend to use &#8220;shepherding&#8221; for passing bugs on to the relevant people, claim sing, etc.<br />
But then I&#8217;m not a manager :)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
