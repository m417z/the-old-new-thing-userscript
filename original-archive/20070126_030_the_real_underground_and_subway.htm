<p> <a href="http://www.ltmuseum.co.uk/"> London's Transport Museum</a> commissioned a gorgeous interactive map called <a href="http://www.tfl.gov.uk/tube/maps/realunderground/realunderground.html"> The Real Underground</a> which lets you see two of the <a href="http://owen.massey.net/tubemaps.html"> many versions of the world-famous London Underground Map</a>, as well as a street map, and switch among them to see how the two schematics agree with actual geography. I wasted way too much time playing with the Real Underground. Now it's your turn. (Looking at the <a href="http://homepage.ntlworld.com/clivebillson/tube/tube.html"> evolution of transit maps</a>, you can see that it was Harry Beck's breakthrough map from 1933 that changed the face of tube maps forever.) </p>
<p> There appears to be a similar effort to <a href="http://www.directionsmag.com/article.php?article_id=811"> do the same to the New York Subway map</a>, published by the brilliant folks at <a href="http://www.urbanmapping.com/"> Urban Mapping</a>. I visit New York only once every other year or so, but this map is so cool I'm tempted to get it anyway, even though I'll probably misplace it by the time I next travel there. </p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a great website on the history of the Underground, with a lot of focus on the closed stations and other such odd little things (like the WW2 era shelters).</p>

		<p>I remember visiting the Transport Museum and studying its really interesting exhibit on the history of the Map.</p>
<p>They showed a lot of other cities&#8217; subway maps, usually based on the London map, but none of them were as clear and comprehensible.</p>
<p>I wonder what there is about the topology of the London Underground that makes Harry Beck&#8217;s map so ideal? &nbsp;Why does the same approach in New York or Paris look cluttered?</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>Iknow that, in Sydney, our train map is based off the London map, but our train lines actually share a lot of physical tracks.</p>
<p>One of the cool things about the London underground is that, if you get on the right platform, then you simply hop on the next train that comes along.</p>
<p>In Sydney, you&#8217;ve also got to study the computer screens, which tell you which stations the next train will be stopping at.</p>
<p>I found navigating London by underground an absolute pleasure, compared to catching trains in Sydney.</p>

		<p>Dean: In general this is not true. When they get to outer London, some services only stop at major stations. There are also branches in some lines, and lines that share tracks/platforms.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m sure Raymond loves nothing more than offtopic questions that aren&#8217;t related to his work, but regardless: </p>
<p>In the Networking tab of the Task Manager, if you have more than two network adapters and click on the scrollbar, the scrollbar thumb blinks. &nbsp;You can also make the thumb blink by tabbing through the window. &nbsp;What *is* that? &nbsp;An exotic combination of WS_ styles, etc., or did the Task Manager author(s) code the blinking behavior themselves? &nbsp;(And if the latter, why?) &nbsp;</p>
<p>I think it has something to do with the Networking lacking a real scrollable view (humor my imprecise terms): you can change which adapters&#8217; graphs are displayed, but you can&#8217;t scroll so that (say) you see the bottom half of graph #1, all of #2, and the top half of #3. &nbsp;Maybe this is a rare case where the scroll bar is focusable, rather than only being attached to a view that&#8217;s focusable.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure my total lack of Win32 programming skills is showing &#8212; curious all the same, though.</p>

		<p>The map morph does a good job of hilighting the fact that the schematics have nothing to do with the geography of the real world. If you live entirely in the underground system and have infinite time then maybe that doesn&#8217;t really matter, but if you&#8217;d like to know things like what sort of distances are involved on a particular leg of the journey, how to effectively workaround the regular failures and rush-hour congestion, then the official maps are completely useless.</p>

		<p>Moscow subway borrowed this approach 30 years later, in 1960-ies.</p>
<p>Here are some classic examples of Moscow subway schemes: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.metro.ru/map/1980/" rel="nofollow">http://www.metro.ru/map/1980/</a> The website is in Russian only and is not an official representation of Moscow subway, it is a personal project. But pictures do not require translation.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
