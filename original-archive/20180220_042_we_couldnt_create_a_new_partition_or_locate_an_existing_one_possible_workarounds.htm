<p>
One of the consequences of being part of the Windows Insiders program
is that occasionally you run into a bug so bad that your system doesn't boot.
Fortunately, the kernel team was able to diagnose the problem
on my machine and develop a fix.
</p>
<p>
The fix was too late for me, but at least it will be useful to others.
In the meantime, I had to reinstall my system.
I waited for the fix to be released and copied the build
to a bootable USB thumb drive.
I booted from that thumb drive and told Windows to install
to the partition that held my previous (broken) Windows installation.
</p>
<p>
And that's where I got the error
"We couldn't create a new partition or locate an existing one."
</p>
<p>
The Setup team told me that Setup wants a System partition,
and one way to make this possible is to shrink an
existing partition by around 500MB.
But my machine already had a System partition.
After all, it's being used by the
existing Windows installation.
</p>
<p>
We played around and concluded that Setup was getting confused
over which volume was the boot volume,
and it may be trying to treat the USB thumb drive as the boot volume
and trying to create a System partition on it.
</p>
<p>
Here's the solution:
At the initial Setup dialog box,
do not click <i>Install Windows</i>.
Instead, press
<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>F10</kbd>.
This will open a command prompt.
</p>
<p>
Use the command prompt to copy the contents of the thumb drive
to a directory in the root of disk 0.
The drive letter for disk 0 will vary, so let's say it's <code>X:</code>,
and for concreteness,
let's call the directory <code>X:\media</code>.
</p>
<p>
Once the contents have been copied,
remove the USB thumb drive,
and reverify that you are on the initial dialog box.
(If you accidentally proceeded past it, then click <i>Back</i>
to get back to it.)
Then run
<code>X:\media\<code></code>sources\<code></code>setup.exe</code>.
</p>
<p>
There are actually two Setup programs.
The first one is
<code>setup.exe</code> in the root of the install media.
This is the Setup introductory dialog.
</p>
<p>
If you click <i>Install</i>, then it runs
<code>sources\<code></code>setup.exe</code>,
which is the main Setup program.
</p>
<p>
Each Setup program detects that a copy of itself is already
running and will hand control over to the existing copy.
</p>
<p>
This means that running
<code>X:\<code></code>media\<code></code>setup.exe</code>
will not work because it will detect is already-running copy
and hand control to it.
</p>
<p>
You have to
make sure that you haven't clicked the
<i>Install</i> button in the initial setup dialog,
and then
run the Setup program in the
<code>sources</code> subdirectory.
</p>
<p>
And don't forget to remove the USB thumb drive before you
run
<code>X:\<code></code>media\<code></code>sources\<code></code>setup.exe</code>.
Otherwise, it will see the thumb drive and get confused again.
</p>
<p>
There are other ways to solve the problem,
but this one seemed the most straightforward.
Basically, you first want to boot Windows off <i>something</i>.
A USB bootable drive is most convenient,
but a network (PXE) boot or a bootable CD will also work.
Next, remove all storage drives except the one you want to install from.
That way Setup won't get confused.
And finally, run <code>sources\setup.exe</code> to get the party started.
</p>
<p>
It worked for me.
Maybe it'll work for you.</p>

		<p>I respectfully disagree, there are a <em>lot</em> of reasons that installs get corrupted. Everything from bad updates to a power outage. Like or not heavy duty recoveries like this do happen all the time. More often than not by just mounting the drive on another computer and then copying off data. Doing it this way prevents that from even being necessary. While in a perfect world an install would never get corrupted that&#8217;s just not realistic.</p>

		<p>This isn&#8217;t just a corrupted install issue, though, this is the installer being unable to understand the drives properly so you can select one to install.  And that is a problem that definitely should never be able to get out to any users not in the insider program.</p>

I agree &#8211; but have you ever seen ANYTHING in the knowledge base that was as clear and informative as one of Raymond&#8217;s write-ups?  Sometimes it seems that the KB is where knowledge goes to die.</p>

		<p>The ability to immediately launch a command prompt pressing Shift+F10 is a neat trick. The visible way (going through the repair options) is slow because it tries to auto-dectect all Windows installations, and may fail if the disk is so wrecked it doesn&#8217;t detect Windows.</p>

		<p>This reminds me the experience that once upon a time, when I need to install Linux on some disk connecting to RAID card, I have to Ctrl-Alt-F3 to switch to the shell, mount driver disk and copy to ramdisk, then insmod some drivers before continue.</p>
<p>Cool thing you can fire up a shell to fix something to allow installer to continue.</p>

		<p>Agreed, in the sense that at least during each blog website upgrade/migration, they remember to fix the links and/or use rewrite like modules to keep the old link work.</p>
<p>There are a number of KB simply disappeared without anything like saying the article is retired or something.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s mostly true: links in comments don&#8217;t seem to get fixed, and really old asp.net links are broken everywhere. That&#8217;s not bad though, compared to the link rot that I see in a lot of other sites!</p>

		<p>Microsoft really should convert some blog entries into KB articles. Authors like Raymond Chen, Eric Lippert (which sadly is no more at Microsoft), Larry Osterman and Aaron Margosis come to mind.</p>
<p>Oh, and as pointed by skSdnW, the entire knowledge base should be mirrored in Archive.org.</p>

		<p>A full reinstall? Ouch. We public build users are lucky; only ever need minor fixes such as rebuilding the bootloader twice daily. *cough*</p>
<p>These kinds of posts are really useful, I&#8217;d practically forgotten about Shift+F10. I wonder if there&#8217;s another hidden shortcut for making the OS upgrade process more verbose; watching the spinner go from 0% to 100% is a bit like watching paint dry.</p>

		<p>Hopefully the Windows setup team can have a look at what Linux distros do for their install media these days.  The same binary image can be written directly to a USB stick or a CD, and it just boots.  On a UEFI system (including mac oddities) it boots as EFI.  On BIOS systems it boots as BIOS mode.  It quite simply just works.  (You can even loopback mount the image and do PXE netbooting off it too!)</p>
<p>Windows is especially frustrating.  For example if you have a cd image (which is usually all you get to download) then quite a few hoops have to be jumped through to turn it into a UEFI bootable USB stick.  Various tools operate on partitions which makes it more complicated to setup the partitioning and boot sectors.</p>

		<p>From Vista onwards, it&#8217;s actually been really simple to create bootable Windows USB sticks &#8211; copy the content of ISO to USB stick, and 90% of the time it&#8217;ll just work. If it doesn&#8217;t, check the following:<br />
&#8211; for BIOS booting, run X:\boot\bootsect.exe /nt60 /mbr X: (replace X: with the actual drive letter; this is only required if the stick was previously formatted with something that&#8217;s not Vista or newer; filesystem can be FAT32 or NTFS &#8211; either will work)<br />
&#8211; for UEFI booting, make sure that the stick is FAT32-formatted, because that&#8217;s the only filesystem the firmware is guaranteed to support</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t call that &#8220;really simple&#8221;!  Having to get partition types and formatting right, and especially the BIOS boot dance is a pain.  Testing is also frustrating since the usual symptom is not showing in boot selection menus or just not booting without useful diagnostics.  Or it booting in BIOS mode when you wanted UEFI.  The Linux &#8220;this image just works&#8221; is considerably more simple and not prone to those kind of errors.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve run into situations like this. Other solutions for me have been: Make sure extraneous devices aren&#8217;t in the bootable devices in the BIOS/UEFI. Sometimes a USB drive will sneak its way in front of the desired boot device. This doesn&#8217;t seem to be a problem for an existing installation, but Setup doesn&#8217;t handle that situation well. I&#8217;ve also run into the issue of booting off the USB/CD in the wrong mode&#8230; trying to install UEFI without booting UEFI or vice versa. That&#8217;s more a UEFI/BIOS interface issue in conjunction with user error.</p>

		<p>A few Fast updates ago, I had just been letting Windows rename its old stuff (Windows.000, Windows.001, etc.) until one of the builds apparently decided &#8220;that&#8217;s enough&#8221; and decided to toast all the files from the Windows.002 directory (including my Users directory!) I still haven&#8217;t located all of the files that it trashed. Lesson learned: make more backups (always good advice), and don&#8217;t trust the installer to keep stuff!</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve run into this problem installing Windows Server 2012 and 2012 R2.  So, it&#8217;s not an insider thing.  (And yes it should have been fixed long ago.)  I wish this article had come out earlier so I knew about shift F10.  I wasted a lot of time the first time this happened to me.  </p>
<p>Other work-arounds I found are to use a CD instead of a USB disk or to explicitly boot UEFI.  I recently encountered this problem installing Server 2012 R2.  Booting legacy resulted in the partition problem.  Booting UEFI allowed the install to proceed without issue.  Next time, I&#8217;ll try shift-F10.</p>

		<p>Windows thought that the drive you booted from was your boot drive&#8230; why is this surprising?</p>

		<p>I just had this issue a couple of weeks ago and ended up having to delete all partitions and starting from scratch! Anyway, good to have this info for the next time it occurs. Thanks.</p>

		<p>Okay, now that I am less likely to attract unwanted attention, here are a couple of tips for improving future posts:</p>
<p>1. When it comes to Windows Setup, please never use X to refer to either the bootloader or the OS volumes. X is reserved for the RAM disk. I&#8217;d use [Vol:] but C is always okay too.<br />
2. When using the terms &#8220;System partition&#8221; or &#8220;Boot partition&#8221; please specify whether you mean the globally accepted meaning or the Microsoft meaning. Or, better yet, consider using &#8220;Bootloader&#8217;s partition&#8221; and &#8220;OS partition&#8221; instead.</p>

		<p>Wow, I actually ran into this issue. Considering the timing and the fact I&#8217;m also an insider, I think I actually hit the exact same bug. [Happened when trying to install 17604, which got out six days before this post]</p>
<p>I deleted all partitions and was left with only unallocated space, but the setup [also running off a USB drive] still couldn&#8217;t create a partition.</p>
<p>I ended up going to cmd and creating one from there and reentering setup. The partition creating via cmd still wouldn&#8217;t work, but now deleting and creating a new one did.</p>
<p>This is a very helpful post. [Although, admittedly, I wouldn&#8217;t have reached it in time anyway.]</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
