<p>Various types of shell extensions such as thumbnail extractors are run in a separate process, and if one of those shell extensions crashes, it takes out <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/12/9413816.aspx"> the COM Surrogate</a> rather than the main Explorer process.</p>
<p> Anonymous wondered <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/05/9700488.aspx#9701560"> if this model could be extended to all types of shell extensions</a>, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/12/02/9931183.aspx#9931717"> perhaps not all at once, but gradually</a>. The dangers of extending this model to existing shell extensions are compatibility (of course) and re-entrancy. </p>
<p> The thumbnail extractor interface was lucky in that the only parameter an extractor received was an <code>IShellItem</code> representing the object for which the caller wishes to retrieve a thumbnail. There's no foothold into the user interface, which means that it can be moved to a place that has no user interface. </p>
<p> Unfortunately, most shell extensions are not so lucky. Many of them receive some user interface object (usually a window handle) as a parameter. If those types of shell extensions have historically been hosted in-process, then the implementors of those shell extensions will do things like take that window handle and subclass it (possibly walking around the window hierarchy for a while until it finds a window it wants to subclass). Moving the shell extension into another process would break it, because you can't subclass windows in another process. </p>
<p> Even if you manage to find an interface that is given no foothold into the user interface, you still may not be able to move it to a host process due to the danger of re-entrancy. When you invoke a COM method call from a single-threaded apartment (and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/04/24/8420242.aspx"> all UI work is done in single-threaded apartments</a>), and the object that is the recipient of the call lives on another thread or even in another process, COM will send the request to that other thread and pump messages waiting for the reply. This means that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/12/02/9931183.aspx#9931935"> a method call which previously never pumped messages now does</a>, opening windows of re-entrancy, and the great thing about windows of re-entrancy is that you never hit them yourself, but your customers somehow manage to find them without any problem. </p>

		<p>I can never forgive Microsoft for taking out IColumnProvider and compatibility with around 60% shell extensions with Vista. Only about 40% of shell extensions on the market work with Vista and later (and I mean 32-bit Vista, not even 64-bit Windows for which Microsoft forgot to build a bridge). Vista broke shell extensions of almost all type &#8211; Property sheet, infotip, context menu, icon handler, thumbnail handler, AutoPlay handler and entirely got rid of column handlers and Windows 7 also later joined the massive functionality degradation party. Vista/W7 shell (Explorer, Taskbar, Start Menu) is a massive step back in compatibility, usability, customizability and features. It&#39;s as if the NT 6 shell was done by interns at Microsoft who still don&#39;t seem to get their act together for Windows 8.</p>

		<p>@xpclient: &nbsp;IColumnProvider was a useful extension mechanism; I still miss it. &nbsp;Other than that I have not seen many compatibility issues introduced by Vista or 7. &nbsp;Maybe the ones that broke were just poorly written in the first place. &nbsp;Unfortunately I have to agree with you that lately things are being dumbed down a bit; my favorite is the file times going from hh:mm:ss to &quot;X minutes ago&quot;. &nbsp;Ironically this is only for files modified recently; files modified less recently retain the hh:mm:ss format. &nbsp;So the more recently a file has been modified the less accurate its last modified time is. &nbsp;Beautiful. &nbsp;Now Windows 8 is bringing the cell phone UI to the desktop; please excuse me while I gag on my own vomit.</p>

		<p>The ö in coördinate gets parsed as an o-umlaut, which is immediately discarded/corrected by the spell checker. It just causes a minor delay because the &quot;mis-spelling&quot; is kind of unusual.</p>

		<p>@Joshua, we are talking about shell extensions here. How would replacing the shell help in any way with achieving shell extension compatibility? You seem to have no idea about how the shell took a step back w.r.t number of features and shell extension compatibility in Vista/7.</p>

		<p>@xpclient, At least two of the alternative file managers still support IColumnProvider, even on Vista and Win7. Windows did not drop support for those shell extensions; Windows Explorer did.</p>
<p>I believe that was the sort of point that Joshua was trying to make.</p>
<p>(You don&#39;t have to replace the entire shell, either. That&#39;s more trouble than it is worth, IMO. You can replace Windows Explorer with something else as the default folder double-click handler.)</p>

		<p>@Leo Davidson, the problem with using third party file managers is that they are slow to adopt or completely missing the new functionality every new release of Explorer/Windows brings. For example, many do not yet support libraries, saved searches, property handlers, preview pane, Windows Search-based recursive filtering or the new file copying improvements in Windows 8 like pausing (you get the idea). There are certain core OS components for which no replacement is not good enough and Explorer is one of them. Plus, almost every third party file manager is extremely ugly. Not that Explorer is particularly beautiful but it&#39;s far less uglier. Using an Explorer replacement is just not feasible. Microsoft should have made efforts to preserve shell extension compatibility in Vista and later. (Dozens of property sheet, infotip, thumbnailing etc extensions do NOT work in Vista but work in XP). I don&#39;t know the reasons for such high level of broken compatibility (might be UAC or might be deprecated shell interfaces).</p>

<p>What about running the extension not just in a separate process but with a restricted token so that it can&#39;t do any damage? &nbsp;I realise that its original goal was simply to prevent crashes, but given that malformed images and codec exploits are a primary exploit vector for 0-day malware, this seems like a useful way to sandbox anything that deals with potentially tainted data. &nbsp;Is there any technical reason why this couldn&#39;t be done? &nbsp;Just curious&#8230;</p>

		<p>Argh, I can&#39;t edit my previous post: The question was based on the previous discussion of COM surrogates some time ago, &quot;Explorer has learned not to trust thumbnail extractors; they have a poor track record for stability&quot;. &nbsp;They also have a poor record for security, sandboxing them seems like one way of dealing with this. &nbsp;This helped Android a while back with a malformed MP3, since they run their media codecs in a sandbox someone who used the MP3 exploit couldn&#39;t get very far with it.</p>

		<p>@xpclient: You just haven&#39;t found the right file manager&#8230;</p>
<p>I won&#39;t say the name as I don&#39;t want to look like I&#39;m advertising a particular product, but there is at least one which covers all of that functionality (and far from playing catch-up, in several cases it had those things or similar years earlier (and with things like preview handlers, supports both them and its own older viewer APIs so you get both) and which looks pretty much however you want it to look.</p>
<p>But it sounds to me like you just want to complain rather than actually solve your problems. :)</p>
<p>Complaining about Windows Explorer is like complaining about Notepad, Calc or MSPaint. They&#39;re fine for casual usage but if you find the bundled tools too limited then you should look for a tool aimed more at what you want to do.</p>
<p>My only annoyance with IColumnProvider being dropped by Windows Explorer is it means &#8212; especially once XP is phased out completely &#8212; that shell extensions are less likely to implement it in the future. But source control is about the only type of shell extension where I want/need an IColumnProvider and hopefully Tortoise* will continue to implement it for the file managers which continue to support it.</p>

<p>That&#39;s not a bad idea for new code, as some kind of opt-in, but I&#39;m pretty sure it would break too many existing shell extensions to be able to make it mandatory or opt-out. Too many of them assume (and require) that they can do things which a sandbox/restricted token would break.</p>
<p>(Just look at the preview handlers in your registry, and how few of them opt into running under low-integrity. And that is things which had to be designed for an API which had the low-integrity opt-in from the start.)</p>

		<p>@Joshua: what&#39;s the trick to solve the reentrance? I know that what&#39;s done is done, but the combination of &quot;PeekMessage may create reentrance, but you should know that and prepare for it&quot; and Apartment-threaded COM using the message pump to wait for returning calls is one of the most deadly pitfalls I encountered so far in the Windows architecture. In particular, IMessageFilter does not always help because PeekMessage dispatches &quot;sent&quot; messages internally. I am pretty sure that many programs capable of hosting out-of-process COM servers (for example, Office) have a myriad of little bugs caused by this reentrance possibility.</p>

<p>I thought LI for preview handlers was opt-out, so you have to explicitly set DisableLowILProcessIsolation = 1, see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/cc144143%28v=vs.85%29.aspx" rel="nofollow">msdn.microsoft.com/&#8230;/cc144143%28v=vs.85%29.aspx</a>. Does this mean that developers are mostly setting DisableLowILProcessIsolation, so they&#39;re choosing to opt-out for LI? &nbsp;The linked page actually warns that &quot;it is not recommended to do so. Systems could eventually be configured to reject any process that is not low IL&quot;.</p>

		<p>My only problem with Microsoft breaking context handlers&#39; backward compatibility is that it didn&#39;t go far enough. I know this topic&#39;s done to death, but after just straight-up malware I can&#39;t begin to count how many times I&#39;ve seen misbehaving context handlers mess up the UX.</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
