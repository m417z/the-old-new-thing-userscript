<p>Remember, Microspeak is not merely for jargon exclusive to Microsoft, but it's jargon you need to know.</p>
<p> We don't encounter the term <i>spend</i> much in the engineering side of the company, but it's in common use among those who regularly deal with money and budgets. </p>

<blockquote class="q"><p> Our corresponding spend will increase significantly if we adopt this proposal. </p>

<p> From the above citations, it is apparent that the word <i>spend</i> is shorthand for <i>expenditure</i>. </p>

<p> So much for that theory. Here, <i>spend</i> means <i>available budget</i>. </p>
<p> My new theory is that <i>spend</i> is shorthand for <i>spending</i>. </p>
<p> This appears to be common use in business-speak: </p>

		<p>To me it seems more like a nouning[0] than a shorthand, and is therefore tense-less[1][2] unlike the verb &quot;to spend&quot;. Which is how it equally applies to an amount we are in the process of spending, or an amount spent, or an amount that is projected to be spent, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>[0] If verbs can be nouned, then nouns &#8211; including &quot;noun&quot; itself &#8211; can surely be verbed. Right?</p>
<p>[1] Like all nouns, with the possible exception of (ex-)parrot.</p>
<p>[2] Tenseless? Atensical? Untensed? Anyone&#8230;?</p>

		<p>Spend, spend.. sounds very forceful just like we can spend. Expenditure sounds very timid, like we really want to save.</p>

		<p>Another example usage: in Singapore, it&#39;s common to see advertisements on the street like &quot;Get $10 off with $50 min spend.&quot;</p>

		<p>@Rick C: Whoosh! xpclient and auto-sorting is now legend enough that the feature has become a parody. I believe he was making a joke (which I quite liked) rather than actually being negative in this case.</p>

		<p>This type of usage is pretty much seen everywhere. First, there are the famous &quot;buy&quot; and &quot;sell&quot;. Depending on the context, they could be &quot;buying&quot;, &quot;purchase&quot; and &quot;bought&quot; plus &quot;selling&quot;, &quot;sale&quot; and &quot;sold&quot;. I also see a lot of &quot;merge&quot; everywhere when it actually means &quot;merger&quot;.</p>

		<p>I posted it as a joke. In case you haven&#39;t been following this blog, I sometimes try to use microspeak with the auto sorting example because this Explorer behavior still drives me mad and mixes up/scatters all my files.</p>
<p>Joke apart, people are still frustrated by it: <a href="http://www.classicshell.net/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&amp;t=3181" rel="nofollow" target="_new">http://www.classicshell.net/&#8230;/viewtopic.php</a> and ask in Microsoft&#39;s forums or Classic Shell&#39;s forum how to disable it. I just don&#39;t get it &#8211; what&#39;s the big deal about offering choice of a past feature. It&#39;s a reminder of Microsoft&#39;s unbelievable arrogance. That same arrogance in giving little choices &#8211; Start menu vs Start screen, Ribbon vs classic toolbars, that caused disasters like Vista or Windows 8 and resulted in company executives getting fired for not giving enough choice about OS behaviors. If anyone should &quot;drop&quot; anything, it&#39;s Microsoft who should drop their arrogance and immediately create a hotfix for Windows 8.1/8/7 and change the Windows 9 codebase as well to make auto sorting optional before another abominable OS ships and flops due to very poor and rude changes form the Windows Shell/UI team. And even if they really don&#39;t want an option in the GUI for this to not confuse novice users, there&#39;s no excuse for not at least making a Registry entry or Group Policy for it.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>I don&#39;t want to hear you complaining about how late and bloated Windows is, then. All those options take time and space to implement. You seem to think that adding the feature back is a simple 5 lines of code. -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>After working at a major corporation 90% staffed by English as a Second Language (ESL) speakers it seems Microspeak/etc. is not corporate slang or shorthand but rather just butchered English. Previous major corporations I&#39;ve worked at staffed primarily by native English speakers have none of this type of language. &nbsp;This explains DonH&#39;s comment &#8211; these phrases are just never mastered by ESL speakers. We shouldn&#39;t be including them in our lexicon, in the same way we don&#39;t include invalid syntax in our code. </p>

<p>I have a very difficult time believing this, because I absolutely have, and this isn&#39;t a recently identified phenomenon.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
