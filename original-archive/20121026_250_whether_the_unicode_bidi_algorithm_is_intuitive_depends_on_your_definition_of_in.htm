<p>In Windows, we spend a good amount of time with the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnste/archive/2006/06/27/647915.aspx"> pseudo-mirrored build</a>. And one of the things that you notice is that pseudo-mirrored text comes out looking really weird. For example, the string <span style="border: black .75pt solid; padding-left: .2ex; padding-right: .2ex"> really? (yup).</span> comes out pseudo-mirrored as <span style="border: black .75pt solid; padding-left: .2ex; padding-right: .2ex"> .(really? (yup</span>. Just for fun, here's here's how your browser renders it:</p>
<blockquote class="m" dir="rtl"><p> really? (yup). </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Even stranger, the IPv6 address <span style="border: black .75pt solid; padding-left: .2ex; padding-right: .2ex"> 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334</span> comes out as <span style="border: black .75pt solid; padding-left: .2ex; padding-right: .2ex"> db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334:2001</span>. (The IPv6 address was the string that prompted this article.) The result of the RTL IPv6 address is even weirder if you force a line break at a particular point. If your browser follows the Unicode Bidi algorithm, you can resize the box below to see how the line break position affects the rendering. </p>
<blockquote class="m" dir="rtl"><p> 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334 </p>
</blockquote>
<p> If your browser doesn't follow the Unicode Bidi algorithm, or if you can't resize the window, here's what you get: </p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse">
<tr>
<td valign="baseline" style="padding-right: 1em">No line break</td>
<td style="font-family: monospace; border: solid black .75pt; text-align: right" nowrap>db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334:2001</td>

<p> "Is this a bug?" </p>
<p> No. </p>
<p> Well, maybe yes. </p>
<p> It depends. </p>
<p> But mostly yes. </p>
<p> Windows is following the <a href="http://www.unicode.org/reports/tr9/"> Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm</a>. So the part that's not a bug is "Windows is correctly following an international standard." The weirdness you're seeing is just a consequence of following the standard. </p>
<p> Let's look at what's going on. </p>
<p> When you render text in RTL context, what you're saying is "Render this text in the form you would see it if it appeared in a newspaper printed in an RTL language." For illustration, we follow the convention that uppercase characters are considered to be in an RTL script, lowercase characters are considered to be in an LTR script, and non-letters stand for themselves. </p>
<p> Say you want to render the string "NEXT COMES john smith." A newspaper would say, "Well, my readership expects things to be laid out right to left. The string 'john smith' is a foreign name inserted into a paragraph that otherwise is written my readers' native language. If the name were in my readers' native language, I would render it as </p>
<blockquote class="m" style="text-align: right"><p> .HTIMS NHOJ SEMOC TXEN </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Since the name is in a foreign language, I will treat it as an opaque 'name blob' that got inserted into my otherwise beautiful RTL sentence." </p>
<blockquote class="m" style="text-align: right"><p> .<span style="border: solid .75pt black">john smith</span> SEMOC TXEN </p>
</blockquote>
<p> (The black outline is not part of the actual output. I am using it to highlight that the phrase <i>john smith</i> is being treated as a single unit.) </p>
<p> This also explains why "hello." comes out as "<span dir="rtl">hello.</span>". The LTR text is treated as a blob inside an otherwise RTL sentence. </p>
<blockquote class="m" style="text-align: right"><p> .<span style="border: solid .75pt black">hello</span> </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Things get weirder once parentheses and digits and more complex punctuation marks are thrown into the mix. For example, the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm has to figure out that in the text "IT IS A bmw 500, OK." the "500" is attached to the LTR text "bmw", resulting in </p>
<blockquote class="m" style="text-align: right"><p> .KO ,<span style="border: solid .75pt black">bmw 500</span> A SI TI </p>
</blockquote>
<p> And it also needs to work out the correct text rendering order when you have RTL text embedded inside LTR text, all of which is embedded inside other RTL text, as illustrated by the brain-teaser "DID YOU SAY &rsquo;he said &ldquo;car MEANS CAR&rdquo;&lsquo;?" </p>
<p> But maybe the standard is buggy. The problem is that the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm is designed for text, so when you ask it to render things that aren't text (such as IPv6 addresses and URLs), the results can be nonsensical. </p>
<p> At least for the IPv6 case, you can work around the problem by explicitly marking the IPv6 address as LTR, so that the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm doesn't get involved, and the characters are rendered left-to-right in the order they were written. </p>
<p> <b>Exercise</b>: Study the Unicode Bidirectional Algorithm and explain why <span style="border: black .75pt solid; padding-left: .2ex; padding-right: .2ex"> really? (yup).</span> comes out as <span style="border: black .75pt solid; padding-left: .2ex; padding-right: .2ex"> .(really? (yup</span>. </p>

		<p>This may not be the right place to ask, but why does Windows Phone (7.5) Internet Explorer handle RTL parentheses differently from the desktop one? For example הָרַחֲמָן הוּא יְבָרֵךְ אֶת (אָבִי מוֹרִי) בַּעַל הַבַּיִת הַזֶּה shows up as &nbsp;הָרַחֲמָן הוּא יְבָרֵךְ אֶת )אָבִי מוֹרִי( בַּעַל הַבַּיִת הַזֶּה on the phone (I hope this posts correctly)</p>

		<p>So in &quot;really? (yup).&quot; it sees &quot;really? (yup&quot; as the foreign blob that gets inserted verbatim, while the final punctuation &quot;).&quot; gets treated as the punctuation at the end of the RTL sentence and is reflected when put on the left edge. The order gets reversed, the right paren gets turned into a left paren, and the period stays a period so &quot;).&quot; turns into &quot;.(&quot;.</p>
<p>So when you concatenate &quot;.(&quot; with &quot;really? (yup&quot;, you get &quot;.(really? (yup&quot;.</p>

		<p>The strange behavior in &quot;really? (yup).&quot; is due to it being authored as a single lexical element but ending in the directionally neutral characters &quot;).&quot;. &nbsp;Authoring the lexical element to begin with an LRE and end with a PDF would cause this to render in a more sensible fashion, regardless of the directionality of the surrounding text.</p>

		<p>I can&#39;t figure out the brain-teaser. Am I correct in assuming it&#39;s supposed to be the visual representation of a sentence that would make sense as english if written in an entirely LTR way, and that the capital parts are the RTL bits?</p>

		<p>@John: Couldn&#39;t be any worse than the confusion over top-down and bottom-up bitmaps. And anyway, if you want &quot;daft&quot; as applied to writing, just google for boustrophedon. Reality beat you to it by several thousand years.</p>
<p>What I find *most* amazing is that someone was sufficiently confident that a BiDi algorithm was possible that they actually tried to invent one. To me, the problems (some of which are described here) are sufficiently apparent that I&#39;d have laughed the idea out of the shop before anyone got started.</p>

		<p>My browser doesn&#39;t believe that 2001:db8:85a3::8a2e:370:7334 can be wrapped, so that issue doesn&#39;t apply. If you force wrapping with word-wrap: break-word; then it will happily break it something like this:</p>
<p>db8:85a3::8a2e:370:73:2001</p>
<p>34</p>
<p>If you just put &lt;wbr&gt; adjacent to all the colons then you get this:</p>
<p>db8:85a3::8a2e:370:::2001</p>
<p>7334</p>

		<p>Ah! It&#39;s really hard to understand RTL when you&#39;re used to read LTR. I implemented some support of bidi in Swing text components in Apache Harmony. I must say I had lots of fun.</p>
<p>@Gabe and @Maurits are right about the reasons why the line is rendered this way.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
