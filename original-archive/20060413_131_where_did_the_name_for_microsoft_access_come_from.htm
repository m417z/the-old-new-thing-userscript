<p> They discovered that Microsoft had a long-forgotten terminal emulator product called Microsoft Access. "Access" sounded like an appropriate name for a database product, so they blew the dust off it and gave the name a new life. </p>

		<p>There&#8217;s a rumour that Excel was going to be combined with Access, but the project was abandoned because the combined product would be called &quot;Microsoft Excess&quot;.<br />
<br />Much the same reason why Dire Straits never hooked up with Chris Rhea.</p>

		<p>BTW, another naming conflict (albeit in Vista)&#8230;</p>
<p>WinInit.exe</p>
<p>In Vista it is part of the startup sequence.<br />

		<p>I always wondered about this one, since there was a computer game manufacturer called Access Software (makers of Links, the golf game). Sounds like an invitation to a lawsuit to me. I seem to recall Microsoft buying Access later on though, so I guess it&#8217;s not an issue any more.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know if this was a factor in the Access case, but it&#8217;s a lot less fuss legally (registering trademarked names etc) and probably speedier to use an old trademarked dusty name that your company still owns that applies to a long dead product. Rumor has it that my company chose its name (Unisys) for that reason.</p>

		<p>Speaking of Multiplan, I seem to recall that Excel was actually the result of a merger between Multiplan and Chart. Does anybody know why they came up with a new name?</p>

		<p>Have to agree with Phil Wilson, the name seems to have been just fortuitous that Microsoft already had the trademark for &quot;Microsoft Access.&quot; Got to say that the the program was so popular that after living on Word 4, Word 5, Word 6 (for DOS) that I can only recall looking at those Green Microsoft folders but can&#8217;t recall having ever used the program.</p>
<p>Gabe: If Excel had 1st released for DOS it may have made life as a Multiplan/Chart merge but 1st releasing as a Mac only (there was a MultiPlan/Chart for the Mac?) I think it fortuitously lost all the old baggage (and picked up some memory hungry ones)</p>
<p>Love these digging into the past articles.</p>

<p>You keep using that word. &nbsp;I do not think it means what you think it means.</p>

		<p>SamT: Multiplan and Chart were released in 1984 for the Mac; Excel 1.0 was released for Mac in 1985.</p>
<p>Check out <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://toastbucket.com/apple1984ad/p08.html" rel="nofollow">http://toastbucket.com/apple1984ad/p08.html</a> for an ad showing the two early pieces of software.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know for sure if Excel was based on the Multiplan codebase or if it was a complete rewrite, but the people who wrote it also worked on Multiplan, so it&#8217;s almost like saying that Windows 95 was the result of a merger between DOS and Windows.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
