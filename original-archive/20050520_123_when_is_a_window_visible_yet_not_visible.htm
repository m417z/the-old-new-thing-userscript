Today, a quick puzzler.
</p>
<p>
Consider the following code fragment:
</p>
<pre>
 ShowWindow(hwnd, SW_SHOWNORMAL);
 assert(IsWindowVisible(hwnd));
</pre>
<p>
We just showed the window, certainly it is visible, right?
Yet the assertion can fire (even in the absence of multi-threading).  Why?
</p>
<p>
Answer below - stop reading if you want to try to solve it yourself.
</p>
<p>
Take a look at
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/windows/windowreference/windowfunctions/iswindowvisible.asp">
the <code>IsWindowVisible</code> function</a>.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
If the specified window, its parent window, its parent's parent window,
and so forth, have the <code>WS_VISIBLE</code> style,
the return value is nonzero. Otherwise, the return value is zero. 
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The <code>WS_VISIBLE</code> style indicates that this window is
visible in its parent.  But the parent itself might not be visible,
in which case <code>IsWindowVisible</code> returns <code>FALSE</code>.

		<p>Yeah, I was trapped by this once. The design makes sense, but the function name is definitely misleading. And it&#8217;s so easy to use (you&#8217;d think) that you&#8217;ll never want to read its documentation.<br />

		<p>It&#8217;s not the name of the IsWindowVisible() function that&#8217;s misleading; if anything, it&#8217;s the name of the WS_VISIBLE style bit.</p>
<p>Maybe it should&#8217;ve been called WS_NOTEXPLICITLYHIDDEN, or something equally cumbersome. Then again, maybe not.</p>
<p>A small improvement to that would be to reverse the logic of the flag and call it WS_EXPLICITLYHIDDEN.</p>

		<p>WS_HIDE works.</p>
<p>Maybe IsWindowVisible should have two arguments &#8212; one a boolean controlling this behavior.  Everyone pays attention to the arguments.</p>

		<p>Calling it WS_HIDE would have the same problem as calling it WS_VISIBLE: Not having the WS_HIDE bit set might imply to some people that the window is visible, when it actually might be hidden due to its parent having WS_HIDE set.</p>
<p>Adding a second parameter to IsWindowVisible() is a much better idea. While we&#8217;re at it, we might as well add the ability to determine if a window is completely obscured by other windows, or offscreen, or visible on a specific monitor. Hey, sounds like a job for IsWindowVisibleEx().</p>

		<p>Alternative answer: When it&#8217;s offscreen, or overlapped by another window. Sure, it&#8217;s visible to according to the OS, but the user wouldn&#8217;t agree!</p>

		<p>Maybe a window&#8217;s DC&#8217;s clip rect will be empty if it&#8217;s completely obscured or offscreen?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
