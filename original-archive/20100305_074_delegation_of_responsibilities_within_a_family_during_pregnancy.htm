		<p>Wow &#8211; I&#8217;ve been speaking English all my life (nearly 50 years) and I&#8217;d never heard one of the expressions on the linked page: &nbsp;&quot;play gooseberry&quot;. &nbsp;Must be a regional thing.</p>

		<p>Carl: Are you British? The linked page is by a British English speaker (I&#8217;m American), so it contains several other idioms I was not a priori familiar with: &quot;in apple-pie order&quot;, &quot;be like chalk and cheese&quot;, &quot;like butter wouldn&#8217;t melt in your mouth&quot;, &quot;small beer&quot;, &nbsp;and &quot;rhubarb, rhubarb&quot;.</p>

		<p>British English here and those phrases are a mystery to me. I wonder where they sourced the information. I&#8217;ve noticed that quite often Americans (that is, Americans with access to the ability to be published) think they know what peculiarities we have in en-GB. Usually they don&#8217;t know at all.</p>

		<p>If I were a woman and pregnant, I would respond &quot;And I&#8217;m drinking for two, now!&quot;*</p>
<p>* Of course it would be water that I&#8217;d be drinking, not alcohol.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m in California. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve heard nearly all of those expressions (or seen in print) except for the gooseberry one. &nbsp;Maybe it&#8217;s from the South&#8230;? &nbsp;I might&#8217;ve guessed en-GB, but apparently that&#8217;s not the case!</p>

		<p>Hints the article wasn&#8217;t written by an American: &quot;favourite&quot;, &quot;come to the cinema with you&quot;, &quot;going on holiday to Jamaica&quot;. There are plenty of other pages on the site that more directly indicate that it&#8217;s written by somebody in the UK.</p>
<p>Of course, that doesn&#8217;t mean that the idioms are all British; I just assumed that since the site is in the UK and I&#8217;m American, that the idioms I&#8217;m unfamiliar with must be British.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve heard from multiple sources that for a group of actors (stage or movie), to create the impression of &quot;unintelligible background chatter &quot;, they just have to repeat &quot;rhubarb, rhubarb&quot; in a low voice. Supposedly, the German &quot;Rhabarber&quot; works as well &#8211; for German. Never tried it, but might work if they take care not to get in sync :)</p>

		<p>The &quot;gooseberry&quot; thing might be an old Welsh idiom &#8211; I&#8217;ve certainly heard it here plenty of times.</p>
<p>&quot;rhubarb rhubarb&quot; came into general knowledge from a film by Eric Sykes, called, funnily enough, &quot;rhubarb&quot;. In the film, the only words anybody speaks is &quot;rhubarb&quot;, and everybody&#8217;s last name is Rhubarb. Even the number plates (licence plates?) on the cars all say RHUBARB.</p>
<p>It was, if I understand correctly, a parody of old radio plays, where it was found that having a group of people repeat &quot;rhubarb rhubarb&quot; over and over, conveys quite effectively, the unintelligible sound of a crowd in the background.</p>
<p>I recognised all those saying on the web-page, but the meaning of some of them appears incorrect.</p>

		<p>Like chalk and cheese basically describes a pair of complete opposites &#8211; I hear it used most when it comes to people &quot;they are like chalk and cheese&quot;.</p>
<p>Only one I haven&#8217;t heard of is apple-pie order, but the rest I&#8217;ve heard said before &#8211; then again, my family is apparently full of Cockney phrases so that&#8217;s probably the reason.</p>

		<p>My dictionary says that &quot;gooseberry&quot; in this sense is British, and that matches my experience, I&#8217;ve never lived anywhere near Wales. Obviously your exposure to the term will vary depending on how often you&#8217;re put in such an awkward situation. The American equivalent appears to be a &quot;third wheel&quot;. But I think you can be a &quot;third wheel&quot; without the other two people being romantically involved, whereas this is not possible for a gooseberry.</p>

		<p>Gooseberry, from when I&#8217;ve heard it used, doesn&#8217;t require the other two people to be romantically involved either. It just seems to suggest &quot;the one in an uncomfortable situation&quot;</p>
<p>For example, my grandmother often used the term for when she was in company of someone who had a secret, which was mentioned publicly, in a kind of &quot;I didn&#8217;t know where to look&quot; sense.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
