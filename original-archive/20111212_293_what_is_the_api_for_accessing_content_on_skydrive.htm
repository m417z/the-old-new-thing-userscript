<p>The last time I mentioned programmatic access to SkyDrive was <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/07/02/10181646.aspx"> last June</a>, where I noted that the interface was given the confusing name Messenger Connect. At least now they renamed it to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windowslive/ff621314"> Live Connect</a>, which is slightly less confusing.</p>
<p> The SkyDrive folks have been pretty busy lately. A few days ago, <a href="http://www.25hoursaday.com/weblog/">Dare Obasanjo</a> <a href="http://windowsteamblog.com/windows_live/b/windowslive/archive/2011/12/07/skydrive-apis-for-docs-and-photos-now-ready-to-cloud-enable-apps-on-windows-8-windows-phone-and-more.aspx"> announced a new Live Connect SDK</a>, which means that you now have even more ways of accessing your SkyDrive content programmatically. (I like how the block diagram screen shot still has the red underline squiggles under the word <i>skydrive</i>.) Check it out at the <a href="http://dev.live.com/"> Live Connect Developer Center</a>. </p>
<p> You can <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/BUILD/BUILD2011/PLAT-134C"> watch the //build/ presentation online</a> if you want to watch somebody try to write code on stage. (I don't risk it myself. You may have noticed that none of my presentations involve on-stage typing!) </p>

<p>SkyNet API: Wait for hybrid human/terminator to join your resistance movement then ask it to break back in to SkyNet&#39;s main location and hook back in to the network. (Sadly, I learned this from watching the latest Terminator movie rehashing the SkyNet ineptly tries to kill John Connor plot.)</p>

		<p>It turns out that Obasanjo is not actually a deposed Nigerian ruler. He served as leader after a coup up until they created an American-style constitution, and many years later served out two elected terms as President. He apparently tried to get the constitution amended to enable more than two terms, but was unsuccessful.</p>
<p>Also I was disappointed to see that the Wikipedia article merely states that he has many children spread around Nigeria, America, and the UK, leaving out any mention of Dare.</p>

		<p>Sorry Raymond, I coudln&#39;t find your email or facebook and the suggestion box is closed, but you migh know this:</p>
<p>How can I join a T800 to my own Active Directory Domain if it was previously joined to skynet?</p>

		<p>@John</p>
<p>The T800 needs to be running Windows 10 Advanced Robotic Ultra Workgroup Ultimate, Release 2, Service Pack 17 in order to be joined to the Active Directory domain. &nbsp;If it was previously removed from a domain, you need to re-image it. &nbsp;Be careful because Service Pack 18 breaks it. &nbsp;Another alternative is to install Windows XP on the T800, but large portions of it&#39;s neural net won&#39;t work correctly, and any passing freedom fighter will be able to bypass it&#39;s firewall at will.</p>

<p>How long should you cook a 20-pound turkey (thawed) for best results?</p>

		<p>@DWalker: Good timing. If he answers, it will be right around Thanksgiving 2013, by which time your turkey is beyond rancid.</p>

		<p>@DWalker:</p>
<p>According to Cooks Illustrated, 4.25-4.5 hours total, at 425 for the first hour, then 325 for the remaining time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Rinse and dry the turkey. Remove the giblets and neck.</li>
<li>
<p>Put the turkey in a V-rack in a roasting pan, breast-down</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brush the exposed surfaces of the turkey with melted butter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Roast in a preheated 425F oven for 1 hour</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Pull the turkey out, turn the oven to 325F, and turn the turkey over so it&#39;s breast-side-down. Use two clean dishtowels to hold the turkey so you don&#39;t burn yourself.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Brush the newly exposed breast with melted butter</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Return to the oven and roast for 3.25-3.5 hours or until the deepest part of the thigh registers 165 on an instant-read thermometer.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the turkey from the oven, take it off the rack, and cover it with an aluminum foil tent. Let it rest for 30 minutes (while you make gravy with the drippings)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I did the above this thanksgiving and the bird was great. I omitted Cook&#39;s recommended brining step, but used a Butterball turkey, which is pre-brined.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
