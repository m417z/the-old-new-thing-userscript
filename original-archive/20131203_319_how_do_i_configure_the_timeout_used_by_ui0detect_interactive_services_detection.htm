<p>Windows Vista introduced <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb756986.aspx"> Session&nbsp;0 Isolation</a> which enforces the rule that services should not display UI. If a service tries to display UI, another service known as the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/patricka/archive/2010/04/27/what-is-interactive-services-detection-and-why-is-it-blinking-at-me.aspx"> <i>Interactive Services Detection</i> service</a> detects this situation and signals the user that a service wants to display UI and gives the user an opportunity to switch to the service desktop, respond to the UI, and then switch back. If the user ignores the service for about one minute, it switches back automatically, on the assumption that something went bad with the detection and the service is actually finished with its UI. (That way, the user doesn't get stuck staring at session&nbsp;0 forever.)</p>
<p> More than one customer wanted to know how to configure this one minute timeout. </p>
<p> The correct solution to the problem is not to configure Interactive Services Detection but rather to fix your service so it doesn't show UI in session&nbsp;0. </p>
<p> It's like saying, "When I mail a letter and get the postal code wrong, the letter reaches the destination eventually, but it takes much longer than a letter sent with the correct postal code. How can I get letters sent with the incorrect postal code to reach their destination faster?" </p>
<p> The answer is to <i>stop putting the incorrect postal code on your letters</i>. </p>
<p> In other words, stop <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/03/11/9976571.aspx"> throwing garbage on the sidewalk</a>. </p>

		<p>People should never have created services with UI in the first place. Have programmers and developers not heard of the word &quot;purpose&quot;?</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command: NT4 through XP had the checkbox &quot;Allow Service to Interact With Desktop&quot; when reconfiguring services. I used to set this on IIS so MsgBox would work in web code (for debugging).</p>

		<p>@Joshua That just means MS fell into the same trap as others who made services with UI.</p>
<p>Visual Studio probably provides proper debugging mechanisms for whatever you were doing (I&#39;ve never used IIS and I don&#39;t know what language you were dealing with).</p>

		<p>@The MAZZTer: Borland C++ 4.5&#39;s debugger didn&#39;t work too well in 32 bit mode.</p>
<p>Service with UI is the obvious solution to the problem of needing an elevated UI for specific tasks. The fact it&#39;s inherently dangerous just wasn&#39;t well understood back in the day.</p>

		<p>@Fleet Command: With introduction of .NET, modifying existing application to run as service has never been as easy. My previous company also have loads of programs that originally written as winform program that later moved on to run as service when they&#39;re &quot;repurposed&quot; to be running on servers.</p>
<p>The negative side is most people do their porting just &quot;good enough to run as service&quot;, but neglected to convert all the message popups from messagebox/dialogs to log files / eventviewer logs.</p>

		<p>What if I&#39;m using an old 3rd party service that I didn&#39;t write that occasionally does this to me? Perhaps I&#39;ve pleaded with the company to fix it but aren&#39;t getting anywhere. I can see that in that situation I&#39;d want to be able to change the timeout, to try to make my machine usable until such time as I can get the vendor to fix the problem.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of setting up an archive server for certain ultrasound machines. Part of install involved switching to session 0 when the reminder popped up, logging in to remote desktop that appeared there (while saving credentials &#8211; this was important), then switching back to regular desktop and disabling Interactive services detection, so it would stop bugging whoever was using the server.</p>

		<p>Why would the user stare at session 0 forever? I&#39;m sure I remember seeing UI to return from session 0 too.</p>

		<p>The whole &quot;interactive programs in session 0&quot; is a tricky business. If I want to run Selenium (a browser automation program) as a service it&#39;s going to end up doing so in session 0 (bear in mind it needs to be able to scrape the screen if the user requests a screenshot). Normally it&#39;s no problem that everything is hidden but there are times when its useful to be able to to see what&#39;s going on and I click the UI0Detect prompt only to have my Remote Desktop Connection close a little while later. Now I know why the Remote Desktop connection was spontaneously closing &#8211; I was staring into session 0 for too long. Another snag seems to be that Internet Explorer can no longer write its cache directory when running in session 0 so its not an easy business&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
