<p>
At a team meeting, I was introduced to yet
another acronym: <i>ROB</i>.
This is spelled out rather than pronounced as a word.
(So maybe it's not really an acronym?
Whatever.)
</p>
<p>
It was never actually stated in the meeting,
presumably because the underlying assumption from
the speaker was that everybody already was familiar
with the term,&sup1;
but the letters ROB stand for
<i>Rhythm of business</i>.
(Sometimes spelled <i>RoB</i>.)
</p>
<p>
As employed in the meeting, the
<i>rhythm of business</i> referred to the
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110308-00/?p=11273">
cadence</a>
of various meetings.
For example,
"Every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday from 9am to 10am
is a staff meeting.
Every Tuesday from 2pm to 5pm we have
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20170207-00/?p=95385">
placemat reviews</a>."
And so on.
</p>
<p>
The calendar showing the weekly schedule is known as the
<i>ROB Calendar</i>.
</p>
<p>
One item that appeared in the ROB Calendar
was called <i>Office Hours</i>.
This is a block of time reserved on the schedule where
you can stop by to discuss whatever is on your mind.
The team leaders promise to be in their offices during
their Office Hours and will not schedule a meeting during this time.
</p>
<p>
Many teams also have their own Office Hours.
This benefits both the team and the people who are looking for help:
</p>
<ol>
<li>For people outside the team,
    it's a time when you know that you can come by and get help.
    This removes the hassle of finding somebody
    on the team and then finding time on their schedule.
</li>
<li>For people inside the team,
    it focuses all the distractions into a specific
    block of time.
    This means that instead of people randomly interrupting
    you,
    people interrupt you during a prearranged period of time.
</li>
</ol>
<p>
Searching through Microsoft internal documents,
I found some uses of ROB on its own,
but I couldn't figure out what it meant.
In finance circles,
there were pages simply titled ROB which contained
a bunch of charts showing how well things were going
compared to the budget and compared to how they went last year.
Not sure what that's about.
Maybe someone out there can fill me in.
</p>
<p>
&sup1;
Note that this doesn't mean that everybody in the
audience was in fact familiar with the term.
The speaker merely assumed that they were.</p>

		<p>I always thought that acronyms could be spoken or spelt out&#8230; people seem to say SEEQUL or S.Q.L&#8230;. (cue the flames!!! :)</p>

		<p>An acronym is an initialism that is pronounced as a word. Classic examples are RADAR, SCUBA, and LASER, all of which are no longer spelled out &#8211; heck, they are rarely spelled in all-caps now. You see radar, scuba, and laser. There are even people who are not aware that these were all acronyms.</p>
<p>I pronounce SATA as a word (usually as &#8220;Sah-tah&#8221;). </p>
<p>I have heard that one way to tell where someone is from is how they pronounce CICS &#8211; if they spell is out, they are from the US; if they say &#8220;kicks&#8221;, then they are from the UK or Australia :-)</p>
<p>Do you spell out RAM? Or do you say &#8220;ram&#8221; (like a male sheep)? Do you refer to &#8220;Buy-Oss&#8221; or do you spell out BIOS? </p>
<p>I&#8217;d be inclined to spell out uncommon initialisms, if only to avoid confusion (&#8220;rob&#8221; could be confusing if Robert attended the meeting, or if you were demanding money!).</p>

		<p>I use whatever has the fewest syllables; thus, SQL = sequel, and RAM = ram, and SCSI = scuzzy.  As for &#8220;rhythm of business&#8221;, were I forced to use that dreadful phrase, I&#8217;d break with my guideline and go with &#8220;are ohh bee&#8221;, because I work with several guys named Rob&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m in favor of spelling the word out.</p>
<p>Yesterday, when I talk with my colleagues at lunch and hear they talking about &#8220;sa-ta&#8221;, I paused for a moment and then realized they&#8217;re talking about SATA.</p>
<p>Talking about this reminds me that Michael Kaplan once mentioned his dialog with his friend in airport regarding &#8220;BOM&#8221;.<br />

		<p>These are obscure Microspeak aren&#8217;t half bad. They&#8217;re interesting for me, especially because of my linguistics minor. But I am more curious about the history of those widespread Microspeak. For example, how Microsoft came to call the volume without the bootloader &#8220;boot volume&#8221; and why it is referring to the volume without systemroot &#8220;system volume&#8221;. Or how on earth did Microsoft ditch &#8220;i386&#8221; for the inaccurate &#8220;x86&#8221;? Why did it never adopt the official &#8220;IA-32&#8221; term? And how it came to the wrong conclusion that x64 is not x86? (In reality, the first x64 CPU only had four additional instructions over its 32-bit predecessor.)</p>

		<p>Btw, &#8220;x64&#8221; is wrong in this sense either. it&#8217;s &#8220;x86-64&#8221; and the Microsoft&#8217;s choice to name this is &#8220;amd64&#8221;.</p>
<p>I think understand the reason for Microsoft to not use &#8220;i386&#8221; because I have the confusion when choosing the right package from RPMfind, when some of the distro packaged their software using i586 and the others using i386. That&#8217;s confusing to me.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
