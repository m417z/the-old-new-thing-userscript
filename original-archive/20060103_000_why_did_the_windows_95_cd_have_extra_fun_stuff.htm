		<p>I liked Hover!.  That and Pitfall! The Mayan Adventure were the two &quot;adventure&quot; games I played most when we got our first &quot;real&quot; computer.  Pentium 75, whopping 16 MB of RAM, and 16.7 million color display.  We had it good then. (-:</p>
<p>Glad to see you back, Raymond.</p>

		<p>Man, I also thought Hover was great. And I think Pitfall must have come with the Aptiva or something, because I played hours of that.</p>

		<p>I rather liked Hover, myself. Any chance of opening up the specs for the map and music files?</p>

		<p>I remember playing hover while there was nothing else installed on my new Win95 PC. Got bored of it pretty quickly! :)</p>

		<p>I remember buying a faster CD-ROM drive just so I could stream the videos off the CD in realtime.</p>
<p>Man, I am a geek.</p>
<p>Microsoft needs to do more partnering like that&#8211; I loved when they joined up with Rolling Stones for &quot;Start Me Up&quot;. In Vista, there should be some WMV-HD music videos once more, or some short films. Mmm.</p>

		<p>Of course, all that content make the 35MB Win95 install into a 270MB CD. And while it does nothing bad in the CD (it&#8217;s not like they&#8217;d make smaller-size CDs), I saw technicians that, wanting to ensure their customers can re-install, copy the entire CD to the computer, videos and all. 270MB used to be a lot&#8230;</p>

		<p>The thing I actually remember thinking at the time is, how many copies does a typical music video sell?  Does the fact that the Buddy Holly video was on the Win95 CD mean it &quot;sold&quot; an astronomical number?</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t think the odd thing was that Win95 had all these cool multimedia goodies (it&#8217;s well known how much money MS dumped into W95 marketing), but that Win98 utterly had nothing &#8211; trailer videos of terrible videogames does not count.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
