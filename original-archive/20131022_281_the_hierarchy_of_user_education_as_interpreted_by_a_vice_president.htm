<p>One of my colleagues told me a story from his days on the Windows team. He had to give a presentation to his vice president on his feature, and he prepared his presentation and demo obsessively to make sure it went smoothly.</p>
<p> At the meeting, there were three presentations on the schedule, all of them with features targeting IT professionals. The first presenter got up and walked through their feature. Upon reaching a particular tricky part of the feature, the vice president asked, "How are customers going to know how to set up those parameters?" </p>
<p> The presenter explained, "We'll have a whitepaper explaining how to set them up." </p>
<p> The vice president growled, "I <span title="!#$*">&#9729;&#9734;&#9877;&#9732;</span> hate whitepapers." </p>
<p> The second presenter's feature was also rather complicated, and the vice president asked the same question. "How are customers supposed to know how to set this up?" </p>
<p> The second presenter explained, "We'll use a wizard to step them through it." </p>
<p> The vice president snarled, "If there's anything I hate more than <span title="!#$*">&#9729;&#9734;&#9877;&#9732;</span> whitepapers, it's <span title="!#$*">&#9729;&#9734;&#9877;&#9732;</span> wizards." </p>
<p> All through this, my colleague was waiting for his turn to present, and one of his nervous habits is to re-run the demo over and over while waiting, making sure it runs smoothly each time. His particular demo required a good amount of effort to reset after each go-round, and just as luck would have it, he was called to present while he was in the middle of resetting his demo. He rushed through the reset as he got up to do his presentation. </p>
<p> My colleague ran through his presentation, but the demo fell apart because he didn't reset his scenario properly. In fact, he got the system into a bad state, because he had been messing with various settings not exposed to users directly. The vice president asked, "How are customers supposed to recover when they get into this state?" </p>
<p> Having watched the first two presentations, my colleague had a good handle on the vice president's mood. He replied, "They're <span title="!#$*">&#9729;&#9734;&#9877;&#9732;</span>ed." </p>

		<p>The default value for a configuration value is just a really complicated CONST value across the entire application.</p>
<p>Off-by-default === Off for 99.99% of users</p>

		<p>But why not make the reset and recovery a part of the presentation? It would be original.</p>

		<p>That&#39;s why default values should be selected such as they work for 99.99% of users. I spend much time, maybe too much, analyzing user scenarios to select default values in my applications (as a small firm, we don&#39;t have budget for formal usability testing, so informally polling coworkers and best guesses must make for it).</p>

		<p>I am afraid to ask what kind of feature it was and whether it still exists/widely used. Thank goodness Raymond doesn&#39;t share such sensitive information, so I can sleep relatively well.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s unfortunate the VP&#39;s response wasn&#39;t recorded. I&#39;d like to think it was something along the lines of &quot;OK, I can live with that&quot;.</p>

		<p>Anon: but the VP wants to see you&#39;ve got a handle on the application.</p>
<p>Absolutely agree on default values, whenever it is possible to run with them without mandatory user input.</p>

		<p>@Boris: VPs don&#39;t really care if you have a handle on the application or not &#8211; all they want to see is &#39;ooh, shiny&#39; and &#39;how many of these can we sell?&#39;.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of my first BillG review in Office. &nbsp; I was new to the group, and was allowed to sit in with the 5 teams in a small-ish conference room. &nbsp;My manager did the presentation, and carefully took notes of Bill&#39;s questions and feedback. &nbsp;At one point, he even had to answer a question with &quot;I don&#39;t know, but we&#39;ll get back to you tomorrow or sooner if you need it.&quot; &nbsp; The presentation then moved to the next team &#8211; their presenter was in the chair next to me. At one point Bill had to forcefully interrupt the guy (he wasn&#39;t taking hints) to ask a question, to which the presenter replied: &quot;Mmmm, I don&#39;t know but that&#39;s not important&quot; and then kept going. &nbsp; The presenter didn&#39;t notice the look of shock of everyone else in the room, and my manager quietly reached over and pulled my rolling chair closer to him and away from the presenter&#8230; &nbsp; </p>
<p>Bill had some seriously creative ☁☆⚕☄ when he was pissed. &nbsp; And I vowed never to be that guy on the other end&#8230; &nbsp; &nbsp; </p>

		<p>Raymond there seems to be something wrong with your blog software. Random words are appearing as weird symbols. Worst of all its happening in the sentence that contains your colleges reply. I&#39;ve tried this in multiple browser and its the same result. Now i&#39;ll never know how customers are supposed to recover when they get into that state?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
