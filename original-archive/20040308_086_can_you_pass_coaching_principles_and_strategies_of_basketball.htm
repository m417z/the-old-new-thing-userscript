<p>  I want to know how you can possibly grade a multiple choice question  that asks you to express an <strong>opinion</strong> (question 20).  An essay question I can see; you get graded on how well you justify  your opinion. But a multiple choice question?  </p>
<p>  "Wrong. That's not your opinion."  </p>

		<p>You&#8217;d think they&#8217;d have some standards at Georgia. At least asking what a zone defense is, or to diagram the pick and roll.</p>

		<p>Since the examiner is one of the answers, I suspect this question could be re-worded as &quot;Do you want to pass this course?&quot; Yes / No :-)</p>
<p>I found questions 5, 6 and 8 more amusing. I&#8217;m English and don&#8217;t know much about basketball but I&#8217;d hope I could guess these.<br />
<br />This is where I find out there are only 3 &quot;quarters&quot; in a high school game, isn&#8217;t it? :-D</p>

		<p>You are forgetting an important aspect of the coach / player relationship.  As a player, you don&#8217;t have an opinion when it comes to basketball.  What the coach says, goes.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve seen UNC or Kansas playing this year, a common theme is &quot;these teams are going to be great once they buy into [insert new coach here]&#8217;s system.&quot;<br /></p>

		<p>It appears as if the original final exam may have been in open-answer format and that ESPN may have Multiple Choice-ified it for ease in online scoring.  This would make question 20 a valid question, albeit still one hard to get wrong.</p>

		<p>The Associated Press printed it in multiple choice format, too, so I&#8217;m inclined to believe it was multiple choice originally.</p>

		<p>The dumbest part is that there&#8217;s no reason for the test to be so simple.  In order to play at that level, you have to understand the game pretty well.  I bet those kids could give intelligent answers to questions like &quot;when do you play a 2-1-2 zone defense vs. a 2-3 zone?&quot;  For a variety of reasons, college athletes sometimes have trouble with their academics, but basketball is one thing they do know!  It&#8217;s insulting to the players that the test was so easy.  Not to mention that it&#8217;ll get him in a heap of trouble.</p>

		<p>Actually, the saddest thing is it wasn&#8217;t a joke.  More sadly, a majority of people missed the &quot;field of 65&quot; question on espn.</p>
<p>I bet some of them even copied.</p>

		<p>Mike, the &quot;worst&quot; two teams out of 65 play each other prior to the tournament to decide who gets sacrificed vs the #1 team in the nation.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a pretty good rundown: <a target="_new" href="http://espn.go.com/ncb/s/bracketology/0205.html" rel="nofollow">http://espn.go.com/ncb/s/bracketology/0205.html</a></p>

		<p>I already failed because the URL being submitted with answers includes the pseudo-English word &quot;incomming&quot; instead of &quot;incoming&quot;.</p>
<p>In another thread I mentioned ongoing use of .ini files.  In fact the key names are usually specified by the customer, and the key names often include misspelled English words.  (Not abbreviations, just plain misspellings.)  Of course in such cases I have to take care not to accidentally spell a word correctly.  Let there be no doubt that backwards compatibility with existing specifications is MANDATORY.</p>

		<p>The 65th team was added just a few years ago, IIRC.  I don&#8217;t remember the rationale for the expansion.</p>

		<p>The rationale is obvious: To increase viewership. The same reason baseball expanded its playoffs from 4 teams to 8.</p>

		<p>The rationale was that a new conference was added and every conference&#8217;s champion gets an automatic bid to the tournament.  Rather than reduce the number of at-large bids, they increased the tournament field by 1.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
