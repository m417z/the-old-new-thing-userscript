<p> An opening line like that pretty much demands bad acting. You can tell that this dialogue was designed by a committee. Nobody actually talks like this. </p>
<p> Well, that's perhaps too much of a blanket statement. Maybe people talk like this at the training company that produced the video. </p>

		<p>I think it is the same guys who make these super-moral children shows. For example, try watching &quot;Mickey Mouse Clubhouse&quot; on the Disney Channel&#8230; Could it be the same guy that does the job here?</p>
<p>PS: Is this training video supposed to do something with your &quot;social skills of a thermonuclear device&quot;? :P</p>

		<p>That sounds surprisingly accurate for a training video (I&#8217;m a trainer).</p>
<p>People often attempt to sound smart with creative phrases when they know they&#8217;re about to ask a stupid question.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ll ask that kind of question, but never in such a long-winded way.</p>
<p>&quot;I&#8217;m trying to do X, but keep having trouble. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve already determined Y and Z, but when I combine them I get W. &nbsp;Would you know any gotchas that I might be running into?&quot;</p>

		<p>If they tried to make it more realistic for the time the film was made, it&#8217;d end up sounding something like &quot;Hey funk daddy, this X is really cutting my groove. Maybe you can open my mind a bit&quot;, which honestly sounds like they&#8217;re propositioning each other.</p>

		<p>How old is the video? Most training videos I&#8217;ve seen are difficult to reasonably evaluate, simply because they date from the 60s/70s/80s.</p>
<p>Generally I&#8217;m too busy focused on the hair and clothes to notice the content.</p>
<p>But you&#8217;re right &#8211; it can&#8217;t *all* be attributable to design by committee. I suspect there is a positive feedback loop in the training video industry where what constitutes a &quot;good&quot; training video is heavily biased by what has come before. This is even more prevalent in company specific material, where real expertise is lacking, and the only guidelines are the fuzzy impressions that people have gathered from other videos that they have seen.</p>
<p>You&#8217;re just witnessing the mature, highly developed product of that feedback loop.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s time for a redesign from first principles</p>

<p>&quot;I still can&#8217;t get your broken code to work. &nbsp;Here is the code I wrote that uses your piece of ****. &nbsp;Send me an email when you fix your code.&quot;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve seen these videos at MS. &nbsp;They&#8217;re all new, I doubt a single one predates the millenium. &nbsp;You can tell, because they frequently make passing references to recent events (compliance issues in the US/EU, corporate policy developed in the last six months, etc.). &nbsp;Can&#8217;t excuse this junk by assuming it&#8217;s from the distant past. &nbsp;Of course, the trick is to set the video to Fast mode. &nbsp;It&#8217;s still boring drivel, but at least the actors sound like hamsters on speed.</p>

		<p>Nitpicker: &lt;i&gt;You already know this, bad dialog != bad acting.&lt;/i&gt;</p>
<p>No, but bad dialog makes good acting substantially harder than it is with good dialog.</p>
<p>&lt;i&gt;Those who can do were taught by someone who can train.&lt;/i&gt;</p>
<p>My experience is that most of &quot;those who can&quot; taught themselves. &nbsp;Training is a shortcut that generally leads to incomplete knowledge, which often becomes problematic later.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
