<p> Oops, the Portland people forgot to edit the ad copy. It still says "A hilarious <i>evening</i> with Jamie Heyneman and Adam Savage" even though the show is in the afternoon. </p>

		<p>I bet Jamie and Adam have some interesting stories.</p>
<p>The kids are to pull in the young demographic. I think they enhance the show (especially Kari Byron).</p>

		<p>Sure, they jumped the shark by adding the build team &#8212; who have been there for the last 90 of 115 episodes. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>I went to the show in Columbus, OH a couple of years back. It was worth the money, they had a lot of inside information about the show and they ran a few &#8220;uncensored&#8221; Mythbusters clips. If you&#8217;re a big fan of the show then its great.</p>
<p>The down-side was the Q&amp;A part where for every good audience question you got three losers trying to ask Jamie and Adam for a job (&#8220;I don&#8217;t have any skills, but I&#8217;ll do anything to work on the show..&#8221;). Although it was funny watching Jamie and Adam nicely refuse.</p>

		<p>Maybe the Portland copy wasn&#8217;t a mistake. &nbsp;Maybe it&#8217;s a way to weasel out if the show doesn&#8217;t live up to expectations: &quot;We said it was a hilarious evening, nothing about afternoons&quot;.</p>

		<p>Cool. &nbsp;There was an internet rumor that they weren&#8217;t on speaking terms and Adam was going to leave Mythbusters for Smash Lab. &nbsp;After I saw this I went back to wikipedia, and sure enough all references to the feud are gone.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the difference between geeks and the rest of TV land. We want to see things work or blow up; others want sexual tension.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why I gave up watching Monster Garage. Great ideas, not enough technicalities.</p>

		<p>The build team would probably be a lot more interesting if they weren&#8217;t given boring myths to work with. I guess it&#8217;s nice that they tackle the less spectacular urban legends, but still.</p>
<p>I do appreciate that they&#8217;ve worked in more science content into the show, with a little warning label notifying you that there is science content.</p>

		<p>What annoys me about the TV show is that they quite often spend a whole episode busting a myth that anyone with high-school physics, a calculator and a piece of paper can &#8216;bust&#8217; or confirm in 2 minutes. Sometimes they myths are so obvious they don&#8217;t need calculation at all.</p>
<p>The more obscure myths are cool though.</p>

		<p>Aaargh: If people was that smart it wouldn&#8217;t have been a myth in the first place and Mythbusters are probably smart enough to know a myth is gibberish. But that the whole point of the show: some people refuse to believe anything unless you prove itshow it (i know some of those my self), so its really necessary (though I fear the most stupid refuse to believe even after Mythbusters).</p>

		<p>&gt; They then jumped the shark by adding &quot;the young guard&quot; kids.</p>
<p>&quot;The Kids?&quot; Kari&#8217;s 33 and Tory and Grant are 37. In fact (according to Wikipedia RMV*) Adam is only 3 years older than Tory. Jamie at 51, is 11 years older than Adam.</p>
<p>Did you notice the episodes where Adam talked *really* stupendously fast. Quite reminiscent of someone on some sort of powdered substance. He seems to have reverted to his usual self the last season or two.</p>
<p>* Reality May Vary</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
