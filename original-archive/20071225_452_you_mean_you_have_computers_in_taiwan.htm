<p>The wife of one of my relatives grew up in Taiwan and attended college in the United States. When she went home to Taiwan for the holidays, she would tell her classmates, "If you need to get in touch while I'm away, you can send me email."</p>
<p> One of them asked her, "You mean, you have computers in Taiwan?" </p>
<p> (Hint: It's the home of <a href="http://www.acer.com/">the world's third largest PC manufacturer</a> behind Dell and HP.) </p>
<p> One of her friends grew up in Japan. When she moved to the United States at around age twelve and was introduced to her new school, her classmates were excited to hear about what it's like living in Japan. One of them asked her, "Do you have <a href="http://tvinjapan.com/"> television in Japan</a>?" </p>
<p> When I told this story, one of my colleagues added his own version: "When I came to the USA from England, an 11-year-old asked me if <a href="http://www.electricity.org.uk/"> we had electricity there</a>." </p>

		<p>My father when traveling on business to London in 1982 was attempting to tell about Mt. St. Helens erupting (we live ~80 miles from it). &nbsp; Nobody seemed that interested. &nbsp;He realized they thought this sort of thing happened all the time in &#8216;the west&#8217;.</p>

<p>I consider these things &quot;mind jerks&quot; &#8211; suddenly challenging something one never really thought about. I give people the benefit of doubt that once they would spend some time thinking about it, most of these lapses would not happen.</p>
<p>travelling south america a lot, the typical &quot;no thought prejudice&quot; is: all covered by jungle, filled with snakes, spiders, bloodthirsty dictators and legions of pickpockets and daylight muggers living in huts.

		<p>The first time I visited the US (coming from Belgium. Not UK! see below why I insist), I spent a few days with some people I met in Wyoming.</p>
<p>The first night, before the dinner, the woman told us &quot;Sorry, do you know what pizza is?&quot;. Then during the conversation, her husband asked us if it wasn&#8217;t too difficult to drive on the right.</p>

		<p>As Italian a few years we got asked if there were color films in Italy (so these friends didn&#8217;t have to bring them from US during their trip) and if we had gasoline cars.</p>
<p>We replied that we didn&#8217;t have film cameras yet and the most popular rides were still horse chariots.</p>
<p>Go figure. :)</p>

		<p>perhaps do not blame solely on the ill-informed and uneducated &quot;school kids&quot; &#8211; the relevant educational authorities in their respective counties/school districts should consider teaching world history, geography, etc etc, this would widen their horizon/perspectives on &#8216;truly world&#8217; things, ot merely US-centric. tq</p>

		<p>I would have thought a better link for Electricity in England might have been:</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gilbert" target="_new" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Gilbert</a></p>
<p>I find that usually, the misconception about England is that it is, in fact, a small village located in Western Europeland.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, you&#8217;re from England? &nbsp;I used to work with a guy from England &#8211; called John Brown, do you know him?&#8221;</p>

		<p>When I was about 14 I visited the states and one of the kids at the hotel asked me if we had phones and televisions in Australia (this was 16 years ago).</p>
<p>When I moved to Redmond 7 years ago the relocation people explained how to use an ATM card to me, and seemed surprised that I did not require instruction in this.</p>
<p>The only thing that I can think of that created these opinions about Australia is Crocodile Dundee. :)</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m from India and I&#8217;ve heard this story about someone from Bangalore who visited the US on a project for his company&#8217;s client. He was asked if they rode elephants to work in India. He replied that they didn&#8217;t because there wasn&#8217;t enough parking space in the parking lots for elephants.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know if that was an innocent question, but it&#8217;s about time some people grew up real quick.</p>

		<p>Once I tried to buy some CD-Rs off eBay (they are badly overpriced here), and saw a nice offer from some Italian seller who proclaimed shipping to the whole EU but the cost had to be asked.</p>
<p>OK, no problem, but the reply was &quot;sorry but I don&#8217;t know any country called Latvia&quot;</p>

		<p>&quot;Do you mean you have computers and high speed internet in USA???&quot;</p>
<p>Well, yes, we do, but they are extremely primitive. &nbsp;Our computers are locked down before delivery because Americans are forbidden by law operate fully functional machinery, and the local warlords still control all the cable and DSL connections to our tenement hovels.</p>
<p>Fortunately the many RTPC (Root Technical Peace Corps) volunteers from Taiwan are helping to improve things here, although progress is greatly hindered by U.S. Congress ignorance and superstition.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>This is due to the fact that in Italy the name &quot;Latvia&quot; is never used, we call your country Lettonia. Chances are 99% of Italians never heard of the Latvia name.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the words Latvia and Lettonia are different enough that you don&#8217;t easily associate them.</p>
<p>I too had to check wikipedia because I was 90% sure it was Lettonia, but I doubted it might be Lituania.</p>
<p>You see</p>
<p>LAT v &nbsp; IA</p>
<p>LET ton IA</p>
<p>LIT uan IA</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not easy to pick the right one.</p>

		<p>I just got back from living in Germany for a few years. &nbsp;Two questions I got were whether there was snow in Germany and whether there was Christmas.</p>

		<p>You mean, you have a democratic government in the US?</p>
<p>Well, the east germans (the people, not the government) in fact had a little problem deciding whether the stuff they say in western TV was for real or just good propaganda. The few who could travel there were either loyal party members or not allowed to return.</p>

		<p>&quot;we went to Europe, and it was actually quite civilized&quot;</p>
<p>You hear this sort of comment from people who visit the US as well. &nbsp;Probably because TV makes it clear that everyone is running around trying to shoot each other all of the time, that there is no natural/healthy food to be found, and that everyone is incredibly ignorant.</p>
<p>Yet, overheard in Waitomo Caves* one day, an American accent, very loud: &quot;Glow-worms? &nbsp;I don&#8217;t see no glow-worms! &nbsp;And what are all those funny little lights anyhoo?&quot;</p>

<p>Oh, and here in Canberra we DO have kangaroos in the city. &nbsp;In one of my previous appointments they sat in the fields outside my office and I had to dodge them as I walked to the bus stop after work.</p>

		<p>Interestingly, this attitude is 95% american. I&#8217;ve never heard Europeans asking &quot;Do you have credit cards in Latvia?&quot;</p>
<p>I guess europeans, even if they don&#8217;t know anything, are afraid to seem stupid. So they won&#8217;t expose themselves this way.</p>

		<p>Yuri, this isn&#8217;t totally American. A teacher once asked the daughter of a friend of mine &#8211; &quot;can you buy bananas in Moscow?&quot; This was at a school in Oslo, and one would think that Moscow isn&#8217;t that &nbsp;far away.</p>

		<p>&quot;Interestingly, this attitude is 95% american.&quot;</p>
<p>Interestingly, bigoted arrogance is a trait of 95% of europeans. &nbsp;The same made-up statistic applies to the trait of making a generalization based on &quot;well I&#8217;ve never heard that happening, so it must never happen!&quot;</p>

		<p>When I was working in Latin America, people would ask me all the time how many guns I had, or how many cars I had. &nbsp;&quot;US Americans&quot; are expected to be rich and/or violent. &nbsp;And stupid, because they never quite understood that I could speak Spanish fluently.</p>
<p>The best part was when drunk old men sitting out on the curb refused to talk to me because they thought that I was from the CIA.</p>
<p>Ignorance is not reserved for any one populace. &nbsp;Tourists and popular media tend to set the stereotypes for any one nation. &nbsp;It&#8217;s the only part of the culture that gets exported to the world, really. If you really want to look and be smart, don&#8217;t ask Yes/No questions. &nbsp;They&#8217;re very misleading. &nbsp;Instead, give people a chance to explain themselves and their home in their own words.</p>

		<p>Always fun convincing Americans that we all live in igloos and have dog sled teams up here in Canada.</p>
<p>Disturbing how often it works too.</p>
<p>Of course, if you&#8217;ve ever watched &quot;talking to americans&quot; by Rick Mercer, you find out that it isn&#8217;t so much a matter of global ignorance, as ignorance in general as you can trick americans about themselves just as often.</p>

		<p>Wladimir, I think it&#8217;s perfectly reasonable to wonder if it&#8217;s possible to buy bananas in Moscow. If somebody asked &quot;can you buy fruit in Moscow?&quot;, that would be a ridiculous question, but bananas are not at all obvious (as they might be in Quito, perhaps).</p>
<p>For one thing, the question probably wasn&#8217;t meant to be &quot;is it at all possible to purchase bananas while in Moscow&quot;, but more like &quot;are bananas relatively easy to find in stores in Moscow&quot;. If bananas are not popular in Russian culture, it&#8217;s unlikely that stores would stock them, and they would not be easy to find.</p>
<p>A similar question might be &quot;do you have huge supermarkets in Moscow?&quot; (Where &#8216;huge&#8217; would be on the order of 1ha.) Afterall, Manhattan (New York City) doesn&#8217;t have them even though they&#8217;re popular all over the world.</p>
<p>I was once derided for asking a Chinese friend if they have pumpkins in China. Considering that pumpkins primarily come from the Americas and are mostly used in pies and on Halloween, both largely originating in Western culture, it made perfect sense to ask if they have pumpkins.</p>

<p>While at school in University of New Mexico, Albuquerque, NM, a friend and I took a trip to LA and were asked, &quot;What currency do they use in New Mexico?&quot; While my friend tried to tell this person that we used the New Peso in New Mexico, I couldn&#8217;t help it and burst out laughing, spoiling the effect of my friend&#8217;s reply.</p>

		<p>When I lived in North Carolina, one of my acquaintances asked if we have swimming pools in New Mexico. &nbsp;(For foreign readers and those who didn&#8217;t learn much in our public schools, New Mexico is one of the fifty states in the United States.)</p>
<p>We replied that the stagecoach brings water through our town once a week. &nbsp;(Hint: &nbsp;Our &quot;town&quot; has 100,000 residents now.)</p>
<p>I also went to a U.S. Post Office to mail a package from North Carolina to New Mexico, and the counter-person pulled out a foreign postage rate book to look up the postage. &nbsp;(This was many years ago, before the U.S. Postal Service counters were as computerized as they are now.)</p>
<p>We informed the U.S. Postal Service counter-person that New Mexico is not a foreign country.</p>

		<p>I was forced to stop in the USA (New-York) a few months ago. I got a meal voucher. I asked for a grapefruit juice with the classic Hamburger (My first time there).</p>
<p>The waiter kindly ask me if I know what a grapefruit juice is ? I said something like &quot;yes I know&quot;. He very kindly make clear that this is not a grape juice. I feel the need to mention that I know that one is sour and the other sweet..</p>
<p>The question make me feel uncomfortable, even if after all it was a kind question. Funny how sensitive we can be on this topic.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
