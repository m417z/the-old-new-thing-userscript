I really like the wallpaper slide show feature,
especially the one that rotates through the top-rated
pictures in my photo library.
My photo library includes photos taken by other members of my family,
and sometimes I'll get a wallpaper that I want to learn more about.
It'd be great if there were some way to say "Hey, tell me more about
this wallpaper."

Today's Little Program
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/08/04/9856634.aspx">
snaps together some blocks</a>.
</p>
<ul>
<li>It registers a command on the desktop background.
<li>The command looks at the current wallpaper image.
<li>And then shows you some information about it in the
    form of a property sheet.
</ul>
<p>
(My colleague actually preferred that the image be opened in
<a HREF="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-US/windows-live/photo-gallery">
Photo Gallery</a>,
but I'll just show the properties because not every has
Photo Gallery installed,
and the purpose of the exercise is to show how to snap blocks together,
not to argue about which color blocks to use.)

Now we get to hook this up to the context menu for the desktop.
</p>
<pre>
[HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\DesktopBackground\shell\Wallpaper properties\command]
@="WallpaperProperties.exe"
</pre>
<p>
Now you can right-click on the desktop background and
select <i>Wallpaper properties</i>, and it will show you
the properties of the wallpaper.
You are of course welcome to do something else,
like load the wallpaper into your favorite image viewer.

<p>
Note that I cheated a bunch here.
In addition to pretty much ignoring all error checking
(because this is a Little Program),
I also use the current mouse position instead of
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/09/23/233376.aspx">
using the point at which the context menu was invoked</a>.</p>

		<p>I mean, as there are advice to stop using DDE( <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2007/02/26/1763683.aspx" rel="nofollow" target="_new">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/1763683.aspx</a> ), maybe there is other way to invoke the currently registered property sheets handler?</p>
<p>Just want to check if there are other ways.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
