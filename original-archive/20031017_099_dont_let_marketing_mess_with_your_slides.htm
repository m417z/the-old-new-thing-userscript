<p>         It's PDC season, so I thought I'd relate an anecdote about a conference from many         years ago.      </p>
<p>         I forget which conference it was, maybe GCDC 1996, we were all busy preparing our         presentations and submitted them to the Microsoft conference representatives so they         could apply the standard template, clean them up, print out copies to go into the         handouts, all that stuff.      </p>
<p>         What about that "clean them up" step?      </p>
<p>         We didn't realize what "clean them up" meant until we showed up at the conference         and looked at the handouts.      </p>
<p>         Part of "cleaning up" was inserting "&reg;" and "&trade;" symbols as necessary. Which meant         that they also took every occurrence of the abbreviation "VB" and changed it to "Microsoft         Visual Basic&reg;". They even did this to the presentation on vertex buffers. The abbreviation         for vertex buffers is also "VB".      </p>
<p>         You can imagine what this did to the presentation on vertex buffers.  </body></p>

		<p>So are you saying that Marketing couldn&#8217;t work out that the topic wasn&#8217;t actually visual basic? Or that they used an automated process without checking it? Either way that&#8217;s pretty dumb (just the sort of thing I&#8217;d probably do :) ).</p>

		<p>More subtle problems make you look stupid, too &#8212; like when you have a slide deck with some source code on it in a language that is case sensitive (eg, JScript) and they&#8217;ve helpfully &quot;corrected&quot; all occurences of &#8216;function&#8217; with &#8216;Function&#8217;. Or when they use the &quot;Smart Quotes&quot; in Office to make the code impossible to copy-and-paste into VS.</p>
<p>Oh and they also break your custom animation slides. And you can&#8217;t see the text on the bottom-right corner of the slide because of that annoying logo they just HAD to put there.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of that recent Microsoft advert in some magazine or other (DDJ??) where there are typos in the code (webServce instead of webService or something). Someone at MS has gone to lots of trouble to develop intellisense &#8230;.</p>
<p>I did mean to mention it on the feedback site or something but I doubt anyone ever reads it.</p>

		<p>In the documentation I write I manually go back and correct any smart quotes that appear in code fragments specifically because many (most?) users just cut&amp;paste them straight into their own programs.  Since the API is multilingual, I have to be very careful to get the formatting just right for each language (e.g. use of VB line-continuation characters, etc etc).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
