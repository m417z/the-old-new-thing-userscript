<p>When you set your Explorer to Details view, it can become tricky to drop an item onto the window background (in order to move it into the folder) because Details view sets full row select (starting in Windows&nbsp;Vista). This helps users of tablets and touch screens, because it increases the size of the target when dragging and dropping into a folder. On the other hand, when you have more items than fit on the screen, every pixel in the view corresponds to an item; there is no background any more. So how do you drop on the background?</p>
<p> If you're using Windows&nbsp;7, you can take advantage of a little gutter space to the left and right of the columns. There is a gutter to the left of the leftmost column and another gutter to the right of the rightmost column. Windows&nbsp;Vista doesn't have these gutters, but you can create a gutter on the right hand side by resizing your columns narrow, and then resizing the window wider than the sum of all the columns. Yes, it's clumsy. </p>
<p> Less clumsy is dropping onto the Details panel at the bottom of the window, which works both on Windows&nbsp;Vista and Window&nbsp;7. Dropping onto the Details panel is treated as a drop on the folder background. And the Details panel is a nice big target for your drag/drop operation, so those of you using a tablet or touch screen should have no trouble finding it. (Those gutters are nice for mouse-based users, but if you've got fat fingers, they're not much help on a touch screen.) </p>
<p> If you've turned off the Details panel, you can also drop onto the title bar. It's not as big as the Details pane, but it's still bigger than the gutters. </p>
<p> Finally, there's always the copy/paste approach instead of drag/drop. Multi-select the items you want to transfer, right-click them and select Copy (or Cut, as appropriate), then go to the destination folder, and under the Organize menu, select Paste. </p>
<p> Except for the gutters, all of these techniques also work for Windows Vista. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: Commenter Medinoc complains that, with the switch to full row select, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/07/31/9853722.aspx#9856027"> it's very hard to click on the background</a>. Actually, it's not that bad. You can right-click on the blank space of any unselected item. For example, find an unselected item with a name that doesn't fill the entire <i>Name</i> column and look at all that white space to the right. You can right-click there and it will be treated as as a right-click on the background. The full row is still treated as part of the item when dropping, for the benefit of people using tablets and touch screens, or people who simply want to hit a target bigger than a 16&times;16 icon. </p>

		<p>One of the many reasons I will never switch to Vista is this full row select. &nbsp;I like details view, but full row select makes things much slower and very frustrating for me. &nbsp;Maybe there is a registry key to disable this that I&#8217;m not aware of.</p>

		<p>I thought that &#8220;benefitting&#8221; the 0.5% that use touch screens and tablets should not be done by pissing off some 50% of those who don&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>I rushed right out to try the &quot;right-click on the blank space of any unselected item&quot; technique. &nbsp;This annoyed me from time to time, when I want to start a command window from the directory&#8217;s context menu. &nbsp;Turns out, the technique works great when you don&#8217;t have any modifier keys pressed. &nbsp;When you hold down the Shift key (to reveal &quot;Start Command Window Here&quot; on the context menu), no go &#8211; pressing the Shift key down causes the current row to be selected, and thus you&#8217;re no longer clicking on the background. &nbsp;Ah, well.</p>

<p>I tried this on Win7 RTM and it mostly works the way you wanted. I held down shift while right clicking in a column in details view and the &quot;Open command window here&quot; option was available. I don&#8217;t have any Vista boxes around to check if this behavior changed, though. One thing to note is that this only works if no items are currently selected. Aside from clicking in the gutter to clear the selection, it looks like right clicking in white space also clears the selection, allowing you to shift-right click.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s interesting that, in Vista, the drop on any part of the details pane seems to work. &nbsp;I expected the numerous dead spots (where a mouse click will fail to activate the window) to also apply to the drop process.</p>

		<p>@Anonymoose</p>
<p>Thanks a million for the link for how to remove full row select. &nbsp;Whereas I would never run Vista at home, from time to time I must use it at work. &nbsp;This setting will go a long way to decreasing my frustration and making Vista slightly more usable.</p>
<p>One annoyance down, 473 more and I might consider upgrading to Vista. :)</p>

		<p>I hate how Vista and Windows 7 don&#8217;t let you right-click on a file without first left-clicking on them. Doesn&#8217;t that defeat the whole &#8220;reducing clicks to improve UI&#8221; ideology that motivated Microsoft to create features like Aero Snap?</p>
<p>In addition, there were two major UI changes in Windows 7 that were bad: making an icon selection persist when you Refresh a folder/desktop and removing the sort/group heading from folders when you&#8217;re not in Details view. If Windows 7&#8217;s taskbar weren&#8217;t such an improvement over Vista, I&#8217;d consider going back to Vista to have those two features back.</p>

<p>Your computer&#8217;s defective.</p>

<p>Why is that bad? Isn&#8217;t that exactly what you&#8217;d expect to happen? Removing the &quot;Deselect&quot; side-effect from &quot;Refresh&quot; is definitely a good thing, fewer side-effects make the behavior less mysterious and easier to understand.</p>

		<p>Maybe I&#8217;m misunderstanding the problem or have done something to my Vista machine, but for me there is always a couple pixels in between each item in the details view that will let me drop to the folder I am currently looking at (drop the background). &nbsp;When you line it up right a solid black line is displayed.</p>

		<p>Left clicking the black space is also interesting. Dragging it downwards grabs the selected item, but upwards it starts drawing the selection rectangle.</p>

		<p>&lt;&lt; Besides, wasn&#8217;t one of the big complaints about Windows that &quot;Details mode should be full row select&quot;? &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Not that I&#8217;d ever heard but maybe the people I talk to all over the net aren&#8217;t a representative sample. &lt;shrug&gt;</p>
<p>It seems odd to me that Explorer optimizes for the case where you want to drop files into a subfolder rather than the case where you want to drop files into the current folder.</p>
<p>Also, IMO, you get the worst of both worlds by combing full-row selection with the old-style selection system (where to deselect you have to find some empty space to click, or reach for the ctrl key). File managers which use full-row selection typically combine it with toggle-selection instead. (Or they leave both choices up to the user.)</p>
<p>I am not saying that the old-style selection system is bad. I actually quite like it and use it myself; I just don&#8217;t think it combines well with full-row selection.</p>

		<p>@Raymond Chen: That&#8217;s what I mean, though. It isn&#8217;t consistent. If I right-click on the actual text or icon it works, but if I right-click on a blank area (where the mouse is still above the &#8220;illuminated hover&#8221; for that file) it does not. Left-clicking will work anywhere in the &#8220;hover&#8221; area. The UI leads me to believe that I can interact with that file when the area is illuminated, but it&#8217;s inconsistent because I can left-click anywhere to select that file, but I cannot right-click anywhere to select and display a context menu for that file.</p>

		<p>Yeah, I get the same behaviour that the other Dan up there says. Dragging over folders in details view makes the space between them droppable onto. It was hard to get used to at first, but now that I&#8217;m used to it I quite like the feature.</p>

		<p>&#8220;I find it strange that multiple people interpret &#8220;the blank space is treated as the background&#8221; to mean &#8220;everything is treated as the background.&#8221; Let&#8217;s try that again. The blank space is treated as the background. The non-blank space is treated as the item. If you want to right-click on the item, then right-click on the non-blank space.&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe that&#8217;s because it&#8217;s confusing, inconsistent and non-intuitive?</p>
<p>The instructions above should actually read:</p>
<p>&#8220;The blank space is treated as the background, unless you&#8217;re left clicking or dropping something on it, in which case it&#8217;s treated as the item. The non-blank space is treated as the item. If you want to right-click on the item, then right-click on the non-blank space. If you want to left-click on the item, then you can click on the blank space or the non-blank space, unless you want to drag the item out, in which case you you have to click on the non-blank space. If you want to drag and drop on the item then you can drop on the blank space or the non-blank space. If you want to drop on the background, good luck finding any blank space.&#8221;</p>

		<p>I guess I like full-row select. It means less mousing when you window is on the left side and the mouse on the right.</p>
<p>Plus, since explorer doesn&#8217;t have horizontal zebra marking, identifying the properties of a file in a cluster of similar ones is a lot harder. Full row select means I can highlight the file, and scan across the details (isn&#8217;t that why we set detail view? Because we want the details?)</p>
<p>The eye has issues following across a table &#8211; it can easily jump a line.</p>

<p>Raymond wrote:&quot;Huh? I just did a direct right-click on an unselected file and the context menu for that file showed up just fine. Click on a part of the file that isn&#8217;t blank.&quot;</p>
<p>See, this is the confusing thing. &nbsp;In details view, the selection/left-click target is now the entire row (including blank spaces in the details columns), but the *right-click* target is only non-blank spaces (i.e. text, icons) in the columns. &nbsp;However, when a file is already selected, then you can right-click anywhere on the selected row, which is why some people think you now have to left-click before right-clicking.</p>
<p>Seems slightly inconsistent to me, but oh well&#8230;. &nbsp;Not complaining too loudly, but just pointing out a potential source of confusion.</p>

		<p>A bigger nuisance that&#8217;s been introduced since vista is the inconsistency between the tree view on the left and the folder contents on the right.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very easy to have a folder highlighted on the left but showing a completely different folder&#8217;s contents on the right. (just click in the blank space next to a folder to highlight it, but not actually show the contents).</p>
<p>This gives a terrible user experience, and can cause you to delete a folder thinking it has contents or lack thereof that it really doesn&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>@Anonymoose: Thank for the link.</p>
<p>@Raymond: &lt;&lt; Besides, wasn&#8217;t one of the big complaints about Windows that &quot;Details mode should be full row select&quot;? &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>I should have precised in the first place that I&#8217;m in single-click mode. While I acknowledge full row select can be useful when you&#8217;re not in single-click mode, it quickly becomes a problem when you are.</p>

<p>Strawman. He didn&#8217;t suggest that you change the left-click behaviour. You can make it consistent by changing the right-click behaviour to use the full row.</p>
<p>You can, after all, select files by right-clicking. But only if you right-click their names. That isn&#8217;t &#8220;full-row select&#8221; anymore, now, is it? :-)</p>
<p>&lt;&lt; (2) How often do you need to left-click on a blank space? &gt;&gt;</p>
<p>Erm, all the time. In Explorer it&#8217;s the easiest way to deselect everything that I know of.</p>

		<p>(Tried to post this a few times but the site goes back to the main blog page instead of showing the &quot;comment accepted&quot; thing it usually does. I&#8217;ll try splitting it into shorter parts in case it&#8217;s the length causing the problem.)</p>
<p>&quot;All right then, how would you have added full row select?&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll list some ideas/thoughts but, TBH, I probably wouldn&#8217;t have made full-row-select the default (let alone mandatory if you don&#8217;t know an obscure registry setting) in the first place.</p>
<p>Does the desire for full-row selection come from:</p>
<p>1) People wanting to be able to click anywhere on a row to select things.</p>
<p>2) People wanting a larger selection target, especially for small filenames, but not necessarily the entire row.</p>
<p>3) People wanting a visual highlight so they can see across a row without getting mixed up with adjacent files.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
