<p>
A customer was upgrading a program from Visual Studio 2008
to Visual Studio 2017.
As part of the upgrade, they also decided to recompile it as
a Unicode program rather than an ANSI program.
And they bumped their <code>WINVER</code>
from <code>0x400</code> to <code>0x600</code>.
All together, these settings mean that they dropped support for
Windows 95, Windows 98, Windows Me, as well as Windows NT 4.0,
Windows 2000, Windows XP, and Windows Server 2003.
Given that all of these operating systems left extended support
quite some time ago
(although Windows XP stubbornly
held on way past its best-if-used-by date),
these updates were long overdue.
</p>
<p>
The customer found that as a result of these upgrades,
the project also switched from using version 5 of the common
controls to version 6.
This was not something they expected,
since it's not anything they explicitly asked to be upgrade to.
What happened?
</p>
<p>
It was the combination of the two other upgrades
that triggered the switch from version 5 to version 6.
</p>
<p>
Version 6 of the common controls was introduced in Windows XP,
so it has as a prerequisite that your <code>WINVER</code> be
set to at least <code>0x0501</code>,
since that is the value that corresponds to Windows XP.
If you choose a lower value, then you are saying that you are
targeting a of Windows that predates version 6 of the common controls,
and therefore trying to use it will never work.
</p>
<p>
Version 6 of the common controls
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20061214-02/?p=28713">
is also Unicode-only</a>,
with some
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20081106-00/?p=20303">
concessions for older messages</a>.
If you build your project for ANSI,
then the project can't use version 6 of the common controls
because it's using the wrong character set.
</p>
<p>
But once you set your project parameters so both of the criteria
are met, then version 6 of the common controls becomes available.
</p>
<p>
If that's not what you want, then you'll need to say,
"Hey, like, I know I meet all the qualifications for using version
6 of the common controls, but I don't want to."
It appears that if you create a new MFC project,
then
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb531404.aspx">
the IDE will enable version 6 of the common controls automatically
once you enable Unicode</a>,
so that could be where the manifest magic is coming from.</p>

		<p>Not disputing that in the least&#8230; that doesn&#8217;t mean the client won&#8217;t get whiny over it. I know in particular Defense contractors would scream about this sort of change even though it&#8217;s actually probably more secure. They assume any change they didn&#8217;t explicitly approve is malicious.</p>

I think (anecdotally) that it&#8217;s more like a variation on the &#8220;[&#8230;] unexpected performance improvement&#8221;: <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20121123-00/?p=6013/" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20121123-00/?p=6013/</a><br />
It&#8217;s a cosmetic change, but it&#8217;s still a change. All changes have to be tracked down and approved.</p>

		<p>Spontaneous changes can also be the symptom of a hidden problem unless you can account for them.  If you find yourself using Thing B when you expected to be using Thing A, that might mean Thing A has gone missing and the system is falling back to Thing B.  Or, if my compile times went from 10s to 1s, I&#8217;d be very suspicious that this &#8220;improvement&#8221; was due to the compilation not working properly, or operating on the wrong set of input files.</p>
<p>From the other side, there is no such thing as a guaranteed-safe upgrade. Your code might be relying on (e.g.) memory not being re-used or other undocumented behaviour of the library.</p>

		<p>Since it took about 10 years since the end of support of Win98 for it to go away, I&#8217;d expect the duration to be similar or longer for WinXP, given the inertia it gained these years.</p>

		<p>Btw, who knows when these organizations will stop paying support contract for WinXP?<br />

<p>Around 2011, my ex-company still have customer paying big amount to maintenance contract for us to support DOS version of out stock trading system (yup, that&#8217;s why they were still using Win98). If the last staff that knows how to support it go retired, I would not be surprised if that company is still using Win98 with that system now.</p>

		<p>IIRC MS&#8217;s pay $tupdily Big Buck$ for post end of life XP support was only going to run 3 years; which means that unless the corporate legacy customers used the I&#8217;m a Cash Register registry hack (XP POS Ready 2009 still has a year and a half of support left) they&#8217;ve been out in the cold since this April.</p>

		<p>Of course being out of terminal support doesn&#8217;t mean it&#8217;ll all just go away.  Up until last September I was producing data used by a Navy system whose UI was built around NT4 embedded.  The need to make weapon systems as light and compact as possible left them with no easy upgrade path.  The PC NT4 was on was too old to run 7 at all or XP well (p3 w 256mb ram); and was a non-extractable part of a 6 figure box.  A program to replace that box (and a number of associated components) was on the plan for a decade ago; but was dropped when the platform unexpectedly developed a to mechanically worn out to be safe problem that devoured all the other upgrade funds.  The whole platform&#8217;s in the process of being replaced now: and between total support funds shrinking with the number of platforms remaining in operation, the replacement platform taking over the missions where updated data would be most important, and the amount of govt bureaucracy between the data getting to the govt and it finally being fielded they let the contract I was on wind up instead.</p>
<p>I wouldn&#8217;t be surprised if other equally ancient systems are still around another 10 or 20 years from now.  Even more than industrial machines and scientific/laboratory instruments weapon platforms have natural life spans far beyond the support period of any major software platforms.</p>

		<p>One other thing that Raymond forgot to mention about switching your project from VS 2008 to VS 2017 is that if you&#8217;re using MFC, every compiled executable in a Release build may add a couple of MB in size for the exact same code you compiled in VS 2008. (Especially if you&#8217;re building with static linking to MFC to avoid dealing with the &#8220;DLL-hell.&#8221;)</p>
<p>Also, I&#8217;m not sure what kind of for-profit company would be willing to neglect 6.47% of the market share for their software by making it not compatible with Windows XP? I mean, don&#8217;t get me wrong. As a developer I absolutely hate Windows XP! That is the most bug-ridden and insecure OS Microsoft ever created (in this century.) But from a marketing perspective, not supporting Windows XP is not something I would want to do at this point in time. If we assume that there are roughly 1 billion installations of Windows out there, you&#8217;re ignoring 64 million systems.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the metrics, by the way (or you can Google &#8220;Windows XP market share&#8221;):<br />
<a href="https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10&#038;qpcustomd=0" rel="nofollow">https://www.netmarketshare.com/operating-system-market-share.aspx?qprid=10&#038;qpcustomd=0</a></p>
<p>BTW, Windows XP still has a larger market share than Windows 8 :)</p>

		<p>&#8220;TW, Windows XP still has a larger market share than Windows 8&#8221;</p>
<p>Makes sense, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>If you can&#8217;t upgrade, or fear upgrades, you&#8217;d be on XP. You&#8217;d never have gone to Vista+.</p>
<p>If you like to upgrade, you&#8217;re probably already on 10. </p>
<p>If you&#8217;re a large Enterprise (say, 30k+ endpoints), you skipped Vista, went to 7, skipped 8, refuse to accept that 8.1 was any different from 8, and are slowly moving to 10 now.</p>

		<p>On the other hand, the people still running Windows XP have demonstrated that they don&#8217;t upgrade anything, so they&#8217;re not going to install the latest version of your app either. They&#8217;ll keep running the version of your app from 1998.</p>

		<p>Yes, I agree. I&#8217;m just approaching it from a marketing standpoint as well.</p>

		<p>How I wish this was true. Unfortunately, some XP users do whine loudly when your latest version requires at least Windows 7&#8230;</p>

		<p>At best the XP &gt; 8 claim is only supportable by splitting 8 and 8.1 apart even though MS has treated the latter as a service pack and EOLed support on 8.0.</p>
<p>Netmarketshare puts XP at 6.5% vs 6% for 8.1 and 1.4% for 8,0.  Statcounter has XP at 3.9% vs 9.0 and 2.6% for the 8.x versions.</p>

		<p>It is very interesting that they were surprised. Upgrading a MFC program from MBCS to UNICODE is not difficult, but needs to be done  carefully. There a lot of places in the code that may need a fix (count of characters, vs bytes in an API cll, forgotten _T() macro&#8217;s, etc, exporting and importing text files, etc).<br />
Using the common controls v6 in a MFC application is often controlled by the following code (simplified version):</p>
<p>#ifdef UNICODE<br />
#pragma comment(linker,&#8221;/manifestdependency:\&#8221;type=&#8217;win32&#8242; name=&#8217;Microsoft.Windows.Common-Controls&#8217; version=&#8217;6.0.0.0&#8242; processorArchitecture=&#8217;*&#8217; publicKeyToken=&#8217;6595b64144ccf1df&#8217; language=&#8217;*&#8217;\&#8221;&#8221;)<br />
#endif </p>
<p>These statements will be put into your source code when you generate your MFC application for the first time.  A global search for UNICODE in the source code of the application that needs to be ported would be a first good step.</p>

		<p>Victor, it sounds like it&#8217;s a trivial issue, but it&#8217;s not. I did it for a couple of projects and it was a nightmare! There&#8217;re tons of places where compiler may not catch it. For instance, printf() type functions (unless you replaced them with the *_s counterparts and use the latest version of Visual Studio.) Otherwise, I&#8217;m still finding bugs in some projects that were converted years ago. It&#8217;s way too easy to rely on an automated refractor and gloss over some branch of code that is rarely executed that may crash the thread later on.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
