<p>My friend <a href="http://wendyhome.com/"> ::Wendy::</a> has many circles of friends, and several of them converged at the <a href="http://elephantcastle.com/content/locations/seattle"> Elephant and Castle Pub</a> in Seattle last week <a href="http://wendyhome.com/2007/10/31/repatriating-to-reading-berkshire/"> for her send-off party</a>, resulting in a night-long game of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venn_diagram"> Venn Diagram</a> as you tried to work out which groups intersected how.</p>
<p> I got to meet in person some of ::Wendy::'s blogger friends, including <a href="http://liscious.net/piehole/"> Jennifer</a> (aka "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/11/02/488164.aspx">Piehole</a>") and <a href="http://www.dharmajunkie.com/"> LaCroix</a> (not her real name), the person who <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/01/24/1521926.aspx"> tipped me off to Yaktrax</a> earlier this year. Jennifer in real life is pretty much exactly like her blog persona: boistrous and hilariously outrageous. LaCroix was a surprise: Although her writing appears methodical and subdued, in person, she's intensely energetic and charismatic. Once you start talking with her, you somehow just <i>want</i> to be her friend. It's no wonder that she has her own <a href="http://www.dharmajunkie.com/2007/11/01/jeudi-le-1-novembre/"> Cafeteria Boyfriends</a>. </p>
<p> At some point during the evening, I mentioned the movie <a href="http://www.darkonthemovie.com/"><i>Darkon</i></a>, a documentary on the <a href="http://www.darkon.org/"> Darkon Wargaming Club</a>, a band of Live Action Role Playing aficionados, known perhaps pejoratively as <i>larpers</i>. We were all fascinated by the idea of the movie (<a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2177830/">Grady Hendrix of <i>Slate</i> calls it a "must-see"</a>), but alas it doesn't appear to be showing in the Seattle area. We'll just have to wait for it to show up in the video rental stores. </p>

		<p>I&#8217;m a complete and utter nerd but I still find LARPing to be a bit too much. &nbsp;I can probably recite some rules for DnD or random video games from memory at this point, so maybe I&#8217;m just as bad.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve done WhiteWolf Larp a few times, great fun. Probably (no, most certainly) looks a bit dorky, but I don&#8217;t really care about that.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what makes nerds great, being able to have fun, knowing fully that to an onlooker you look like a total dork.</p>

		<p>Am I the only one that&#8217;s disappointed that Raymond and Wendy didn&#8217;t end up together? Strange really, I don&#8217;t actually know anything about either of them other than their blog posts, so I have no idea if this is a silly idea or not.</p>

		<p>I have larped before, and I wouldn&#8217;t consider &quot;larper&quot; to a pejorative term.</p>

		<p>Raymond! &nbsp;That is hands down the sweetest thing anyone has ever written about me. &nbsp;You are an absolute darling. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Had an excellent time on Friday chatting with you and Jennifer (and oh my god, I was introduced to so many people I can&#8217;t remember everyone&#8217;s name!), we really should grab a bunch of people and get together again. &nbsp;A healthy dose of the giggles is good for whatever ails you! &nbsp;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
