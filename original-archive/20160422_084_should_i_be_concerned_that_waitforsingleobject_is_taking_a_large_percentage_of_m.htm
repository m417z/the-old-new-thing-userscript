<!-- CONTENT START -->
<p>
A customer designed a client-server system where the client
and the server ran on the same machine (but with different security
contexts).
They were doing some performance tests of the data transfer
portion of the system, and one of tests consisted
of the following:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Client opens a unit of content on the server.
<li>Repeat 100,000 times:
<ul>
<li>Client seeks to the start of the content.
<li>Client reads entire content a line at a time
        until the end of the content is reached.
    </ul>
<li>Client closes the connection with the server.
</ul>
<p>
When they ran this test, they found that the
<code>Wait&shy;For&shy;Single&shy;Object</code>
function was consuming 6% of the total CPU time.
"We expected
overhead of calling the
<code>Wait&shy;For&shy;Single&shy;Object</code>
function
to be negligible.
I suspect most developers don't take into
account the full cost of
<code>Wait&shy;For&shy;Single&shy;Object</code>."
</p>
<p>
If you read the same content
100,000 times,
it will quickly become fully cached,
and the entire exercise becomes CPU-bound
rather than I/O-bound.
</p>
<p>
CPU-bound operation is CPU-bound.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, we understand that this is an artificial
scenario and that real-world applications will not
use the server in this manner.
The issue is that the
<code>Wait&shy;For&shy;Single&shy;Object</code>
function is using a lot of CPU in this trace,
whereas most developers probably consider
<code>Wait&shy;For&shy;Single&shy;Object</code>
to be effectively free."
</p>
<p>
What you've done is taken what is presumably
a complex operation and
stripping it down to just overhead.
Caching the entire workload in memory
means that
the actual work of reading the data is reduced
to a series of <code>memcpy</code> operations,
and since you're reading the data a line at a time,
you're not copy a lot of data at each round trip.
It's like using a large cardboard box to ship an
index card.
All of the cost is in getting the cardboard box,
setting it up,
packing it,
sealing it,
and mailing it.
</p>
<p>
Continuing the analogy:
If you construct a sample test of your
company's shipping system by shipping 100,000
cardboard boxes,
each of which contains a single index card,
then you're going to draw conclusions like
"Tape and shipping labels constitute 5% of
the weight!"
</p>
<p>
Well yeah, if you're shipping empty boxes,
then tape and shipping labels are going to take
up a measureable percentage of the weight,
seeing as <i>you are shipping boxes that
are practically empty</i>.
</p>
<p>
What you've got there, my friend, is a
<code>Wait&shy;For&shy;Single&shy;Object</code>
stress test.
</p>
<p>
What is more interesting from a performance
standpoint is not the percentage of overhead
that goes to
<code>Wait&shy;For&shy;Single&shy;Object</code>.
What you should be worrying about is the
actual amount of time spent by
<code>Wait&shy;For&shy;Single&shy;Object</code>.
From the customer's own data,
it appeared that around 3 microseconds of
the per-operation cost was being spent in
calls to <code>Wait&shy;For&shy;Single&shy;Object</code>.&sup1;
That's the number you should be putting into your
calculations to decide whether that overhead
is preventing you from reaching your performance targets.
</p>
<p>
If you think about it some more,
you may notice that the customer is worried
that the
<code>Wait&shy;For&shy;Single&shy;Object</code>
cost is too large a percentage of the CPU time,
when in fact they should be worried that it is <i>too little</i>
of the CPU time.
Look at it another way:
94% of the CPU time is spent
<i>inside the application code</i>.
For example,
when
the
<code>Wait&shy;For&shy;Single&shy;Object</code>
call returns, the server
that was waiting on the handle has to figure out
what the signaled handle means,
determine which client is issuing the request
and
which piece of content is being requested,
and
route the request to the appropriate handler.
The handler then performs any applicable security
checks and
parameter checks,
and then it can do actual work:
Calculate how many bytes of data need to be returned,
locate those bytes,
and copy those bytes.
Finally, it has to do
whatever is necessary to transfer that
data back to the client.
</p>
<p>
Assuming that the actual work
of determining what memory needs to be transferred
to the client is, say, 1% of CPU (this is probably being
generous),
then that means 93% of the CPU is being spent
in <i>application overhead</i>.
</p>
<p>
In the above analogy,
the thing you should be noticing is not that
tape and shipping labels take up 5%
of the weight.
What you should be noticing is that cardboard boxes
take up 95% of the weight.
That's the thing that's determining your
shipping weight overhead.
If you want to lower your weight overhead
for shipping a single index card,
don't try to get thinner shipping labels.
Work on switching from cardboard boxes
to envelopes.
</p>
<p>
&sup1; The customer didn't say how many times
<code>Wait&shy;For&shy;Single&shy;Object</code>
was called per operation, so I don't know what
the per-call <code>Wait&shy;For&shy;Single&shy;Object</code>
cost was.</p>

		<p>My guess is that the box&#8217;s blame was theirs, and the label&#8217;s blame is somebody else&#8217;s (in this case, Microsoft&#8217;s). And we all know that it is easier to switch blame on the 5% than to make something useful on the remaining 95% you are responsible of. So let&#8217;s try to shave that 5%!</p>

		<p>Death is different to optimisation. It is easy to justify ignoring an optimisation that would save someone an extra five seconds of their day when it takes two hours for the software to do it&#8217;s job. It&#8217;s not easy to justify ignoring something that could save a single life.</p>

		<p>It rather depends on the cost/benefit tradeoffs of the change.</p>
<p>Making it illegal to use a private car on a journey of less than 30 km would massively reduce deaths in cities (both from pollution and from collisions); and yet I see very little movement towards this, even though it&#8217;s trivial to justify the benefits on the numbers, because the cost of the change is too high.</p>
<p>Same applies to optimization, with the difference that the benefits from saving 5 seconds in a 2 hour operation are much, much lower than the benefits of saving 1,000 lives per year per city.</p>

		<p>Actually making using cars with less than 30 km distance is not really possible to enforce. If you switch it to &#8211; for example &#8211; prevent cars from entering cities (or centers of those), you will easily find several cases of already such an enforcement implemented. And many movements actively trying to push similar ones in their cities as well.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s trivial to enforce &#8211; just require all cars to have a reporting black box that transmits the latest OBDII state back to the police every minute, and track vehicles that travel less than 30 km between two extended time periods (say 5 minutes) with the engine off.</p>

<p>Then correlate this with blanket ANPR coverage of the road network; you can prevent speeding at the same time, by busting anyone who manages to exceed the designated limit between two ANPR cameras.</p>
<p>The cost is rather high, but it saves lives.</p>

		<p>Enforcing such a law would be a nightmare (to know how far people drive would require spying on them). Also, to make people change their behavior, you need to provide them with an alternative at least as good (and probably better to offset the cost of changing). If public transportation is inconvenient, people will want to use private vehicles, regardless of pollution or risk of collision (by the way, collisions in cities are less deadly than collisions on open roads, because speed matters a lot). If environment-friendly vehicles are expensive, people will keep their polluting cars.</p>

		<p>I think that would only be true if you always had a constant CPU and disk load over all your tasks. In real life, you want your computer to be able to handle its maximum reasonably common load fairly comfortably, which normally means that the rest of the time it will be cruising on idle.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
