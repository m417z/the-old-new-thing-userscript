<p>A great word to use at Microsoft to make it sound like you're one of the cool insiders is <i>pivot</i>. Mostly because the meaning of the word varies from place to place, so you can use it to mean whatever you like while still sounding hip and jargony.</p>
<p> In Windows Phone, the term <i>pivot</i> is a technical term which refers to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ff941098(v=VS.92).aspx"> a type of control that lets users switch easily from page to page</a>. The term is used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metonymy"> metonymically</a> to mean the pages themselves. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> In the Calendar, on the To-Do <i>pivot</i>, you can press and hold on a to-do item and select <i>postpone a day</i>. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> In Excel, the term <i>pivot</i> refers to a type of table or chart that <a href="http://office.microsoft.com/en-us/excel-help/pivottable-reports-101-HA001034632.aspx"> summarizes data</a>. </p>
<p> In Windows Live Search (as it was known back then), the term <i>pivot</i> referred to the category selectors at the top of the page (Images, Videos, News, <i>etc</i>.) </p>
<p> But once you go beyond specific technical definitions, things get vague quickly. </p>
<p> The most general sense of the term is just that a pivot is way of visualizing data. No summarization required. </p>

</table>
<p> Use the new hotness to gain instant credibility. </p>
<p> Here are some other citations which seem to be even more vague. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> We will focus <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/12/11/10376210.aspx"> v-teams</a> along client/server pivots across workloads. </p>

<blockquote class="q"><p> Is there a way to write a program that does Q whenever Z happens? Another pivot on this question would be to add this as a feature in the XYZ product. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> Over time, we will adjust this diagram to pivot by process rather than organizational unit, but for the moment, the organizational unit serves as a rough proxy for process. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The new model will be a significant change to the organization, and it will take focused effort to reorient the organization to this alignment. Initially in this new pivot, there may be challenges in learning new roles, accountabilities and responsibilities from role to role in the overall project structure. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> That last one is today's winner for muddled management-speak. </p>
<p> When in doubt, toss in the word <i>pivot</i>. Nobody will know what you mean, but that's okay, because you don't know what it means either. It just sounds cool. </p>

		<p>Or to pivot your analysis, one could metonymically state that Redmond often restructures their phrases to leverage grammatical constructs of limited utility transliterated into grammatical sites where existing lexical paradigms are the norm.</p>
<p>(Microsoft often uses useless words where existing common phrases would be more normal).</p>

		<p>&quot;The new model will be a significant change to the organization, and it will take focused effort to reorient the organization to this alignment. Initially in this new pivot, there may be challenges in learning new roles, accountabilities and responsibilities from role to role in the overall project structure.&quot;</p>
<p>Sounds like &quot;pivot&quot; here just means &quot;change of direction&quot;, which is the word&#39;s original meaning anyway (to me). &nbsp;Using &quot;pivot&quot; here sounds strange, but of course the whole sentence sounds like marketing-speak.</p>

		<p>Most of these seem to be using &quot;pivot&quot; to mean &quot;grouped&quot;, which derives from &quot;pivot table&quot;.</p>
<p>The original concept that a pivot table allows you to look at the data from different perspectives (as if it were an object being physically rotated and viewed from different sides, which is correctly described by &quot;pivot&quot;) seems to be totally lost. &nbsp;This does yield a new set of groupings, but does NOT mean that &quot;pivot&quot; is synonymous with &quot;group&quot;.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
