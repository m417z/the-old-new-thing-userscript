<p>Microsoft Outlook by default uses a semicolon to separate multiple recipients. <a href="http://www.extendoffice.com/documents/outlook/1649-outlook-allow-comma-as-address-separator.html"> You can change this to a comma</a>, but why is the semicolon the default?</p>
<p> Microsoft Outlook was originally positioned as a business product, and many businesses complained that the use of a comma as a separator created havoc because they have a policy of setting names in the address book as "Last, First". </p>
<p> In 2000, the Outlook folks tried to change the default, but the outcry from corporations made them go back to having the semicolon be the default separator. </p>
<p> Besides, there are a lot of people who have commas in their names, such as <a href="http://www.mlkdayofservice.org/"> Martin Luther King, Jr</a>. </p>

		<p>And probably everyone who works at Microsoft used Last, First as the way to display contact names. I say this because in all versions of Outlook before Outlook 2007, if you set the display format to &quot;First Last&quot; it would not stick. A reboot, or adding a new contact, or just a sneeze would change the setting back to &quot;Last, First&quot;. And half of my contacts would show as &quot;Last, First&quot; while the other half would show the way I specified.</p>
<p>My conclusion from that situation was that none of the Outlook developers and testers used &quot;First Last&quot; as the display format, or they would have noticed it. (And I did not have a support contract, so I couldn&#39;t enter a bug.)</p>

		<p>Of course a colon is valid in Unix paths, too. The big difference is that approximately 100% of Windows (and DOS) paths have a colon in them, while approximately 0% of Unix paths have a colon in them.</p>

		<p>Personally, I prefer using a semicolon as a separator as it seems to be a &quot;more special&quot; character than the comma. &nbsp;As you point out, a comma might be found in a person&#39;s name, but (considering PATH) it also seems to be more common in file paths as well.</p>
<p>Regarding Last, First &#8212; that&#39;s one of those things that seems like a good idea when you&#39;re planning an Active Directory deployment, but as someone who&#39;s worked with both Last, First and First Last environments, just using the default First Last can save you a lot of headache in both administration and usability. &nbsp;Really, all that Last, First gives you is a little better default sorting in AD tools like Users and Computers (and that can be achieved easily enough through other means).</p>

		<p>As programmer, using semi-colon as separator is just plain natural choice to me. Even in Excel formulas, sometimes when we need to concatenate multiple text fields, semi-colon is still the natural choice.</p>

		<p>Finally an explanation for why Outlook is different to every other email app on the planet. &nbsp;That does however lead to a followup question: If every other email app on the planet doesn&#39;t have problems with commas, why is it such a big deal for Outlook?</p>
<p>(Also, the fix via a config-option change only works for Outlook as an application. &nbsp;If you have to use the web interface, there&#39;s no way to fix it, you have to manually re-type your address line if you&#39;re cutting and pasting into Outlook).</p>

		<p>@Dave: I could guess that it could be because of the fact that Exchange works with Active Directory, and by default the proxyAddresses attribute contents are separated by semicolon. This makes it natural choice to use it too as separator.</p>

<p>&gt; As programmer, using semi-colon as separator is just plain natural choice to me. Even in Excel formulas, sometimes when we need to concatenate multiple text fields, semi-colon is still the natural choice.</p>
<p>Switch your locale to something that uses , as decimal separator, and Excel will start using semicolons as formula separators.</p>

		<p>@Gabe: &quot;Of course a colon is valid in Unix paths, too.&quot;</p>
<p>Nope, it&#39;s actually not, at least for bash. &nbsp;None of the obvious quoting methods work, then 10 seconds on the internet turned up this StackOverflow question: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14661373/how-to-escape-colon-in-path-on-unix">stackoverflow.com/&#8230;/how-to-escape-colon-in-path-on-unix</a></p>
<p>Given how widespread bash is (hi, shellshock bug), if it isn&#39;t supported on bash, it&#39;s effectively not supported&#8230;</p>
<p>Bonus on-topic chatter: the email RFCs specify syntax for &quot;group-name: address, address, address;&quot; using the semicolon to separate the groups. &nbsp;That&#39;s how &quot;Undisclosed-recipients:;&quot; works. &nbsp;It&#39;s a &quot;non-empty&quot; value for the To field to prevent the MTA from choking, which enables putting all of the real recipients into Bcc.</p>

		<p>Obviously using punctuation in this way is entirely wrong. Outlook (and PATH) should be using U+001F INFORMATION SEPARATOR ONE between elements. Or perhaps PATH should use U+001E INFORMATION SEPARATOR TWO, with U+001F used between each directory in a path. To our time machines!</p>

		<p>@Raymond: &nbsp;Sorry, I made an assumption. &nbsp;I&#39;m glad the issue appears to be fixed in Outlook 2007 and above, but &quot;my IT department&quot; has never applied group policy to my computer, so they couldn&#39;t mess with me&#8230;. &nbsp;(At my previous job, I WAS the IT department, and at my current job, my computer doesn&#39;t get group policy applied.)</p>

		<p>@Skyborne: &quot;Nope, it&#39;s actually not, at least for bash&quot;</p>
<p>Bash has no problems with :s in paths (&#39;mkdir :&#39;, &#39;cd :&#39;, &#39;cd ..&#39;, &#39;rmdir :&#39; works fine), you just can&#39;t escape it in $PATH (or probably $LD_LIBRARY_PATH and other similar variables). Those are two different things, and Gabe was talking about the former.</p>

		<p>@John Elliott:</p>
<p>Time machine initialized. Loop closure failed due to cascade of the following form: Using U+001F as list separator resulting in keyboard adding U+001F followed by U+001F valid in filenames followed by initializing a time machine to correct the mistake.</p>

		<p>@Evan: bash doesn&#39;t interpret any of those as colon-separated lists, either. &nbsp;They&#39;re just arguments to mkdir/rmdir, and filenames to cd.</p>
<p>With all the talk about $PATH/%PATH%, it seems I just assumed Gabe was referring to the same thing.</p>

		<p>@Skyborne: &quot;bash doesn&#39;t interpret any of those as colon-separated lists, either. &quot;</p>
<p>Sure. Gabe didn&#39;t say &quot;colon-separated lists.&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;With all the talk about $PATH/%PATH%, it seems I just assumed Gabe was referring to the same thing.&quot;</p>
<p>Try this elaboration: &quot;Of course a colon is valid in Unix paths, too. The big difference is that approximately 100% of Windows (and DOS) paths have a colon in them, while approximately 0% of Unix paths have a colon in them. As a result, Windows/DOS needs to handle :s gracefully (e.g. by using a different character), whereas the rarity of : paths in Unix means if they don&#39;t work in $PATH it&#39;s not a huge loss.&quot; </p>

		<p>@evan</p>
<p>Yes it&#39;s obvious that the &quot;colon is valid in Unix paths, too&quot; refers to paths passed to calls like open() &amp; mkdir() and not PATH= handling. Using the PATH= interpretation would make &quot;0% of Unix paths have a colon in them&quot; a lie.</p>
<p>It&#39;s irrelevant what any modern unix system does though, the characters for separators were chosen many years ago.</p>

		<p>@Raymond</p>
<p>&gt;What happens in every other email app if you type &quot;Smith, Bob, Jones, Jane&quot; in the To field</p>
<p>In the one I use, it looks up each of the four names and tries to deliver to them. &nbsp;If I want to send mail to Bob Smith I type in &quot;Bob Smith&quot;, no commas, semicolons, or other punctuation.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>But will &quot;Bob Smith&quot; find &quot;Smith, Bob&quot;? (And presumably you still need quotes if sending to MLK, Jr.) -Raymond</em>]</div>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
