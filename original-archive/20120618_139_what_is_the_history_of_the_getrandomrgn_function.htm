<p>An anonymous commenter was curious about how <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd144918(VS.85).aspx"> the <code>Get&shy;Random&shy;Rgn</code> function</a> arrived at its strange name, what the purpose of the third parameter is, and why it is inconsistent between Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;NT.</p>
<p> The sense of word "random" here is <a href="http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/R/random.html"> hacker slang</a> rather than its formal probabilistic definition, specifically sense&nbsp;2: "Assorted, undistinguished", perhaps with a bit of sense&nbsp;4 sprinkled in: "Not well organized." (Commenter Gabe suggested that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/06/04/10314472.aspx#10317464"> a better name would have been <code>Get&shy;Specific&shy;Rgn</code></a>.) </p>
<p> Once upon a time, when men were men and Windows was 16-bit, there was an internal function used to communicate between the window manager and GDI in order to set up device contexts. Internally, the region was called the Rao Region, named after <a href="http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/articleshow/28160333.cms"> Rao Remala</a>, the programmer who invented it, and the function that calculated the Rao Region was rather uncreatively called <code>Compute&shy;Rao&shy;Rgn</code>. </p>
<p> When porting to 32-bit Windows, the Windows&nbsp;NT and Windows&nbsp;95 teams both found that they needed this same internal communication between the window manager and GDI. GDI already has a bunch of functions named <code>Get&shy;Xxx&shy;Rgn</code>, so instead of writing a separate marshaler for each one, they opted to write a single <code>Get&shy;Random&shy;Rgn</code> function which takes an integer which serves as a function code, specifying which region the caller actually wants. (I suspect the Windows&nbsp;95 team followed the cue of the Windows&nbsp;NT team, since Windows&nbsp;NT ran into the problem first.) </p>
<p> Since this was an internal function, it didn't matter that the name was a bit cutesy, nor did it matter what coordinate system it used, as long as the window manager and GDI agreed on the name and coordinate system. The Windows&nbsp;95 team still had a lot of 16-bit code that they needed to be compatible with, so they chose to generate the Rao region the same way that the 16-bit <code>Compute&shy;Rao&shy;Rgn</code> function did it. The Windows&nbsp;NT folks, on the other hand, decided that it was more convenient for them that this internal function use screen coordinates, so that's what it returns on Windows&nbsp;NT. </p>
<p> <code>Get&shy;Random&shy;Rgn</code> isn't really a function that was designed to be public. It was just an internal helper function that outsiders discovered and relied upon to the point that that it became a compatibility constraint so strong that it turned into a <i lang="la">de facto</i> documented function. And all the weirdness you see behind it is the weirdness of a function never intended for public consumption. </p>
<p> The introduction of the Desktop Window Manager in Windows Vista changed the way the visible region was managed (since all windows are logically visible even when occluded because their drawing is redirected to an off-screen surface), but the <code>Get&shy;Random&shy;Rgn</code> function has to keep track of the "visible region" anyway, for compatibility. </p>

		<p>Re 640k: &nbsp;Exactly&#8230;. &nbsp;I would think this is &quot;random&quot; as in <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_access" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Random_access</a> &nbsp;which is a definition not well supported by the &quot;Hacker dictionary&quot;. &nbsp;And it dates from a time when men were men and computers didn&#39;t necessarily have operating systems.</p>

		<p>From the function&#39;s point of view, the parameter value is a random selection (by the caller) from the set of values documented for the parameter.</p>
<p>&quot;Random&quot; isn&#39;t a hacker term &#8212; it is a systems analysis term, meaning that the value of a property may be anything within defined limits.</p>
<p>&quot;Arbitrary&quot; is a good synonym this usage of &quot;random&quot;.</p>

		<p>â€˜the GetÂ­RandomÂ­Rgn function has to keep track of the &quot;visible region&quot; anywayâ€™ &#8211; There isn&#39;t much â€˜to keep track ofâ€™ though.</p>
<p>Also, random is a horrible word in certain contexts, because there can be a complete ambiguity between the meaning of â€˜you can pick any value you likeâ€™ and â€˜might return any value, beyond your control or predictionâ€™. This is especially troublesome in game rules, where I&#39;ve seen it used in both senses.</p>

		<p>Not the first time that &quot;random&quot; is abused in such a way. Seeing &quot;public static final int RANDOM_PRIME = 33&quot; is quite confusing until you notice that some team members just don&#39;t get the difference between &quot;arbitrary&quot; and &quot;random&quot;.</p>

		<p>@SimonRev &#8211; haha :)</p>
<p>It&#39;s funny how odd numbers are elevated to prime automatically by some. &nbsp;I guess it ends in 3, so part of it is prime? :P</p>
<p>@Voo et al &#8211; I agree, arbitrary is a much better term. &nbsp;My sister (26yo) also uses the term &quot;random&quot; in place of &quot;stranger&quot;. &nbsp;EG: &quot;Some random person just turned up at the party&quot; which is often shortened to &quot;who&#39;s that random over there?&quot;. &nbsp; Having a maths &amp; IT degree it took me a moment to work it out :)</p>

		<p>@dave</p>
<p>I think the agony here is about this particular use of random, not that spoken languages can have multiple meanings, homonyms or words having informal meanings. The naming of this function implies something that it actually do, and it could be even worse for people who aren&#39;t native English speakers.</p>

		<p>@Dave my take on it is more that Random has a specific meaning in the domain of computer software that is related to pseudorandom number generation, and not arbitrary. &nbsp;Therefore programmers tend to get a little confused when they hear other programmers use different usages of the word.</p>
<p>By similar example, my brother is a lawyer. &nbsp;He is greatly agonized whenever anyone mixes up slander and libel. &nbsp;Most Americans will interchange the two freely, even though to a lawyer they have distinct meanings. &nbsp;If another lawyer started mixing the meanings I can see where he would be confused and frustrated.</p>

		<p>[I think you&#39;ll find in computer software circles, the word random has extended non-mathematical meanings as described in the Jargon File. &quot;The user can grab any random file.&quot; This is the word &quot;random&quot; in the sense of &quot;arbitrary&quot; rather than &quot;statistically random&quot;. -Raymond]</p>
<p>Sure, but that&#39;s a colloquial usage. I think we are generally more careful with semantics for documentation and variables. Other example: I&#39;m totally fine using &quot;GB&quot; when actually meaning &quot;GiB&quot; in a normal discussion, but if I&#39;m writing some documentation for networking code I sure as hell will make sure to either use the correct, standardized meaning &#8211; or, if it&#39;s existing, older code &#8211; to make sure it&#39;s clearly documented that yes when saying &quot;GB&quot; we actually mean 2^30 bytes.</p>

		<p>The funny thing about the way programmers use the term &quot;random&quot; is that of all the things it means (&quot;arbitrary&quot;, &quot;pseudo-random&quot;) it almost never means &quot;actually random&quot;!</p>

		<p>@Dave: It&#39;s just no fun to come across a situation where it&#39;s impossible to tell whether you should pick a card face down or face up. The problem is not the multiple meanings as such, the problem is that it has so many meanings, many of which completely opposite, and impossible to tell apart from context. The word random has almost lost its meaning, to the point where you can just blot out all its occurrences and hardly lose any information at all. But at least then you know something&#39;s missing. But when there&#39;s a word there, those six letters instruct all readers that they know what it means, even though none of them do.</p>

		<p>&quot;The word random has almost lost its meaning&quot;.</p>
<p>So the meaning of &quot;random&quot; is just random now.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
