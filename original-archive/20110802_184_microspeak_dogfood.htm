<p>Everybody knows about the Microspeak term <i>dogfood</i>. It refers to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food"> the practice of taking the product you are working on and using it in production</a>.&sup1; For the Windows team, it means installing a recent build of Windows on your own computer as well as onto <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/06/07/10171801.aspx"> a heavily-used file server</a>. For the Office team, it means using a recent build of Office for all your documents. For the Exchange team, it means moving the entire product team to a server running a recent build of Exchange. You get the idea.</p>
<p> Purists would restrict the use of the word <i>dogfood</i> to refer to a product group using its own product, but in practice <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/office2010/archive/2009/08/17/evolving-the-backstage-view.aspx"> the meaning has been generalized</a> to encompass <i>using a prerelease product in a production environment</i>. The Windows team frequently dogfoods recent builds of Office and Exchange Server. Actually, the Exchange Server case is one of double-dogfood,&sup2; for not only is the server running a prerelease version of Exchange Server, it's doing so atop a prerelease version of Windows! </p>
<p> Dogfooding does have its costs. For example, the prerelease version of Exchange Server might uncover a bug in the prerelease version of Windows. While the problem is investigated, the Windows division can't send email. These outages are comparatively rare, although they are quite frustrating when they occur. But you have to understand that the whole purpose of dogfooding is to find exactly these sorts of problems so that our customers won't! </p>
<p> <b>Footnote</b> </p>
<p> &sup1; Despite the efforts of our CIO, the term <a href="http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2009/11/turning_dog_food_into_ice_cream_and_other_tidbits_from_microsofts_cio.html"> ice-creaming</a> has not caught on. </p>
<p> &sup2; I made up the term "double-dogfood" just now. It is not part of Microspeak. </p>

		<p>&#39;ice-creaming&#39; just doesn&#39;t hold the same emotional impact as the term &#39;dogfooding&#39;. If you&#39;re serving yourself a disgusting (software) product, hopefully you&#39;ll take some action and make it more palatable. If you&#39;re already working with ice cream, you can still make some improvements, but none are necessary to be desirable.</p>

		<p>Actually I thought &quot;the whole point of dogfooding&quot; was to give you the motivation to fix the issues (because it directly affects your ability to send email, or do you job, or whatever, just as it would for your customers), rather than replacing the need for a test department &#8211; i.e. finding the issues in the first place.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>It doesn&#39;t replace testing; it supplements it. It&#39;s very hard to replicate a complex real-world environment in a test lab. &quot;Hi, we need to simulate 6 months of usage on a large network.&quot; -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Chris B: Dogfooding is a part of QA. Once a product has passed a certain level of QA, it is deemed dogfood-quality, and can then be deployed as such.</p>
<p>In server groups, sometimes we use &quot;selfhost&quot; instead.</p>

		<p>It would be triple dogfooding if the recent builds of Exchange Server were built with the most recent build of the VC++ compiler. &nbsp;Maybe it would be quadruple dogfooding if the most recent build of the VC++ compiler was built from a VC++ compiler with the same code (but compiled with the previous build of VC++ compiler).</p>

		<p>I had a friend who worked on the original Exchange server. The whole Exchange team was dogfooding their server, of course, which meant that they all lost their mailboxes whenever the message store file format changed (or the message store just got corrupted). That may or may not have been worse than using the Unix (XENIX) based system that everybody else was using at the time.</p>

		<p>@Michael: I can&#39;t speak on VS&#39;s behalf, but with GCC, that&#39;s par for the course &#8212; when making a new build of GCC, they first use an older build to build the new code (the bootstrapping), then it recompiles itself.</p>

		<p>Yes, building a VC++ compiler using a prerelease VC++ compiler (and so on) is amazing. &nbsp;Bugs in the compiler may create bugs in the compiler (they may be invisible but still present).</p>
<p>I like the term ice-creaming better than dogfooding! &nbsp;Maybe it will catch on.</p>

		<p>@Raymond @Jon,</p>
<p>Not to mention that many times you don&#39;t really think of something until you use it in the wild. I&#39;ve had the joy of testing too many pieces of software by too many companies large enough to know better that clearly built bad Market research teams. &nbsp;It wasn&#39;t until someone handed them the software and said &quot;Use this, please&quot; &nbsp;that they realized it was horrible. &nbsp;(Plus most of them were designing software they don&#39;t even use!)</p>

		<p>I doubt the word &quot;ice-creaming&quot; will go far, as the word &quot;dogfooding&quot; has been used everywhere quite some time and most developers have been used to it.</p>
<p>It&#39;s just no longer an issue related to branding&#8230;</p>
<p>As for Exchange server down for a breaking pre-release, it wouldn&#39;t be much a problem if they run 2 Echange servers and then set the dogfooding one to automatically forward a copy of every mail received to the corresponding mailboxes of backup Exchange server. When the dogfooding server dies because of buggy build, the backup server will keep mail functions up by a few networking tweak.</p>

		<p>Probably call it teabagging over at the E&amp;D division whenever they test new Xbox builds. After all, a screwup would result in one geting teabagged.</p>
<p>Then again, I wonder how the Win CE team dogfoods &#8211; it&#39;s not like they can do all their work inside WinCE. The Phone team is easy &#8211; just run it on their phones.</p>

		<p>@Adam Rosenfield: GCC goes further than that. It uses an older build to build the new code (stage1), then it recompiles itself (stage2), then it recompiles itself <em>again</em> (stage3), and compares the last two builds. They should be identical except for things like timestamps on a few binary formats, else there is a bug somewhere.</p>

		<p>I just can&#39;t take the term &quot;ice-creaming&quot; seriously. If I heard someone saying they were &quot;ice-creaming&quot; Windows I&#39;d have to wonder if Windows gave its consent.</p>

		<p>I recently talked about this exact topic with a friend.</p>
<p>Dogfood your own product is fun! Using your own product to help you to build the next version of that product is double fun!</p>
<p>Think about:</p>
<p>* Windows division guys who use Windows to develop the next version of Windows&#8230;</p>
<p>* Visual Studio guys from DevDiv who develop the next version of Visual Studio using Visual Studio&#8230;</p>
<p>* Office guys who write specs about next version of Office using Office&#8230;</p>
<p>* TFS guys who stores their next release source code in TFS&#8230;</p>
<p>* Compiler guys who builds the next complier using the current one&#8230;</p>
<p>Etc. etc&#8230;.</p>

		<p>There is also a term &quot;puppyfood&quot; (maybe specific to Office?) which I guess means &quot;A release candidate for dogfood&quot;.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
