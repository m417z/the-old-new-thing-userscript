<p>One evening, I had a series of three dreams. In each one, I visited an unusual home.</p>
<p> In the second dream, I visited the home of a friend of mine. She lived in a modern luxury apartment inside an art museum. It was a little tricky, because you could visit her only during museum hours. If you stayed past closing time, then you were locked inside the museum, and you were spending the night whether you liked it or not. </p>
<p> On the other hand, it meant that you could go out an view the art to your heart's content without any crowds. </p>
<p> And no, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000R56RD2/?tag=tholneth-20"> the museum did not come to life</a>. You just got free run of a museum for the night. </p>

		<p>Here in NJ, we have the Bickford Theater, which is on the Morris (county) Museum.</p>
<p>In the evening, the theater is used by local community theater groups.</p>
<p>Which means, during intermission, you can wander through the empty museum.</p>

		<p>@just karl, if you are getting emails &quot;from this blog&quot; then I suggest you look for an unsubscribe link on the email. </p>
<p>Probably it is some third-party RSS reader service you subscribed to many moons ago.</p>

		<p>On the opposite side, a friend of mine swore that his kindergarten spanned over almost all the condos in a four or six-story building; only on the last floor there was a &quot;normal&quot; house where lived some man, who they often saw bringing up the groceries at home.</p>
<p>(it must be said that this my friend is known for his not-so-believable stories)</p>

		<p>Last night I dreamed that I was called back to middle school for an assembly. I think it was a motivational speaker. I was there with my best friend from eighth grade, and I remarked about how we&#39;re probably older than some of our teachers were when we were in that grade.</p>

		<p>In Norway, in the zoo of the city of Kristiansand, you can live be living in the zoo, if you like. At least if you are loaded with money &#8211; you pay per night, about as much as for a medium-priced hotel room.</p>
<p>The zoo is not a pure zoo; it has some entertainment park elements. An example of the latter is a complete reconstruction of a fantasy village in one of Norway&#39;s most popular children&#39;s books through all ages, &quot;Cardamom town&quot; by Torbj√∏rn Egner. After the zoo closes its gates at night, overnight guests can stay in this fantasy model town, and walk around watching the zoo animals at night. (Special guided night tours are arranged, for those who find it too scary to walk alone.) </p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
