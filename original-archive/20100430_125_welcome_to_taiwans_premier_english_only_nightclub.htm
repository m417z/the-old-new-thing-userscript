<p>One of my friends is fluent in both Mandarin and English. When she lived in Taiwan, she paid a visit to a nightclub whose gimmick was that you had to speak English. The target audience was not foreigners but rather native Taiwanese who learned English as a second language. My friend didn't have any problems with this rule, but many of the guests appeared to be struggling to conform.</p>
<p> My friend paid a visit to the ladies' room, and there she overheard a conversation between two other guests. (They were speaking in Mandarin. Apparently, the rules aren't enforced in the bathroom.) </p>
<p> "There's this cute guy out on the dance floor, but I don't know what to say to him. My English is not very good." </p>
<p> My friend told her, "That's okay. His English isn't very good either." </p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve always wondered whether there were niche groups in Asia that are obsessed with Western culture as some Americans are with Japanese anime and such.</p>

		<p>In Japan it&#8217;s a lot more than a niche. If you get a chance, read &quot;Dave Barry Does Japan.&quot; It&#8217;s a humor travelogue which also covers the weird blend that arose from native Japanese culture and the near idolization of the U.S. after WWII. Manifests in business practices, the music scene, and in randomly putting (often meaningless or non-sequitur) English words and characters on clothing.</p>

		<p>Various Asian countries have &quot;English Villages&quot;, though the fad may be waning.</p>

		<p>There are few things I dislike as much as Swedes speking english with other Swedes for no reason.</p>
<p>Here in Sweden a lot of the universities are trying to get more international students in their master programs and are holding more and more courses in english. The result is Swedish teachers speaking english with Swedish students, resulting in a worse education.</p>

		<p>Hm, I wonder which club? &nbsp;There is a restaurant/club in Taipei that caters to white male expats, if you get my drift. &nbsp;The most popular clubs do not have an English requirement as far as I know, but you will usually find a large percentage of clubgoers speaking English due to the party lifestyle of ABC&#8217;s.</p>

		<p>Was the guy on the dance floor so stunning that there could be no mistake, or did your friend just think it safe to generalize from what she heard around her?</p>

		<p>@Lucas: It&#8217;s not difficult to understand for the Japanese part, and it&#8217;s not just about anime. Taiwan has inherited a lot of traditions (The education structure, just to name one).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
