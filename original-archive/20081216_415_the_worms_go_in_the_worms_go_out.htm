		<p>Does everyone hate ABBA or what? Seriously, what&#8217;s wrong with them and their songs? I see this disdain on multiple blogs I follow. Why?</p>

		<p>You&#8217;re right&#8230; they&#8217;re better than Devo&#8230;.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the style of the music, it&#8217;s infectuous and popy. I grew up on ABBA. I like ABBA. And I&#8217;m still kicking myself for not seeing Mamma Mia! when it came to town. So not everyone hates them. But people usually fall into one categories &#8211; love &#8217;em or hate &#8217;em.</p>

		<p>That Boston Globe article is dangerous. &nbsp;Don&#8217;t start to read it, unless you are prepared to let the mental jukebox let rip with an Abba number or two (on endless repeat) for the rest of the day&#8230;</p>

		<p>From the article:</p>
<p>Sweden&#8217;s fab four (or shall we say &quot;fabelns fyra&quot;?)</p>
<p>If you do, you are saying literally &quot;the fable&#8217;s four&quot;.</p>
<p>How could they possibly arrive at that bizarre translation..?</p>

		<p>BOFH: don&#8217;t speak Swedish, but it might be understood as &quot;the four of fable&quot;?</p>

		<p>@BOFH: Yup, it kind of makes the article a bit surreal. I guess they used an automatic translation tool or something.</p>
<p>The intended meaning of &#8216;fab four&#8217; really must be fabulous four which in Swedish would be something like &#8216;sagolika fyra&#8217;, which in wording is related (saga &gt;= fabel) but in meaning quite different.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s not a hate / love thing. They&#8217;re just totally uninteresting, like eg Britney. In one ear, out the other. Just silly bimbo music, forgotten in half a second&#8230;</p>

<p>&quot;For some reason, people who worry a lot are more earworm-prone than non-worriers.&quot;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
