<p> I'm not really interested in sports. Teams, standings, scores, who got traded to what team, none of that is interesting to me. What I am interested in, however, is "meta-sports": The business of sports, the technology of sports, the evolution of techniques, changes in the rules, that sort of thing. That's one of the reasons I'm a fan of the radio program <a href="http://www.onlyagame.org/">Only a Game</a>. (The other, more important, reason can be summed up in two words: <a href="http://www.onlyagame.org/about/staff/charliepierce.asp"> Charlie Pierce</a>.) </p>
<p> All that is a rather lengthy lead-in to <a href="http://www.corante.com/transition/"> Transition Game</a>, Nick Schulz's look at the world behind sports. He covers what it is about sports that I like, with none of the stuff I don't like. (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/03/31/404109.aspx">I've linked to him before</a>, but I like him so much I'm going to do it again.)

		<p>Can anyone tell me why designing a robotic camel jockey would save camel racing?</p>

		<p>tt: the problem they were having was that they could no longer use children as jockeys. The reason children were used in the first place was because they don&#8217;t weigh much. This is, for example, why horse jockeys in the U.S. are usually very small people. The less for the animal to carry, the more energy they can put into moving quickly.</p>
<p>So, the robotic jockeys help because if you can design one that weighed less than an 18 year old (the new minimum age for a jockey), your camel could move faster, carrying less weight, than the competition&#8217;s.</p>

		<p>Not only that, but the children they were using were paid for and bought from poorer neighboring countries&#8211; basically slave labor.</p>
<p>Wired has a great article about the issue:<br />

		<p>Maybe someone can explain leg shaving to me then.</p>
<p>I would swear it&#8217;s for tradition and not much else. I hear people mention tarmac rash, and easier massaging, etc&#8230; but honestly&#8230; it&#8217;s just for the looks isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>(Just ordered a full Campagnolo Record groupset and eagerly awaiting delivery&#8230; maybe I should shave my legs in the meantime)</p>

		<p>I always assumed the leg shaving was for aerodynamic reasons.</p>

		<p>Road rash and massage are two valid reasons for the leg shaving.  Try pulling medical tape off a hairy leg, or see what a mess massage oil makes on that unshaven limb.  Aero benefits?  Not really.</p>
<p>But I hope not to crash very often, and as an amateur I&#8217;m not getting massages on a daily basis.  So for the vast majority of racers out there, they (including myself, sheep that I am) shave because&#8230;everybody else does.  I refer you to the article on air conditioning that Raymond posted, specifically &quot;tradition&quot;.</p>

		<p>Leg shaving has to do with FEELING fast more than anything.  I think you feel cooler, too.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
