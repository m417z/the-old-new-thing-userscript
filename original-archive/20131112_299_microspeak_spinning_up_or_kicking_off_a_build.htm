<p>
Remember, Microspeak is not merely for jargon exclusive to Microsoft.
It's jargon you can employ to sound more like an insider.
</p>
<p>
Most of the time,
a fresh build of Windows is produced
<a HREF="http://www.stevemcconnell.com/ieeesoftware/bp04.htm">
every day</a>.
When the product is nearing a release,
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/08/20/10442834.aspx">
train service gradually declines</a>,
with faraway branches losing service first.
Eventually, the train stops running altogether,
and the release branch remains stable for extended periods,
not accepting any <i>payload</i>.
This allows the test team to run their supersized test suites,
the ones that take days to complete.
(Known in the jargon as a
<i>Full Test Pass</i>, or <i>FTP</i>.
Sadly, this is easily confused with the File Transfer Protocol,
also called FTP.)
</p>
<p>
Of course, the Full Test Pass may discover some problems,
and if one of them is considered serious enough,
a fix is applied to the release branch,
and then a new build
<i>spins up</i>.
</p>
<p>
The metaphor here is that the computers that produce the build
have been sitting
idle for so long that the imaginary turbines have stopped spinning.
To build another release,
<a HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sBe3QzVW5_8">
the turbines need to get up to speed</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Microspeak phrase <i>spin up a build</i> applies more generally
to the concept of
<i>producing a one-time build from a branch that has not had a build in a long time</i>.
The branch may not have had a build because it has stopped accepting changes,
like our release branch in the example above.
Or it may not have had a build because it has intentionally been abandoned.
</p>
<p>
An example of the latter case is
a special branch for experimental work that will never go
into any official release.
The build lab may be under instructions not to produce a build from this branch
because the developers working in the branch can just rebuild the components
they are experimenting with.
Or because the branch is in a constant state of flux,
so trying to produce a build will usually result in chaos.
Or because the opportunity cost of producing a build out of this branch
is denying a build to another branch
due to limited hardware resources,
and the people in the experimental branch are willing to take on some
of the work themselves in order to free up resources for the other team.
</p>
<p>
If for some reason, the experimental branch would like the build lab to
produce a build,
they can ask the build lab to
<i>spin up a build</i> for the experimental branch.
(Presumably with a phrase like
"when you get the chance" so that the build team can <i>kick off</i> the build at a time
when demands for build machinery are low,
like in the early afternoon.)
</p>
<p>
<i>Kicking off a build</i> is the jargon term for
starting a build,
presumably inspired by the <i>kick-off</i> which starts many sporting events.</p>
<p>Most regularly-scheduled builds occur overnight,
and you might ask,
"When does our build kick off?"
This means
"What time does the build lab start building our branch?"
You would ask this if, for example,
you want to know how much time you have left to get your fix signed off
if you want the fix to go into tonight's build.
If the build kicks off at 5pm,
you might say,
"There's no way I can get it done by then."
But if it kicks off at 7pm, you might say,
"Maybe I can convince my testers to drop what they're doing and test this fix,
and then I can address the problems they find and get the
fix signed off by 5pm.
That leaves two hours for the change to
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd787631.aspx">
make it through the gated check-in queue</a>."
(When a check-in successfully exits the gated check-in queue,
it is said to have
<i>cleared the queue</i>.)
</p>
<p>
Even if the build normally kicks off at 5pm,
you can ask your branch manager,
"Can you delay kicking off the build until 7pm?
I have an important fix that we really would like to get into tonight's build,
and there's no way it'll be ready by 5pm, but I think I can make it by 7pm."
Of course,
every hour you delay kicking off the build
is an hour later the build becomes available in the morning,
so
the branch manager needs to balance
the cost of delaying the release of the build
with the benefit of picking up this fix.
</p>
<p>
That's a lot of build-related jargon for one day,
but these are terms you need to know (because you will hear others use them),
and if you dare, you can employ them yourself to sound more hip and with-it.</p>

		<p><!-- p>When you say, "the kick-off which starts may sporting events", presumably you mean "many" sporting events, and not the sporting events in the month of May.


<p>The wonderful thing about computers is that they can usually go from sitting idly for months or years to working in mere moments with no maintenance required. Just try that with an old piece of machinery.</p>

		<p>Given that you&#39;re talking about builds&#8230;</p>
<p>Some eight or nine years ago, when I was fascinated by the history of Windows and researched much of it on the Internet, I was very frustrated that I couldn&#39;t find an exact definition for the terms &quot;build&quot; and &quot;build number&quot;. Instead, everybody assumed they were already known and I had to guess their meaning from the context. Another thing that was missing from the Internet was the complete system of Windows build numbering, with all the idiosyncracies that have accumulated over time&#8230;</p>

		<p>I assumed everybody &quot;kicks off&quot; a build. As for &quot;spinning up&quot;, we use that for anything where there is some non-trivial initialization period. For example, we would &quot;spin up a new VM&quot; because there&#39;s some process involved in it.</p>

		<p>In the chip design world we kick off regressions.</p>
<p>Given today&#39;s design sizes, a regression may easily take up to a week, even on a multi-thousand node compute farm. Typically, it takes a day or two.</p>
<p>Quite a bit of planning can go into determining which build version gets into the regression given those sizes.</p>

		<p>Now I think again and thought VM doesn&#39;t make it either.</p>
<p>In my last company, we have a client site that involves hardware SSO with IBM Websphere MQ.</p>
<p>Even we resisted the pain to reduce the test suite to 2 VMs, every time we need to start it again from shutdown state to &quot;functional&quot; one would take experienced staff 2 days to reconfigure them. (The tricky part in this setup is that some of the components have circular library dependency hell on loading order, so the startup step involves loading a lower version one first to satisfy one component, then overwrite it with another version and start another component, then overwrite it back or the system will go defunct when the deamon forks. Unfortunately bash script is not possible because some component requires user input when it starts and they don&#39;t accept inputs from pipes)</p>
<p>That&#39;s what I&#39;d call &quot;enterprisey&quot;.</p>

		<p>So everytime you want to test some code your have to wait until the next day? Or is this just for the testers?</p>

		<p>@Neil: I think the difference is building on a single workstation vs a multi-node compute farm</p>
<p>@Clipboarder: Individual developers probably do test their own changes locally&#8230; but at some point that code has to be pushed up the source tree towards the trunk. And you want a fully-clean build and install to regression test your changes and it&#39;s coexistence with everyone else&#39;s changes in the branch.</p>

		<p>@savedijon: &nbsp;I&#39;m also in microprocessor design. &nbsp;While it would take a while to run a full regression suite, that isn&#39;t quite what is being referred to. &nbsp;This is more like the smoke test that is run (for us at least) on each build before it would go into any further regression. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Just curious, what is the process (there at MS) for the gated checkins?</p>
<p>Most cases I&#39;ve seen simply require unit tests to pass. I do know that you have several review processes in place (code quality, security, etc), but I hadn&#39;t heard anything about that process being embedded within the TFS (gated) checkins.</p>
<p>I welcome your thoughts :)</p>
<p>Thanks,</p>

At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
