<p> After five years, the contents of abandoned safe deposit boxes are turned over to the state, which attempts to contact the owners, but if the owners cannot be located after three years, <a href="http://www.murphyauctions.net/safedeposit08dec.html"> they are put up for auction</a>. Things like <a href="http://www.murphyauctions.net/images/safedeposit-day1/2.jpg"> this antique watch with a Swedish dedication</a>: "Till min k&auml;ra syster Nanny fr. Elin &mdash; Mors klocka" = "To my dear sister Nanny, from Elin &mdash; Mom's watch". It's sad that something with such obvious sentimental value is being sold off. </p>
<p> Or, if you are more of the nerdy type, you could bid on <a href="http://www.murphyauctions.net/images/safedeposit-day1/1531.jpg"> Star Trek <strike>comic books</strike> graphic novels</a> or a <a href="http://www.murphyauctions.net/images/safedeposit-day1/1641.jpg"> Michael Jordan rookie trading card</a>. </p>

		<p>Just did a search on the Washington unclaimed properties site for &quot;Microsoft&quot; and it came up with 6 unclaimed items.</p>
<p>Also checked my own states page (PA) and found some money owed for three family members</p>

		<p>I think it would be more interesting if they auctioned off the contents of the boxes prior to opening them. &nbsp;Everyone likes a surprise!</p>

		<p>The auction includes &quot;Paper currency including Federal Reserve Notes &amp; Silver Certificates.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m surprised it&#8217;s worth it to auction paper money, especially if it was kept as currency rather than as a collector&#8217;s item. &nbsp;(I mean, this is a safe-deposit box, after all.) &nbsp;Do you really get more than face value for it in the end?</p>
<p>Yeah, there&#8217;s a collector&#8217;s premium for paper money, but it isn&#8217;t that much (silver certificates aren&#8217;t redeemable in silver anymore). &nbsp;You&#8217;ve got that 10% buyer&#8217;s premium, then the seller&#8217;s premium, then the amount the buyer shades his bid (could be substantial for dealers, who have to sell it onwards).</p>

		<p>John, if you like surprises, plenty of regular auctions do sell the &quot;mystery&quot; box/chest/trunk.. (During preview, you can usually inspect the contents, provided the container can be opened..) And seems there are some mystery locked boxes in this auction too. Look at lot 1480 for example.</p>
<p>But, 15% buyers premium for web buyers ? Wow.. And the place doesn&#8217;t accept paypal or other web payment ? Stone age, my friend. Stone age. I&#8217;m sure somewhere like e-bay would be happy to help them out, but that might hike the buyers premium to 20% or more.</p>
<p>Wonder what&#8217;s really on the video here <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.murphyauctions.net/images/safedeposit-day1/1440.jpg" rel="nofollow">http://www.murphyauctions.net/images/safedeposit-day1/1440.jpg</a> ? I doubt someone would keep that video in the safe deposit unless they&#8217;d taped over it with something more worthy of protecting.. Or more incriminating.. It&#8217;s the Zapruder film of the 80s ?</p>

		<p>(Dumb side question: What&#8217;s the MSDN.com auto-policy on links in a comment ? When I pulled one link to the auction, my post went through, but with two links, it wouldn&#8217;t post, and I got no error msg.. Assuming I haven&#8217;t triple or more posted..)</p>

<p>I&#8217;m guessing this is the heuristic spam detector misfiring.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
