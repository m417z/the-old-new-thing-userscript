That technique still works in Windows 7&nbsp;and&nbsp;8, but there's an easier shortcut that takes advantage of window arrangement features added in Windows&nbsp;7.</p>
<p> First, you switch to the application by whatever means. Then hit <kbd>Win</kbd>+<kbd>UpArrow</kbd> to maximize the window. That should put the window on-screen, albeit at the wrong size. Now you just grab the title bar of the window with the mouse and drag it off the top edge of the screen. Bingo, the window returns to its original position, and you can use the mouse to put it wherever you like. </p>
<p> This trick doesn't work for windows that cannot be resized (such as <i>Calculator</i>), but for those windows, you can use <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/05/11/9601136.aspx"> the old version of the trick</a>. </p>

		<p>Would Win+Shift+left/right arrow work to get non-resizable windows back? I haven&#39;t encountered this issue in a long time and the move command (thankfully) does not allow you to move a program off the screen and keep it there.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve always been curious why it&#39;s necessary to press an arrow key to enter move mode. Once I&#39;ve pressed M to declare my intent to move the window, it seems odd that I can then move the cursor arround with the mouse and it&#39;s the four-pointed move arrow, but the window isn&#39;t anchored to it.</p>
<p>Is it because I declared my intent to move with the keyboard, so it wants everything to stay keyboard-centric? Perhaps there&#39;s some usability or programmatic side-effect-prevention reason that I&#39;m overlooking.</p>

		<p>While playing with this I just noticed a cheshire cat bug in Windows 7. &nbsp;If you use ALT+SPACE M LEFT to move a window off the left side of the screen it leaves its shadow behind at the edge of the screen. &nbsp;The window isn&#39;t constrained to the desktop; if you use the arrows to move it up or down the rogue shadow remains stationary.</p>

		<p>@Brian G: &quot;I&#39;ve always been curious why it&#39;s necessary to press an arrow key to enter move mode. &#8230; Is it because I declared my intent to move with the keyboard, so it wants everything to stay keyboard-centric?&quot;</p>
<p>The same thing happens if you right click on a window on the taskbar and choose move from there. (Depending on your Windows 7 settings you may have to hover over the taskbar entry, wait until you get the window thumbnails, then right click on one of those.) So it&#39;s not a &quot;you started to do this with the keyboard&quot; thing.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t know the positive answer, however. :-)</p>

<p>Then you can&#39;t get to the pin menu in the first place. Do I have to write a custom shell just to prove a point (GetSystemMenu works just fine cross-process).</p>
<p>@Brian G. That&#39;s an excellent example of -100 points. If you are using the mouse, then why are you selecting the menu to move the window? The title bar move works so well.</p>

		<p>i have had the problem with tools windows popping up on the other monitor (my tv, usually off, or not displaying the pc), the old trick wouldn&#39;t work, and the new trick wouldn&#39;t work either since they are tool windows, they won&#39;t maximize.</p>
<p>Other multimon unaware programs like mumble, that occasionally start on the wrong monitor, or pop up something on the monitor, i have had good luck accessing the system move menu from the win7 taskbar popup view of the window, even if it only displays a titlebar because it cant find the window content!</p>

		<p>@Joshua</p>
<p>Mine. If you have a VB6 application with modal windows, you can minimize the window, but it doesn&#39;t minimize all other windows. If you do it manually, then you cannot restore the window anymore. If you hide them you get other problems. So what else can you to then to move it to -32000 pixels?</p>

		<p>[ Why does Windows allow a window to be completely outside of the visible workspace area? ]</p>
<p>Just an example: IIRC VB.NET w/ Windows Forms does not give you a simple way to create an invisible form (i.e. a form that is invisible from the start), so often people give it a default location way offscreen to hide it as soon as possible. Granted, there&#39;s a way to achieve the desired result without this trick, but it&#39;s far from obvious (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12393715/how-to-have-an-invisible-start-up-form" rel="nofollow">stackoverflow.com/&#8230;/how-to-have-an-invisible-start-up-form</a>).</p>

		<p>Another approach for top-level windows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Start Task Manager. (Elevate it if the window you want to find is elevated.)</li>
<li>
<p>On the Applications tab, choose the desired application.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Switch to another tab, then back to the Applications tab.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Choose your desired option from the Window menu.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I don&#39;t know why Task Manager doesn&#39;t like tiling just the one application.</p>

<p>@Danny thank goodness you posted your opinion on Windows 8 on this only tangentially related blog post. It was touch and go there for a bit- we almost had to go without knowing your feelings on it.</p>

		<p>Odd that the Win+Up Arrow hot key would be tied to the snap feature (which I do have disabled, BTW) &nbsp;That seems like it would be of general use as well.</p>

		<p>How do you get a modeless dialog back on screen using the keyboard (since Alt+F6 no longer works)?</p>

		<p>The Windows Snap Feature (specifically the keyboard shortcuts) is Windows 7&#39;s #2 killer feature in my book. #1 is the ability to reorder Taskbar Items, it enables my OCD tendencies.</p>
<p>I&#39;m surprised no one linked Raymond&#39;s older post on how to emulate the feature in previous versions of Windows, although like he mentions there&#39;s no super cool keyboard shortcut (which makes the whole deal work in my opinion). <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/07/28/9850416.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/9850416.aspx</a></p>

<p>Mine too, although I wish they had gone further and given us the ability to reorder items in a group as well, so I didn&#39;t have to use a third party program for it.</p>

		<p>@John: Thankfully at least *someone* was able to put in the time to implement it, although I would of course have preferred it to be included in the OS itself.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
