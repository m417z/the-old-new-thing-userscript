		<p>&quot;Some people would argue that there&#8217;s no such thing as a good pun.&quot;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s all in how you look at it. &nbsp;&quot;Bad puns&quot; and &quot;Puns too weak to be good&quot; use different meanings of &quot;bad&quot;, but between the two of them they include all puns.</p>

		<p>My favorite part about the articles is the City Manager saying &quot;We&#8217;ve heard of issues and we&#8217;ve had undercover investigations, police surveillance, and it resulted in nothing&quot;.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure it didn&#8217;t take much work to get the police to run operations there :)</p>

		<p>Down here in Chile, the &quot;coffe shops with legs&quot; as we call them have existed by decades now. They are the obligatory stop after lunch hour for workers in downtown Santiago (of course, you can have only so many expressos in one day; most of the &quot;habitu&#233;s&quot; drink tea or juice.)</p>

		<p>Oh boy. &nbsp;Back in 1993 or so, here in Sarasota, Florida not to far from Siesta Key we had a drive through drink station of sorts where scantily clad ladies would fulfill drink orders (alcoholic and otherwise&#8230;hoe that was possible I&#8217;m still not sure). &nbsp;It was directly off a very busy intersection and consequently caused a lot of accidents because male drivers were not paying attention to the road. &nbsp;Out of curiosity I drove through that kiosk once for a Dr. Pepper. &nbsp;Needless to say up close these women were nothing to really gawk over. &nbsp;What we perceive at a distance is rarely what we get up close. &nbsp;Eventually the city had this place closed down due to the accident factor.</p>

		<p>How come StartRunwordpad runs Wordpad but typing wordpad on a commandline won&#39;t? Is the Run dialog hard-wired to look in the right path for wordpad, or is it using a completely different mechanism for resolving commands? I know it must be doing *something* different, since typing a path will open that path, where on the command line you actually have to invoke &quot;explorer \mypath&quot;.</p>
<p>I imagine there&#39;s a good chance you&#39;ve posted about this, but google is useless on the subject, turning up mainly annoying tutorials and &quot;webcasts&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Memsom &#8211; exactly my thoughts. For some reason I couldn&#8217;t help but also think of Monty Python.</p>

		<p>Wouldn&#8217;t they feel really cold here in the NW? Brrrrr.</p>
<p>Reminds me of that sushi place where people would eat off naked women wrapped in plastic.</p>
<p>Both sound a bit like being sexist places (in the sense that guys probably couldn&#8217;t work there with equal opportunity and the other one too).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
