		<p>When my bank says they&#8217;ll get back to me within 5 days, they really mean 7 or more days. Since weekend days don&#8217;t count, they could advertize this as a &quot;0-day sale&quot; because it happens between Friday and Monday exclusive.</p>

		<p>Somewhat related that bugs me is when stores especially clothing stores have items on &quot;Sale&quot; that are never not on Sale. They will put a price with a really high number say $80 and mark it down 50% sale. but no matter when you view the item its always on sale from day one until they stop selling it. To me thats not a sale thats the regular price.</p>

		<p>Happy hours are notorious. 6-8pm is actually fairly short in my experience. In NYC, I frequently see happy hours from 4-7pm, 5-9pm, or any other random number of hours. I&#8217;m pretty sure I&#8217;ve seen a six hour long happy hour once.</p>

		<p>The happy hour thing is because of time dilation.</p>
<p>Most people experience time passing faster when happy/active and slower when sad/bored.</p>
<p>Thus, to make a happy hour actually last an hour to the person experiencing it, as advertised, it needs to use up more than an hour from the reference of the unhappy people (i.e. everyone else).</p>
<p>The &quot;6-8pm&quot; is just a guide telling you that you will leave the unhappy people at 6pm and return to them at what is, to them, 8pm. Since most of the world is unhappy &#8212; i.e. not participating in the happy hour &#8212; it makes sense to let them keep their time as the reference point.</p>
<p>Of course, many have tried to explain their one hour lateness the morning after a happy hour but few have succeeded. You&#8217;d have to convince an awful lot of people to set their clocks back an hour, using an argument about relativity which few would understand. If you succeeded it&#8217;d make programming date/time stuff even more difficult, and nobody wants that.</p>

		<p>The largest value of one I&#8217;ve seen so far is seven. The building 41 cafeteria has a sign listing the customer service principles of the food service vendor that runs the cafeteria. &quot;We put safety first&quot; is number seven on the list.</p>

		<p>Maybe the store is open for 12 hours each day. 8 AM to 8 PM = 12 hours on each *calendar* day. 2 12 hour periods = 1 *chronological* day.</p>

		<p>&#8212;-&quot;but no matter when you view the item its always on sale from day one until they stop&quot;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>In the UK that&#8217;s officially illegal. The goods have had to be on display at the higher price for a certain number of days. Of course the shops only put one example on display, in some obscure corner.</p>

		<p>@Clovis: &quot;Explain DFS then. Who&#8217;s ever managed to buy a sofa at full price from them?&quot;</p>
<p>They rotate what&#8217;s on sale and what isn&#8217;t. &nbsp;Basically, every three months a different 25% of their stock is on sale. &nbsp;The DFS Sale is continuously on, but never covers their entire stock.</p>

<p>Last time I looked in DFS it was more like 75% on sale and 25% at the rip-off price.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
