<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/">Jensen Harris</a>'s brief example of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/jensenh/archive/2005/10/14/481042.aspx"> using Excel's random number generator</a> reminded me that I had need for the random number generator recently myself: Generating <a href="http://isd.usc.edu/~karl/Bingo/"> buzzword bingo</a> cards. </p>
<p> At the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/25/473724.aspx"> Battlestar Galactica party</a>, our hosts needed to create some Battlestar Galactica-themed buzzword bingo cards and asked me to help out. Here's how I did it: </p>
<ol>
<li>Build a list of words and phrases in column A. </li>
<li>In column B, next to each word or phrase, enter "=rand()".     You can use Jensen's "block entry" trick. </li>
<li>Build your bingo card elsewhere on the sheet. </li>
<li>In the upper left square of the bingo card, enter "=A1";     in the next square, "=A2", and so on. </li>
<li>Highlight cell B1. </li>
<li>Click the "Sort ascending" button on the toolbar. </li>
<li>Print your bingo card. </li>
<li>Repeat steps 6&nbsp;and&nbsp;7 until satisfied. </li>
</ol>
<p> It's not beautiful, but it gets the job done. </p>

		<p>I use Excel for the otherwise tedious job of pasting static initialization data into C/C++/C# programs.</p>
<p>Copy the data into a column (or columns) in Excel.  In an adjacent column, create an expression that adds quotes, curly brackets, commas, etc. to the first data item.</p>
<p>Duplicate the expression down its column and copy the resulting data into the C program.</p>

		<p>I wrote a little program to stream STDIN/STDOUT to and from the clipboard.  I can then highlight a block of variables or code, copy to the clipboard, alt-tab to a CMD shell and type like:</p>
<p>clipboard -o | awk &quot;{ print &quot;{&quot; $3 &quot;,&quot; $5 &quot;},&quot; }&quot; | clipboard -i</p>
<p>Or whatever.  sort, awk, sed, grep, uniq, perl all come in handy here.</p>
<p>I never though of using excel though.  Interesting idea.<br /></p>

		<p>&quot;Canned&quot; random number generators are dangerous things.   Keno games at a casino (if I recall, in Montreal, Quebec) have been broken because the programmers were lazy, and used the random function supplied with the program.</p>
<p>There was a really good pseudo-random-number generator discussion and code in the April or May 1989 issue of Byte. </p>
<p>It was random enough so that there were duplicate numbers created in the sequence, but pseudo enough so that with the same seeds, the same sequence was produced.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
