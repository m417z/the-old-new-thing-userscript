<p>Some time ago, <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/gray_knowlton/"> Gray Knowlton</a> wrote an article on <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/b/gray_knowlton/archive/2010/09/22/how-to-present-to-an-executive.aspx"> how to present to an executive</a>.</p>
<p> As you might have guessed, I've done it <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/07/8464281.aspx"> completely the wrong way</a>. </p>
<p> Many years ago, I was part of a group presenting to a senior-level executive. I was the one who wrote the document establishing the background for the topic and laying out the various options with their pros and cons. I wasn't the one doing the actual presenting, but I was asked to attend anyway, just in case the senior executive had a question that the presenters couldn't answer. </p>
<p> For the duration of the meeting, I sat in the back and knitted. </p>
<p> As it turns out, I wasn't needed. But at least I got some knitting done. </p>
<p> (I was commended for the quality of the document I had written, so don't think I was just blowing off the issue entirely.) </p>

		<p>Hmm&#8230;i see no problem here, as you weren&#39;t main part of the presentation. But! Would you have been able to stop knitting and answer a question, if some questions were arising?</p>

		<p>Chriso: I am convinced that Raymond would have been able to answer the question without even a single pause in the knitting.</p>

		<p>In order to keep the executives from getting bored, did you go through the presentation and delete every third paragraph?</p>

		<p>Like James Garfield, Raymond can write with both hands, simultaneously, in different scripts.</p>
<p>(I think we need to start a Raymond Chen Facts site a la Chuck Norris Facts and Bruce Schneier Facts.)</p>

		<p>If I were in the position of backup supporter during such presentation, I would have been busy typing on my laptop (whether doing this related to presentation or not is up to others to guess&#8230; :P ).</p>
<p>I would, however, agree that knitting (or any other things obviously not related to the meeting by the others) is a bit over&#8230;</p>

		<p>Once of my colleagues got reprimanded for knitting in a meeting.</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I once sat through an hour-long all-hands meeting with my back to the Big Boss typing energetically on a desktop keyboard. &nbsp;Other attendees mentioned that the clacking of the keys was a nice distraction during pauses.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  I would, however, agree that knitting (or any other things obviously not</p>

<p>Naah, gutting a fish is a bit over. &nbsp;Knitting is just fine.</p>

		<p>Personally I think knitting would be a whole lot less disturbing than actually working on a laptop. The keys clicking, most certainly the fan kicking in after some time,.. not that quiet.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
