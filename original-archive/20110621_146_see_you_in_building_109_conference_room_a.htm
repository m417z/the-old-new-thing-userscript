		<p>I worked in 109 for the last three years and never knew about this! I remember Azteca having some other nicknames though. You grow tired of the place if you do work in 109</p>

		<p>I think the studio buildings got renamed to something else sometime in 2009. I remember going to studio E in 2008, then in 2009 realize it wasn&#39;t called studio E anymore.</p>
<p>The studio building is where Microsoft&#39;s Entertainment and Devices division occupied. Studio E was where the Windows Embedded (WEB) team was until they got kicked out late 2010 by the Windows Phone 7 team.</p>
<p>One of the other studios has a cool hanging display, and one houses the Xbox team (until they moved). Well something Xbox related &#8211; either general Xbox, Microsoft (Game) Studios, or 343 Industries.</p>
<p>They are also the most annoying buildings for visitor parking (if you can find any &#8211; the lot is packed and if you&#39;re late, it&#39;s the multistorey carpark for you). If you do get a spot in the building, have fun as you gotta walk out through the entrance and in via the front door &#8211; the carpark entrance is inside the secure area.</p>
<p>Nice building though. But a bit of a maze since the concept of long hallways was foreign to the architect and it was easy to get lost, double-back, or go in circles. I&#39;m sure one of the Halo maps was used as inspiration.</p>

		<p>[limited parking, parking garage entrance into secure area, short confusing hallways]</p>
<p>So, just like Building 10, then.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
