<p>The process by which Windows has been localized has changed over the years.</p>
<p> Back in the days of 16-bit Windows, Windows was developed with a single target language: English. </p>
<p> Just English. </p>
<p> After Windows was complete and masters were sent off to the factory for duplication, the development team handed the source code over to the localization teams. "Hey, by the way, we shipped a new version of Windows. Go localize it, will ya?" </p>
<p> While the code that was written for the English version was careful to put localizable content in resources, there were often English-specific assumptions hard-coded into the source code. For example, it may have assumed that the text reading direction was left-to-right or assumed that a single character fit in a single byte. (Unicode hadn't been invented yet.) </p>
<p> The first assumption is not true for languages such as Hebrew and Arabic (which read right-to-left), and to a lesser degree Chinese and Japanese (which read top-to-bottom in certain contexts). The second assumption is not true for languages like Chinese, Japanese, and Korean, which use DBCS (double-byte character sets). </p>
<p> The localization teams made the necessary code changes to make Windows work in these other locales and merged them back into the master code base. The result was that there were three different versions of the <i>code</i> for Windows, commonly known as Western, Middle-East, and Far-East. If you wanted Windows to support Chinese, you had to buy the Far-East version of Windows. And since the code was different for the three versions, they had different sets of bugs, and workarounds for one version didn't always work on the others. (Patches didn't exist back then, there being no mechanism for distributing them.) </p>
<p> If you ran into a problem with a Western language, like say, German, then you were out of luck, since there was no German Windows code base; it used the same Western code base. Windows&nbsp;95 tried out a crazy idea: Translate Windows into German <i>during the development cycle</i>, to help catch these only-on-German problems while there was still time to do something about it. This, of course, created significant additional expense, since you had to have translators available throughout the product cycle instead of hiring them just once at the end. I remember catching a few translation errors during Windows&nbsp;95: A menu item <i>Sort</i> was translated as <i lang="de">Art</i> (as in "What sort of person would do this?") rather than <i lang='de"'>Sortieren</i> ("put in a prearranged order"). And a command line tool asked the user a yes/no question, promting "J/N" (<i lang="de">Ja/Nein</i>), but if you wanted to answer in the affirmative, you had to type "Y". </p>
<p> The short version of the answer to the question "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/08/17/10050774.aspx#10051007">Why can't the localizers change the code if they have to?</a>" is "Because the code already shipped. What are you going to do, recall every copy of Windows?" </p>
<p> At least in Windows&nbsp;95, the prohibition on changing code was violated if circumstances truly demanded them, but doing so was very expensive. The only one I can think of is the change to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/08/22/54679.aspx"> remove the time zone highlighting from the world map</a>. And the change was done in the least intrusive possible way: Patching four bytes in the binary to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/27/880411.aspx"> make the highlight and not-highlight colors the same</a>. You dare not do something like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/11/04/9917053.aspx"> introduce a new variable</a>; who knows what kinds of havoc could result! </p>
<p> Having all these different versions of Windows made servicing very difficult, because you had to develop and test a different patch for each code base. Over the years, the Windows team has developed techniques for identifying these potential localization problems earlier in the development cycle. For a time, Windows was "early-localized" into German and Japanese, so as to cover the Western and Far-East scenarios. Arabic was added later, expanding coverage to the Mid-East cases, and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/e7/archive/2009/07/07/engineering-windows-7-for-a-global-market.aspx"> Hindi was added in Windows&nbsp;7 to cover languages which are Unicode-only</a>. </p>
<p> Translating each internal build of Windows has its pros and cons: The advantage is that it can find issues when there is still time to make code changes to address them. The disadvantage is that code can change while you are localizing, and those code changes can invalidate the work you've done so far, or render it pointless. For example, somebody might edit a dialog you already spent time translating, forcing you to go back and re-translate it, or at least verify that the old translation still works. Somebody might take a string that you translated and start using it in a new way. Unless they let you know about the new purpose, you won't know that the translation needs to be re-evaluated and possibly revised. </p>
<p> The localization folks came up with a clever solution which gets most of the benefits while avoiding most of the drawbacks: They invented <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/michkap/archive/2011/04/11/10152035.aspx"> pseudo-localization</a>, which simulates what Michael Kaplan calls "an eager and hardworking yet na&iuml;ve intern localizer who is going to translate every single string." This was so successful that they <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/shawnste/archive/2006/06/27/647915.aspx"> hired a few more na&iuml;ve intern localizers</a>, one which performed "Mirrored pseudo-localization" (covering languages which read right-to-left) and "East Asian pseudo-localization" (covering Chinese, Japanese, and Korean). </p>
<p> But the rule prohibiting code changes remains in effect. Changing any code <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/release_team/archive/2005/08/26/456610.aspx"> resets escrow</a>, which means that the ship countdown clock gets reset back to its original value and all the testing performed up until that point needs to be redone in order to verify that the change did not affect them. </p>

		<p>@Gabe,</p>
<p>For example in English we say &quot;one hat&quot; &quot;two hats&quot; or sometimes &quot;one hat(s)&quot;. &nbsp;That doesn&#39;t work in every language. &nbsp;Especially languages that have multiple plural forms (i.e. different words for hat when talking about two hats or three hats).</p>
<p>An example in German might be that 22 is &quot;twenty two&quot; in English, but &quot;two and twenty&quot; in German. &nbsp;It is very possible that the English UI team puts something together that cannot work like that.</p>

		<p>&gt;&gt; do you mean a problem that requires a code change specific to German?</p>
<p>Raymond gave an example of something that would require a code change to fix things for German:</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>a command line tool asked the user a yes/no question, promting [sic] &quot;J/N&quot; (Ja/Nein), but if you wanted to answer in the affirmative, you had to type &quot;Y&quot;.</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>The code change wouldn&#39;t have a noticeable effect in English; however, the change wasn&#39;t German-specific (other languages might benefit).</p>
<div class="post">[<i>That didn&#39;t require a code change. The German localizers merely forgot to localize the Y to a J (probably because the Y was not clearly documented as to what it represented, so they played it safe and left it alone). -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>@SimonRev: Grammatical number formats are a pain. There are at least four grammatical forms you have to handle (&#39;one, two, many, lots&#39; as an approximation) and the exact rules for which form to use for each number is different for different languages.</p>

<p>&#8230;yes I have implemented this! Kind of. We have the framework but right now we&#39;ve only implemented the English number-&gt;form mapping.</p>

		<p>@Joshua:</p>
<p>Distributing the patches that you need is great until you find that the same patch breaks someone else&#39;s software. (They don&#39;t need the patch, so they never tested against it.) At least when patches come from MS through (say) Windows Update, the end-user will blame MS rather than you.</p>

		<p>@Raymond: &quot;Or are you suggesting that we take the Internet and send it in a time machine back to 1992?&quot;</p>
<p>What you meant to say is that the internet did exist in 1992, but that a) Windows/DOS didn&#39;t support TCP/IP, SLIP, PPP, etc directly, and b) the general population did not have access to the internet yet.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve been around long enough to remember BITNET and ARPANET. RELAY was the name of the &quot;chat&quot; program over BITNET, and was popular with us college kids back then. We distributed a lot of files back then too (of questionable educational and moral benefit).</p>

		<p>Although not actually have used them (I went on the net the first time at 1999), I think small file transfer is possible with X-modem-CRC protocol even when internet did not exist.</p>
<p>Not sure if Microsoft would have served such a big modem pool, though.</p>

		<p>Back to topic, I remember that there were lots of 3rd party patching software for Win3.1/Win9X to support Chinese. Some will even translate even menu item to (sometimes non-sense) Chinese. I wonder how did they do that at that time.</p>
<p>Also, was installing hooks not allowed for the teams doing localization works? I think it could effectively modify Windows behaviour without affecting the stability of English version of Windows. (Evade reset escrow bar) The language supplements could be sold as seperate package like &quot;Plus!&quot; at that time.</p>

		<p>&quot;A menu item Sort was translated as Art (as in &quot;What sort of person would do this?&quot;) rather than Sortieren (&quot;put in a prearranged order&quot;)&quot;</p>
<p>That reminds me of a mistranslation in Star Wars, Episode 2. Cliegg Lars there talks about how, after losing a leg, he &quot;cannot ride any more&quot; (i.e. speeder bikers etc.). In the German translation, he literally says &quot;Seit [&#8230;] kann ich kein Pferd mehr reiten&quot;, which means &quot;Since [&#8230;] I cannot ride a horse&quot;. Except that in Star Wars there are no horses at all, and the translator apparently did not know this.</p>
<p>After a while I came to the conclusion that whenever possible, I watch movies and play games in their original English version. Some translations are mediocre, some are good, but very few are really stellar and able to capture the original, and a lot are a mixed affair. For example, in the series &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, sometimes a joke is translated in a way to perfectly convey the literal meaning and a hidden joke or allusion, while other times there are conversations between the characters that make little sense until you imagine what they would have sounded in English, and after a while I got a pretty good grasp on what the original text was before a bad translation.</p>
<p>A stellar example of English-to-German localization, however, is the British series &quot;Little Britain&quot;. For the localization, they hired two (very good) German comedians who even managed to convey jokes that would only make sense for a British, like replacing names of movie actors or musicians not known outside of the UK with the names of German actors/musicians with a very similar reputation.</p>

		<p>At least some of you guys have had localised versions available to you for a while. &nbsp;It&#39;s taken Microsoft 27 years to get round to British English.</p>

		<p>@Mephane: Did they localise the title as well? ;-)</p>
<p>Obligatory rant: WFW3.11&#39;s TCP/IP sucked, based on the speed of a third party database client/server compared to either a different third party TCP/IP stack or Windows 95.</p>

		<p>Speaking of &quot;Patches didn&#39;t exist back then, there being no mechanism for distributing them&quot;, I remember when Windows Update debuted. &nbsp;Many Web sites were vehemently against the whole idea. &nbsp;I read comments like &quot;This is a horrible idea&quot;; &quot;I want to update my software, not Microsoft&quot;; &quot;Who do they think they are, trying to update MY computer&quot;; &quot;I&#39;ll decide what patches need to be applied&quot;; advice to not turn on automatic updates; and so on.</p>
<p>The whole industry has come a long way since then in making good use of automatic software updates and security patches.</p>

		<p>@Mephane: the problem is that you need to know a language quite well before watching movies (reading books) in that language is better for understanding than having a mediocre to good translator. only if you yourself know that language pretty well you have a *chance* to grok the hidden meanings. If you still struggle with it by any means watch in this language (read it) to improve that language skills but don&#39;t expect to understand everything in all layers. Most translations are in fact quite good, especially if the translator had enough time (i.e. not releasing the same day worldwide) </p>

		<p>@Wolf does the data you are looking in indicate how Y/N is handled in any of them? (Are there any of them that are large enough to have locale use cases, either on windows, in any unix OS, or in CLDR?)</p>

		<p>@David Walker: Indeed. Especially after once or twice accidents that updates breaks some computer in production after rollout.</p>
<p>The patch testing process has been much much more rigid since that, however I still know some I.T. staffs prefer to hold the updates 1 month before approving them in their WSUS servers.</p>

		<p>@Wolf: I think it&#39;s better to leave it as (Y/N) then. Just like in Chinese version, the &quot;choices&quot; are always shown as &quot;是(Y)/否(N)&quot; or &quot;確認(O)/取消(C)&quot;.</p>

		<p>I remember a small but painful bug in Win98 First Edition PL.</p>
<p>ipconfig /? listed all the /switches as usual, in English, but some (all? don&#39;t remember) of them didn&#39;t work.</p>
<p>After a while of trying to find out why &quot;ipconfig /all&quot; didn&#39;t work, I&#39;ve had a crazy idea&#8230;</p>
<p>ipconfig /wszystko</p>
<p>Worked.</p>
<p>Someone over-eagerly translated the switch (bye-bye, script compatibility), and to add insult to injury, didn&#39;t translate it in the /? listing.</p>

		<p>@Joshua: Distributing the patches that you need is great until you find that the same patch breaks someone else&#39;s software. (They don&#39;t need the patch, so they never tested against it.) At least when patches come from MS through (say) Windows Update, the end-user will blame MS rather than you.</p>
<p>When the applications which breaks is developed by MSFT, it justified. I will not namn any but atleast two *server* softwares has been totally incompatible (endless crashing) with Windows Server OS hotfixes. These problems often results in a very obvious cash loss. One would expect MSFT software to be more Windows compatible.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
