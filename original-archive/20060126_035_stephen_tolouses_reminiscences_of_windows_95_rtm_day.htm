		<p>I&#8217;m curious as well, and this is just a wild guess, but those were the heydays of DLL hell. For example, one DLL file that I remember &quot;fondly&quot; was ctl3dv2.dll.</p>
<p>Could it be that the build number of Win95 was set to 950 (i.e. high enough) to effectively disambiguate the DLLs in that system from versions of the same files in WinNT 3.1 and 3.5x?<br /></p>

		<p>Wendy, I&#8217;m guessing that &quot;stepto&quot; stems from the guy&#8217;s name: [Step]hen [To]louse.</p>
<p>Although I was amazed to learn that Sanford and Son was a cheap american knockoff. ;)</p>

		<p>Yeah it&#8217;s a combination of my name.  I&#8217;ve been with Microsoft since april of 94 and my contractor email alias was a-stepto, then became stepto when I was hired 1.95.  People started caling me stepto right about then and the name stuck.</p>
<p>I had no idea there was a technical reason for increasing the buil number so I look forward to the explanation.</p>
<p>S.</p>

<p>If it&#8217;s glare that&#8217;s the problem, the brightness and contrast of your monitor may be set incorrectly.  Try using a photographer&#8217;s test pattern to calibrate your monitor &#8211; it makes everything better, not just the extreme cases (there are plenty of test patterns for gamma and brightness/contrast to be found through Google).</p>

		<p>&quot;Technical reasons for build number being adjusted&quot;.</p>
<p>As a Windows NT user since 3.1, I simply and uncharitably assumed that the Windows 95 release engineers were trying to look cute at the expense of perverting a simple technical notion &#8212; i.e., the build number is a number that is incremented at each build.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
