<p>It has been reported that everybody's favorite mock tabloid <a href="http://newsbloggers.aol.com/2007/07/24/instapollamericanow-mourning-the-weekly-world-news/?ncid=NWS00010000000001"> <i>The Weekly World News</i> is ceasing publication</a>. Seeing as this is <i>The Weekly World News</i> we're talking about, I'm not sure <a href="http://www.mediabistro.com/fishbowlny/newspapers/weekly_world_news_killed_by_aliens_declining_circulation_63587.asp"> how much of this I'm going to believe</a>, but people seem to be taking it at face value.</p>
<p> I remember seeing a WWN article clipped out and posted on the door to a geology professor's office at XYZ college. The article's title was something like "Dinosaurs alive and well&mdash;on the moon!"* It was illustrated with a drawing of happy dinosaurs wandering around a tropical lunar paradise, and the article quoted "An XYZ geology professor" as having seen the dinosaurs through a telescope. (What's a geologist doing looking at the moon through a telescope?) This was a small college, so the professor figured he must have been the one. </p>
<p> <b>Nitpicker's corner</b> </p>
<p> *This story is from memory. I may have gotten details wrong. For example, the dinosaurs may have been on Mars, not the moon. The name of the college was probably not XYZ. </p>

		<p>We have a similar paper in the UK, and this reminds me of a story they ran some years ago, shortly after they started&#8230;</p>
<p>&quot;World War 2 Bomber Found on Moon!!&quot;</p>
<p>followed the next week by:</p>
<p>&quot;Someone&#8217;s Stolen Our World War 2 Bomber From The Moon!!&quot;</p>
<p>(following numerous astronomers saying &quot;erm, no, there isn&#8217;t a WW2 bomber on the moon at all&#8230;&quot;)</p>

		<p>Now if the &quot;real&quot; tabloids would just follow suit the world might be a better place. &nbsp;On the other hand, the idiots who buy that garbage would still be with us and someone else would step up to fill the void. &nbsp;Sigh. &nbsp;The heat death cannot come soon enough.</p>

<p>WWN is actually really entertaining. &nbsp;It&#8217;s chock full of super-short-story fiction.</p>

		<p>My favorite was the headline reporting that Heaven was full, no more room for souls. A couple of weeks later it was reported that they were wrong &#8211; there was in fact room for 28,317 (or some such absurd number) additional souls in Heaven. Either way, I figure I&#8217;m now out of luck on the Pearly Gates deal.</p>
<p>RIP WWN!</p>

		<p>I remember both the WW2 bomber on the moon and the heaven is full stories from WWN. &nbsp;The former ran an article months later asserting that aliens hid it because &quot;we knew too much.&quot; &nbsp;What about? &nbsp;Who knows.</p>
<p>My personal favorite was an article at least 18 years ago claiming that vampires were going trick-or-treating on Halloween because they were afraid of catching AIDS. &nbsp;There&#8217;s just so much wrong with the idea.</p>

		<p>Although I&#8217;ve not read WWN before, from the headlines posted here I think it is very entertaining&#8230; suitable to good laugh before work.</p>

		<p>Why wouldn&#8217;t a geologist look at the moon through a telescope? &nbsp;Or Mars? &nbsp;Would it be okay for a geologist to look at a rock through a microscope? &nbsp;The only difference is the matter of scale. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Plenty of geologists look at the pictures of rocks sent back by Mars rovers. &nbsp;It kind of begs the question of whether a microscope attached to a planetary probe is actually a telescope, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>Frankly, the whole search for life on other planets seems like entertainment to me, very very expensive entertainment, so I can&#8217;t fault WWN for wanting to get in on the act.</p>

		<p>I would pay a significant amount of money for a CD- or DVD-ROM collection of every WWN issue ever printed.</p>
<p>About fifteen years ago, they reported that a family on North Shore Drive in Vienna, Virginia, was the subject of a lawsuit by neighbors for using a goat to cut their lawn. Can you imagine?! A goat!</p>
<p>Since I happened to live on North Shore Drive, I examined the photo closely and determined the address of the house. I went to the address, which was not the same house, and asked if they owned a goat. They didn&#8217;t. I gave them the paper, and went off to call and annoy the WWN offices.</p>
<p>You have weird ideas of fun when you&#8217;re in your early twenties.</p>
<p>After spending some time on hold, I finally got through to someone who listened to my tale of going to the address and disproving their story. I was placed back on hold. After about &nbsp;half hour, the phone was picked up by someone who listened to my account once more. And that&#8217;s when they earned my eternal respect and admiration.</p>
<p>&quot;We make this stuff up,&quot; he said. &quot;Can&#8217;t you tell?&quot;</p>
<p>We proceeded to laugh for an hour or so about other stories they&#8217;d published, and things he&#8217;d read in reader mail. It was a big phone bill, but I&#8217;ve loved the WWN ever since.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
