<p>This is a trick I learned while participating in a document review meeting. Before the meeting each reviewer reads the document and adds comments. All the reviewers and the document author get together, and during the meeting, we go through each comment, discuss it, and come to a conclusion. The results are recorded at the end of the comment under headings like "DISCUSSION", "RECOMMEND", or "CONSIDER".</p>

<div> When should a developer use a Widget to solve a problem, and when should they use a Doodad? The choice is not clear. </div>
<div> &rarr; DISCUSSION: Widgets are when there is a choice between two options. Doodads are when there is a decision that can have multiple answers. </div>
<div> &rarr; RECOMMEND: Add guidance. </div>
</p>

<p> The meeting leader deftly entered the &rarr; character into the document without needing to pull down any menus. And this wasn't the big, bulky arrow you get when you do the <tt>-&gt;</tt> autocorrect. </p>
<p> The meeting leader explained, "I just hit the <kbd>TAB</kbd> key. In a comment, it enters an arrow. I discovered this by accident many years ago. I have no idea if this is a bug or a feature, but it still works!" </p>

		<p>I examined the character, and it is a plain U+0009: Character Tabulation (HT) (and, not, say, U+2192: RIGHTWARDS ARROW). Hence, for some reason, U+0009 is displayed as an arrow in comments. The same symbol is used for U+0009 when you display hidden formatting characters in the document.</p>

<p>You&#39;ve been able to reply to comments since at least Word 2003 by selecting a comment and clicking the new comment button. &nbsp;Is the Word 2013 version different in anyway?</p>

		<p>As Andreas has already said, this is not a rightwards arrow (U+2192) but is just a tab (U+0009) being displayed as one. When I need real arrows, I just type yazirusi (meaning &quot;arrow&quot;) in my Japanese IME and convert. It gives me all of the following to choose from: →⇒←⇔↑↓</p>

		<p>Daniel: I tried it your way and the Word 2013 feature does seem to produce the same end result, only now there&#39;s an actual Reply option in the comment itself, so there&#39;s no need to use New Comment again. I don&#39;t recall commenting on comments before discovering this Reply option, so I wouldn&#39;t have used that old way.</p>

<p>Comments are usually turned on with Change Tracking. Change Tracking shows (new) whitespace.</p>

		<p>This trick only works when viewing comments in ballons. The arrow won&#39;t be rendered when using the _Reviewing Pane_ or when viewing comments inline.</p>

		<p>I bet it was introduced for troubleshooting balloons, and remained there because of some manager who loves arrows for actions instead of bullet points.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
