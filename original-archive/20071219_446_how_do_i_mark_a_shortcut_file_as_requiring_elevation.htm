Specifying whether elevation is required
is typically something that is the responsibility of the program.
This is done by
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/dnlong/html/AccProtVista.asp">
adding a <code>requestedExecutionLevel</code> element to your manifest</a>.
(<a HREF="http://community.bartdesmet.net/blogs/bart/archive/2006/10/28/Windows-Vista-_2D00_-Demand-UAC-elevation-for-an-application-by-adding-a-manifest-using-mt.exe.aspx"
>Bart De Smet shows you how</a>.
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/calvin_hsia/archive/2007/04/13/add-a-manifest-to-control-your-application-vista-uac-behavior.aspx">
Calvin Hsia does the same for your Visual FoxPro programs</a>.)
But if the program you're running doesn't have such a manifest&mdash;maybe
it's an old program that you don't have
any control over&mdash;you can create a shortcut to the program and
mark the shortcut as requiring elevation.
</p>
<p>
To do this, you set the <code>SLDF_RUNAS_USER</code> flag in the
shortcut attributes.
Here's a skeleton program that sets the flag on the shortcut
whose path is passed on the command line.
For expository purposes, I've skimped on the error reporting,
and just to shake things up, I've used ATL smart pointers.
</p>
<pre>
#include &lt;windows.h&gt;
#include &lt;shlobj.h&gt;
#include &lt;atlbase.h&gt;

void MarkShortcutRunAs(LPCWSTR pszShortcut)
{
 CComPtr&lt;IPersistFile&gt; sppf;
 if (FAILED(sppf.CoCreateInstance(CLSID_ShellLink))) return;
 if (FAILED(sppf-&gt;Load(pszShortcut, STGM_READWRITE))) return;
 CComQIPtr&lt;IShellLinkDataList&gt; spdl(sppf);
 if (!spdl) return;
 DWORD dwFlags;
 if (FAILED(spdl-&gt;GetFlags(&amp;dwFlags))) return;
 dwFlags |= SLDF_RUNAS_USER;
 if (FAILED(spdl-&gt;SetFlags(dwFlags))) return;
 if (FAILED(sppf-&gt;Save(NULL, TRUE))) return;
 wprintf(L"Succeeded\n");
}

int __cdecl wmain(int argc, wchar_t *argv[])
{
 if (argc == 2 &amp;&amp; SUCCEEDED(CoInitialize(NULL))) {
  MarkShortcutRunAs(argv[1]);
  CoUninitialize();
 }
 return 0;
}
</pre>
<p>
There's not really much to this program.
It creates a shell link object
(<code>CLSID_ShellLink</code>) and
asks it to load from the file whose path is given on the command line.
It then uses <code>IShellLinkDataList::GetFlags</code> and
<code>IShellLinkDataList::SetFlags</code> to fetch the old flags
and set new flags that include <code>SLDF_RUNAS_USER</code>.
Once that's done, it saves the result back out.
</p>
<p>
The hard part was knowing that the <code>SLDF_RUNAS_USER</code>
flag existed in the first place.
</p>
<p>
(I fear that most people will read this article and say,
"Awesome! My program requires elevation, and this is how I can
mark my Start menu shortcut to prompt for elevation.
Thanks, Raymond!"
These people will have completely ignored the opening paragraph,
which explains that that is the <i>wrong thing to do</i>.)</p>

<p>I&#8217;d be very sad if you were to stop writing here, Raymond, but it&#8217;s comments like this that really show what you&#8217;re up against trying to communicate with people who are too lazy (or full of themselves) to bother actually reading what you have to say.</p>

		<p>As the first paragraph states, &quot;maybe it&#8217;s an old program that you don&#8217;t have any control over&quot;. &nbsp;This to me implies you are the user and not the developer.</p>
<p>As a user, maybe you do have the option of adding a manifest file, maybe not. &nbsp;Raymond is just trying to point out what you can do when you can&#8217;t take the &quot;proper&quot; approach.</p>

		<p>Is there some means (other than this shortcut mechanism, which is of course for end users and not for developers) by which a particular program can support being run both elevated and not elevated? I&#8217;m thinking of a program which in normal circumstances wouldn&#8217;t require elevation, but sometimes you might need to run it that way to do some rarely-done thing.</p>
<p>I suppose a cleaner solution in many cases would be to run the privileged part in a separate process which the unprivileged process can start, but I&#8217;m still curious as to whether the above is possible for curiosity&#8217;s sake.</p>

		<p>Hi Ben Cook, have a look at new version of AutoRuns (by earlier Sysinternals) at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb963902.aspx</a></p>
<p>This version by default runs as a normal user, when you check or uncheck any auto run entry it pops up with a option to run itself as &quot;Elevated Mode&quot;, it basically runs its own exe in elevated mode then terminates.</p>
<p>So your idea is now a new thing.. and it might the &quot;Proper&quot; thing to do as a developer.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t understand why people are flaming the first poster for a perfectly reasonable question. A manifest is just an xml file &#8211; creating one seems to require less technical ability than creating a program to create or modify a shortcut. Am I missing something here?</p>

		<p>Paul Gunn, I think the first poster made a good point as well. I suspect the people flaming him misunderstood what he said and thought he meant modifying/adding the manifest into the exe. Maybe they don&#8217;t realise that the manifest can be a separate XML file next to the exe.</p>
<p>About Raymond&#8217;s post itself: I believe he&#8217;s just trying to tell us what to do if we need to programatically create such a shortcut (maybe as part of a deployment tool for a legacy app?). If a user just wants to create a shortcut to run an app elevated then they can go to Properties -&gt; Compatibility and check &quot;Run this program as an administrator&quot;, which I expect runs some code in the Shell which does exactly as Raymond has described.</p>
<p>Ben Cooke: UAC lets programs run themselves with an elevation prompt, like mvadu describes. It also allows programs to create elevated COM objects (again with an elevation prompt) which the unelevated code can then talk to, which is often a good solution when only parts of a program need to be elevated.</p>

		<p>Ben Cooke: Somewhat off topic, but if your application only occasionally needs to do tasks that require elevation, one &quot;right&quot; way to do it is to encapsulate that functionality in a COM object and use the COM Elevation Moniker to instantiate that object when you need to use that functionality: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms679687.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://msdn2.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms679687.aspx</a></p>
<p>The difference between doing it this way and just doing it in an .exe running in a separate process is largely academic, of course, since your COM object gets instantiated in a surrogate process anyway. &nbsp;One (very small) advantage is that you don&#8217;t have any .exe files lying around just waiting for end users to run them &quot;to see what it does.&quot; &nbsp;The advantage to both methods over what you propose is that the code that runs with privileged access in both cases is generally much smaller and easier to give the extra-careful audit it deserves.</p>

		<p>Leo Davidson: Properties-&gt;Compatibility adds an entry to the registry that causes the program to be run as administrator regardless of where it&#8217;s run from. &nbsp;I suspect you meant to draw a parallel to the Properties-&gt;Shortcut &quot;Advanced&quot; tab and its &quot;Run as administrator&quot; checkbox.</p>

		<p>Don&#8217;t forget, the program may already have a manifest (e.g. common controls v6) and so just &quot;dropping a new one in&quot; may break whatever functionality it was relying on.</p>

		<p>Thanks for the feedback, everyone. I like the elevated COM object thing; very clever! Presumably the complication of it running in another process is hidden from the developer behind the COM API, which is nice.</p>
<p>Hopefully one day I&#8217;ll get a chance to play with this stuff. (My company&#8217;s still doing development on Windows XP, and we don&#8217;t have any Vista boxes.)</p>

		<p>No, I meant for *ME* to drop a manifest there, not the *DEVELOPER*. &nbsp;Why would I want to create a special shortcut when I could just create a manifest and have the application work regardless of how it is invoked?</p>

		<p>That doesn&#8217;t work for all programs though as some programs will not run if they have been changed. How the program would know if changed I don&#8217;t know.</p>

		<p>OK, its an old program and I don&#8217;t have any control over (no manifest). Creating a link with SLDF_RUNAS_USER isn&#8217;t the proper approach either. So what *is* the proper approach for the user (if any)? </p>
<p>Creating a manifest seems a better idea, because I won&#8217;t have to fix *all* shortcuts to that program. I believe, Raymond&#8217;s approach can be used by any user, while adding a manifest next to an exe requires&#8230; well, elevation.</p>

		<p>I can think of a handful of situations that can be solved with this approach that a manifest can&#8217;t manage. If you wanted a Start menu shortcut for editing a .ini file within the program&#8217;s directory in Notepad, for example.</p>

		<p>@waleri: It seems rather pointless for a user who doesn&#8217;t have access to an administrative account to add the SLDF_RUNAS_USER flag to a shortcut.</p>

		<p>One example of &quot;an old program that you don&#8217;t have any control over&quot; is CMD.EXE. &nbsp;</p>
<p>When I was working on Visual Studio, we our build environment was set up by opening a CMD window and running a batch file to set PATH and other variables. &nbsp;Typically you&#8217;d create a desktop shortcut that ran something like:</p>
<p>CMD /k BUILDENVIRONMENT.CMD no_optimization</p>
<p>These shortcuts were typically created by an automated tool which was written in C#. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Our build required you to be an administrator (silly) so we wanted to mark the shortcuts to run as admin on Vista. &nbsp;However, you can&#8217;t mark CMD.EXE to always run elevated!</p>
<p>It was my job to figure out how to develop VS on Vista, and I had to write the code to do the above. &nbsp;It was tedious to write the P/Invoke declarations, but then the implementation was very clean.</p>
<p>(Oh, and it was Raymond who helped me find SLDF_RUNAS_USER :-) )</p>

		<p>I wanna ask another question about shortcut and elevation here.</p>
<p>If I wanna run a program in HOMEPATH, I can put this path in the shortcut&#8217;s &quot;start in&quot; property, but it will not work while marking it as requiring elevation.</p>
<p>So is there a way to achieve it? Thanks</p>

		<p>@Dean Harding</p>
<p>Thanks very much. Since my rss items grow too many always, sometimes important items have been ignored.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
