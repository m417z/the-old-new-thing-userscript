<p>
During the course of investigating a bug that resulted
in the system crashing with a bluescreen,
the question arose,
"What are the compatibility consequences of making this change?
Are there any legitimate scenarios where somebody would be
relying on being able to do XYZ and counting on the old behavior?"
</p>
<p>
I had to step in and state the obvious:
</p>
<p>
"There is clearly no valid scenario for the old behavior,
because if you try to do XYZ, you crash with a bluescreen."
</p>
<p>
Some people were amused by the clear logic of this statement.
But it's also the case that sometimes people get so excited
that they miss the obvious.</p>

		<p>Maybe doing just XY is a valid operation on it own, and the fix for XYZ&#8217;s bluescreen changes the result of XY. That would be a compatibility concern.</p>

		<p>If XYZ can be used in a sneaky way that avoids the crash, or it crashes only rarely, then you have a potential compatibility issue because people might be using it in the sneaky way (or are getting lucky). But in this case, XYZ always crashes, so the question is easier to answer.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m glad to see sanity won out in this won.  I wish it would win out more often such as in fixing the behavior that if you try to paste an invalid filename into an Explorer rename, the clipboard contents get changed with the invalid characters removed.</p>

		<p>Raymond talked about that six years ago: <a href="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110110-00/?p=11793" rel="nofollow">https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20110110-00/?p=11793</a></p>
<p>It seems that this is a bug (or feature, take your pick) that has earned its tenure! Honestly, I don&#8217;t see this behaviour biting people very often: How many times do you paste filenames in a rename operation?</p>

		<p>I do it a lot.  I disagree with the idea that old bugs should not be fixed because of the potential existence of unknown applications relying on them.  Microsoft broke a lot of stuff with Windows Vista and newer.  It&#8217;s time to let this one go (and others like it).  Not fixing old bugs might have made sense when Microsoft didn&#8217;t do much with customer feedback.  Now they have the insider program.  If they fix the bug and it breaks something major, they can create a compatibility shim or know for sure that the bug must stay, before impacting the release builds.</p>

		<p>Wow, you guys reenacted a 20 year old anecdote. It went like this:<br />
Same bug leading to the code &#8220;crash computer&#8221; was discovered in Linux, Mac, Windows.<br />
Linux team: let&#8217;s remove this code.<br />
Mac team: we cannot remove &#8220;crash computer&#8221; code for compatibility reasons, but let&#8217;s make sure it is never called.<br />
Windows: we have to call &#8220;crash computer&#8221; code for compatibility reasons, let&#8217;s add &#8220;uncrash computer&#8221; after it.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
