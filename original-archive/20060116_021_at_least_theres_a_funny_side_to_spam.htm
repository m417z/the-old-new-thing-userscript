		<p>thanks for posting, that was really, really funny</p>
<p>Suddenly though you start to laugh at everything that can be interpreted in a funny way. For example, on the bottom of this very comment form, it says, in very big black type, &quot;REMEMBER ME?&quot; &#8211; kinda intimidating :-)</p>

		<p>The main page started off with an advertisement for one of those fake spyware cleaners which is probably actual spyware.  I can&#8217;t quite figure out whether that is funny or isn&#8217;t funny.</p>

		<p>Hey Norman, is it your life long dream to complain about every single post made by a Microsoft blogger?  You are so tiring.</p>

<br />&gt; Hey Norman, is it your life long dream to<br />
<br />&gt; complain about every single post made by a<br />
<br />&gt; Microsoft blogger?</p>
<p>No, sometimes I complain about other commenters.</p>
<p>But my previous comment in this case was a comment on the anti-spam blog.  At first I laughed when I saw the anti-spam blog contain an advertisement that is likely to install malware (often including spam servers).  After a minute I remembered that it&#8217;s not funny because so many people fall for such advertisements for fake products.  On both counts I was commenting on the occurence of that advertisement in that blog.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
