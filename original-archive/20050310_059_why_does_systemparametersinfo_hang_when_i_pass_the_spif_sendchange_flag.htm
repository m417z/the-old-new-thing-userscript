For example, if you call SystemParametersInfo(SPI_SETDOUBLECLICKTIME, 500, 0, SPIF_UPDATEINIFILE | SPIF_SENDCHANGE); then the system will broadcast the message SendMessage(HWND_BROADCAST, WM_SETTINGCHANGE, SPI_SETDOUBLECLICKTIME, 0); If there is a window that...</td></tr>

<p>
If you pass the <code>SPIF_SENDCHANGE</code> flag to
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/sysinfo/base/systemparametersinfo.asp">
the <code>SystemParametersInfo</code> function</a>,
it will broadcast
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/sysinfo/base/wm_settingchange.asp">
the <code>WM_SETTINGCHANGE</code> message</a>
with the wParam equal to the system parameter code you passed.
For example, if you call
</p>
<pre>
SystemParametersInfo(SPI_SETDOUBLECLICKTIME,
      500, 0, SPIF_UPDATEINIFILE | SPIF_SENDCHANGE);
</pre>
<p>
then the system will broadcast the message
</p>
<pre>
SendMessage(HWND_BROADCAST, WM_SETTINGCHANGE,
            SPI_SETDOUBLECLICKTIME, 0);
</pre>
<p>
If there is a window that isn't responding to messages,
then this broadcast will hang until that unresponsive
window finally resumes responding to messages or is killed.
</p>
<p>
If you'd rather not be victimed by unresponsive windows,
you have a few options, but it also may affect your program's
expectations.
</p>
<p>
You could issue the <code>SystemParametersInfo</code>
call on a background thread.  Then your background thread
is the one that blocks instead of your UI thread.
</p>
<p>
With this message, the background thread can notify the
main thread when the broadcast finally completes, at which
point your program now knows that all windows have received
their notifications and are on board with the new setting.
</p>
<p>
You could issue the <code>SystemParametersInfo</code>
call without the <code>SPIF_SENDCHANGE</code> flag,
then manually broadcast the change via
</p>
<pre>
DWORD dwResult;
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/winui/windowsuserinterface/windowing/messagesandmessagequeues/messagesandmessagequeuesreference/messagesandmessagequeuesfunctions/sendmessagetimeout.asp">SendMessageTimeout</a>(HWND_BROADCAST, WM_SETTINGCHANGE,
            SPI_SETDOUBLECLICKTIME, 0,
            SMTO_ABORTIFHUNG | SMTO_NOTIMEOUTIFNOTHUNG,
            5000, &amp;dwResult);
</pre>
<p>
This does mean that unresponsive windows will not receive the
notification that a system parameter has changed.
This is acceptable if you decide
that your change in settings was minor enough
that a program missing the notification is no big deal.
In other words, when the unresponsive program finally wakes up,
it will not know that the setting has changed since it missed
the notification.
</p>
<p>
You can combine the above two methods: Use a background thread
and send the message with a timeout.
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the best technique is to use 
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/winui/WinUI/WindowsUserInterface/Windowing/MessagesandMessageQueues/MessagesandMessageQueuesReference/MessagesandMessageQueuesFunctions/SendNotifyMessage.asp">
the <code>SendNotifyMessage</code> function</a>.
<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/11/19/266664.aspx">
As we learned earlier</a>,
the <code>SendNotifyMessage</code> function
is like <code>SendMessage</code> except that it doesn't wait
for a response.  This lets your program get back work while
not messing up programs that were momentarily unresponsive
when you decided to broadcast the notification.
</p>
<pre>
SendNotifyMessage(HWND_BROADCAST, WM_SETTINGCHANGE,
            SPI_SETDOUBLECLICKTIME, 0);
</pre>
<p>
The downside is that you don't know when all windows
have finally received and processed the notification.
All you know is that someday, they will eventually find out.
Usually you don't care about this aspect of the broadcast,
so this lack of information is not an impediment.</p>

		<p>Just curious, what are the functional differences between SendNotifyMessage and PostMessage if it&#8217;s not sending to a window created by the calling thread?</p>
<p>I understand that SendNotifyMessage will just call the window procedure for the local thread, does it also skip the message queue for windows in other threads?</p>

		<p>Raymond, on that post you say &quot;Sent messages are not queued. Obviously, I need to dedicate a future entry to explaining the difference between posting and sending messages since people appear not to grasp it.&quot;</p>

		<p>I noticed this problem with XP &#8211; If an application has a modal dialog opened (for example File/Open in Notepad) and I switch the themes from XP to Classic, the application doesn&#8217;t update. It stops responding to theme changes until it is closed and restarted. If the application starts in Classic theme, then switching to XP works fine, and all subsequent theme changes too.</p>
<p>Maybe the &quot;Display Properties&quot; box doesn&#8217;t notify the applications correctly? Or is it a more generic problem with broadcasted messages and modal message loops?<br /></p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
