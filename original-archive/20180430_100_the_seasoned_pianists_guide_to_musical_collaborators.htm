<p>
The wife of one of my relatives is a classical pianist.
She shared with me her hot takes on musicians she collaborates with.&sup1;
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Violinists tune <i>forever</i>.
Her husband is a casual violin player.
Their daughter is a beginning violinist.
For fun, her husband decided to play a duet with their daughter.
<i>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star</i>.
Great.
He picks up his violin and starts playing and says,
"No, wait, stop, I need to tune."
He then spends the next ten minutes tuning his violin,
and then tunes his daughter's.
They then play a song for 30 seconds.
</li>
<li>
Singers are always complaining about the temperature,
the ventilation system,
and any other imaginable aspect of the venue.
</li>
<li>
To be fair, she concedes that pianists take forever adjusting the bench.
</li>
<li>
Cellists complain that the piano is too loud.
"Of course it's too loud.
You're sitting right in front of the open lid.
All the sound is being directed into your head.
Besides, the piece is a piano trio.
<i>Piano</i> trio.
Guess what instrument this genre of music is named after.
Uh-huh.
Oh, and your cello part?
Yeah, you're basically doubling my left hand.
So suck it up."
</li>
<li>
Reed instrumentalists blame the reed for anything they mess up.
"Oh, of course, it's the reed's fault.
Wait a second, didn't you make that reed?"
</li>
<li>
She asked a French horn player,
"Do you need to tune?",
fearing a tuning marathon based on her experience with violinists.
But the horn player said,
"Nah, I'll tune as I go."
Because apparently this is what horn players do because the
characteristics of the instrument change as it changes temperature,
etc.
</li>
</ul>
<p>
As you might expect for a pianist,
she is hired to do a lot of accompaniment.
I learned that she makes
makes more money from bad musicians than from good ones.
For one thing, bad musicians are generally willing to pay a higher rate.
And for another thing, they ask for more rehearsals,
which means that you get paid a higher rate for longer.
(The downside, of course, is that you are accompanying a bad musician.)
</p>
<p>
Though there is one specific musician that she refuses to work with any more.
The other musician is drop-dead gorgeous but is always a measure late.
I guess there are some musicians so bad that you won't accompany
them at any price.
</p>
<p>
<b>Story time</b>:
When she came to visit me last year,
she asked if she could
bring some music with her because she had to practice for a performance.
This was a silly question because
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20070430-01/?p=27053">
everyone should have a house pianist</a>.
</p>
<p>
While she was out, I peeked at her music.
One of the pieces was the
<a HREF="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sw9DlMNnpPM">
Busoni piano transcription of
Bach's Chaconne in D minor</a>.
I fumbled through the first page before giving up.
One of the tempo markings was
<i>non affrettare</i> (don't rush),
which made my mind boggle that there are people so expert
at piano that rushing is even possible!
</p>
<p>
Anyway, I told her about my experience trying to play
the Busoni/Bach piece, and she replied,
"Oh, yeah, I love that piece. I use it to warm up."
</p>
<p>
For me, so difficult I can't even get past the first page.
For her, just a warm-up.
</p>
<p>
&sup1;
Note that attitude may have been added for entertainment purposes.
Actually, that note pretty much applies to anything I post.</p>

		<p>Bonus to the bonus: the instrument we call a &#8220;piano&#8221; was originally called a &#8220;pianoforte,&#8221; because it can be played quietly or loudly, unlike similar instruments such as the harpsichord.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s still pianoforte in Italian (although it&#8217;s often abbreviated to &#8220;piano&#8221;). What&#8217;s more interesting is that the modern pianoforte is the evolution of the fortepiano, which is what people such as Mozart or Haydn actually used/wrote music for.</p>

		<p>Or indeed if they willingly play out of tune. (Having said that I will play out-of-tune pianos as I don&#8217;t have the time or equipment to tune them, but I find it much harder than playing instruments that are in tune.)</p>

		<p>This sounds eerily similar to my experiences working with rock musicians. Drummers seem to *always* need to tune their drums (electric guitarists aren&#8217;t far behind!) and singers always need more of themselves. About the only people who are ready to go most of the time are the bassists and keyboard players, and the sound guy! (Note: This comment is somewhat exaggerated, and I may be biased towards bass players and sound technicians.)</p>

		<p>Drums have the excuse of being easily knocked out of tune by setting them up.</p>
<p>An array of tuning forks and a pair of rubber mallets is a great musical instrument.</p>

		<p>Playing both electric guitars and electric bass, I can tell you it&#8217;s not so strange &#8211; electric guitars do get out of tune way more often than basses, especially when you play songs with a lot of bendings and you have cheap tuners.</p>

		<p>Brahms made a piano arrangement of Bach&#8217;s Ciaccona (for the left hand only, published as &#8220;5 Studien, Anh. 1a/1&#8221;) . That might be easier to start with. It&#8217;s also closer to the original. (Adding harmony when playing solo pieces on the piano is fine in general, but I think Busoni is way over the top.)</p>

		<p>&gt; She asked a French horn player, &#8220;Do you need to tune?&#8221;, fearing a tuning marathon based on her experience with violinists. But the horn player said, &#8220;Nah, I&#8217;ll tune as I go.&#8221; Because apparently this is what horn players do because the characteristics of the instrument change as it changes temperature, etc.</p>
<p>As a sometimes-hobbyist musician, pretty much _all_ instruments, especially those using breath, have this characteristic.  Tuning only gets you the gross range, and many instruments will require subtle adjustments for different notes (what needs to be adjusted depends on what the instrument is).</p>

		<p>I was at a concert once where Beethoven&#8217;s Pathetique was played. The pianist seemed to have a brain fart in the middle of one speedy passage (1st movement recapitulation closing theme, if I remember right), and practically BSed his way through a few measures. That made me chuckle.</p>

		<p>&gt; Oh, and your cello part? Yeah, you&#8217;re basically doubling my left hand. So suck it up.&#8221; </p>
<p>Ouch. ;-)</p>

		<p>&#8220;Anyway, I told her about my experience trying to play the Busoni/Bach piece, and she replied, &#8220;Oh, yeah, I love that piece. I use it to warm up.&#8221;&#8221;</p>
<p>Maybe. Or maybe, &#8220;Yeah, I had to rewrite it as a double-red-white splay tree and interfrobulate it with the ORM, but no big deal.&#8221;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
