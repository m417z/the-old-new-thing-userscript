<p>I have no idea why the window manager team added <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/197571"> this feature</a> to Windows&nbsp;NT. It basically says, "Hi, use this key to violate all the rules known to mankind about what can legitimately be done in a <code>DllMain</code> function. Oh, and be <a href="http://www.avira.com/en/threats/section/fulldetails/id_vir/3265/tr_drop.stration.677.html"> an attractive malware attack vector</a>, too."</p>
<p> I've debugged a few crashes that were traced back to the <code>AppInit_DLLs</code> key. What makes them particularly fun is that the offending DLL is usually not on the stack. Rather, the fact that a foreign DLL is being loaded inside <code>USER32</code>'s initialization code means that you're violating the rule against calling <code>LoadLibrary</code> inside a <code>DllMain</code> function. The result of this madness is that DLLs get initialized out of order, and typically manifests itself in some DLL crashing trying to use an object (often a critical section) that it is supposed to have initialized in its <code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code> handler. It crashed because the loader got tricked into initializing DLLs out of order. The dependent DLL received its <code>DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH</code> before the prerequisite DLL. </p>
<p> I end up looking at these failures because the victim DLL is often a DLL that my group is responsible for. </p>
<p> The window manager folks came to the same conclusion about <code>AppInit_DLLs</code>, and it doesn't work any more in Windows Vista by default. (<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/nickkramer/archive/2006/04/18/577962.aspx">Nick Kramer describes how to re-enable it</a>.) </p>

		<p>John: Using this registry value it is very easy to automatically inject your code into lots of processes on the user&#8217;s desktop (virtually all that load user32.dll). Otherwise you would need a separate process that injects DLLs into users&#8217; processes. So at least there is a use case for this registry value.</p>

		<p>Since the KB article says &quot;The AppInit_DLLs value is found in the following registry key: HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE&#8230;&quot; and even explicitly states &quot;Typically, only the Administrators group and the LocalSystem account have write access to the key that contains the AppInit_DLLs value.&quot;, the malware argument is moot.

<p>That would be the case if users didn&#8217;t run with admin privs all the time (pre-Vista) and vendors did their part writing software to runs with minimal privs.</p>
<p>Vista&#8217;s UAC is annoying but if it forces developers to think seperation of privs, then all the better.</p>
<p>Actually, this ranks up there as a pretty sneaky attack, at least when it was discovered. Do spyware scanners check this now?</p>

<p>What cmov is saying is that in that case you don&#8217;t need AppInit_DLLs to perform an exploit &#8211; why not just install a service or a device driver? &nbsp;It&#8217;s just another example of Raymond&#8217;s &quot;It rather involved being on the other side of this airtight hatchway&quot; set of &#8216;exploits&#8217;.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s like the ELF dynamic linker&#8217;s LD_PRELOAD, only implemented in the wrong place. LD_PRELOAD may be used for good or evil, but it can be made reliable (in so far as injection of code into another process can be).</p>

		<p>This just extends the insanity that can happen in DllInit functions. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t know why it wasn&#8217;t just removed, rather than limited. &nbsp;The above mentioned &quot;use case&quot; is not a strong enough reason to allow this.</p>

		<p>&quot;Sounds like The Daily WTF material. &nbsp;Seriously, is there even one legitimate use for this?&quot;</p>
<p>The Wise Installer products (formerly of Wise Solutions, then Altiris, now Symantec) use this to monitor installation processes in-memory to capture machine changes without using the more traditional method of machine snapshots. &nbsp;Whether this is legitimate or not is up for debate. &nbsp;I have found that is causes more problems than anything else, so I would say no.</p>

		<p>Tyler, AppInit mechanism automatically injects your DLL in <em>every</em> running process which imports from user32.dll.</p>
<p>That means if your DLL goes down, whole system goes down with it.</p>
<p>I really do not see any legitimate uses for this feature. It can be easily emulated by other means anyway so nobody will miss it, especially not the malware writers.</p>

		<p>&quot;That&#8217;s what peer review was created for.&quot;</p>
<p>Peer reviews do not catch every possible problem.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure at the time, the feature WAS peer-reviewed, and the developer who wanted the feature included probably argued vehemently for his (or her) feature, perhaps eventually winning out over the &quot;detractors&quot;.</p>
<p>With properly constructed DLLs, AppInit_DLLs should work without problems. You just need to craft your DLL *knowing* that it will be included in the AppInit_DLLs registry key, and be very careful about what dependencies you drag in (e.g. kernel32 and nothing else).</p>

		<p>I have to defend the AppInit team here- it probably did help some fancy things like plug-in themed GUIs. Furthermore, they were working in a pre-internet era when malware was kind of hard to get on. So in a scale of design errors where activeX is at 10, Sun&#8217;s NFS is at 8 (unsecured LAN filesharing), appinit is probably a 5. It doesnt help malware onto the system, just provides a way for it to live.</p>
<p>but if you want to lock down everything, what about all those CBT hooks?</p>

		<p>&#8220;&#8230; and typically manifests itself in some DLL crashing trying to use an object (often a critical section) that it is supposed to have initialized in its DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH handler. It crashed because the loader got tricked into initializing DLLs out of order. The dependent DLL received its DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH before the prerequisite DLL.&#8221;</p>
<p>As long as your dll is not dependent on any other in the AppInit_DLLs list, it&#8217;s fine to create synchronization objects such as critical sections in your DllMain and then use them later in the *same* dll.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>As noted in the article, the crash was in some other DLL, not in the AppInit DLL. -Raymond</i>]</div>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
