<p>Not always.</p>

<p>Some managers may have a split-focus triopter (?), allowing three different parts of their brain to focus on three different things simultaneously.</p>
<p>However, I suspect that their mind (or at least their use of language) being aberrant is the much more likely hypothesis. :-)</p>

<p>Yeah, but that&#8217;s just the range in which things are not so far out-of-focus that you notice it.</p>

		<p>Then there is a concept of a focal plane. And depth of field. All objects there will be in focus.</p>

<p>A good punchline.</p>

		<p>The Focus and In Focus are two different concepts. Something being in focus is describing a range of light ray convergence. The Focus describes the specific point where all light is converging. Having a split focus concept in play doesn&#8217;t change the dynamics of how optics work: each segment of the picture has one focus.</p>
<p>A lot of comments are taking the phrase &quot;We&#8217;re focusing on three features for this release&quot; and mentally reordering it as &quot;We have 3 features in focus for this release&quot;. The latter would make sense: any number of objects can be in focus; however, only one thing can be the focus.</p>

		<p>If it&#8217;s spotlight and not focus, it doesn&#8217;t sound quite strange for me.</p>
<p>You can surely place a few spotlights on things and just neglecting things not on spotlights.</p>

		<p>Ah, this is so out-of-date ;=) &nbsp;The current hot management-speak term is re-focus. This is the result of constant changes in direction, and it&#8217;s no longer useful to focus on those things there, we always need to re-focus on these things here instead. Well at least for today anyway. The constant re-focussing is indeed an aberration.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s a trend in contemporary marketing speak that&#8217;s seeping into wide-spread daily usage. Marketing likes to use non-committal yet suggestive words to mis-lead readers while not mis-leading in the legal sense. This lead to using slight exaggeration in numbers, so the overall atmosphere of the copy consistently push readers towards their designed meaning.</p>
<p>Managers, after being &quot;trained&quot; to read these market pieces, pick up the ability to &quot;extend&quot; the meaning of words, and get used to always speak in &quot;suggestive case&quot;, resulting in these somehow not-so-right usage.</p>
<p>But we can&#8217;t really say they&#8217;re wrong. Natural language is known to shift like this. During an era where technology is king, technical speak spread to the masses; during an dra where marketing is king, so does marketing speak.</p>

		<p>@Mr NotSoPedantic</p>
<p>I agree, that&#8217;s what I thought. In our company my direct manager manages 3 groups of people, and each groups has its focus on a different (set of) product(s). So the manager can rightly say &#8216;we&#8217; are focusing on three things.</p>

		<p>My understanding of the usage of the phrase is that focus equals concentration. &nbsp;While focus might imply a digital measurement, concentration is quite clearly an analog measurement.</p>

		<p>Regarding &quot;We&#8217;re focusing on three features for this release&quot; it is apparent to me that these features will each be concentrated on in turn prior to release, or perhaps simultaneously by more than one actor, as &quot;We&quot; implies more than one person. Raymond, this one is just you being weird.</p>

		<p>The parameters of cognitive focus are distinct from the parameters of optical focus. And I think you&#8217;re confusing focal plane (or length) with focal point. You can have several objects be in focus at various points in the field of view. Look up tilt-shift lenses for an example of manipulating the focal plane outside the context of a defective lens.</p>

		<p>Yeah, this is just the usual way of making it look like everything is equally important, instead of making a sensible assessment of what&#8217;s going on. &nbsp;A few people here seem to&#8217;ve missed that point&#8230;</p>

		<p>This remains me of my former company&#8217;s CEO.</p>
<p>To galvanize employees&#8217; low morale, the newly hired CEO would setup company meeting once every quarter.</p>
<p>He would say &quot;laser beam focus&quot; several times in these mettings when describing how we would approach the goals.</p>

		<p>This isn&#8217;t management speak. &nbsp;This is the English language. &nbsp;The first definition for &quot;focus&quot; on dictionary.com is &quot;a central point, as of attraction, attention, or activity: The need to prevent a nuclear war became the focus of all diplomatic efforts.&quot; &nbsp;You have to go further down to find the physics/optics definitions. &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/focus" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/focus</a></p>
<p>Saying one&#8217;s focus is on A, B, and C makes perfect sense when A, B, and C are only three out of hundreds of possible things to consider. &nbsp;It wouldn&#8217;t be odd, for example, to hear someone say that the Obama administration is focusing on health care and the economy. &nbsp;As opposed to crime, AIDS, corruption, homelessness, military expansion, or any number of other things he could also be concerning himself with.</p>

		<p>jmp nailed it &#8212; people who are poor at prioritizing things say that they are focused on several things at once which actually means they are not really focused on anything.</p>
<p>You can&#8217;t have foreground and background in focus on a photo when using shallow DOF (large aperture). Yes, you can use focus stacking but then you don&#8217;t have two things in focus at the same time.</p>
<p>It is the same kind of people who mark all their outgoing emails with &quot;high priority&quot;.</p>

		<p>@porter, Morten: The literal translation of &#8220;Schwerpunkt&#8221; is &#8220;heavy point&#8221;. In the context of the examples given by Raymond, it would be translated as &#8220;a center of interest or activity.&#8221; &#8220;Schwerpunkt&#8221; can&#8217;t really be verbiaged, but a proper equivalent verb would be &#8220;konzentrieren&#8221;, which would be perfectly valid as used the examples, without abiguity.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Any noun can be verbed. Try &#8220;schwerpunktifizieren&#8221; or, if you&#8217;re a minimalist, &#8220;schwerpunkten.&#8221; What? That&#8217;s not a proper verb? Who cares! -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>As Cheong said, a light (e.g. torch) and the mind can &quot;focused on&quot; multiple objects. &nbsp;Even literally, you can have different focal points for different lenses, or for varying points in time. &nbsp;I wonder, would you also take issue with &quot;almost unique&quot; or &quot;more correct&quot;?</p>
<p>Alexander, that&#8217;s a fantastic summary: I&#8217;d expand it to all media outlets. &nbsp;But concerns like political correctness and being quotable have tilted language throughout history.</p>

		<p>One group had 70 focus areas. After much debate, meetings, and fan fare, they laser-focused into 20 core areas each with 3 to 5 sub foci. &nbsp;I love management.</p>

		<p>Okay, there is a similar Chinese word misused frequently. People like to say &quot;囊括&quot; to mean that &quot;winning &#8216;most&#8217; of the prizes&quot; or &quot;taking &#8216;most&#8217; of the seats&quot;. But &quot;囊&quot; means &quot;bag&quot;, so it shall signify &quot;all&quot;, not &quot;most&quot;.</p>
<p>I guess when a concept is cool and certain word seems adequate, people just use it.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
