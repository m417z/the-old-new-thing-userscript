<p>Actually, <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/11/24/496690.aspx"> I discussed this topic already</a>, but I'm mentioning it again here since it's thematically related to the other Start menu articles.</p>
<p> I'm told that there have been a few tweaks to the rules for Windows&nbsp;Vista. Some installers set the time stamps on the program to match the time stamp of the install media. This makes for pretty directory listings but means that the Start menu fails to recognize the program as new. To address this, the Start menu also takes the creation time of the directory containing the program into consideration when determining which programs are new. </p>
<p> Second, a program that appears in the pin list will not be marked as new, since that would be pointless duplication. (This is only an issue for the "chameleon" pin list entries like "Internet" and "Email" which track your current default Web browser or mail program.) And third, the grace period after installation <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/11/24/496690.aspx#496798"> has been extended</a> from one hour to five hours. This gives computer manufacturers more time to install all their <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/10/25/872891.aspx"> shovelw</a>^H^H^H^H^H^H^Hhigh-quality added-value software. </p>

		<p>And it takes just about 3 hours to clean all of it on a new box to get back to a more or less clean OS install so that I can then add back in the actually useful 3rd party stuff&#8230;.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s quicker to reinstall the base OS than to remove a lot of the carp that comes preinstalled.</p>

		<p>No, you don&#8217;t understand. &nbsp;The shovelware is installed &quot;in order to serve you better&quot;.</p>
<p>Does Microsoft offer an option to download a clean installation CD/DVD image (assuming you have a valid license key)? &nbsp;I am in the market for a notebook, but every single review of the current generation of products makes it clear that the systems come ONLY with a recovery partition; there is usually an option to create your own recovery CDs based on the recovery partition, but that would still result in all the crapware. &nbsp;I could buy an OEM copy, but that&#8217;s $100 &#8211; $200 (depending on what version) that I shouldn&#8217;t have to spend.</p>

		<p>Ah&#8230; ^H. Kids these days just don&#8217;t get it. Or at least the Young Thing here at work didn&#8217;t.</p>
<p>BTW great series, very enjoyable &#8212; I&#8217;d never thought about how the start menu worked before.</p>

		<p>Honestly I can&#8217;t stand the &quot;Highlight newly installed programs&quot; option and it&#8217;s one of the first things I turn off in a new install.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve come to love the XP-style Start Menu, but that option is just annoying. I figure that considering I *just* installed it, I should know to go find it in the Start Menu. &nbsp;Maybe this is another example of &quot;power&quot; user vs &quot;normal&quot; user ways of thinking.</p>
<p>Thanks again for doing this series Raymond. Series/articles like this are why I read your blog.</p>

		<p>Usually it&#8217;s impossible to get a clean installation or clean media in the budget models, even if you can get it for the high end (like dell&#8217;s XPS and Optiplex lines). That&#8217;s just part of the cost of the systems, the shovelware subsidizes the price tag.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re particularly clever with nlite, you can usually get around any removal restrictions that the OEMs put in their recovery discs, though.</p>

<p>&quot;there is usually an option to create your own recovery CDs based on the recovery partition, but that would still result in all the crapware.&quot;</p>
<p>*scratches head* &nbsp;Where do you normally see that option? &nbsp;I&#8217;d love to attempt to create my own RCD but with SP2 installer on it. &nbsp;:P</p>

		<p>A friend got a Vista laptop from Dell&#8217;s &quot;Home and Home Office&quot; UK department a month or two ago (Inspiron I think) and it came with three discs &#8211; OS, drivers and crapware. (And another for MS Works, or something.) I didn&#8217;t try them, because the Decrapifier worked excellently.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
