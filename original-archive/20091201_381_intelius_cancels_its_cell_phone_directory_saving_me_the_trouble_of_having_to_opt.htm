<p>A few years ago, I wrote about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/08/15/4392539.aspx"> a new cell phone directory that charges $15 to give you incorrect information, and from which you have to renew your opt-out every three months</a>. Well, apparently, less than a year later, due to "complaints from consumers and Verizon Wireless," Intelius decided to <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/businesstechnology/2004163292_apcellphonedirectory04.html"> discontinue the service</a>.</p>
<p> Intelius is back in the news, because <a href="http://www.techcrunch.com/2009/10/27/intelius-files-to-go-public-again-still-a-huge-toxic-scam/"> they have filed a preliminary prospectus with the SEC for an initial public offering</a>. (According to TechCrunch, this is their second attempt at an IPO.) "<a href="http://uk.finance.yahoo.com/news/infospace-ceo-aims-for-new-ipo-with-intelius-ftimes-dc48e465dad5.html">It's important to know the history. Many investors looking at his history would be very careful</a>." The person being referred to by that analyst is your friend and mine, Naveen Jain, current CEO of Intelius and more notably <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/03/14/395274.aspx"> former CEO of InfoSpace</a>. </p>
<p> My guess is that Naveen did this for the attention, because it has been too long since the last time he got to tell a reporter how awesome he is. </p>
<p> (By the way, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?oldid=306951595"> his Wikipedia article at publication time</a> demonstrates a bit of Naveen-like grandstanding. The article claims that he joined Microsoft in 1989 as a senior executive. I worked in an office down the hall from him in the early 1990's. He was no senior executive. He was just another middle manager, notable for being significantly more annoying and loud-mouthed than your average middle manager. And the quotation "My job was to define what a product should do from a consumer point of view and what it is that Microsoft wanted the program to be" is just the job description of a Program Manager at Microsoft. Nothing special.) </p>

		<p>You normally go to lengths to make sure companies who write bad code etc aren&#8217;t named and shamed, but here you make a personal attack on an idividual&#185;.</p>
<p>I understand why you may dislike Naveen or view him with scepticism, but is a little consistancy too much to ask? &#8230;I&#8217;d rather you named everyone that no-one btw!</p>
<p>&#185;What, no &#8216;The opinions expressed herein are my own and are not an official position of Microsoft Corporation&#8217;?</p>

		<p>Okay, this is fascinating! The entry has been updated again, and Raymond&#8217;s name has been removed but it is mentioned that he&#8217;s a Program Manager (with citation to this blog entry). Raymond actually said he was a middle manager, so it&#8217;s likely that Naveen&#8217;s actual designation may have been more on the lines of Lead/Group PM. I can&#8217;t believe Wikipedia moderators are this active &#8211; it&#8217;s truly amazing!</p>

		<p>Jain&#8217;s personal web page (linked from Wikipedia) has a quite overblown-sounding biography. &nbsp;He &quot;worked on several crucial projects&quot; such as OS/2, Windows NT, and Windows 95. &nbsp;I presume that many Microsoft employees who worked at Microsoft in the same time period, would have &quot;worked on&quot; those same projects.</p>
<p>Then he &quot;got tired of making billions for Bill.&quot; &nbsp;Wow.</p>

		<p>Wow, Jain&#8217;s biography says he won the &quot;Albert Einstein Technology Medal&quot;. &nbsp;Wikipedia says this is formally called the &quot;Albert Einstein award&quot; and comes with a gold medal.</p>
<p>It is an award for work in theoretical physics. &nbsp;Jain has never won it.</p>
<p>There are other similarly named awards:</p>
<p>The Albert Einstein Medal <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein_Medal" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albert_Einstein_Medal</a> is an award presented by the Albert Einstein Society in Bern. &nbsp;From what I can see, Jain has not won this.</p>
<p>The Albert Einstein World Award of Science <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/winners-science.php" rel="nofollow">http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/winners-science.php</a> &quot;was created as a means of recognition, and as an incentive to scientific and technological research and development. It takes into special consideration those researches, which have brought true benefit and well being to mankind&quot;. &nbsp;From what I can see, Jain has not won this award either.</p>
<p>It sounds like Jain is deluded and makes up things.</p>

		<p>The founder of eXfuze, an MLM company with an 8-ball compensation plan that screams &quot;pyramid scam&quot; to anyone in the know is apparently &quot;a former Microsoft executive&quot;.</p>
<p>Much is made of this, but with such high employee numbers the statistics suggest Microsoft&#8217;s ex-employees ought to include among them a fair share of fraudsters, and even more serious criminals, as well as the novelists, Olympic athletes, oboe players or Price Is Right contestants.</p>
<p>In fact it would be odd if we discovered that no ex-Microsoft employees were involved in anything shady &#8211; they&#8217;re not saints after all.</p>

		<p>When I read that headline I thought it was going to be something about the use of the Prefix &#8216;Inteli&#8217; &nbsp;&#8211; as Microsoft use that a lot (InteliMouse and InteliSense spring to mind) but I was totally wrong ! Interesting read anyway :)</p>

<p>Yes, but a primary source is better than no source at all (which was the prior state of the article), and he later found a secondary source.</p>

<p>I would imagine that identifying code that Raymond sees at work would open him/Ms up to liability and at the very least make people less willing to send him code to fix. Naveen, not so much &#8211; his whole business model is creepy.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
