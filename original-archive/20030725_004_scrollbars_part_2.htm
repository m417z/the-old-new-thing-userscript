        Managing scrollbars is not hard in principle. The basic idea is not that difficult,
        but there are a lot of small details that need to be ironed out. If you don't get
        the details just right, your program will feel odd in a strange way that you often
        can't pinpoint, much like a subtle background hum that makes you feel uneasy without
        realizing it. Getting the details right is important to making your program feel crisp
        and clean.
    </p>
<p>    <b>The base program</b> </p>
<p>
        Let's start with a basic program and gradually add scrollbar features to it. The basic
        program merely displays one hundred numbered lines. Add these variables to the scratch
        program:
    </p>
<pre>HFONT g_hfList;         /* Font for list */
int g_cyLine;           /* Height of each line */
int g_cItems = 100;     /* Number of items */
</pre>
<p>
        and add these functions to the scratch program:
    </p>
<pre>BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
    /* Create the font we use for the list */
    LOGFONT lf;
    SystemParametersInfo(SPI_GETICONTITLELOGFONT, sizeof(lf), &amp;lf, 0);
    g_hfList = CreateFontIndirect(&amp;lf);
    if (!g_hfList) return 0;

    /* Compute the height for each line */
    HDC hdc = GetDC(hwnd);
    HFONT hfPrev = SelectFont(hdc, g_hfList);
    SelectFont(hdc, hfPrev);
    SIZE siz;
    GetTextExtentPoint(hdc, TEXT("0"), 1, &amp;siz);
    g_cyLine = siz.cy;

    ReleaseDC(hwnd, hdc);

    return 1;
}

void
OnDestroy(HWND hwnd)
{
    DeleteObject(g_hfList);
    PostQuitMessage(0);
}

/* This is a separate function for now; you'll see why later */
void
PaintSimpleContent(HWND hwnd, PAINTSTRUCT *pps)
{
    HFONT hfPrev = SelectFont(pps-&gt;hdc, g_hfList);  /* Use the right font */
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; g_cItems; i++) {            /* Print all the lines */
        char szLine[256];
        int cch = wsprintf(szLine, "This is line %d", i);
        TextOut(pps-&gt;hdc, 0, i * g_cyLine, szLine, cch);
    }

    SelectFont(pps-&gt;hdc, hfPrev);
}

void
PaintContent(HWND hwnd, PAINTSTRUCT *pps)
{
    PaintSimpleContent(hwnd, pps);
}
</pre>
<p>
        We now have a base program upon which to build.
    </p>
<p>
        I'm sorry this is taking so long to get off the ground. But things finally get interesting
        in part 4, honest.

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
