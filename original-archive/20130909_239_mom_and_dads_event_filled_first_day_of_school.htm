<p>I dreamed that my wife and I had dropped our daughter off at her new school for the first time, and I made a wrong turn and ended up going the wrong way. We got off at an exit for highway I-5, and the on-ramp turned into a two-lane highway hundreds of feet in the sky. To keep people from going too fast, the road <a href="http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/K-12/airplane/roll.html"> rolled</a> back and forth: First it tilted to the right, then to the left, and so on. (Imagine your hand making the "so-so" gesture.) You just had to drive carefully.</p>
<p> The road dead-ended at a building, so we parked the car and got out. It was a tiny gift shop with puppets and marionettes. The attendant came out and thanked us for volunteering at the <a href="http://www.kcls.org/northbend/"> North Bend library</a>. </p>
<p> We watched a women's doubles volleyball match between a US and Chinese team. Two players per side, playing on a volleyball net stretched across a basketball court. The US narrowly won the first set, but dominated the second, and the Chinese pair stopped trying. Serves fell laughably short of the net or sailed wildly out of bounds. (Even worse than those badminton players <a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/sport/2012/aug/01/olympic-badminton-players-charged"> trying to lose</a>.) </p>
<p> After the match, there was a group photo of the two delegations. There was a traditional photo, and then a Harlem Shake photo. Conspiracy theorists would later analyze the two photos for clues to the political climate between the two countries. </p>
<p> After the match, there was a discussion of organic farming techniques, like "How much radiation does a chicken give off when it is sitting on a fence as opposed to on the ground?", and then it was time to go home. While my wife went to sign out of our volunteer duties, I unlocked the safe that had the control panel for our car and started loading our things for the drive home. </p>
<p> I hope my daughter enjoyed her first day at school. </p>

		<p>I wonder if a child&#39;s first day at school is about as confusing and non-sequential as your dream? &nbsp;I bet it&#39;s a bit of a trip for little ones to suddenly be dumped into this very different power and time structure. :)</p>

		<p>So it was essentially an intentional Tacoma Narrows bridge?</p>

		<p>Sounds like one of those days when you drink alcohol but it have a longer than normal delayed before taking effect which makes you drink more and the after math you get more drunk than you planned to.</p>
<p>World is spinning like a badly written physics game. Your thoughts gets more and more strange. You suddenly develop extreme multitasking having the ability to talk while thinking on other things at the same time. Your limited short-term memory having a hard time keeping track of both tasks while also trying to keep the world from spinning +90 to -90 than it jumps back to +90 and repeats while having a wobbly, sort of water shader effect on.</p>
<p>The next day you feel sick the whole day and do not return to feeling normal until the day after that.</p>
<p>I bet it is the sulfites in the wine that cause the longer than normal delay before you feel the alcohol.</p>
<p>The trick is to drink lots of water and not sleep until the spinning have stopped but when it is spinning all you want to do is lay down or sit down.</p>
<p>Recording yourself is even more fun, you wonder the next day who took over my body, is that really me or an inferior genetic copy lookalike?</p>
<p>According to quantum physics the world is always wobbling, like that bridge, well more like a very fast vibrator, we just do not notice it. That&#39;s the theory anyway.</p>

		<p>You have some weird dreams!</p>
<p>I used to come here to read about the Windows programming topics, now I&#39;m mainly here for the dreams.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
