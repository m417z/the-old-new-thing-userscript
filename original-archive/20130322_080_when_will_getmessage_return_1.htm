<p>
A source of great consternation is the mysterious <code>-1</code>
return value from
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms644936(v=vs.85).aspx">
<code>Get&shy;Message</code></a>:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
If there is an error, the return value is &minus;1.
For example, the function fails if
<code>hWnd</code> is an invalid window handle
or <code>lpMsg</code> is an invalid pointer.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
That paragraph has caused all sorts of havoc,
because it throws into disarray the standard
message pump:
</p>
<pre>
MSG msg;
while (GetMessage(&amp;msg, NULL, 0, 0)) {
 ...
}
</pre>
<p>
But don't worry, the standard message pump is safe.
If your parameters are exactly
</p>
<ul>
<li>a valid pointer to a valid <code>MSG</code> structure,
<li>a null window handle,
<li>no starting message range filter,
<li>no ending message range filter,
</ul>
<p>
then <code>Get&shy;Message</code> will not fail with <code>-1</code>.
</p>
<p>
Originally, the <code>Get&shy;Message</code> function did not
have a failure mode.
If you passed invalid parameters, then you invoked undefined
behavior, and you probably crashed.
</p>
<p>
Later,
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/12/10/9934911.aspx">
somebody said</a>,
"Oh, no, the <code>Get&shy;Message</code> function needs to
detect invalid parameters and instead of crashing, it needs
to fail gracefull with some sort of error code."
(This was before "Fail-Fast" came into fashion.)
</p>
<p>
The problem is that
<code>Get&shy;Message</code>'s return value of <code>BOOL</code>
was already specified not as a success/failure code,
but rather a
"Has a <code>WM_QUIT</code> message been received?" code.
So return <code>FALSE</code> wouldn't work.
</p>
<p>
The solution (if that's what you want to call it)
was to have
<code>Get&shy;Message</code> return the
not-really-a-<code>BOOL</code>-but-we'll-pretend-it-is
value
<code>-1</code> to signal an <i>invalid parameter</i> error.
</p>
<p>
And that's what threw everybody into a tizzy,
because now every message loop looks buggy.
</p>
<p>
But you can calm down.
The standard message loop is fine.
All the parameters are hard-coded (and therefore valid by inspection),
save for the <code>&amp;msg</code> parameter,
which is still valid by inspection.
So that case is okay.
It has to be, for compatibility.
</p>
<p>
The people who need to worry are people who pass a variable
as the window handle filter (because that window handle may
no longer be valid),
or pass dynamically-allocated memory as the <code>lpMsg</code>
(because the pointer may no longer be valid),
or who pass a nontrivial message filter
(because the filter parameters may be invalid).
</p>
<p>
In practice,
the memory for the <code>lpMsg</code> is nearly always
a stack variable (so the pointer is valid),
and the message range filters are hard-coded
(so valid by inspection).
The one to watch out for is the window handle filter.
But we saw earlier that
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/02/09/369804.aspx">
a filtered
<code>Get&shy;Message</code>
is a bad idea anyway</a>,
because your program will not respond to messages that don't meet
the filter.</p>

		<p>Where the documentation says &quot;If the function retrieves a message other than WM_QUIT, the return value is nonzero&quot;, should it really say &quot;the return value is 1&quot;? &nbsp;-1 is a nonzero value, but is presumably not among the possibilities when there&#39;s no error. &nbsp;Or, does nonzero implicitly refer to nonnegative nonzero values?</p>

		<p>@RP7:</p>
<p>The thing is, TRUE may be defined in the headers as 1, but a function may not necessarily return 1 for success.</p>
<p>You would be better reading that as more of a non specific to specific return value order. This really makes the values that it can obtain on success INT_MIN to -2 and then 1 to INT_MAX. The fact that -1 was given as a specific value means that it is automatically removed from the success values.</p>

		<p>In fact, specifying a valid HWND of a main application window in a call to GetMessage (main message loop) means, that</p>
<p>this application will never terminate. Specifying NULL, however, ends application properly.</p>

		<p>@Crescens2k &quot;The fact that -1 was given as a specific value means that it is automatically removed from the success values.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#39;s not necessarily something you can infer. There are functions in the C standard where the only reliable difference between an error and success is errno. Two come to mind easily: strtol and mktime (the latter not on windows, since years before 1970 are not accepted by MSVCRT&#39;s mktime) can each return their respective error values [LONG_MIN and LONG_MAX, and (time_t)-1, respectively] as valid results.</p>
<p>GetMessage could have, in principle, been defined in a similar way, wherein you must call SetLastError(ERROR_SUCCESS) before calling it, and inspect the result of GetLastError if the returned value == -1. In practice, I suspect it always returns 1 for success.</p>

		<p>@Random832:</p>
<p>Surely if that was the case, it would also document it.</p>
<p>For example, GetWindowLongPtr:</p>
<p>If the function fails, the return value is zero. To get extended error information, call GetLastError.</p>
<p>If SetWindowLong or SetWindowLongPtr has not been called previously, GetWindowLongPtr returns zero for values in the extra window or class memory.</p>

		<p>@me. I get the impression that the function used to return non-zero on invalid parameter, so altering it to return 0 would cause apps that previously got lucky (passed invalid parameters, but no noticable side effects) to run their exit sequence without the user asking them to. But yeah, something like return FALSE with GetLastError() being ERROR_INVALID_PARAMETER vs ERROR_SUCCESS or something would seem like a better work-around otherwise.</p>

		<p>Raymond, you might want to file a bug with MSDN; the GetMessage page says that you should avoid the &quot;while(GetMessage(&#8230;))&quot; form at all costs.</p>

		<p>What&#39;s this function again? I never heard of it (same way I never heard of WinMe for example). PeekMessage (especially with a while) and the counter-part PostMessage are all I need. GetMessage / SendMessage can become deprecated as far as I care. I live in a multi-thread world, and functions who will stop my show are a No-No.</p>

		<p>@Danny, see how far you get by posting WM_GETTEXT.</p>
<p>Also, if you live in a multi-thread world, why does your UI thread need to do anything but checking messages? Having other things to do than check messages is the only reason I can think of not to want to block on GetMessage &#8211; PeekMessage is fundamentally for a single-thread-multitasking programming model (i.e. you have other things to do than check messages in your main loop).</p>

<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
