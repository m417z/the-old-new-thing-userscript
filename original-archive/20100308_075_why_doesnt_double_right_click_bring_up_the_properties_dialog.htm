<p><a href="http://www.vacant-nebula.com/">kip</a> asks <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#836056"> why double-right-click isn't a shortcut for Properties</a>.</p>
<p> Recall the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/10/15/242761.aspx"> logical consequences of the way Windows converts single-clicks into double-clicks</a>. The double-click action is an extension of the single-click action. </p>
<p> In the case of context menus, the proposed double-right-click action is not an extension of the single-right-click, because the single-right-click displays a menu, whereas the double-right-click would go directly to the Properties dialog. Indeed, the way context menus are positioned on the screen specifically negates the possibility of double-right-click, for the context menu positions itself (under normal conditions) so that the click point is aligned with a dead spot on the menu. That way, when people who instinctively double-click everything do their double-right-click on an item, they get a context menu on the first right-click, and the second right-click is ignored. If the context menu were positioned so that the click point was aligned with an active location on the screen, then those habitual double-clickers would be accidentally invoking some context menu command when they really wanted to call up the context menu. </p>
<p> Now, if you decide to ignore the extension principle (and there are certainly lots of people who do), and if you decide that habitual double-clickers deserve to lose (and you're perfectly happy telling them that they're idiots who don't deserve the privilege of using a computer when they complain, "Your operating system is hard to use"), then you have to add <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/10/15/242761.aspx"> reaction delays</a> to single-clicks so you can perform separate single-click and double-click actions. Seeing as using right-click to display a context menu was not widely known prior to Windows&nbsp;95, it would probably be even more confusing if a right-click on Windows&nbsp;95 didn't do anything... only to have a menu appear a half second later after you had given up on the click and moved on. </p>
<p> The Alt+double-click (and equivalently, Alt+Enter) shortcuts were added as a concession, so that people whose lives wouldn't feel complete without a shortcut for calling up properties can finally die happy. </p>

		<p>Why doesn&#8217;t Alt+Enter bring up Properties dialog in the navigation pane? Why MS wants to force us to use right pane? It&#8217;s been broken since the obnoxious Vista and its successors.</p>

		<p>@Raymond: I&#8217;m sorry, but what can I do, it&#8217;s THE LAW :)</p>
<p>But now seriously, in your story you are talking about adding a feature for the people that want a shortcut, and I&#8217;m adding that the feature was later (partially) removed.</p>
<p>@Koro. I understand that I had to do some questionable things to get the results I want. If you are aware of a better (documented) way to do some of it, please let me know, I beg you. I&#8217;ll be glad to use the right API if it exists. But lets move this to the Source Forge forums (or Code Project if you prefer: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.codeproject.com/KB/shell/classicshell.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.codeproject.com/KB/shell/classicshell.aspx</a>). Raymond&#8217;s blog is not the right place for this discussion.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s how one takes it. Evidently, everyone takes it as Vista bashing even when it&#8217;s on-topic. I see it as a way to let Microsoft know that as users we want it back and that they need to do something about it in a hotfix or service pack, especially if it&#8217;s been ignored for half a decade.</p>

		<p>The title of the post is &quot;Why doesn&#8217;t double-right-click bring up the Properties dialog?&quot;.</p>
<p>Exactly HOW is the fact that Vista doesn&#8217;t support Alt+Enter shortcuts &#8216;on-topic&#8217; for that title?</p>
<p>I thought that a firm grasp of logic was a prerequisite for becoming a developer. Seems not!</p>

		<p>Two people pointed out the Alt+Enter inconsistency (and therefore lack of logic, in my logic). Although it was sligthly off topic (if every discussion is required to be pinpoint on topic, there wouldn&#8217;t be any discussion, again, in my logic), the response was (kind of) invokement of Goodwin&#8217;s law (see the first sentence of the last paragraph of &quot;Usage and corollaries&quot; section in Wikipedia article).</p>
<p>I&#8217;ll stop here because this is getting offtopic, but my opinion is that not every Vistabashing is undeserved.</p>

		<p>Lawrence &#8211; it is not &quot;on-topic&quot; for the title, but is &quot;on-topic&quot; for the contents of the article, particularly the last paragraph.</p>
<p>As an old-school DOS user, keyboard support (or lack of) is a pet peeve of mine. Historically Windows has had a very good track record of catering to keyboard users. There is simply no good reason why Alt+Enter should be broken in Vista. There is no way there was a usability study or a research that proved that this feature should be removed. Most likely some code got rewritten, the feature got broken, and nobody bothered to fix it. I wanted to have a constructive discussion about the problem but instead Raymond accused me of Vista-bashing, which brought in the real &quot;Vista sucks&quot; and &quot;you suck for saying Vista sucks&quot; crowds. Constructive discussion &#8211; what was I thinking!</p>

<p>LOL, no! If you were to see the crap that us poor maintenance dudes have to clean up to keep stuff running, you&#8217;d cry for the fate of humanity. TheDailyWTF doesn&#8217;t even start to capture the badness inside.</p>

		<p>&quot;I think we found another corollary to Godwin&#8217;s law: In any discussion about Windows, somebody will mention that Windows Vista sucks.&quot;</p>
<p>With such an attitude, I don&#8217;t think Windows 7 will see the success XP sees. Sure millions of copies are being sold but how does that translate into market share? How many users actually keep running Windows 7? It will be forever before any OS eclipses XP&#8217;s market share because of this very attitude to ignore little annoyances that result in feature loss.</p>

		<p>Thanks, Raymond! I forgot about that comment. I didn&#8217;t realize I had been reading this blog for at least 3.5 years already.</p>

		<p>a) Habitual double clickers can&#8217;t use Windows as it is. I tried it for a full five minutes and even the taskbar and shell act weird if you use your computer that way. And I don&#8217;t see why we should make special concessions to a small fraction of people who do such bizarre things. Although at this point it might be fun to mention that Windows 3.1 included a mouse tutorial. I&#8217;ve ran it on XP and several things go wrong, and it&#8217;s completable, but pretty much useless, too much water under the bridge and all that rot.</p>
<p>b) You could make the dead spot in the context menu react appropriately to the second click to hide itself and display the properties window. Also, if you receive two clicks within the double click time and within double click distance, you can be sure that a double click was intended. Sending them as two single clicks to different windows is certain to be a mistake. Maybe a slight redesign is in order.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
