<p>A customer explained that they had a program that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/12/23/10250556.aspx"> used the <code>IShell&shy;Link::<wbr>Get&shy;Path</wbr></code> method to extract the program that is the target of a shortcut</a>. They found that this <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/12/10/10375909.aspx"> didn't work for certain shortcuts</a>, namely, shortcuts whose targets are not physical file paths.</p>
<p> The one that they were specifically having trouble with was the Control Panel shortcut. For example, if you open the classic Control Panel, then drag any of the Control Panel items to the desktop, this will create a shortcut to that Control Panel item. If you view the properties on that shortcut, the Target will be grayed out instead of showing a path. </p>
<p> "We want to get the target path of the shortcut so that we can launch the application. How can we get the target path from <code>IShell&shy;Link::<wbr>Get&shy;Path</wbr></code>? Is there a special Windows API to get the path?" </p>
<p> They can't get the target path because these are shortcuts to virtual objects. <i>There is no target path to begin with</i>. </p>
<p> But if you look past the question to their problem, you can see that they don't need to know the path in the first place. All they want to do is launch the target application. The way to do this is simply to pass the shortcut to the <code>Shell&shy;Execute</code> function. You can take <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/11/26/270710.aspx"> this simple program</a> as inspiration. Pass <code>"open"</code> as the verb and the full path to the shortcut as the file. </p>
<p> As a bonus: Your program will also respect the other settings in the shortcut, like the Start In folder, the shortcut key, the preferred window state (normal, maximized, <i>etc</i>.), the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd378459(v=vs.85).aspx#where"> custom application user model ID</a>. </p>
<p> And to answer the question (even though it isn't needed to solve the problem): Use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb774942(v=vs.85).aspx"> the <code>IShell&shy;Link::<wbr>Get&shy;ID&shy;List</wbr></code> method</a> to obtain the shortcut target regardless of whether it is a physical file or virtual namespace item. </p>

		<p>Interesting that the customer was going to extra work, trying to find the target of a shortcut in order to launch the program. &nbsp;To be fair, passing the shortcut to ShellExecute is something that never crossed their mind; after all, in the documentation and samples for using ShellExecute, I&#39;ll bet the target is always a program (Notepad.exe is a favorite) and rarely or never a shortcut.</p>

		<p>One thing you need to remember when dealing with control panel idlists is that not all of them roundtrip to a parsing-name and back. (Mouse is one of them IIRC)</p>

		<p>Martin: almost any question that starts with &quot;why can&#39;t I&quot; and ends with &quot;don&#39;t ask why I need it&quot; probably has the answer &quot;because the designers didn&#39;t think anyone would need it or it never occurred to them as a feature in the first place&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Martin, you can, sort of. Win7 added the SLDF_ALLOW_LINK_TO_LINK flag. The normal way you create shortcuts does not use it for some reason. Create a shortcut to a dummy .lnX file and hex edit the .lnk or create an app that calls the API directly. (Pinning a link to a link to the startmenu will resolve the first link for some unknown reason)</p>

		<p>They likely wanted the CPL file, but yeah, this is a case of &quot;how do I do this the way we&#39;ve always done it&quot; rather than &quot;what is the proper way to do this&quot;. Some CPL files can hold multiple control panels IIRC.</p>
<p>I have to wonder if the customer&#39;s actual root problem involved a shortcut, or if a shortcut was the result of them solving the &quot;easy part&quot; of the problem themselves. (Maybe the problem was more like &quot;How do I invoke a specific control panel?&quot;).</p>

		<p>By the way, what&#39;s the meaning of respecting &quot;shortcut key&quot; in launching by ShellExecute?</p>
<p>What&#39;s the significance/effect of shortcut key when you&#39;ve already decided to execute the link? Or is it a typo?</p>

		<p>I had the same question in mind: Whats the meaning of shortcuts in lnk files in general? What if 5 lnks use the same shortcut? Will the shell deep-search C: to know all shortcuts of all lnk files?</p>

		<p>&quot;The shell will apply the shortcut to the app that got launched, so you can use the shortcut to switch back to the app quickly.&quot;</p>
<p>Is there any user who knows about this? &quot;Normal&quot; shortcuts like Win+E also launch the app which seems impossible with shortcuts in lnk files.</p>

		<p>@GunsSmoker: Yes it should. NULL means: Users preferred verb &gt; &quot;open&quot; &gt; First found during RegEnum &gt; &quot;openwith&quot;. (The RegEnum step is missing on Win9x IIRC)</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve known about shortcut keys since forever, but I had no idea they were also a magic switch-to-app button.</p>
<p>I&#39;m also failing to grasp the point of shortcut-to-shortcut-to-thing or deeper. The chain becomes ever-more-fragile with each step that gets added, and it&#39;s not at all clear how the settings (specified per shortcut) would layer. Even if rules were designed, there&#39;s a nontrivial chance they&#39;d be the wrong rules for some users&#8230;</p>
<p>I thought Win9x was stupid for having .lnk files that weren&#39;t clean and simple symlinks, but they turned out to have more features, and then Linux sprouted .desktop files. Hmm.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
