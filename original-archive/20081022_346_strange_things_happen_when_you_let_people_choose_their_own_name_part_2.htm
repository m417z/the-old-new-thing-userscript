<p>I described <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/10/21/9008384.aspx"> last time</a> how most parts of your entry in the company address book are closely regulated, but the differentiator is left to the honor system. Here are two and a half more examples of people who decided to do something funny with their bonus text.</p>
<p> A message was sent to a mailing list I happen to be a member of, and the sender's name was listed as "John Doe (O|||||O)". I told John that I though the (<a href="http://jeeps.thefuntimesguide.com/2005/11/jeep_templates_1.php">O|||||O</a>) was hilarious, and he wrote back, "Also, call my phone and listen to how the autobot says my name." </p>
<p> I did, of course. The text to speech synthesizer pronounced his name as <i>John Doe overtical bracket vertical bracket vertical bracketo</i>. </p>
<p> Number two: <a href="http://www.leeholmes.com/"> Lee Holmes</a>, <a href="http://www.leeholmes.com/blog/default.aspx"> PowerShell blogger extraordinaire</a>, uses as his differentiator a PowerShell prompt. He shows up in the address book as "Lee Holmes (PS C:\&gt; _)". Oh, and wait, it's fancier than that. The underscore <i>blinks</i>, albeit at a glacial rate: Every so often, Lee removes the underscore from the differentiator or adds it back. </p>
<p> And here's the half: <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/robert_hensing/"> Robert Hensing</a> changed his name in the address book to <a href="http://blogs.technet.com/antimalware/archive/2008/01/10/mbr-rootkit-virtool-winnt-sinowal-a-report.aspx"> Robert Hensing (EL CONQUISTADOR)</a> (not to be confused with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uz6amk3P-hY"> the shoe</a>). This is only half of an example because I'm not going to tell you why he chose "EL CONQUISTADOR" to go after his name. I'll leave the story for him to tell (if he feels so inclined). </p>

		<p>If you&#8217;ve got a self appointed guru try and convince him to change his to John Doe (<em>?</em>) because everyone comes to him for questions. &nbsp;If he&#8217;s not really a guru he won&#8217;t know this is a chat dumb butt.</p>
<p>Was the big G&#8217;s differentiator used? &nbsp;I wouldn&#8217;t think so, but it would&#8217;ve been hilarious to see him use (<em>$</em>) since he has so much money coming out of his.</p>

		<p>So just to clarify, we&#8217;ve plumbed a new low &#8211; someone has nitpicked Raymond&#8217;s description of the level of funniness of the joke. It was not funny enough to warrant being described as, &quot;hilarious&quot; but merely, &quot;funny.&quot;</p>

<p>With a PowerShell script interfaced to the Exchange server, naturally.</p>
<p>And since the differentiator accepts HTML punctuation, the next obvious choice is &lt;blink&gt;_&lt;/blink&gt;</p>
<p>Oops, there goes the honor system.</p>

  &quot;Also, call my phone and listen to how the autobot says my name.&quot;&quot;

<p>Snarky/Igor/Yusheng Comment: You&#8217;d think it would be Decepticons who work at Microsoft&#8230; then again&#8230; maybe they really did capture an Autobot.</p>

		<p>Now I feel like emailing the few Microsoft contacts I know and ask them what their differentiators are. But I did a quick scan of my inbox and I see one, maybe two with the differentiators listed &#8211; the rest are showing up as boring &quot;John Doe&quot; and such. What gives? Sometimes they leak out, but mostly not&#8230;</p>
<p>Then again, I doubt they have anything interesting.</p>
<p>I also may have to ask them to find out what Raymond&#8217;s differentiator is&#8230;. *grin*.</p>

		<p>My differentiator is:</p>
<p>KC Lemson (UX Jedi Master)</p>
<p>Although I&#8217;ve had that for about six months now, so I think it&#8217;s time for a change. UX Ninja, perhaps? Although that would basically just be copying the xbox emulation ninjas&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
