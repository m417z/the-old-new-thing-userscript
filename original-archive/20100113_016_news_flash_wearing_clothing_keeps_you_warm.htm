		<p>The solution to the steroids problem is obvious: make steroid use mandatory. &nbsp;Problem solved. &nbsp;Seriously, at this point I just don&#8217;t care about it anymore.</p>

<p>You don&#8217;t want to encourage junior (and amateur) athletes to use steroids, do you? They aren&#8217;t exactly healthy, after all.</p>

		<p>Putting on a sweater doesn&#8217;t fix the fundamental problem: It&#8217;s to cold. Only global warming can fix that!</p>

		<p>Julian: the &quot;age 25&quot; one is not the newspaper&#8217;s error, as you can see if you can make out the blurry attribution of the quote to former Colorado state senator Mary Anne Tebedo.</p>
<p>Like bahbar already pointed out about #7, it doesn&#8217;t really fit in with the rest of the list.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve worked for a (small) newspaper before as an assistant editor.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that headlines are usually written (or rewritten) by editors, rather than the original writers; silly, obvious, or humorous headlines are often intentional, most often to attract attention. A particularly goofy headline will often lead you to at least read the lead paragraph of an otherwise mundane story. Call it the &quot;made you look&quot; affect. (Mysterious/silly/disconcertingly obvious hyperlink descriptions can also lead to the &quot;Made you click&quot; effect).</p>
<p>In more politically charged publications, obvious headlines can be used to reinforce audience prejudices, or to trivialize the people involved in the story.</p>

		<p>The Wall Street Journal&#8217;s James Taranto often includes two different segments with variations on this theme in an online column, one titled &quot;News of the Tautological&quot; and one titled &quot;What would we do without *?&quot; where * is experts, scientists, sources (referring to an article titled &quot;Explosives in Detroit Terror Case Could Have Blown Hole in Airplane, Sources Say&quot;), etc.:</p>

		<p>I was surprised by the statement &quot;Mark McGwire admits to using steriods&quot;. &nbsp;It&#8217;s the &quot;admits&quot; part that surprised me, not the truth about whether he used steriods in the past. &nbsp;Those are two different things, the doing and the admitting.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
