When I described the two ways that the <code>TIME_ZONE_INFORMATION</code>
structure represents the rules for daylight saving time,
commenter Voo
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/03/11/10139574.aspx#10140261">
argued</a> (and I hope I interpreted the message correctly)
that either there should be two functions, one for each of the ways,
or have
<code>Get&shy;Time&shy;Zone&shy;Information&shy;For&shy;Year</code>
function calculate the day automatically from the week and return that.
That way, callers always see the correct day.
</p>
<p>
Okay, there are multiple things in play here,
but they all boil down to "no code is an island".
</p>
<p>
If all you needed to support was a way to answer the
question "When does daylight saving time start and end
in this specific year",
then certainly the <var>n</var>th week rules could be
interpreted by the
<code>Get&shy;Time&shy;Zone&shy;Information&shy;For&shy;Year</code>
function,
so that all that came out of the function was a specific date and time.
</p>
<p>
But that's not the only function that deals with time zone information.
For starters, we have
<code>Get&shy;Time&shy;Zone&shy;Information</code>.
Since this function is not dependent on the year,
it wouldn't know what year to use to calculate
the date on which the third Sunday falls.
It would have to leave the structure in generic form.
</p>
<p>
Now, maybe you say, "Yeah, these two functions return
the same structure, and you just have to know that one of
the functions will autoconvert and the other won't."
Some people will find that confusing.
</p>
<p>
Maybe you solve that problem by saying,
"These two functions return
different structures, reflecting their different
natures."
Some people will be frustrated by that,
because they will have to write two versions
of the same function, one for each structure.
</p>
<p>
(I'm not event going to bother adding
<code>Get&shy;Dynamic&shy;Time&shy;Zone&shy;Information</code>.
to the mix.)
</p>
<p>
And then there's the question of whether it's okay
that the <code>Get</code> function returns a structure
that cannot be passed into the corresponding
<code>Set</code> function.
(Which is a bit of a pointless question here,
seeing as there is no
<code>Set&shy;Time&shy;Zone&shy;Information&shy;For&shy;Year</code>
function, but maybe someday it will show up.)
It also means that you cannot compare two
<code>TIME_ZONE_INFORMATION</code>
structures from different years to see whether
the time zone transition rules are the same in those years.
(This is, admitted, a fringe scenario.)
</p>
<p>
Two functions seems the less crazy way out.
There would be a
<code>Get&shy;Unexpanded&shy;Time&shy;Zone&shy;Information&shy;For&shy;Year</code>
which returns the unprocesed information
and a
<code>Get&shy;Expanded&shy;Time&shy;Zone&shy;Information&shy;For&shy;Year</code>
that does the date lookup for the appropriate year.
Though personally, I would keep
<code>Get&shy;Time&shy;Zone&shy;Information&shy;For&shy;Year</code>
as-is and add a
<code>Calculate&shy;Daylight&shy;Saving&shy;Transition&shy;Dates&shy;For&shy;Year</code>
function.
That way, you could use it to expand other things.
</p>
<p>
I suspect no such
<code>Calculate&shy;Daylight&shy;Saving&shy;Transition&shy;Dates&shy;For&shy;Year</code>
function exists because the kernel folks have
a general bias against writing functions that you could
have written yourself,
so that they can focus on writing functions that
you <i>can't</i> write yourself because
it requires special access to things that only the
kernel has access to.
(Like querying the current time zone.) </p>

		<p>Calculate­Daylight­Saving­Transition­Dates­For­Year is also impossible to write as the kernal does not have access to a time machine. In 1960 would you know what that function should have returned if passed &#8220;UK&#8221; and &#8220;1970&#8221; ?</p>

		<p>Um, why doesn&#8217;t the time zone live in user space?  The current time probably needs to go through the kernel, since that&#8217;s direct hardware access, but why the time zone?</p>

		<p>The current timezone is a global setting, not user-level (unless you&#8217;re running in Terminal Services mode, in which case remote logins can provide a timezone for the session).  It&#8217;s managed in the kernel with the rest of the date/time functions.  I have no idea why it&#8217;s not a user setting, but them&#8217;s the breaks.</p>

		<p>The time zone is a kernel setting because the kernel uses local time (at least for some purposes). The kernel uses local time because the hardware clock is assumed to be in local time, and so are FAT timestamps. These are local time for compatibility with DOS. DOS used local time because… well, it was the obvious choice for a single-user system with no network connection.</p>
<p>The time zone is a user-mode setting on Unix systems, because they use UTC for almost everything, and convert to and from local time on input and output. Unix uses UTC because… well, it was the obvious choice for a multi-user system with people dialing in by teletype from all over.</p>

		<p>Yeah.  I guess my point was that this expectation could&#8217;ve been changed with Windows NT, but they opted not to.  Probably because of compatibility with DOS applications (or more likely, OS/2 applications).</p>

		<p>This is a valid concern. Unfortunately, other OSs follow the same path, even though they cannot easily get updated. This way, the user is sometimes forced to change the time zone only to avoid automatic DST switch on a device that was programmed for an outdated version of a local law.</p>

		<p>I once read the not-totally-unconvincing argument that DST is actually (somewhat) *more* natural than same-time-all-year.<br />
The reasoning was something like: in ancient times without clocks humans started to rise when the sun rises (plus/minus a fixed delta). Only after clocks and artificial lighting was introduced the &#8220;office starts all days at nine&#8221; was introduced, meaning you have to get up unnaturally early in winter (and late in summer). DST tries to emulate the everyday changing rising of the sun to some degree, but because nobody wants to change their clocks everyday (or business starting time, train schedules etc) does so in one one-hour increment, which is obviously non-ideal in itself, too. With electronic clocks this could be done, but it&#8217;s probably too late now :-)</p>

		<p>I think it would make a lot of sense for businesses to say &#8220;from March–November, we&#8217;re open from 8am–5pm, and from November–March, we&#8217;re open from 9am–6pm&#8221; or similar, rather than deal with everyone changing their clocks and all the repercussions thereof.</p>

<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
