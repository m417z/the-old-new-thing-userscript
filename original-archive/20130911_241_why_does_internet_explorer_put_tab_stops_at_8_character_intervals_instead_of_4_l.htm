<p>When you embed a TAB character (U+0009) in a &lt;PRE&gt; block (or more precisely, an element whose <code>white-space</code> CSS property is computed to be <code>pre</code> or <code>pre-wrap</code>), Internet Explorer will move the current position to the next multiple of eight characters. Many people prefer four. (Some <i>insist</i> that only four is the correct value and anybody who disagrees with them is simply wrong.)</p>
<p> Why eight? </p>
<p> Because that's <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/CSS21/text.html#white-space-model"> what the standard says</a>. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> All tabs (U+0009) are rendered as a horizontal shift that lines up the start edge of the next glyph with the next tab stop. Tab stops occur at points that are multiples of 8 times the width of a space (U+0020) rendered in the block's font from the block's starting content edge.  </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Note that the standard does not provide an extensibility point to customize the position of tab stops. The number eight is hard-coded into the standard. If you don't like that, then don't use tabs. (There appears to be a draft proposal to add a <code>tab-size</code> property to control this, but nothing standard yet, at least not at the time I originally wrote this article.) </p>
<p> Okay, but why did the standard pick eight as the tab stop interval? I don't know (never having attended any CSS standardization meetings), but I suspect they were observing existing practice. For reasons unknown even to Wikipedia, teletypewriter tab stops were historically placed at eight-column intervals. </p>

<p>Four is good for source code and markup, but I find ten (yes, ten!) best when writing SQL. Then again, I always turn on the IDE&#39;s &#39;replace tabs with spaces&#39; feature.</p>

		<p>Tab size 4 is obviously too small if you are using the TAB character for its original purpose (i.e. to arrange some numbers into columns).</p>
<p>Tab size 8 is good if you are using a TTY with a common line size (e.g. 72, 80, 64, or 40 characters per line) &#8211; the tab stops split the line evenly.</p>

		<p>Back in the olden days (Oh! No! &nbsp;There he goes again!), unit record equipment (i.e., keypunch machines) had a tab stop so the operator could move quickly across a card. &nbsp;Each tab stop came at intervals of 8. &nbsp;I heard, but can&#39;t verify that the reason was is that there were 80 data columns on a card and tab stops of 8 worked well since it allowed the operator to move ahead by 1/10th of a card with a single keypress.</p>

		<p>Anyfoo, this just pushes the question back one layer, but I bet it&#39;s because punch cards were most commonly 80 columns. &nbsp;Wikipedia also suggests this: &quot;A legacy of the 80 column punched card format is that a display of 80 characters per row was a common choice in the design of character-based terminals.&quot;</p>

		<p>anyfoo: Allegedly, it&#39;d due to IBM punch cards having 80 columns. The punch card size was supposedly based on the size of punch cards used in the 1890 census, which was based on currency size in 1890 so they could reuse the currency holders to hold punch cards. Why was currency that size? Who knows. I have no backup for any of that, but it makes for a good story.</p>

		<p>Just a guess, but a US standard 8.5 inch wide sheet of paper in with standard typewriter Pica (10 cpi) can do 85 characters per line with no margin.</p>
<p>Leaving a (very small) quarter inch for each margin allows up to 80 characters per typewritten line.</p>
<p>Supporting 80 characters on a punch-card (and later teletype and video terminals) could support the longest reasonable typewritten line.</p>

		<p>One should note that there are NOT 80 columns on an 80 column punch card. &nbsp;There are 80 DATA Columns and 1 column for a verify punch thus giving a total of 81 columns.</p>

		<p>Because if you make it customizable, people will customize it weirdly, breaking the intention of &lt;PRE&gt; as &quot;I just embedded a pre-formatted document&quot;. It just so happens in the long end of things that source code is the last thing using tabs and we use it for block indentation and we have a protocol that can be used to make it a personal preference.</p>

		<p>The tabulation feature goes back over a century to manual typewriters. On those machines you would set stops on a rack for the various table columns, and pressing the Tabulate key would move the carriage to the next stop.</p>
<p>Their use for paragraph indentation was secondary, or they would have called the key &#39;Indent&#39;.</p>
<p>Typewriters had adjustable stops, the electronic printers that followed them had adjustable stops, and ISO 6429 even defines a way for terminals to programmatically set tab stops (see HTS in <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_6429">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/ISO_6429</a>), so it&#39;s not clear where the 8-space default came from.</p>
<p>The usual font size was 10cpi, so 5 spaces was a half-inch (and the standard for paragraph indentation). So why wasn&#39;t the de facto standard 5 spaces then? The closest I&#39;ve found to an explanation is that 8 is a power of 2 and easier to implement in the transistor-based devices of the 70s.</p>

		<p>Unix actually has a program called (unsurprisingly) tabs which (by default) resets the programmable tab stops to intervals of 8 characters.</p>

		<p>@12BitSlab: I used 80-column cards for several years when learning FORTRAN, assembler, and PL/I back in the 70s&#8230; there are exactly 80 columns (and 12 rows) on the &quot;Hollerith&quot; card used in that era on IBM mainframes. &nbsp;I actually had to start with an ancient, art-deco 026 keypunch that punched BCD (from which EBCDIC was Extended). &nbsp;One had to learn several over-punches to get several characters punched correctly.</p>

		<p>To even talk about &quot;how many characters&quot; a tab is equivalent to is to put yourself in a state of sin. To insist that the number be an integer is an abomination.</p>
<p>A tab takes you to the next column, pure and simple. How many characters you can fit into a column depends on the font and (for variable pitch fonts) your characters. You should believe with all your soul that your esteemed colleague at the next desk uses a different font and therefore there simply is no answer to the question &quot;how many characters&quot;.</p>

		<p>@ Mr. Cranky &#8212; a keypunch machine could be in 1 of two modes &#8212; punch or verify. &nbsp;In &quot;punch&quot; mode, the first 80 columns were open to be punched and the 81st column oculd not be punched. &nbsp;In &quot;verify&quot; mode, a card that was already punched was punched again, except that no punches were recorded in columns 1-80. &nbsp;The machine &quot;verified&quot; that the two efforts were the same. &nbsp;After punching the 80th column, if all punches matched, the machine automatically put a punch in column 81 indicating that the data had been verified. &nbsp;Programmers &#8211; as we used to be called &#8212; almost never used verify mode. &nbsp;That was the realm of data entry operators.</p>

		<p>@RaceProUK: Of course DOS/Windows is correct. Think about it everyone, &lt;LF&gt; should do just that, feed the line and move the cursor down one vertical row, staying in the same horizontal column (this is how old terminals worked). &lt;CR&gt; should move you back to the beginning of the line. Both together should bring you to the beginning of the next line.</p>
<p>@Maurits: Shouldn&#39;t matter, but the convention is &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt;</p>
<p>Off topic, but since I mentioned old terminals, back in my college days I used to create a whole file consisting of nothing but &lt;CTRL&gt;-G characters and dump that to the line printer in the back of the computer lab. It was fun to watch the lab monitor run up to the back of the room to try to find out why the printer was beeping uncontrollably.</p>

		<p>I wonder if the convention is &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; because the physical operation of moving the carriage all the way to the left takes slightly longer than the physical operation of rotating the paper drum by one line. Perhaps CR was implemented asynchronously in some contexts.</p>

		<p>@Maurits,</p>
<p>One obvious example: barring adequate buffering and/or flow control, carriage return and other carriage control operations are asynchronous with respect to a teletype&#39;s input. See, e.g., the UNIX 6th edition manual,</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://man.cat-v.org/unix-6th/2/stty">man.cat-v.org/&#8230;/stty</a></p>
<p>where delays for CR, LF, FF, HT, VT, and BS tailored to the performance characteristics of various terminal devices are described. Amusingly, vestigial support for these &quot;delay types&quot; persists in modern UNIX specs, see, e.g.,</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7908799/xsh/termios.h.html">pubs.opengroup.org/&#8230;/termios.h.html</a></p>

		<p>@Maurits, it&#39;s mechanical. The lever in typewriters requires less force to roll the platen vertically than to push the platen. This way, you could make &quot;ladder&quot; phrases. This was not very common, but it was even less common to just push the platen without changing line.</p>
<p>Hence, you&#39;re right about the effort, but that is intentional.</p>
<p>However, CR LF is actually in the reverse order, perhaps in an attempt to prevent the last line feed to eject a new (albeit empty) sheet of paper in the early printers. With LF CR, you&#39;d have an extra hardware register, adding complexity to detect that the characters were followed. Even in more advanced hardware, the software would become a bit more complicated just because.</p>

		<p>@RaceProUK, Mac is right (LF CR), Windows so-so (CR LF, but the same effect), Unix thought about saving one byte per line (LF only).</p>
<p>But in fact, for pure computer text, it&#39;s not common to have a pure &quot;line feed&quot;-only and it doesn&#39;t make sense anymore to have two characters. Yet, we have to live with ancient artifacts in file streams being binary vs text mainly because of this, the other reason being character encoding. But encoding came after, and only the recent languages/libraries had them in mind since inception.</p>

Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
