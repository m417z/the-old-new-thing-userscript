<p><i>Bug jail</i> is not a place where bugs are sent as punishment for their crimes. Rather, it's a (virtual) place that developers are sent when they have too many bugs.</p>
<p> Project management establishes some maximum number of bugs (known as a <i>bug cap</i>) each developer is permitted to have <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/04/14/9547557.aspx"> on his or her plate</a>, and developers whose bug count exceeds the specified maximum are placed in <i>bug jail</i>. The precise triggers for bug jail vary from team to team, and it may vary based on the nature of the bug. For example, one trigger might be that any <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/11/21/9131198.aspx"> Priority&nbsp;0</a> bugs more than 24 hours old will land you in bug jail. </p>
<p> Once you land in bug jail, you are not allowed to do feature work, be it coding, writing specifications, whatever. The precise triggers for getting out of bug jail also vary from team to team, but one rule might be that you need to get your bug count back down to 50% of the bug jail trigger level before you are allowed to exit. </p>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/06/30/10032415.aspx"> Staying on top of your bug count is an important part of the software development process</a>, and the primary motivation behind bug jail is not to punish developers, although I'm sure that's how most developers perceive it. Rather, it serves as an early-warning system to highlight things that are not going smoothly. There may be a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/09/20/10213768.aspx"> bug farm</a> developing in that feature area. Or the team needs to revise its idea of what it means to be "done" with the feature. And it's a signal to project management that they may need to scale back their plans so as not to compromise quality and the ship schedule. </p>
<p> When everybody understands the reasoning behind bug jail, you avoid lengthy discussions over boundary cases ("What if a developer is about to check in a feature but a low-priority bug comes in that pushes them over the limit?") and avoid discovering that people have been "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/11/16/10091537.aspx">gaming the system</a>" (for example, by reclassifying bugs as feature requests so they don't count toward the bug cap). Like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/06/08/10021303.aspx"> bug hugging</a>, these sorts of games prevent project management from truly understanding how close the project is to being finished. </p>

		<p>Maybe people would try to avoid it less if you didn&#39;t call it bug jail, but something that sounds less like a punishment. Getting promoted to the Anti Bug Squad, for example.</p>

		<p>As a general guideline, this sounds great. It&#39;s a bad idea to let your bugs grow out of control while you work on new features. Fixing bugs quickly reduces development time and makes it easier for the rest of the team to work with each developer&#39;s features. Using this a hard and fast rule can lead to some really silly behavior that can cause more harm than good. From your last paragraph, it sounds like this is not allowed to get out of control.</p>

		<p>The idea sounds sensible, certainly &#8211; in part as a safeguard against people pushing you for features in place of fixing bugs.</p>
<p>&quot;Could you make Explorer steam the milk for my coffee when it boots up?&quot;</p>
<p>&quot;No can do, bug jail&quot;</p>
<p>More diplomatic than having to explain &#39;sorry, your milk-steaming request is a lower priority than that other guy&#39;s request for a cup-holder&#39;, at least.</p>

		<p>Whatever they&#39;re doing, it doesn&#39;t seem to have stopped many bugs getting out to customers. &nbsp;People on my team are hitting a VS2010 bug in which one or more local variables are greyed out in the debugger&#39;s Watch window (&quot;CXX0017: Error: symbol &quot;fBestZ&quot; not found&quot;). &nbsp;Can&#39;t be inspected, can&#39;t be modified. &nbsp;Apparently Microsoft is aware of the problem but has no plans to fix it until VS2012 (?). &nbsp;Needless to say, a debugger has limited use under these circumstances.</p>

<p>&quot;Whatever they&#39;re doing, it doesn&#39;t seem to have stopped many bugs getting out to customers.&quot;</p>
<p>And how exactly do you derive your metric of how many bugs were stopped? The amount of bugs in a project after its release is not a reliable indicator of how many were found and fixed during development. But I understand that an overwhelming desire to complain can blur the lines of logic.</p>
<p>At my previous employer, I used to be one of the few developpers who liked fixing bugs better than writing new features. Bug jail sounds like a fun place to me!</p>

		<p>If some new bit of code is generating enough bugs to put its developer into bug jail you&#39;re probably better off keeping that developer off of new features. Bugs don&#39;t come from the code, they come from the developers. Of course this breaks down if the bugs are not assigned to the developer who wrote the buggy code.</p>

		<p>Individual contributor bug counts are ignorant of the fact that we now live in a world where software is such a community driving process that any individual&#39;s bugs are not consequential. &nbsp;The bugs belong to the common consciousness. &nbsp;Although there may be individuals better at fixing the bugs, or ignoring their presence, the responsibility as a whole lies on every developer.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
</div><br/>
