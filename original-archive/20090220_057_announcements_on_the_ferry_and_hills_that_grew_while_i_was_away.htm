<p>This weekend is the annual <a href="http://www.cascade.org/EandR/chilly/index.cfm"> Chilly Hilly</a> bike ride, an early wake-up call to bicyclists in the Seattle area to get their act together and hit the road.</p>
<p> Last year, I joined <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004199188_chillyhilly25m.html"> my 2999 closest friends up and down the hills of Bainbridge Island</a>. Unfortunately, the hills had <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/08/448970.aspx"> grown taller</a> in the two years since my last ride. </p>
<p> There was an <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/06/19/636824.aspx"> announcement on the ferry</a>. It went something like this: "Your attention please. There is a bicycle on the car deck that has <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/watson_house/3301394737/"> fallen over onto its side</a>. Repeat: A bicycle has fallen onto its side." </p>
<p> It took a few seconds for the joke to sink in with all the people on the ferry, but after a short while, the passenger deck was chuckling. </p>

		<p>I&#8217;m used to not understanding the programming articles here, but apparently I&#8217;m such a dim bulb I don&#8217;t understand the humor either. Why is this worthy of a chuckle?</p>
<div class=post>[<i>A bicycle falling onto its side is a totally insignificant event (indeed most of them start the ferry ride on their side already). It&#8217;s like saying, &#8220;Your attention please: There is car on deck B with a map that has not been folded up properly.&#8221; It&#8217;s funny because the initial wording of the announcement suggests that something dire has happened, but when you get to the end, you realize it&#8217;s something insignificant. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I would say I have at least 50/50 shot of somewhat understanding the programming articles (caring is a different matter; I don&#8217;t do Windows programming right now), but I also didn&#8217;t get it until Raymond was kind enough to explain.</p>
<p>Maybe I&#8217;m too used to having a kickstand, and thinking of it as vital equipment or something like that. ;-)</p>

		<p>It is a lot funnier if you put yourself in the perspective of the guy looking over the deck, some standing up but probably most casually strewn about lying whichever way; and then making the announcement. &nbsp;It helps if you like your humor so dry it crumbles to dust in your fingers. &nbsp;It also helps if you think having to explain such a joke is even funnier.</p>

		<p>I must admit, after visualizing an entire parking deck cluttered with bicycles, the majority of them laying on their sides&#8230; it is worthy of a chuckle :D</p>

		<p>How was the ride? My wife and I had planned to go this year but they were calling for pretty bad weather and we were not relishing the thought of those hills in the rain. :) Turned out to be a simply fantastic day! At least we got a 7 mile run in&#8230; but we&#8217;re still regretting not attending.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>It was a fine ride, thanks for asking. I assess each Chilly Hilly as a win/lose/draw. My goal was to fight Chilly Hilly to a draw, but I beat it this year. (I measure success by how well I fare on the last few hills.) My record is now 2 wins, 1 loss. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I enjoy commuting on this ferry daily. &nbsp;Most of the announcements are either safety related or asking people to turn off their car alarms in their sensitive cars. &nbsp;They are mostly humorless and functional.</p>
<p>We do get the occasional announcements of about Orca whales, boomer submarines on their way into Bremerton, lunar eclipses, or funerals as people’s ashes are sent on their way. &nbsp;It’s all pretty relaxed.</p>
<p>A few years back, I finally got my wife to ride on my motorcycle that I commute on, so we went to the grocery store in downtown Bainbridge Island. &nbsp;I parked my bike with the kick stand (side stand) and went inside. &nbsp;A few minutes later there was an announcement for the owner of the motorcycle to please return to it. &nbsp;It turns out we had a “little” earthquake and the bike fell over onto a leased BMW. &nbsp;As it turns out, there was no harm done, but my wife took this as a omen and hasn’t ridden on it since.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
