<p>One of my colleagues moved to Granada last year, and he kindly provided me <a href="http://www.dobleve.org/blog/2008/03/12/places-to-eat-in-madrid/"> some recommendations for places to eat in Madrid</a>. We found El Brillante easily, positioned across the street from the Atoche train station, with its back door and terrace facing the <a href="http://www.museoreinasofia.es/"> <i lang="es">Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia</i></a> (which mercifully goes by the nickname <i lang="es">Museo Reina Sofia</i>). But once you step inside to order your lunch, you enter a crowded, cacophanous world with people yelling back and forth and nothing even resembling a line.</p>
<p> Here is how to have lunch at El Brillante: </p>
<ul>
<li>When you step inside, you will find the restaurant in the shape     of a long, wide hallway, with a path down the center and     a set of counters along each wall.     Go to the side with the bar.     The bar is the crowded place with the beer tap,     as opposed to the cook who is the busy but     lonely guy with the cases of food in front of him. </li>
<li>Work your way to the bar, which may be very crowded.     We found that if you wander towards the side facing the museum,     the bar is much less crowded. </li>
<li>The counter staff will come to you when it's your turn.     I don't know whether there is an     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/05/27/8553639.aspx#8556948">     invisible queue</a>     or whether you have to get the attention of a staff person.     When I was there, I was the only one waiting to order,     so even if there were a queue, I was the only person in it. </li>
<li>Place your order. Do it in Spanish because nobody speaks English here.     Fortunately, each item on the menu is numbered, so if you've learned     your numbers, you can at least order your food.     For beverages, you're on your own. </li>
<li>The counter staff will shout your order to the cook on the other     side of the hall. </li>
<li>Enjoy your beverage while you wait for your food.     Soak up the atmosphere as the counter staff shout more orders to     the cook, the waiters from the terrace come in and shout five or     six orders to the cook in rapid succession,     the cook shouts completed orders to the wait staff,     waiters deliver the food to the counter and shout the order     to the counter staff...     You may have noticed that there's a lot of shouting.     That's just the way they do it here.     Don't fight it. Revel in it. </li>
<li>Eat your food.     Watch the counter staff juggle multiple tasks:     Shouting orders, pouring drinks,     making coffee,     washing dishes,     settling bills.     Note that this arrangement would be a major health code violation     in the United States, because the United States is safety-obsessed. </li>
<li>Napkin dispensers are on the counter, and you're going to run through     a lot of napkins. But where's the trash?     At your feet.     The kickplate is a trough for soiled napkins. </li>
<li>When you're finished, get your server's attention     (I asked for <i lang="es">la cuenta</i>&mdash;the check).     But there is no actual check.     The server merely calculates your bill in his head and tells you     the total.     Of course, if your knowledge of Spanish is limited to     <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jg3WY2Sgxtw">     counting to twenty</a>     (<a href="http://www.sesameworkshop.org/aboutus/newsletter_article.php?contentId=100110">learned from watching Sesame Street as a child</a>),     you may not understand what he says.     If you have a pen, you can ask the counter staff to     write the total on a napkin for you. </li>
<li>Pay, leave a 5% tip, and head out on your way. </li>
</ul>
<p> As you can see, it's a well-choreographed zoo. </p>
<p> Oh, and the food is good, too. That's why the place is so crowded. During our brief stay, we saw calamari sandwiches whipping past one after another; they are apparently <a href="http://umamimart.blogspot.com/2008/02/mangiamo-2007-el-brillante.html"> famous for them</a>. </p>

		<p>We were there a couple months ago and loved it&#8230; my wife was desperately looking for a non-smoking place to eat (More difficult than you might imagine, since the Madrid government has decided to not enforce the nonsmoking laws as a political statement).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s cute that you are still leaving tips&#8230;</p>

		<p>A couple of remarks:</p>
<ul>
<li>In Spain is not mandatory leaving a tip, although is very common (I noticed that some Portuguese commenters said the same about Lisbon, so maybe it&#8217;s an Iberian issue). Anyway, in most sites you leave the change as tip, unless you are a big group of people or you feel great about the service (tips around 1â‚¬ are OK in most cases for two-three people).</li>
<li>
<p>The calamari sandwiches (&quot;bocadillo de calamares&quot;) are the typical &quot;tapa&quot; of Madrid, you can probably find very good sandwiches in a lot of bars of the city.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>PS: Due to the fact that the first time I saw the word &quot;calamari&quot; was in Star Wars, when I saw &quot;calamari sandwich&quot; I couldn&#8217;t help but to imagine Admiral Ackbar between a couple of bread slices&#8230; Well, I think that this utterly confirm that I&#8217;m a geek :-)</p>

		<p>We need to find a way to collect these tidbits in a howto book of some sort&#8230; then when you&#39;re there you follow the procedure and you&#39;re done, rather than stuck looking how to order.</p>

		<p>5% tip is a lot. You&#8217;re definitively American :)</p>
<p>And I know 5% is a lot because I&#8217;ve worked as a waiter in Spain. Spaniards usually leave nothing or just a few coins.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
