<p>This past weekend, a group of us went on one last training ride before the <a href="http://www.cascade.org/EandR/stp/"> STP</a>, which begins tomorrow. The Burke-Gilman is a multipurpose trail, with bicyclists sharing the path with walkers, joggers, inline skaters, sometimes even people on horseback. (Inline nitpicker's corner: The horseback riders are on the Sammamish River Trail, which is technically a different trail from the Burke-Gilman even though the two connect seamlessly.)</p>
<p> As you cycle past a group, you can sometimes catch a few words of conversation. Usually, those words are not noteworthy at all. "...said to her..." or "...opened up..." or "...whenever the..." </p>
<p> Except when I passed one pair of walkers, I heard one of them say "...concentration camp..." </p>
<p> <b>Traffic alert</b> </p>
<p> According to the <a href="http://www.wsdot.wa.gov/Northwest/King/Construction/#520Closure"> Washington State Department of Transportation Construction Updates web site</a>, "Crews will completely close SR 520 between Montlake Blvd. and 108th Avenue NE from 11 p.m. Friday to 5 a.m. Monday for the annual maintenance and inspection." Curiously, this isn't losted on the <a href="http://wsdot.wa.gov/traffic/trafficalerts/default.aspx?route=SR%20520&amp;view=main&amp;action=3"> SR 520 Travel Alerts</a> page. </p>

		<p>I once overheard two girls who were cycling in the opposite direction. The first girl said to the other, while clearly gesturing towards me, &quot;what about him?&quot; To which the other replied &quot;nah, too young&quot; (I was 14 at the time; my memory&#8217;s a bit fuzzy but the girls looked about 16 or something).</p>
<p>At least it beats &quot;too ugly&quot; :P</p>

		<p>Just wanted to point out a possible typo:</p>
<p>&quot;Curiously, this isn&#8217;t losted&#8230;&quot;</p>
<p>Shouldn&#8217;t that be listed? :)</p>

		<p>We always had a bit of fun with this, trying to come up with the wild and weird. Of course, the best one is from Lewis Black: &quot;If it weren’t for my horse, I wouldn’t have spent that year in college&quot;</p>

		<p>I recently caught &quot;Doesn&#8217;t his beard make him look sexy?&quot; Now, I&#8217;m pretty sure they must have been talking about someone else &#8211; some filmstar or something &#8211; but as I was the only bearded man in sight, it made my day :)</p>
<p>In Raymond&#8217;s case it&#8217;s likely that the level designer of that trail only coded in a single conversation loop for the pedestrian NPCs, and he hears snippets of the same conversation as he passes each group of NPCs. Conversation probably goes something like:</p>
<p>&quot;So I said to her, whenever the Nazis opened up a concentration camp, they&#8217;d test it on blog nitpickers.&quot;</p>

		<p>The fun thing is that the people who Raymond overheard may not even be conscious that they ever said &quot;concentration camp&quot;. Words plucked out of context can take on a significance which was never intended by the speaker or understood by the listener.</p>
<p>“&#8230; it ruined my concentration; camp doesn&#8217;t even begin to describe him.”</p>
<p>“&#8230; could say it&#8217;s the strength that&#8217;s important, the concentration. Camp Coffee made that way&#8230;”</p>

		<p>Hope ya&#8217;ll were courteous trail riders. Lots of &quot;chain gangs&quot; road bikers &#8217;round here are very discourteous on the road and more so on the trail. Play nice, don&#8217;t run over kids and grannies etc. WashPo covers it every now and then&#8230;</p>

		<p>Overheard this weekend by myself. &nbsp;Two twenties-ish females talking outside of the Alison Krauss concert. &nbsp;One says to the other: &quot;Yeah, we&#8217;ve reached the sending dirty text message stage.&quot;</p>

		<p>This happened to me this weekend, hiking down in Portland. &nbsp;Only it was our conversation that was overheard. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The people heading the other way on the trail heard only, &quot;&#8230;in that case you just go back in time and kill yourself&#8230;&quot; which they found highly amusing.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
