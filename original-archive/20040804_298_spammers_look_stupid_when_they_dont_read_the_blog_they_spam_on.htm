<p>Yesterday, I got a 419 scam via the contact form.  This is a new low for spam stupidity.  You'd think people who blog are more likely to be aware of Internet scams  because they're reading the news, are clearly more comfortable with  technology, and often  <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/oldnewthing/archive/2004/01/31/65533.aspx">  make fun of news stories about 419 scammers</a>.</p>
<p>  But if you're for real, I have this to say to you:  Be careful!  I'm sure you are being completely truthful  when you say you are the only child of Deposed Corrupt Dictator XYZ,  but be aware that there are many unscrupulous people  claiming the same thing!  So watch out for Vivian, Pierre,  Lama, Austine, Martin, Kabilla, Jean Paul, Farek,  David, Curimbada, Cynthia, and of course, Dictator Junior.  It's very disappointing that there are so many impostors  trying to get their hands on the fortune  that <b>you</b> stole and that by rights belongs to <b>you</b>.  </p>
<p>  Also watch out for XYZ's former Finance Minister, accountant,  widow, brother, and hair stylist.  They're after the same thing.  </p>
<p>  Good luck.  </p>
<p>  (I also find it impressive that you were able to embezzle  $100 billion U.S. dollars, since your country raises less than  $2 billion per year in tax revenues. How you managed to amass  that much money so quickly is truly an amazing accomplishment  of economics.  If you returned even just half of that money  back to the country in exchange for amnesty, that would fund  your government for a generation.  Think about it.  Do it for the children.)  </p>
<p>  P.S. I was joking about the hair stylist. Please don't hurt him.  </p>

  This is a new low for spam stupidity.</p>
<p>Surely not?  For scam stupidity maybe, but for spam stupidity it has to be compared to all kinds of spams.  For example, postings offering low-cost copies of software, posted to the Linux Kernel Mailing List.

		<p>It&#8217;s nice when they keep you up to date with current events, though. Here&#8217;s one from a prospective associate in Russia:</p>
<p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>Good day,</p>
<p>I have an amount in  excess of US$12M, which I seek your partnership<br />
<br />in accommodating for me. You will be rewarded with 10% of the total<br />
<br />sum for your partnership. Can you be my partner on this?</p>
<p>INTRODUCTION :</p>
<p>I am Mr. Ivan Ruskov, a personal treasurer to Mikhail Khodorkovsky<br />
<br />the richest man in Russia and owner of the following companies:</p>
<p>Chairman CEO: YUKOS OIL (Russia&#8217;s  Largest Oil Company)<br />
<br />Chairman CEO: Menatep SBP Bank (A well reputable financial<br />
<br />institution with  branches all over the world)</p>
<p>SOURCE OF FUNDS:</p>
<p>The documents of the above funds in question was handed over to me to<br />
<br />be used in paying an American oil merchant for his last oil deal with<br />
<br />my boss, Mikhail Khodorkovsky. Already the funds have left the shore<br />
<br />of Russia to an European private bank where the final crediting is<br />
<br />expected to be carried out. While I was on the process, my boss got<br />
<br />arrested for his involvement in politics by financing the leading and<br />
<br />opposing political parties (the Union of Right Forces,<br />
<br />led by Boris Nemtsov, and Yabloko, a liberal/social democratic party<br />
<br />led by Gregor Yavlinsky) which poses a threat to President Vladimir<br />
<br />Putin&#8217;s second tenure as Russian president. You can catch more of the<br />
<br />story on this website:</p>
<p><a target="_new" href="http://www.opendemocracy.net/debates/article-3-56-1409.jspor" rel="nofollow">http://www.opendemocracy.net/debates/article-3-56-1409.jspor</a><br />
<br /><a target="_new" href="http://newsfromrussia.com/main/2003/11/13/51215.html" rel="nofollow">http://newsfromrussia.com/main/2003/11/13/51215.html</a></p>
<p>YOUR ROLE:</p>
<p>All I need from you is to stand as the beneficiary of the above<br />
<br />quoted sum and I will arrange for the documentation, which will<br />
<br />enable the European bank transfer the sum to you&#8230;.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
