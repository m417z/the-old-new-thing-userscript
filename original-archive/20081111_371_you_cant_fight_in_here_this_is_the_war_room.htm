<p>(<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29czSGSPE7k">Video clip</a> for those who don't get the reference.)</p>
<p> <a href="http://cwr.iwm.org.uk/server/show/nav.00f00k"> The term War Room is attributed to Winston Churchill</a>, used to describe the underground meeting room where the war effort was directed. It is the "crucial meeting room where important decisions are made" sense of the term that is used at Microsoft. </p>
<p> Many software products (or even just components of software products) have a meeting room designated as its <i>War Room</i>. Depending on the stage of the project, <i>War Meetings</i> might be held weekly, daily, or even several times a day. The meeting is run by the <i>War Team</i>, with representatives from all product components in attendance. Progress reports are given, the schedule is managed, critical bugs (or, if things are coming down to the wire, <i>all bugs</i>) are reviewed. For projects that are spread out over multiple locations, fancy teleconferencing equipment may be installed, and there may be clocks on the walls for time zones around the world. </p>
<p> Since the same people tend to attend these meetings over and over, there's a good chance that you'll find long-standing inside jokes and other rituals. For example, in the Windows War Room, there are pieces of paper on the walls with various catch phrases printed on them. I have no idea what they mean, but they are obviously a source of amusement for the people who spend hour after hour in the War Room. </p>
<p> If you're a programmer or tester, you don't have much direct interaction with the War Meetings unless you are responsible for a bug that has caught the attention of the War Team, at which point you are suddenly thrust into the frenzy. Before each War Meeting, your manager will want a status report, and if it's a new bug, you may even have to explain the situation in person. For example, suppose the project is in its final days, and a new bug just turned up. You may be called upon to describe the bug to the War Team, assess how risky the fix is and its impact on performance, application compatibility, and all that other information that the release management team will need to know in order to decide whether they are going to approve the fix. (Another phrase you may hear is <i>taking a bug to War</i>, which means <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/11/05/9043631.aspx"> bringing the bug before the War Team</a> to request that they approve the fix for the product.) </p>
<p> And now that you've learned all this vocabulary surrounding the term <i>War Room</i>, you have to forget it all, because the new term is <i>Ship Room</i>, since that is the room where decisions about shipping the product are made. (Though it seems that the security folks still call their meeting room the <a href="http://www.news.com/8301-13860_3-9827124-56.html">War Room</a>.) </p>
<p> Aside: The White House <i>War Room</i> <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2123938/"> was renamed the <i>Situation Room</i></a> in 1961. </p>
<p> I don't know the reason for sure, but I suspect the old term is deprecated because it sounds too belligerent and uncooperative. </p>
<p> (And happy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Veterans_Day"> Veteran's Day</a>.) </p>
<p> <b>Bonus track</b>: <a href="http://edge.technet.com/media/Inside-the-SQL-2008-Ship-room"> Inside the SQL 2008 Ship room</a>. And no, the music is not part of the meeting. </p>

		<p>Actually, the Department of War was split by executive order in September of 1947 into the Department of the Army and the Department of the Air Force. At the same time, the national Security Act of 1947 formed the National Military Establishment. The NME was made up of the Department of the Navy, the Department of the Army, and the Department of the Air Force.</p>
<p>That NME was renamed in 1949 to the Department of Defense.</p>

<p>And with meetings about software without any software developers present, nobody can convince me that they&#8217;d succeed at it.</p>

<p>Brings to mind the War Council episode from Victor Stone&#8217;s Corporate Runs series (still I believe the only stabbing mentioned in the MSDN Library!) Ah, here it is:</p>

<p>Wow, I remember reading these mini-stories in the .chm files way back when, and thinking how cool they were.</p>
<p>Nowadays, according to Google, they are only in the Japanese version.</p>

		<p>I think &quot;ship room&quot; is the devdiv term. That&#8217;s what we called it in the C++ team back when I started in &#8217;94, and I only heard &quot;war room&quot; in the Windows context</p>

		<p>I think the ship room would be amusing if it contained an actual ship inside it at some point. Maybe have it as a novel MS Prank that the day after a product ships, the team come in and quickly replace the table with an actual boat of some kind..</p>

		<p>BTW, don&#8217;t miss the War Rooms beneath Whitehall next time you&#8217;re in London. &nbsp;It&#8217;s hard to look at the map of the Atlantic that&#8217;s riddled with pin holes from tracking Lend Lease convoys or to see the cigar in the ash tray in the next room without getting something of a chill&#8230;&quot;we will nevah surrender!&quot;</p>
<p>Which isn&#8217;t to say that a Windows release isn&#8217;t a Big Deal in its own way&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
