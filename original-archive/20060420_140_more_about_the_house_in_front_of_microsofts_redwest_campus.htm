<p> After <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/04/11/573346.aspx"> I mentioned that house in front of Microsoft's RedWest campus</a>, I received an e-mail message from Mike Daly which corrects some of my mistakes and provides additional details: </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p> Actually, there were two houses in the strip in front of RedWest. The one you show has not been moved. The other ended up on blocks and parked opposite the RedWest driveway while the parking garage was built. That house eventually was moved north down the street and put on a foundation (about two years ago). You can see it <a href="http://local.live.com/default.aspx?v=2&amp;cp=47.663427~-122.142801&amp;style=o&amp;lvl=2&amp;scene=3688581"> in the middle of this picture</a>. The yard is in straw, and there is a new blacktop drive going down the north side into the backyard. </p>
<p> After the house was put on the foundation, a sign went up to subdivide the land. As far as I can tell, the house has never been lived in (in the new location). In fact the electricity has not been connected. I've been running past those houses for years, and it has been strange to watch the one move up and down the street. Also, when the land was purchased by Microsoft, there were two old chicken coops in the middle of the property under the largest blackberry brambles you have ever seen. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I also recommend that you go back to that earlier article, because there's some good info in the comments. </p>

		<p>Someone&#8217;s house is getting zapped by a huge laser in the middle of that shot.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s funny. &nbsp;I always thought it was just some techno-house of the future type thing that MS had put together back before I moved to Seattle.</p>

		<p>The comment thread in the previous article about Mount Rainier being the big threat to the region reminded me that Microsoft had a competition to name their new data-centre. &nbsp;The winning entry was &quot;Rainier&quot;, because &quot;it&#8217;s solid and reliable, unchanging and constant&quot; (I&#8217;m paraphrasing, but you get the idea). &nbsp;The announcement of the name was made at the same time the USGS declared Rainier to be one of three mountains most likely to blow up.</p>

		<p>&quot;Someone&#8217;s house is getting zapped by a huge laser in the middle of that shot.&quot; &nbsp;Yeah whats up with that? &nbsp;Did Microsoft install a Tesla coil?</p>
<p>I was noticing that in the Welcome window in the lower left hand corner Windows Live Local it mentions WingTip Toys. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve noticed on Microsoft Certification tests, MSDN articles, and now Windows Live Local that Microsoft uses WingTip Toys (and a few others like Datum and WoodGrooveBanks) as examples companies. &nbsp;Just wondering if anyone knows 1) if Microsoft owns patents on these names 2) if Microsoft specifies that employees use these dummy company names in their documentation if they have to create examples with company names 3) any reason why those names where picked? &nbsp;Just wondering. Thanks.</p>

		<p>Ha, the Rainier thing reminds me of the IE commercials with &quot;Confutatis Maledictis&quot; playing prominently.</p>

		<p>Did Pepsi and Coke pay for advertising placement? &nbsp;Trucks from both companies are clearly visible in the pictures. &nbsp;I thought that was funny&#8230; &nbsp;Kind of like platent advertising in sitcoms or something. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>I wanted to clear up some of the misconceptions regarding the Morelli house still standing on 148th Ave NE. I am a close relative, living on the Eastside; actually I am the beneficiary of the estate with regards to the house! The original owners are Redmond pioneers who developed a chicken/egg farm on the property in 1915. &nbsp;They built the farm, survived the Depression, raised their children and provided for their grandchildren on this acreage and more in the surrounding area. It was a difficult, but necessary decision to sell this remaining piece of property, our home for many generations. &nbsp;I am not old enough to know what this property looked like when my grandparents started their farm, but when the Microsoft excavation of the property was completed, I had the opportunity to see the land as it had been almost 100 years ago. &nbsp;It was an incredibly emotional moment for me when the bulldozer engine was turned off. &nbsp;All was quiet. The view before me was just what my grandfather and his brothers saw. &nbsp;It is a tremendous landscape with the Cascades in the background&#8230;a sweeping hill&#8230;the perfect place&#8230;.We are proud that Microsoft bought this piece and has built a beautiful campus. &nbsp;The owner of the remaining house in front of the campus has lived here all his life and chose to live out his years in the house he was raised in. &nbsp;He has given greatly to the community as a Redmond High School teacher and coach. &nbsp;No amount of money, trips, etc that Microsoft could offer would change his decision to stay there. &nbsp;Money would not motivate him to leave. &nbsp;I am so thankful that I am able to still go over to his house, enjoy his home cooked meals and bring my children into the exact house where their great grandparents and grandmother lived. &nbsp;The memories I have every time I walk through that door I can share with my husband and children. &nbsp;These are some of the many reasons that this house remains standing today. &nbsp;It will not be torn down. &nbsp;I hope that I have given some insight into the history of the &quot;remaining house&quot;. &nbsp;The place where you work, shoot baskets, have lunch, and read your book by the waterfall has a history and special meaning&#8230;for you and for us&#8230;I hope that I have given some insight into the history of the &quot;remaining house&quot;. I am happy to answer any questions and to continue this thread.<br />
<br />Most Sincerely, Allegro</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
