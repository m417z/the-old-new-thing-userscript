		<p>Extreem?<br />
<br />It looks like they have been playing against my mother.<br />
<br />She is a vicious croquet player ( her second favorite game, scrabble is #1), it is not unusual to end up clibing over a fence or into a row of shrubs to try to knock your ball back towards the goal.</p>

		<p>I prefer the excitement of rock, paper, scissors.</p>

		<p>Extreme croquet</p>
<p>&#8230; a curious game that involves hitting people for no readily apparent reason and then running away.</p>

		<p>Back in my high school days I used to work at the St. Bonaventure dining hall.  We used to have a sport called &quot;Freestyle Dishwashing&quot;.  It was <em>loads</em> of fun ;-)  It basically just involved loading the different dishes/pans onto the dishwasher into intricate patterns on in remarkable quantities.</p>

		<p>I misread the title of this article. I thought it was Extreme Crochet&#8230;</p>

		<p>If I meant crochet I would have written crochet.</p>

		<p>Sounds like a lightweight version of what I and friends used to play at school (in 6th form, think seniors in US high school).</p>
<p>Hoops over rabbit holes were a favourite, or a couple of yards up a 45 degree bank.</p>
<p>We stopped when no-one could handle the combination of bank and rabbit hole&#8230;</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
