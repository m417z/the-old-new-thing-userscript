		<p>@Joshua: It specifically said &quot;office equipment&quot;. Anyway, if the building contained equipment requiring specialized powerup requirements/sequencing, then they should have made sure that the breakers were thrown prior to restoration of the electrical supply.</p>
<p>I was more disappointed that selecting the black text on black background didn&#39;t highlight the actual building and date.</p>

		<p>When I worked in a grocery years back, we had to do this. Had to throw some huge breakers to disable each zone before the system was re-energized from outside.</p>
<p>Once, the system failed to trip and disable all of the outside breakers when the power was cut, and it blew a hole in the backup generators when the power came back up&#8230;</p>

		<p>Hmm. Sometimes there actually is a reason why people within their specific domain tend to use a buzzy sounding word, usually because the more common word is technically just slightly incorrect, and people tend to forget that people outside the domain do not really care.</p>
<p>As a simple example, if there was something like a mandatory (possibly transparent) HTTP proxy in a company, and that proxy would be down, a system administrator might inform the user that browsing the web is not possible instead of more colloquially saying that &quot;the Internet is not available&quot;. Technically, that&#39;s just not really true, even if most non-technical users may not care that the Internet is more than websites.</p>
<p>But in this case I really don&#39;t see how &quot;turned back on&quot; would be wrong.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve heard of &quot;energized&quot; used in this context, mainly in publications on home electrical work; as in, &quot;use a non-contact voltage tester to make sure that the cable is not energized before starting work.&quot; &nbsp;&quot;Restoral&quot; is a new one for me. &nbsp;Perhaps it&#39;s a short form of &quot;Restoration&quot;?</p>

		<p>&quot;Restoral&quot; seems to be a perfectly good word; first use 1605-15. It is indeed a short form of &quot;restoration.&quot;</p>

		<p>That may be electrician jargon rather than facilities jargon (i.e. a roof guy or HVAC guy may not know what it means any more than you do). I&#39;ve heard it used in the electric power industry in reference to things like circuits, power lines, transformers, generator field coils, and the like, but nowhere else.</p>

		<p>In industrial settings &quot;energized&quot; is used when talking about a system using any energy source. A machine that is unplugged may still be energized because it is connected to a compressed air line, a mechanical spring is in tension or a large weight hasn&#39;t been lowered. Part of safely servicing that sort of equipment is recognizing the energy sources and knowing the procedure to &quot;de-energize&quot; it. However, I&#39;ve never seen re-energize used to discuss the reverse process.</p>

		<p>@Jerome, because it&#39;s a serious issue which affects everyday work and all the so-called usability &quot;experts&quot; at MS don&#39;t get it. Raymond could certainly get it fixed if he wanted to.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>You seem to think this is a very easy thing to change. It&#39;s actually very hard because the insides of Explorer were completely rewritten (notice that it doesn&#39;t use a list view control any more), so it&#39;s not like there&#39;s a single change that I can just back out.

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
