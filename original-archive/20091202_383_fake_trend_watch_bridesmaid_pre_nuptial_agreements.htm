<p>My wanderings through the online world of bridesmaid craziness began with the article <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/24/fashion/24skin.html"> <i>Brides taking their bridesmaids for Botox treatments or maybe a boob job</i></a>. I blame the <a href="http://www.salon.com/mwt/feature/2007/05/21/mead_weddings/"> wedding-industrial complex</a>, which constantly pushes weddings as the bride's "perfect day", "the best day of your life", a "fairy tale come true" where you can be "a princess for a day." (Folk tales which end in big lavish weddings are told from the female point of view; there aren't many folk tales about the young boy who grows up to marry a beautiful princess.)</p>
<p> And I love Elizabeth A.'s comment called out in the sidebar to the <i>New York Times</i> article. </p>
<p> Back to that article: Is the Botox girl's night out a real trend or a <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2086925"> fake trend</a>? In <a href="http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/alltherage/2008/02/pre-nups-for-br.html"> <i>Pre-nups for bridesmaids. Gain weight and you're out</i></a>, the author claims that "one in five women actually ask their bridesmaids to sign a pre-nup." On that, I call fake trend. </p>
<p> First of all, I could find only one actual documented case of a bride who made her bridesmaids sign contracts agreeing not to gain weight before the wedding. And <a href="http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=3217531"> it was a prank</a>. </p>
<p> Okay, so if it happened only once, where did this "one in five" come from? I followed the citation to <a href="http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-512107/One-brides-ask-bridesmaids-sign-pre-nup--sack-refused.html"> the source article in <i>The Daily Mail</i></a>, which merely says that one in five <i>would</i> ask their bridesmaids to sign such an agreement, not that one in five <i>actually did it</i>. </p>
<p> But wait, there's more. I followed the citation from that <i>Daily Mail</i> article to the <a _href="http://www.youandyourwedding.co.uk/index.php/v1/Bridesmaid_contract" href="http://web.archive.org/web/20080802232311/http://www.youandyourwedding.co.uk/index.php/v1/Bridesmaid_contract"> the original survey from <i>You &amp; Your Wedding</i> magazine</a>, and found that it was even weaker than <i>The Daily Mail</i> described it: The actual result was that one in five <i>would consider a bridesmaid contract in general</i>. So we're double-counterfactual now. And the survey was not scientific; it was just an online survey. </p>
<p> Okay, so let's tally up the numbers. The claim that one in five brides ask their bridesmaids to sign a pre-nuptial agreement which includes a clause regarding weight would be true if... </p>
<ul>
<li>The online survey results were representative of brides as a whole     (and the people who answered the survey were answering seriously), and </li>
<li>Everyone who <i>would</i> consider having a bridesmaid pre-nup actually     <i>did</i> consider it, and </li>
<li>Everyone who considered it followed through and did it, and </li>
<li>Every one of those pre-nups contained a clause regarding weight. </li>
</ul>
<p> I call fake trend. </p>

		<p>&#8220;(Folk tales which end in big lavish weddings are told from the female point of view; there aren&#8217;t many folk tales about the young boy who grows up to marry a beautiful princess.)&#8221;</p>
<p>Not so&#8230; there are a great number of folk tales based around the boy (usually the youngest, sometimes a simpleton) who leaves home to make his own way in the world, falls desperately in love with a beautiful princess, and overcomes the obstacles which the king puts in his way (usually there are three of them).</p>
<p>These stories are usually all about conflict and overcoming and being a man and&#8230;. getting the girl!</p>
<p>Every Hollywood story (modern folk tale) ever told involves getting the girl, actually.</p>
<p>Good call on the fake trend, though. The fact that the survey is online completely eliminates it for me.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>You&#8217;re right about the folk tales. I had forgotten about the &#8220;plucky boy overcomes obstacles to win princess&#8217;s hand&#8221; genre.

		<p>@Maurits,</p>
<p>I stopped following Aladdin sometime in 1994, so I&#8217;m not in a position to comment on how the wedding was presented and what lead up to it. Good to know, though.</p>

		<p>Hi &#8211; long time lurker, first time poster. &nbsp;But you should probably be aware that the Daily Mail has a&#8230; well, a reputation. &nbsp;It deals more in fictional impressions than actual &quot;news&quot;.</p>

		<p>The Newsweek story says &quot;Although brides who&#8217;ve used pre-nups were reluctant to go on the record for this story, several of them explained that the agreements were necessary to ensure that their day was perfect.&quot; which implies that even if it&#8217;s not a trend, these prenups do exist for real.</p>
<p>Of course it says nothing of the existence of weight-gain clauses or anything like that.</p>

<p>I guess it&#8217;s a good thing that Vetinari was never in any of these tales, or else it would be explained that the plucky boy must fail at the final task or else find himself a tragic example to others.</p>

<p>(It&#8217;s a comic, not a serious suggestion.)</p>
<p>Also, these days the disney movie format is &quot;princess falls in love with the scullery boy with a heart of gold cos the prince is a jerk&quot;. I expect that soon that&#8217;ll get old, and the princess will be falling in love with the scullery maid with a heart of gold.</p>
<p>All well and good, I&#8217;m sure, but when they have a smug voice-over at the end explaining that its a &quot;more modern version&quot; I&#8217;m sure that something has gone horribly wrong.</p>

<p>well, PotC did pretty much that with Will and Liz and the Commodore. Of course, allowing the commodore to degrade completely, recover, and redeem himself was a nice touch (along with the wedding ceremony in a swordfight, to bring things back on topic)</p>

		<p>What you have to remember is that it&#8217;s not a newspaper, it&#8217;s the Daily Mail. The Daily Mail is, in general, made up of pieces about how horrible foreign people are and imaginary things that foreign people may have done, how frightening the EU is, how Gordon Brown is a Communist robot from the future, and, of course, fake trend pieces. The New York Times, while far better on the actual news bits, also likes fake trend pieces; Gawker devotes an entire category to imaginary NYT trends.</p>

		<p>Folk tales centered around young boys often to end with the boy killing the king/chief/father and taking his rightful place as the new hero-king.</p>
<p>Sometimes if the story is on the nicer side, the boy-hero-king kills a monster instead.</p>
<p>All you have to do now is figure out how to turn that into an industry.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m suprised they bothered doing an online survey, most of this type of story comes from a journalist asking her friends in the same office what they think and writing it up as a statistic. A great example, from a better British newspaper: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.badscience.net/2007/09/imaginary-numbers/" rel="nofollow">http://www.badscience.net/2007/09/imaginary-numbers/</a></p>

		<p>Congratulations, you have discovered a rich seam of churnalism. This problem is discussed further by journalist Nick Davies in his book &quot;Flat Earth News&quot; &#8211; <a href="http://www.flatearthnews.net" rel="nofollow">http://www.flatearthnews.net</a>.</p>
<p>He dedicates an entire chapter to the Daily Mail, which he calls &quot;the professional foul of Fleet Street&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Maurits:</p>
<p>&quot;To Disney&#8217;s credit, Belle /does not/ marry the Beast. &nbsp;They&#8217;re just friends.&quot;</p>
<p>Really? &nbsp;I&#8217;m fairly sure the scene at the end of the movie is supposed to be a wedding. &nbsp;Particularly since this is after the Beast changes back, and the conditions to change back were &quot;If he could learn to love another, and earn her love in return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would be broken.&quot;</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I agree there is undeniably some form of &quot;love&quot; between them. &nbsp;My &quot;just friends&quot; comment was perhaps a little strong.</p>
<p>In fact, there /is/ a &quot;wedding&quot; in the movie, but it&#8217;s much earlier on, and it doesn&#8217;t turn out so well.</p>
<p>But&#8230;</p>
<p>Belle has ambitions (she wants &quot;adventure in the great, wide, somewhere&quot; etc.) and Prince Whatshisname has&#8230; other issues. &nbsp;Marriage, between these two, at this stage, would have been a disaster. &nbsp;I agree that the scene at the end is consistent with a wedding, if the viewer is predisposed to such things, but it is also consistent with your basic &quot;welcome back to civilization&quot; party.</p>

<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Does_belle_marry_the_beast" rel="nofollow">http://wiki.answers.com/Q/Does_belle_marry_the_beast</a></p>
<p>A: Yes, belle decides to visit her father for awhile and when she comes back the beast is on the floor. Belle kisses the beast and he turns into a prince. they marry&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
