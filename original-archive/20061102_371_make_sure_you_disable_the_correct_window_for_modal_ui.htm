Some time ago,
I was asked to look at two independent problems with people trying
to do modal UI manually.
Well, actually, when the issues were presented to me,
they weren't described in quite that way.
They were more along the lines of,
"Something strange is happening in our UI. Can you help?"
Only in the discussion of the scenarios did it become
apparent that it was improper management of modal UI that
was the cause.
</p>
<p>
We already saw
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/27/81155.aspx">
one subtlety of managing modal UI manually</a>,
namely that you have to enable and disable the windows in the correct
order.
That wasn't the root of the problems I was looking at,
but enabling and disabling windows did play a major role.
</p>
<p>
When we
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/04/01/404531.aspx">
took a look at the dialog loop</a>,
the first steps involved manipulating the <code>hwndParent</code>
parameter to ensure that we enable and disable the correct window
at the correct time.
</p>
<pre>
 if (hwndParent == GetDesktopWindow())
  hwndParent = NULL;
 if (hwndParent)
  hwndParent = GetAncestor(hwndParent, GA_ROOT);
 HWND hdlg = CreateDialogIndirectParam(hinst,
               lpTemplate, hwndParent, lpDlgProc,
               lParam);
 BOOL fWasEnabled = EnableWindow(hwndParent, FALSE);
</pre>
<p>
In both cases, the first two "if" statements were missing.
We already saw
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/24/79212.aspx">
the danger of disabling the desktop window</a>,
which is what the first "if" statement protects against.
But the specific problem with modal UI was being caused by
the missing second "if" statement.
</p>
<p>
Both of the problems boiled down to somebody passing a child
window as the <code>hwndParent</code> and the code doing
manual modal UI failing to convert this window to a top-level window.
As a result, when they did the <code>EnableWindow(hwndParent, FALSE)</code>,
they disabled a child window,
leaving the top-level window enabled.
</p>
<p>
The two problems had the same root cause but manifested themselves
differently.
The first problem led to strange behavior because
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/02/23/378866.aspx">
the user could still interact
with the top-level window since it was still enabled</a>.
Sure, a portion of the window was disabled (the portion
controlled by the child window passed as <code>hwndParent</code>),
but the caption buttons still worked, as did many of the other
controls on the window.
</p>
<p>
In the second case,
disabling the wrong window created a different problem:
When the modal UI was complete,
the window manager activated the top-level window that was the
owner of the modal window since that window was never disabled.
This caused the top-level window to receive a <code>WM_ACTIVATE</code>
message,
which it handled by putting focus on the control that had focus
when the top-level window was deactivated.
Unfortunately, that window was the window that was passed
as the <code>hwndParent</code>,
which was <i>disabled by mistake</i>.
The attempt to restore focus failed,
and when the manual modal UI finally finished up and enabled
the child window, it was too late.
You wound up with focus nowhere and a dead keyboard.
This second problem was
reported as simply "<code>SetFocus</code> is not working."
Only after peeling back a few layers (and application of some
psychic powers) did the root cause emerge.
</p>
<p>
Now, even though this was a subtle problem,
you already knew all the pieces that went into it since I had
covered them earlier.
And as for those psychic powers that I used?
It's really not that magic.
In this case of psychic debugging, I worked backwards.
In response to the report that
<code>SetFocus</code> was not working,
the next set of questions was to determine why.
Is it a valid window handle?
Does the window belong to your thread?
Is it enabled?
</p>
<p>
Aha, the window isn't enabled.
That's when the customer also mentioned that they were doing
this inside a <code>WM_ACTIVATE</code> handler.
If you're gaining activation, who were you gaining it from?
Oh, a modal dialog, you say?
One that you're managing manually?
Once I discovered that they were trying to manage modal UI manually,
I suspected that they were disabling the wrong window,
since that fit all the symptoms and it's something that people tend
to get wrong.
</p>
<p>
Most of what looks like psychic debugging is really just
knowing what people tend to get wrong.</p>

		<p>In 25 years I imagine programmers visiting &quot;The New Old New Thing,&quot; a continuation of this blog by one of Raymond&#8217;s offspring &#8211; Ramona Chen. &nbsp;Not only will those programmers learn from the knowledge Raymond has passed down to her, they will reap additional benefit because of the natural evolution of the species.</p>
<p>Instead of a debugging education via stories of Raymond&#8217;s clairvoyant feats they will benefit from direct psychic debugging. &nbsp;Ramona Chen will not only root-out code errors through the use of clairvoyance and remote viewing, she will edit and rebuild the offending code by psychokinesis.</p>

<p>Most of what looks like psychic *anything* is just knowing what people tend to want. &nbsp;You&#8217;d be surprised how similar your &quot;psychic debugging&quot; process is to the process used by your nearest &quot;Psychic Readings&quot; shop. &nbsp;Though, you&#8217;ll never get them to admit it.</p>

		<p>This is really a trackback, but since this doesn&#8217;t seem to have trackbacks, here it is as a comment:</p>
<p>In my blog post here&#8230;</p>

<p>&#8230;I say &quot;I&#8217;d never thought of the term &#8216;psychic debugging&#8217;, but, yes, it&#8217;s a combination of a certain skill and a lot of experience with the root causes of most of the problems,&quot; and then I go on to tell a couple of stories from times long past.</p>

		<p>Just to be confusing, I&#8217;ve seen a case where hiding a window failed to activate its owner window even though that window was enabled. For the curious, this only happened when the window itself had had a modal dialog; just opening and closing the owned window activated the owner fine.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
