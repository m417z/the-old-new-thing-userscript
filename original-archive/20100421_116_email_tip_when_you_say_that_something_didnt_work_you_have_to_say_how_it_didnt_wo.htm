<p>I illustrate this point with an imaginary conversation, inspired by actual ones I've seen (and, occasionally, been a frustrated party to).</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  <b>From</b>: X<br> </p>
<p> I want to do ABC, but I don't have a DEF. Anybody know of a workaround? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Somebody has an idea: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  <b>From</b>: Y<br> </p>
<p> Try mounting this ISO file into a virtual machine and  trying the ABC from there. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Unfortunately, it didn't work: </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  <b>From</b>: X<br> </p>
<p> I tried that, but it didn't work. Any other ideas? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> When somebody suggests a troubleshooting step or a workaround, but when you try it and it doesn't work, you need to say <i>how</i> it didn't work. The person who made the suggestion had some expectation that it <i>would</i> work, and just saying that it didn't work will probably just generate an unhelpful response like "Well, try again." Which doesn't help anybody. </p>
<p> In this example (which I just made up), a better response from&nbsp;X would be something like this: </p>
<ul>
<li>"I tried that, but it didn't work.     Virtual PC refused to load the ISO image,     putting up the error message 'The CD image could not be     captured. You may not have the proper access privileges     to the CD image files.'" </li>
<li>"I tried that, but it didn't work.     Virtual PC loaded the ISO image, but when I tried to     view the contents of the CD, I got 'Not ready reading     drive D.'" </li>
<li>"I tried that, but it didn't work.     Virtual PC loaded the ISO image,     but when I double-clicked the ABC file,     I got the same error that I got when I tried to do ABC directly." </li>
</ul>
<p> Each of these is a different failure mode that suggests a different course of action. </p>
<p> And then the response probably won't be, "Well, try again." </p>

		<p>Or maybe it&#8217;s not a typo&#8230; I can&#8217;t decide since both versions look strange to me&#8230;</p>
<ul>
<li>Did you try making sense of the sentence?</li>
<li>
<p>I tried, didn&#8217;t work&#8230; Any other ideas?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Well, try again</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Redressing it into &quot;I&#8217;ve been a party to frustrating conversations&quot; makes sense so I guess &quot;to&quot; is correct, &nbsp;I&#8217;m just not used to see sentences ending like that. :)</p>

		<p>Raymond&#8217;s original usage is correct, except for the split infinitive. &nbsp;The more correct formation is as Nawak suggested, although Raymond&#8217;s original usage is generally understood, most people not wanting to resort to &quot;That is the kind of language up with which I will not put.&quot;</p>
<p>In this case, using &quot;too&quot; would work if it was being used in the sense of &quot;also.&quot;</p>
<p>Having said all that, I will now attempt to return to the topic. &nbsp;If I&#8217;m dealing with a customer, I can almost always find a way of asking them to try again and tell me the error that won&#8217;t piss &#8217;em off. &nbsp;&quot;Please send me a screenshot showing the error&quot; usually works.</p>

		<p>Any more I&#8217;m tired enough of conversations like this that I just reply with some bogus &quot;solution&quot;. &nbsp;Why doesn&#8217;t your ABC do DEF? &nbsp;Check if your caps-lock key is on.</p>

		<p>@Rick C</p>
<p>Split Infinitive is not a grammatical rule of the English Language. It is a Latin rule that Latin loving English scholars thought might work in a non-Latin based language.</p>
<p>Same with ending a sentence with a preposition. Latin rule people decided should be in a non-Latin based language.</p>

		<p>Sometimes a good technique is to be slow to answer:</p>
<ul>
<li>it doesn&#8217;t work!</li>
</ul>
<p>(2 days pass)</p>
<ul>
<li>what happens?</li>
</ul>
<p>3 mins 37s later:</p>
<ul>
<li>an error message pops out and the application quits!</li>
</ul>
<p>(3 days pass)</p>
<ul>
<li>what does the error message say?</li>
</ul>
<p>Usually, the interlocutor starts to notice that while you are helping, he still hasn&#8217;t got anywhere in five days. He will then try to anticipate your questions and provide more information. Hopefully, the next time he contacts you, it will go like this:</p>
<p>first email:</p>
<ul>
<li>it doesn&#8217;t work!</li>
</ul>
<p>five minutes later, second email:</p>
<ul>
<li>forgot to say, an error box shows up complaining about file permissions</li>
</ul>
<p>If you are lucky, he will even explain what he already tried!</p>
<p>If all goes well, by anticipating your questions, he may also anticipate your answers and may well end up finding the solution by himself. By taking the time to correctly state the problem, the user has allowed his brain to wake up.</p>
<p>Of course the initial slow response can be skipped if the interlocutor is really inexperienced and has no idea what can be a useful information in his situation. The delay can be introduced when it becomes obvious he is not making any effort at helping you helping him.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m sorry, I can&#8217;t think of any way to respond to those sorts of people than saying &quot;go back and read the error message until you understand it&quot; and I just know someone will complain that I&#8217;m mean and it&#8217;ll show up at review time.</p>

		<p>Nice bit of advice Raymond. But it can be applied to strictly. I&#8217;ve seen a situation where all the doumzas where sprocking out of control. We were told to press button X, which didn&#8217;t work. This got reflected at us: what doesn&#8217;t work? Well, we&#8217;ve pressed the button and the doumzas are still sprocking out of control. If something else had happened, we would have told you, &lt;expletive deleted&gt;. Barring catastrophic failure or weird surprises there&#8217;s usually just one failure mode for a button: it doesn&#8217;t work.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  It is a Latin rule
</p></blockquote>
<p>I find that really hard to believe since a) in Latin the issue does not arise and b) in Latin it is common to split word groups that we wouldn&#8217;t, because thanks to the casing system this introduces less ambiguity and can better tie the sentence together and emphasise important words.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  That is the kind of language up with which I will not put.
</p></blockquote>
<p>In this case ‘up’ is not normally considered to be governed by the ‘rule’ because in this context it isn&#8217;t really a preposition. So ‘with which I will not put up’ is correct. Note that I personally don&#8217;t have a real dislike for putting prepositions at the end, it&#8217;s just that misrepresenting the ‘old’ way of doing things to make a point is wrong.</p>

		<p>&quot;Well, we&#8217;ve pressed the button and the doumzas are still sprocking out of control. &quot;</p>
<p>Why wouldn&#8217;t you say that in the first place? &nbsp;They told you to press button X and you said it didn&#8217;t work. &nbsp;The button press didn&#8217;t work? &nbsp;Did the button get stuck? &nbsp;Was there a modal dialog preventing you from clicking it? &nbsp;Was it grayed out?</p>
<p>Raymond&#8217;s advice holds true: &nbsp;you should have said you pressed the button, but the doumzas are still sprocking out of control.</p>

		<p>You&#8217;ve got to remember that Raymond does &quot;support&quot; mostly for programmers who should know better. It&#8217;s one thing for a customer or end-user who just wants to get their job done and doesn&#8217;t care HOW computers do whatever they do: for those people, tact and politeness are important. But a programmer should know better than to just say &quot;it doesn&#8217;t work&quot;.</p>

		<p>There are support situations with very different expectations with regard to the quality of information provided by the party seeking help. You try to keep your customers happy as long as they are not rude to you (and, sometimes, even then) and you can shun and make fun of incompetent &quot;professionals&quot; as much as you like.</p>

<p>No, it is a conjugation. You don&#8217;t split the infinitive in latin for the same reason you don&#8217;t chop up words and spread them around the sentence. English != Latin, so split infinitives if you like.</p>

		<p>@Anon and Cooney</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my point. Latin scholars decided that the no split infinitive rule from Latin should be in English. It&#8217;s not a &quot;rule&quot; in Latin because they can not happen. They wanted English to be more Latin-Like so they tried to get it to be a rule in English.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why you hear people spout it off as if it is a rule in English, when it really isn&#8217;t. Same with the ending a sentence with a preposition.</p>

		<p>Rangoric: It&#8217;s not as simple as that. &nbsp;A number of processes are causing reanalysis of its syntactic function. &nbsp;Historically, part of the tension would be the overloading of the word &quot;to&quot; after loss of the English case system, but the appeal today is probably the simplistic desire to model the infinitive as a single unit.</p>
<p>However, the English infinitive has little to do with Latin, and evolved (including its splitting) independently of it. &nbsp;So please don&#8217;t blame &quot;Latin scholars&quot;.</p>

		<p>&quot;Split Infinitive is not a grammatical rule of the English Language. It is a Latin rule that Latin loving English scholars thought might work in a non-Latin based language.&quot;</p>
<p>What is it with people and Latin rules?</p>
<p>Latin doesn&#8217;t have &quot;to&quot; plus infinitive. The rule not to &quot;split&quot; infinitives is Germanic. You cannot split infinitives like that in German either (and in fact it would sound wrong to a German speaker if you did). English has evolved a bit faster, maybe, but the rule is Germanic. It has NOTHING to do with Latin.</p>
<p>The same applies to ending sentences with prepositions. You can&#8217;t do it in German. Presumably it was also wrong in English before it evolved. Again, this is a rule of Germanic languages and has nothing to do with Latin.</p>
<p>These rules were not introduced by Latin scholars trying to make English more like Latin, these rules have been part of the English language ever since it became its own branch of the proto-Germanic language. And before that the rule was part of the proto-Germanic language.</p>

<p>Both English and German had a historical tendency to place prepositions away from their complements. &nbsp;I can remember a sentence from the poem Iwein (Middle High German): &quot;da ist daz herze schuldec an&quot;, which in Modern German would be more like &quot;das Herze ist schuldig daran&quot; (just arranging the words correctly, not accounting for meaning). &nbsp;German has followed the path of tightening up phrases, while English has remained a bit lax.</p>
<p>And if you look at it from a syntactic point of view, you see that pulling the object of a preposition out of its normal place is not really different from pulling the whole phrase out. &nbsp;You are just moving smaller and larger chunks. &nbsp;The chunks themselves are syntactically valid units, so it doesn&#8217;t really matter which one you pick. &nbsp;I don&#8217;t think there are any languages, however, that let you pull things out of phrases that aren&#8217;t valid phrases themselves. &nbsp;So you can&#8217;t, for example, do this:</p>
<p>&quot;I was on the green grass&quot; -&gt; &quot;I was on the green what?&quot; -&gt; *&quot;What was I on the green?&quot;</p>
<p>Usually you&#8217;d say &quot;What green thing was I on?&quot;. &nbsp;Either you take the entire noun phrase from after the preposition, or you take the entire prepositional phrase (preposition + noun phrase). &nbsp;You can&#8217;t just take an arbitrary part.</p>

		<p>There were no infinitives. Somebody saw the word &#8216;to&#8217;, saw a grammatical argument, and (presumably) not knowing what in infinitive is leapt to the conclusion that there must be a split one somewhere. This sort of thing happens *all the time* when people who have no idea what they&#8217;re talking about try to correct others&#8217; grammar.</p>

Hey look, the book you&#8217;re looking for turned up. This trick works in real life all the time. Book=file, bookshelf=hard drive, defrag=rearrange files (books) on the hard drive (shelf) to be more efficient. -Raymond]</p>
<p>you&#8217;re missing the part where delete file = chuck the book in the garbage. Why would you then expect it to still be on your bookshelf?</p>
<div class=post>[<i>I didn&#8217;t chuck the file in the garbage; I just lost track of it. I mean, obviously the file is still in the computer somewhere. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Of course, it is even more fun dealing with that sort of thing on the message boards where the user fails to</p>
<p>a) adequately describe the problem</p>
<p>b) utilize the forum search (which would have turned up several helpfull threads on that exact problem, and the full solution if they searched with the error number)</p>
<p>c) And then gets all pissy because the community weren&#8217;t all online to help babysit him through his deadline&#8230; at 11:45 p.m. EST&#8230;.. on New Years Eve.</p>

		<p>Most companies develop mediocre software. Then the support doesn&#8217;t have any other choice than to be rude and try a non sequitur. The few companies that actually make high quality software does also have the opportunity to be helpful when the user want help.</p>
<p>The source of a bad support experience starts long before the user contacts the support. A software that angrys the user usually makes the support experience even worse, especially when the manufacturer is arrogant and don&#8217;t admit that there&#8217;s a flaw.</p>

		<p>You do have to be careful though. &nbsp;Most of the time, the user is just too lazy to read the docs. &nbsp;But sometimes they missed the docs because they&#8217;re not easy/obvious enough to find. &nbsp;The latter is a genuine bug.</p>

		<p>&#8216; I can remember a sentence from the poem Iwein (Middle High German): &quot;da ist daz herze schuldec an&quot;, which in Modern German would be more like &quot;das Herze ist schuldig daran&quot;&#8217;</p>
<p>well, &quot;da ist das Herze schuldig dran&quot; would still not be incomprehensible in modern german &#8211; while sounding a bit &quot;poetic&quot;, admittedly (and perhaps not exactly in the same sense as in middle high german)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
