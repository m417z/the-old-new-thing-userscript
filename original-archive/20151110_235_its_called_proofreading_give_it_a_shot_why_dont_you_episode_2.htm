Now, sure, this is an article about a pharmaceutical company,

Four authors, a contributor, two editors, and two updates later,

		<p>Collaterol is the first &quot;cloud-based&quot; drug: instead of buying the pills, you actually just purchase a license to use them. &nbsp;If you don&#39;t pay enough (or otherwise fail to comply with the EULA), the manufacturer can take the pills back.</p>

		<p>It has been posited that big news organisations intentionally put misspellings, grammatical errors and punctuation errors in articles. It helps them identify those who plagiarize their content.</p>

		<p>Without wishing to bury the lead &#8212; welcome to the great sub-editors debate. &nbsp;As margins are squeezed in traditional media, and the distance between journalist filing and publication decreases (to the point of almost varnishing) you&#39;ll find independent proofreading has simply become obselete. &nbsp;So errors that used to be caught now turn up in published copy. This is especially true of old-school journalists who&#39;s work was always corrected before publication.</p>
<p>[Sub-editors &#8211; Please find and correct the five intentional errors in the above]</p>

		<p>@Gwo: &nbsp;Challenge accepted.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;The idiom in U.S. journalism is &quot;bury the lede&quot; not &quot;bury the lead.&quot;</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;Need an apostrophe in &quot;sub-editors&#39; debate.&quot;</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;Need a comma after the parenthesized phrase to set off the second part of the dependent clause from the independent clause.</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;Correct spelling of &quot;obsolete.&quot;</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;Starting a sentence with &quot;So,&quot; a coordinate conjunction, isn&#39;t usually appropriate in formal writing. &nbsp;You can delete &quot;So&quot; to make the sentence stand alone. &nbsp;Since that sentence also follows logically from the previous, you can combine them by (1) inserting a comma and making &quot;So&quot; lowercase or (2) deleting &quot;So&quot; and replacing the period with a colon or semicolon.</p>
<p>6. &nbsp;The possessive pronoun is &quot;whose&quot; not &quot;who&#39;s&quot;.</p>
<p>Of these, I&#39;m guessing the #5 was not one you intended.</p>

		<p>@dp: Those are copiers&#39; traps, but they were historically put into maps rather than news articles. &nbsp;In any case you don&#39;t need them any more now since a Google search will find copies without requiring you to place traps. &nbsp;Not even the Grauniad does this any more.</p>

		<p>Sadly, not only the news media suffers from this. There&#39;s hardly any time I can pick up a new book or magazine and find a glaring error in the first few pages, be it spelling or grammar :(</p>
<p>Last week I also noticed an error on a widespread poster from a plastic miniatures selling company. I could &#39;grap&#39; a prize. :S</p>

		<p>Well done to @Adrian and @Yuri_Khan who caught all the one&#39;s I intended and some I didn&#39;t (I don&#39;t consider English spacing to be an error &#8212; if an HTML layout engine screws it up by inserting &nbsp;s that&#39;s not on me. The double-hyphen for em-dash is just a bad habit I got from LaTeX and never got rid of). &nbsp;</p>
<p>I intended: </p>
<p>i) &quot;bury the lede&quot; usually preferred to &quot;bury the lead&quot;.</p>
<p>ii) &quot;obsolete&quot; spelled incorrectly.</p>
<p>iii) superfluous comma before conjunction </p>
<p>iv) missing comma after subclause</p>
<p>v) &quot;varnishing&quot; over &quot;vanishing&quot;</p>
<p>vi) who&#39;s should be whose</p>
<p>vii) there are not five intentional errors</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure about sub-editors&#39; vs sub-editors &#8212; it&#39;s a debate about sub-editors, it does not belong to them. &nbsp;I think I prefer it omitted possessive.</p>

		<p>Hi Raymond,</p>
<p>I was lucky enough to catch the Blue Angels Homecoming show in Pensacola last weekend. At an event on the evening prior to the show, they were handing out signed and framed posters to sponsors and VIPs. &nbsp;I noticed that the headings on these posters said, &quot;Blue ANGELS.&quot; I asked if this was some kind of insider name or joke? &nbsp;It turns out that the posters had been proofread by no less than a dozen people, not counting those who autographed them. &nbsp;I got my copy before they stopped distributing them. No posters or programs were available for sale at the event. &nbsp;I guess the message here is Nobody&#39;s Perfect.</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>Lance</p>

		<p>Lance Silver: Was the surprising thing about the poster that the word &#39;angels&#39; was in all-caps, or did you actually mean to write &#39;ANGLES&#39; instead?</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
