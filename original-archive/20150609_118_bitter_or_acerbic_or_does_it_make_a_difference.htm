		<p>&quot;Acerbic&quot; is more biting than bitter (hence: &#39;sour or bitter&#39;).</p>

		<p>As applied to a person, I&#39;d say that &quot;bitter&quot; describes how the person is whereas &quot;acerbic&quot; describes how the person comes across to (some) others. Or put another way, &quot;acerbic&quot; is the other guy&#39;s problem.</p>

		<p>I agree with Ken.</p>
<p>To me a bitter person is one who has a bitter attitude toward life,</p>
<p>while an acerbic person makes biting remarks on the follies of others.</p>

		<p>Actually, it lists bitter second, under the &quot;archaic&quot; heading. &nbsp;Prior to that it says:</p>
<p>&gt; &quot;(especially of a comment or style of speaking) sharp and forthright&quot;</p>
<p>Which seems to be something else altogether. &nbsp;And, after all, most thermonuclear devices are &quot;sharp and forthright&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Raymond &quot;It means, um&#8230; bitter.&quot; </p>
<p>No it doesn&#39;t. It&#39;s either &quot;1.(especially of a comment or style of speaking) sharp and forthright: &quot; or &quot;2.tasting sour or bitter.&quot;</p>
<p>It only means bitter if they were discussing how you taste, which I hope they weren&#39;t but I don&#39;t know what your reputation is :-)</p>

		<p>Since acerbic means sour or bitter&#8230; do you drink a lot of coffee? (I remember the characteristic chart of coffees also have acidity rating)</p>

		<p>I would suggest that when applied to personality types they mean different things. &nbsp;An acerbic personality it one characterized by being blunt or forthright. &nbsp;A bitter personality is one characterized by resentfulness.</p>

		<p>Hmmm&#8230; I haven&#39;t actually seen much evidence of &quot;thermonuclear reactions&quot; in this blog. As long as one reads the documentation, understands the underlying problem, tries not to make it into two problems, tries not to ask pointless questions, tries to &quot;be somebody&quot;, one should be perfectly fine. It all seems perfectly reasonable, so I&#39;m assuming those coworkers never bother with this blog?</p>

		<p>England used to be inhabited by travelers from Germany (the Saxons). &nbsp;&quot;Bitter&quot; was one of their words &#8212; along with &quot;f#ck&quot;, &quot;sh!t&quot;, &quot;piss&quot;, &quot;fart&quot; and &quot;bled&quot;. &nbsp;Note that these weren&#39;t their slang words; these were the proper (and only) words in the language to describe those things.</p>
<p>The in 1066, travelers from France (the Normans) invaded. &nbsp;These were the people who &quot;copulated&quot;, &quot;defecated&quot;, &quot;urinated&quot;, &quot;flatulated&quot;, and &quot;exsanguinated&quot;. &nbsp;Some were also acerbic, and like all conquerors, they:</p>
<p> &nbsp;&#8211; Made themselves the aristocracy.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&#8211; made their language the official language.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&#8211; made the native people slaves.</p>
<p> &nbsp;&#8211; denied education to the newly slaved populous (and thus having no way to learn the new official language, continued speaking their old, now outlawed, language)</p>
<p>Which is why Modern English has two words for everything. Farmers of the time would raise &quot;cows&quot; and &quot;pigs&quot;, which would be served to the masters as &quot;beef&quot; and &quot;pork&quot;.</p>
<p>In some cases, one word of the pair is deemed to be the &quot;proper, official&quot; word, used by upstanding citizens, while the other is the &quot;bad&quot; word spoken only by the lower classes.</p>
<p>So, basically, we&#39;re engaging in a 900-hundred year old class warfare, which started a half a world away, among two classes which don&#39;t exist anymore.</p>
<p>(In other cases, like &quot;ensure&quot; and &quot;insure&quot;, different words were created by our formerly rather loose spelling rules, until we decided we couldn&#39;t stand having one word spelled two different ways, and decided to give one a slightly different meaning. &nbsp;Bitter/acerbic is a victim of that as well.)</p>

<p>&quot;Females who have not yet had a calf are called heifers; after bearing a calf they are referred to as cows. Males are bulls, steers (castrated bulls), or bullocks (young steers). Bulls are not generally sold as fresh meat, and only steers, heifers, and bullocks produce beef of the highest quality.&quot;</p>

		<p>Acerbic is a quality of conversation. Bitter is a quality of state of mind.</p>
<p>Acerbic is more like sharp or maybe biting in conversation. Bitter is feeling let down by the world (something like that). </p>
<p>You can be acerbic because you&#39;re bitter. You can&#39;t really be bitter because you&#39;re acerbic.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
