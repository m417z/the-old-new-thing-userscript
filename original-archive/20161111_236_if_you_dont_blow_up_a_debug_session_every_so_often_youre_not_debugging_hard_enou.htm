I was
helping a customer live-debug an assertion failure
in an automated test running in a lab.
I messed up an attempt to unwind the stack to
restart a call and ended up corrupting the process state.
Undaunted, I realized that the issue at hand was that
one specific API call was failing,
so I said to myself, "That's okay if I can't restart the call.
I can just
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20151016-00/?p=91341">
simulate the call</a>!"
so I patched registers and manually pushed data onto the
stack and all that stuff.
</p>
<p>
And then I stepped through the code,
and it crashed
because
I messed up one detail:
When virtually pushing the return address on the stack,
I had a mental lapse and subtracted 4 from the stack pointer
even though this was a 64-bit machine and I should have
subtracted 8.
Due to the stack misalignment,
the code eventually crashed on a
<code>movaps</code>
instruction several stack frames deep into the function.
</p>
<p>
I blew up the debug session not once but twice.
</p>
<p>
If this happens to you,
don't beat yourself up.
If you don't blow up a debug session every so often,
then you're not debugging hard enough.
</p>
<p>
(That punch line is a ripoff of something I heard the
<a HREF="http://www.cartalk.com/">Car Talk</a> guys say:
"If you don't
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20070717-01/?p=25973">
stall a manual transmission</a>
every so often,
then you're not driving it right.")</p>

		<p>My saying:<br />
&#8220;If you don&#8217;t crash Windbg, you&#8217;re not debugging hard&#8221;</p>
<p>The darn thing crashes once in a while on the target reboot. I suspect because of use of .kdfiles.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m glad I don&#8217;t work in a place where manually patching stack frames in the debugger is routine procedure.  It&#8217;s nice to know there are people who can do it, though.</p>

		<p>A friend let me use his brand new car (over $40K) a couple times while I was still learning how to drive a manual a decade or so ago. When I asked him if he was sure about letting me drive, he replied &#8220;There&#8217;s no point in having teeth if you can&#8217;t grind them once in a while&#8221;.</p>

		<p>At least you didn&#8217;t blow up the debug session before it even got off the ground!  Did that to the Tandem debugger back when I was an intern &#8212; turns out, drive-relative Windows paths in NonStop debug symbols blow up INSPECT&#8217;s ThirdEye symbol processing library because it thinks they&#8217;re Tandem paths that can only be oh, 31 chars long.  Whoops!</p>

		<p>So true. The fact that you blew it twice may indicate you&#8217;re working at the limit of your abilities. It might be more effective to carefully script the call simulation (and through each failure debug the script), rather than trying again and again to manually perform this delicate and dangerous dance.</p>

		<p>+1 for the Car Talk reference. One of the most fun hours on the radio, even if it&#8217;s in reruns now, and despite the fact that I&#8217;m not a car person.  Why there isn&#8217;t an analogue show for computers is a mystery, and a shame.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
