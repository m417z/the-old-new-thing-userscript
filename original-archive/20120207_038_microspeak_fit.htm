<p> In Microspeak, <i>fit</i> is a predicate noun which is never used on its own but always comes with a modifying adjective. For something to <i>be a good fit</i> is for something to be appropriate or suitable for a particular situation. The opposite of a <i>good fit</i> is not a <i>bad fit</i>, because that's pejorative. Rather, something that is not a <i>good fit</i> is referred to as a <i>poor fit</i>. </p>

		<p>The first definition on Google for the noun form is &quot;The particular way in which something, esp. a garment or component, fits around or into something.&quot; This really isn&#39;t a particular phrase used only in Microsoft.</p>

		<p>The Microspeak (or business-speak) seems to be the ritualistic formal use of &quot;fit&quot; in the stock expressions &quot;good fit for X&quot; and &quot;poor fit for X&quot;, even where common speak would prefer &quot;(un)suitable&quot; or something more specific like &quot;overkill&quot; or &quot;incompatible in design&quot;. &quot;Poor fit&quot; in particular seems to be a euphemism for &quot;unsuitable&quot;, and &quot;good fit&quot; either a more committed way of saying &quot;applicable&quot; or a less committed way of saying &quot;the obvious solution&quot;. The meaning is not unusual, the usage is.</p>
<p>Compare &quot;An image editing tool obviously doesn&#39;t meet the criteria&quot;, &quot;The Datacenter Edition is massive overkill for most small business&quot;, &quot;The results are obtained incrementally, so we can make good use of IQueryable&lt;T&gt; and LINQ&quot;.</p>
<p>Conversely, &quot;this criminal is a good fit for the electric chair&quot;, &quot;a hedge clipper is a poor fit for haircuts&quot;, &quot;an Intel processor is a poor fit for an AMD motherboard&quot;.</p>

		<p>@Ray</p>
<p>Microspeak is not just &quot;words invented by Microsoft&quot;; it&#39;s &quot;peculiar usage that you see a lot at Microsoft</p>
<p>&lt;/quote&gt;</p>
<p>Is &quot;Body&quot; then Microspeak as well? I believe you do see a lot of &quot;Body&quot; used in peculiar ways also. Or any other common words that made a new definition since computers and the IT in general came into action since mid 80&#39;s? (Head &#8211; another human part, same HTML category; Brain &#8211; nicest one would be brainstorming &#8211; the most common IT related would be the one teachers tell in school as &#39;CPU is the brain of PC&#39;; and the list can go on forever)</p>
<p>Q.E.D.</p>
<div class="post">[<i>If those words were used at Microsoft at a higher rate than in the general language, then I would include them, but my impression is that that is not the case right now. (By your criterion, &quot;totally&quot; is not Valspeak since it is used in the general language with the same meaning. Nevermind that it is used in Valspeak far more often than in the general language.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>&#39;&#8230; Then again—&quot;before she had this fit&#8211;&quot; you never had fits, my dear, I think?&#39; he said to the Queen.</p>
<p>&#39;Never!&#39; said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the Lizard as she spoke. (The unfortunate little Bill had left off writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no mark; but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.)</p>
<p>&#39;Then the words don&#39;t *fit* you,&#39; said the King, looking round the court with a smile. There was a dead silence.</p>
<p>&#39;It&#39;s a pun!&#39; the King added in an offended tone, and everybody laughed&#8230;</p>

		<p>Are you telling me that &quot;Body&quot; is not used at Micro$oft at a higher rate then in the general language? Do I really need to point you at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.microsoft.com</a> pages and see what is the rate of the word &lt;BODY&gt; in there? Or to send you to pay a visit to those who are working on web applications (intern or external ones? I believe their number are in tens of thousands, which dream HTML even in coma?

		<p>I would propose the following working definition of &quot;Microspeak&quot;-ness:</p>
<p>Let M be the event that a person works at Microsoft.</p>
<p>Let W be the event that a person uses a (given) word w.</p>
<p>Then a word w is &quot;Microspeak&quot; iff P(M|W) &gt; P(M).</p>

		<p>@Drak, what seems to have caused a bit of head-scratching is that it is an everyday phrase that anyone anywhere is expected to understand, not an unusual use of language that is particular to MS. It&#39;s just English.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
