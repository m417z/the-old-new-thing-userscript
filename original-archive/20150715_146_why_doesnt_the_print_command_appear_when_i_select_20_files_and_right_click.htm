<p> The problem here is that users will select a large number of files, then accidentally Print all of them. This fires up 100 copies of Notepad or Photoshop or whatever, and all of them start <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/12/03/274312.aspx"> racing to the printer</a>, and most of the time, the user is frantically trying to close 100 windows to stop the documents from printing, which is a problem because 100 new processes is putting a heavy load on the system, so it's slow to respond to all the frantic clicks, and even if the click manages to make it to the printing application, the application is running so slowly due to disk I/O contention that it takes a long time for it to respond to the click anyway. </p>
<p> In panic, the user pulls the plug to the computer. </p>
<p> The limit of 15 documents for legacy verbs tries to limit the scope of the damage. You will get at most 15 new processes starting at once, which is still a lot, but is significantly more manageable than 100 processes. </p>
<p> Player verbs and COM-based verbs have higher limits because they are typically all handled by a single program, so there's only one program that you need to close. (Although there is one popular player that still runs a separate process for each media file, so if you select 1000 music files, right-click, and select "Add to playlist", it runs 1000 copies of the program, which basically turns your computer into a space heater. An arbitrary limit of 100 was chosen to keep the damage under control.) </p>
<p> If you want to raise the 15-document limit, you can <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/2022295"> adjust the <code>Multiple&shy;Invoke&shy;Prompt&shy;Minimum</code></a> setting. Note that this setting is not contractual, so don't get too attached to it. </p>

		<p>The broken link has something to do with the automatic translation feature of Microsoft&#39;s support site. When I click on it, I get redirected to <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="https://support.microsoft.com/">https://support.microsoft.com/</a> es-es/kb/2022295 (space inserted so the URL doesn&#39;t get truncated in the comment), probably because my default locale is ES-es. That URL gives an &quot;article not found&quot; error. Replacing &quot;es-es&quot; with either &quot;en-en&quot; or &quot;en-us&quot; gives the correct article. This problem should affect only overseas readers with non-English locales, and would be corrected by inserting &quot;en-us/&quot; in the URL of the link.</p>

		<p>That&#39;s patently stupid behavior on MSDN&#39;s part. I would want to read the original documentation even if a translation to my local language is available. Redirecting to a non-existing version just makes things work.</p>

		<p>Ever since Vista, the &quot;Open&quot; verb also doesn&#39;t appear/work if you select just 2 different file extensions and press Enter e.g. 1 DOC and 1 DOCX. Thankfully Send To works so a simple VBScript placed in the Send To folder to open each file with its associated default program works on any number of files and the script can also be modified to not open all files at once but sleep for a few seconds.</p>

		<p>@Niklas: the impact of querying file data can also cause performance issues&#8230; while perhaps not as severe, you never known whether the &quot;more than 15 files&quot; are on a local SSD, a local magnetic disk, a remote network share, a CD/DVD, or even on a floppy disk&#8230; additionally, I&#39;ve worked with some *very* large folders (200k+)&#8230; the impact of &quot;clicking the button to show more details&quot; is minimal to the user, and can have a HUGE impact to system(s).</p>

		<p>@Scott Brickey: I guess I can see how that could be a problem, but would still prefer a few hundred as the limit at least. As an aside, I tried to modify the setting per the link Raymond provided, but it did not seem to take even though I did re-login after adding the registry value. Well, maybe the contract already expired :)</p>

<p>That seems to be something that changed starting with Vista. &nbsp;In Windows XP I could select a large number of files in Explorer and it would show me the total size. &nbsp;When I switched to Vista in 2007 I found the new behavior a bit annoying. &nbsp;And I still do.</p>

		<p>@Niklas</p>
<p>The first thing I did after reading this article was try the setting and see if it would also work to raise the &quot;show more details&quot; limit. But I wasn&#39;t surprised when it didn&#39;t work after restarting Explorer and checking I created/spelled everything right, since the two things &#8211; what the blog article is talking about and that Explorer UI feature &#8211; are not the same (or at least so I think). And I&#39;ve also made the mistake of right-clicking print after selecting a bunch of files, so I probably would have reverted the setting even if it did also work for that unrelated thing.</p>

		<p>No, it does NOT explain why you have to click show more data for &gt;15 or 100 files. This is not because of some inherent complexity, this is just bad design which could have fixed long time ago, but didn&#39;t.</p>
<p>Keep in mind, that when you&#39;re reading the directory with FindNextFile, you also get the file size and timestamps. There is no added cost to get the total size.</p>

		<p>Hiding / disabling elements is a confusing UI paradigm &#8212; just put yourself in the user&#39;s position: sometimes it shows up, sometimes it doesn&#39;t, with no apparent rhyme or reason. &nbsp;Better would be to keep it, and if they invoke the command, then pop up that you can&#39;t print more than 15 items at a time &#8212; at least this way they have a hope of understanding what&#39;s going on. &nbsp;Oh, I&#39;m sure there are technical hurdles, but still (how about hiding the original verb and replacing it with a stub that shows the information?)</p>

		<p>Mark S: Having a bunch of UI elements that are just sitting there, only to give you an error message, isn&#39;t a good experience for the user either. If I want to know what functions I&#39;m allowed to perform for the current state, do I just have to click on everything to see what works? I&#39;d much rather see it visually.</p>
<p>If the user needs to know why the option isn&#39;t available, a tooltip on the disabled feature ought to be sufficient. In some cases, perhaps trying to use the disabled feature could bring up a dialog box to get the program into the state that enables it (e.g. &quot;You need to be an administrator to edit this. Enter admin credentials here:&quot;).</p>

		<p>Why can&#39;t windows remember if it took &quot;long time&quot; last time a user selected &quot;many&quot; files and did some &quot;action&quot;, and then decide if it should allow the &quot;action&quot; on &quot;many&quot; files? This isn&#39;t rocket science, a five year old can figure this stuff out.</p>
<div class="post">[<em>What&#39;s the definition of &quot;a long time&quot;? Is this remember for each file type, for each collection, for each action? E.g. &quot;The last time the user selected A.DOC, B.DOC, and C.DOC, and selected &#39;print&#39;, it took 5 minutes. I should warn them the next time they select A.DOC, B.DOC, and C.DOC and select &#39;print&#39;. But if they select A.DOC, B.DOC, and D.DOC, then no warning, because maybe the problem was that C.DOC was too big.&quot;? (And if C.DOC is smaller now than it was last time, maybe I don&#39;t warn.) -Raymond</em>]</div>

Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
