<p> Despite the friendliness of people in the Pacific Northwest (or perhaps because of it), bank robberies in the area are above the national average. But in the Seattle area they went down by nearly half in the beginning of 2007. The reason isn't known for certain, but one factor may be <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2003661713_safecatch11m.html"> a new approach to thwarting bank robbers</a> by employing "aggressive friendliness" and rattling the nerves of a would-be robber. </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p> Scott Taffera sensed something was wrong when a man walked into the Ballard bank branch he manages wearing garden gloves, a hat and sunglasses. </p>
<p> But instead of following the nonconfrontational strategy used by most banks with suspicious people, Taffera approached the man with a hearty greeting and an offer to help. He invited him to remove his hat and sunglasses, and guided him to an equally bubbly teller. </p>
<p> In the end, the oddly dressed man requested a roll of quarters before slinking out the door. </p>

<p> By the end of 2007, <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004107551_webbankrobbery04m.html"> bank robberies in the state hit a 20-year low</a>, dropping the state <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2004108641_bankrobberies05m.html"> from fourth most robbed in the nation to eleventh</a>. </p>

		<p>The implication is that he was going to rob the place, but other than his &quot;odd&quot; wardrobe there was nothing to suggest this was the case. &nbsp;Here&#8217;s an idea &#8211; maybe he was a freaking gardener!</p>

		<p>John: So he&#8217;s a gardener. The only difference is that he gets better-than-average service. It&#8217;s a win-win situation. :)</p>

		<p>Some years ago, the then mayor of Alexandria, Virginia, saw a fellow walk into his bank with a handgun. He sat the man down and started selling him a loan, explaining terms, etc., and carried it on till the police arrived. As I recall, there was no question that the man had the handgun to rob the bank.</p>

		<p>Years ago I was a floor manager for Toys R Us and basically our rules for dealing with shoplifters was basically the same.</p>
<p>An increased attention on the customer, especially suspicious ones, sets up the expectations that customers are being watched (in a good way), and that shoplifting is unlikely to succeed.</p>
<p>As James says, &nbsp;the &#8216;suspicious&#8217; types that are really customers get better service and the thieves are rattled and bug off.</p>

		<p>So the best way to get good customer service is to act suspicious. Of course, it could also get you a visit from the police instead of good service.</p>

		<p>@john</p>
<p>Who needed a roll of quarters?</p>
<p>Here in Costa Rica you can&#8217;t even enter a bank wearing anything that obscures your face, and cell phone use is not permitted.</p>

<p>Maybe he had parked his lawnmower somewhere where you need to put small change into the parking machine, and needed quarters to pay for his space :)</p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>The problem is to figure out where you&#8217;ll get better service and where you&#8217;ll just get a squirt of mace and a set of new bracelets. :-(</p>

		<p>In the evening after a meal, some people like walking in parks. Me, I like to troll around in the local home improvement stores looking at cool cordless drills, nail guns etc&#8230;</p>
<p>NOW I understand why I get better service in the evening.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
