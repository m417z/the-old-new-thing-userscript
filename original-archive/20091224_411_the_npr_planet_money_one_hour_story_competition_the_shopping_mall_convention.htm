<p>Voting closed last night on the second NPR Planet Money one-hour story competition. Three reporters were sent into a convention (this time, the <i>International Council of Shopping Centers</i> conference) and given one hour to collect tape for a story. <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/money/2009/12/podcast_iron_reporter_competit.html"> Listen to the results</a>, either in the full podcast format or just to the three individual stories.</p>
<p> Each of the stories was interesting in its own way. From Adam Davidson, I learned some mall restaurant jargon. From Chana Joffe-Walt, I learned about the pursuit of the cool kids. And from Alex Blumberg, I learned why a guy dressed in a bright red blazer known only as <i>McGuire</i> is the most popular guy at the convention. </p>
<p> My vote went to Chana's story. </p>

		<p>I was struck by the misunderstandings in the first two pieces. First, the mall folks inability to disambiguate between Greek and Roman culture (okay the Romans did copy a lot of the earlier Greek culture). Second, Chana&#8217;s use of the &#8220;cool kids&#8221; was that she was making an analogy of cool kids with mall anchors. If the mall is to be successful it needs a &#8220;cool kid&#8221; or popular mall anchor such as Red Robin or Best Buy. People will go to where the cool kid is. The mall folks interpreted it to mean that they needed to attract cool kids (popular adolescents) themselves (as opposed to less desirable mall rats. This slow uptake by these mall folks probably demonstrates why then need to attend the convention.</p>

		<p>It didn&#8217;t help that the ATC director (&quot;the stuffy British judge&quot;) told listeners that Chana was the judges pick, and then he told everyone to go listen to the podcast and vote themselves.. That&#8217;s salting the vote..</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
