		<p>Wow, he&#8217;s coming right to me!  That tears it, I&#8217;m going to have to meet him and have him sign my copies of his books.  And maybe I&#8217;ll have time to tell him my Thanksgiving story&#8230;</p>
<p>On this last Thanksgiving my wife eight-and-a-half months pregnant.  She was in a lot of pain and could hardly move and had been that way for several months.  Because of this she couldn&#8217;t go anywhere for Thanksgiving and she really didn&#8217;t feel like having anyone over.</p>
<p>I was determined to give her a good Thanksgiving dinner despite all this.  Fortunately, I&#8217;d discovered Good Eats this year and had seen the &quot;Romancing the Bird&quot; episode.  I followed Alton&#8217;s advice in that episode and used his recipes and ended up cooking one of the best Thanksgiving dinners we&#8217;ve ever had.  The turkey was fantastic, and the dressing was delicious.  It was all so good I could hardly believe that I had made it, and it made my wife very happy.</p>

		<p>Alton Brown, geek cooking god, is on a book tour promoting his new book &quot;I&#8217;m Just Here For More Food&quot; and visiting Seattle at the end of January. Must go. I love his show Good Eats on the Food Network,&#8230;</p>

		<p>Ha ha!  Not only did I get &quot;More Food&quot; for Christmas, he&#8217;s coming to Tampa!</p>
<p>I made his Sweet Potato Pie for Christmas and Thanksgiving.  Soooo delicious.</p>

		<p>If you like Alton, read &quot;On Food and Cooking&quot; by Harold McGee. It&#8217;s the definitive bible of Alton&#8217;s style of kitchen lore.</p>

		<p>Neat! David got me his first book for hannukah last month, and we just made the salisbury steak recipe last night. I love the show and the fact that he has a blog.</p>

		<p>If you are going to two bookstores in Seattle would you just make a small stop in Portland?  You have at least two die-hard fans that would love to meet you.  Portland does have the largest bookstore in the world, how could you miss that?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
