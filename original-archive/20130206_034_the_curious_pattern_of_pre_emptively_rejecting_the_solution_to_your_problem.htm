<p>
A frustrating pattern that shows up occasionally in customer
questions is the case where the customer poses a problem,
and pre-emptively rejects the mechanism explicitly designed
to solve that problem.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
How can we change the widget color without using
<code>IWidget::<wbr>Set&shy;Color</code>?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Um, the whole point of
<code>IWidget::<wbr>Set&shy;Color</code>
is to change the color of a widget.
Why are you rejecting the mechanism whose sole purpose
in life is to solve the very problem you are having?
</p>
<p>
Usually, if you press hard enough, they will cough up the
reason why they think they cannot use the solution specifically
designed to do what they want.
Various excuses tend to come up over and over.
</p>
<p>
One excuse is the belief that the proposed solution
does not work in a particular scenario.
"We cannot use ACLs because they don't work on network volumes."
Um, yes they do.
Check it out.
</p>
<p>
Or that the proposed solution doesn't fit their choice
of technology.
"We are programming in a language that does not support
COM objects.
We can only p/invoke to C-style APIs."
Well, you can work around that problem by writing a helper
DLL that exposes a C-style API, and implements it by
calling the COM method.
</p>
<p>
Or that the proposed solution violates some vague corporate
policy.
"We have a corporate policy that users cannot change widget colors,
so the
<code>IWidget::<wbr>Set&shy;Color</code> method returns
<code>E_ACCESS&shy;DENIED</code>.
We're looking for a way around that policy."
Okay, well, now that's something you need to take up with the
people who establish your corporate policies.
Don't come to us looking for ways to circumvent corporate policy.
</p>
<p>
One time, the reason came from our
own technical support staff:
"We cannot write a C++ program that calls
<code>IWidget::<wbr>Set&shy;Color</code>
and provide it to the customer
because we are not a developer support team.
We are not allowed to send compiled binaries to the customer
for liability reasons,
and we generally do not send
source code because our customers
typically do not have the expertise or desire to install
Visual Studio and
the Platform SDK just to compile and run a five-line C++ program.
(Did I mention that we are not a developer support team?)
Can it be done from a batch file?"
</p>
<p>
Yeah, how about this batch file:
</p>
<pre>
 &gt;changeColor.cs echo using System;
&gt;&gt;changeColor.cs echo class Program {
&gt;&gt;changeColor.cs echo public static void Main(string[] args) {
&gt;&gt;changeColor.cs echo ...
&gt;&gt;changeColor.cs echo }
&gt;&gt;changeColor.cs echo }
%windir%\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\csc changeColor.cs
changeColor blue
</pre>
<p>
Only half-joking.
</p>
<p>
The non-joking answer is
"The customer can take this information to a developer support team,
or at least somebody who will write the program for them,
if they don't know how to write a program themselves."
Microsoft Consulting Services exists for this, but that is
likely overkill for a five-line program.</p>

		<p>The one&#39;s I like are when someone says &quot;I can&#39;t use X&quot;, and then refuses to elaborate on WHY. So then, you come back with &quot;Well, if you don&#39;t want to use SetColor(blue), you could use SetAttribute(&quot;Color&quot;,blue)&quot;, and they again reject it (and again refuse to say why).</p>
<p>It then becomes a fun guessing game as you proposes solutions and see each one shot down, and try to divine the pattern yourself on what is or is not prohibited.</p>

<p>The engineering response to a brain-dead corporate policy is to bypass whatever is enforcing it. Sometimes the policy cannot be changed for political reasons but must not be enforced. This is also what leads to the various patches circulating that disable group policy altogether.</p>

		<p>How about: &quot;For various reasons we&#39;re considering technology Y for an upcoming project, and I&#39;m trying to get a handle on which kind of problems that choice may lead to. One problem is changing widget colors, where it looks like it would be quite complex and painful to call the ordinary IWidget::SetColor from Y code. Is there a different way to achieve the same effect in a more Y-friendly manner? An email interface would be ideal, because email meshes particularly well with the Y concurrency model.&quot;</p>

		<p>@Andrew: I&#39;m well aware of that.</p>
<p>An amusing case was calling some COM entity from NSIS installer. NSIS can&#39;t do COM lookup, and DLL plugins for it have to be specially compiled as the C libraries aren&#39;t set up. If the vendor&#39;s compiler can&#39;t it&#39;s quite a puzzle. It turns out that NSIS can in fact be used by treating the COM interface as an ordinary structure and walking the vtable, but it&#39;s very painful.</p>
<p>Thankfully this comes up rarely in cases early enough in the install that the C++ runtime install can&#39;t run first.</p>
<p>This gets from amusing to painful when calling via a strange language that doesn&#39;t know about COM and can&#39;t coerce types. Having to write all those wrapper modules (same DLL or many DLLs doesn&#39;t matter) gets painful.</p>

		<p>I might want the SetColor equivalent that works on all controls, not just those the Microsoft API designers decided to permit. &nbsp;What&#39;s the big damn deal about letting me make e.g. a &quot;STOP!&quot; button that&#39;s red with white lettering even though the system Button Face Color is part of the systemwide theme / colorscheme? &nbsp;I frequently have reasons to want to get around ARTIFICIAL LIMITATIONS in the abstract APIs that have been wrapped around the fundamentals that do what I want.</p>

		<p>@Chris Chiesa: So we have you to thank for all those horrible GUIs that ignore all conventions and user defined properties? Believe me you may think that having 50 applications on your desktop that all look and behave completely different from each other is great, but users disagree.</p>

		<p>@TightA***: seeing as .NET websites that aren&#39;t precompiled use this compiler to compile on the fly as a page is served for the first time, I&#39;d say that you have a good chance to find this compiler in the .NET framework folder :)</p>

		<p>If the calling language doesn&#39;t &quot;support&quot; COM, what&#39;s so hard about using the vtable directly? &nbsp;After all, COM was explicitly designed to be usable from C and not require C++.</p>
<p>Writing a wrapper DLL and creating a whole new project might be a bit overkill&#8230;</p>

		<p>[It&#39;s essential if you want to avoid trailing spaces and don&#39;t want to run into trouble with lines that end in a digit. -Raymond]</p>
<p>Good point. I usually use bash where the trailing spaces are omitted unless quoted, so I wasn&#39;t aware of this problem.</p>

		<p>@TightA***: Yes, the C# command-line compiler is installed with every version of the .NET framework. You do not need Visual Studio to build .NET applications.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
