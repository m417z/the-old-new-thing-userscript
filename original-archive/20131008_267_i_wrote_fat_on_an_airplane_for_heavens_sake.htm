<p>When you wrote code for 16-bit Windows, one of the things you spent time doing as part of performance tuning was deciding which functions should be grouped together in which segments.</p>
<p> Code in 16-bit Windows executed out of code segments, each of which could be up to 64<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/06/11/9725386.aspx">KB</a> in size. When a code segment was loaded from disk, the entire segment was loaded, and when it was discarded, the entire segment was discarded. This meant that you could affect your application's performance in significant ways by choosing which functions go in which segments. </p>
<p> For example, it was to your advantage to keep functions that are called at the same time in the same segment, so that they would be loaded as a unit (saving I/O time). If you chose poorly and put unrelated functions in the same segment, then calling any function in the segment caused all the functions to be loaded, which was a waste of I/O since you loaded a bunch of functions you didn't need. </p>
<p> Even if the functions were called at the same time, you also had to keep an eye on their popularity. If you have one function that is called frequently and another that is called infrequently (but always preceded by a call to the first function), the less popular function will ride the coattails of his roommate and remain loaded in memory. This creates unnecessary memory pressure that could cause a function which is moderately-frequently-called to be discarded to make room. </p>
<p> Creating lots of small segments allowed your memory usage to be managed with finer granularity, but it also costs you in general overhead as well as I/O, because each segment load was a new round trip to the disk. You therefore had to balance memory cost against I/O cost. </p>
<p> The process of optimizing the grouping of functions into segments was known as <i>segment tuning</i>. </p>
<p> During the development of Windows&nbsp;3.0, it was customary to have regular meetings with Bill Gates to brief him on the status of the project. At one of the reviews, the topic was performance, and Bill complained, "You guys are spending all this time with your segment tuning tinkering. I could teach a twelve-year-old to segment-tune. I want to see some <i>real</i> optimization, not this segment tuning nonsense. I wrote <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc938438.aspx"> FAT</a> on an airplane, for heaven's sake." </p>
<p> (I can't believe I had to write this: This is a dramatization, not a courtroom transcript.) </p>
<p> This "I wrote FAT on an airplane" line was apparently one Bill used when he wanted to complain that what other people was doing wasn't Real Programming. But this time, the development manager decided she'd had enough. </p>
<p> "Fine, Bill. We'll set you up with a machine fully enlisted in the Windows source code, and you can help us out with some of your programming magic, why don't you." </p>
<p> This shut him up. </p>

		<p>Even in the old mainframe days, we used to profile code so we would know how often certain routines were called. &nbsp;We would then reorder source code to make sure certain routines were relatively close to each other. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Back in those days, machines cost millions of dollars and programmers cost thousands. &nbsp;Therefore, we sacrificed the time of humans to serve the needs of the machine. &nbsp;Today, we have developers making very good money writing code for a device that retails for $100. &nbsp;In today&#39;s world, we sacrifice the machine to serve the needs of humans. &nbsp;Today&#39;s world is completely upside down from the &quot;olden days&quot;.</p>

		<p>&quot;I wrote FAT on an airplane&quot; is not an argument that would impress me. It seems to me like it&#39;s exactly the kind of thing you would get when writing code on an airplane &#8212; which I mean neither negatively nor positively. And I hope that was the day mr. Gates learned that arguments of the form &quot;I did something awesome, why do you continue to suck?&quot; do not tend to inspire people.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t mind if billg gets a little arrogant at times. &nbsp;One merely has to look at how he wrote the ROM code for the Altair to realize his abilities.</p>
<p>Also, ALL of the concepts embodied in modern tablets and smartphones were &quot;invented&quot; by billg when he wrote the code for the Tandy 100. &nbsp;Things like &quot;instant on&quot;, data stored in &nbsp;non-volitile memory, small productivity apps, continue from the same point after power down, etc. &nbsp;Persoannly, I put billg in the Top 5 of all-time CS people who contributed to computing.</p>
<p>BTW, my Top #1 is Alan Turing.</p>

		<p>@ Alex &#8212; I don&#39;t disagree with you at all. &nbsp;However, the cost of that extra $1 per device is distributed of thse users of the software. &nbsp;In the &quot;Olden Days&quot;, we used to write software for a single machine. &nbsp;Today&#39;s development costs are spread over millions or possibly billions of users. &nbsp;That changes the Math in significant ways.</p>

		<p>&gt;continue from the same point after power down, etc.</p>
<p>Never written a PDP11 powerfail handler, I see.</p>
<p>(Admittedly that was about carrying on after a complete and unanticipated loss of power, during which you had maybe 10mS to save machine state to core)</p>

		<p>I remember running a benchmark back in the early days of VMS that caused the swapper to swap itself out. Mind you, that was a long time ago. We ran the benchmark in the Dublin office and our save tape was stuck in Irish customs &#8211; fortunately someone from Digital realised they could send the code over their internal network &#8211; so we actually had something to run, I&#39;m not sure we ever got that tape back!</p>

		<p>A related issue: I read a story from long ago, in the early days of IBM 360. The machine did provide paging hardware, but the OS didn&#39;t support it (yet). With limited memroy, programmers had to manually manage the overlay of different logical segment in the same physical memory space, always ensuring that no two function that were active at the same time claimed the same physical addresses. IBM released a new version of their system software, including an intellegent linker that tracked all calls and created all the overlay segments automtatically, releaving the programmer of a lot of work. But then, this was also the software release that introduced support for the paging hardware, creating an &quot;unlimited&quot; (virtual) memory space so there was no longer any need for making overlays at alll, it could all be handled in hardware by the paging mechanism.</p>

		<p>@ j b &#8212; the first itreration of S/360 software was released before disk drives were considered ready for the commercial world. &nbsp;At that time, everything was focused on &quot;unit record processing (i.e. cards). &nbsp;One didn&#39;t need to worry about virtual memory since most of the early programs were ports of code written to run under OS/MFP or OS/MVP. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Even though virtual memory wasn&#39;t implemented in 1.0 of OS/360, there were hooks ready to support it. &nbsp;Fred Brooks insisted that virtual memory was the future and that S/360 had to support it no matter what. &nbsp;That meant that we could write code for unlimited memory and rest assured that our code would be just fine in future iterations.</p>

		<p>And yet, I feel Bill Gates had a totally valid point, and anybody who has worked with post-Gates era Microsoft software surely knows what I&#39;m talking about.</p>
<p>I have a much better opinion of him after reading this, to be honest.</p>

		<p>He wrote DOS on a single sheet of Holiday Inn note paper on his way to meet with IBM, so writing FAT on a plane should have been a piece of cake. &nbsp;I never got FAT on a plane &#8211; portion size too small.</p>

		<p>Winston &#8211; you think he wrote DOS? Check your history. But maybe you were joking.</p>
<p>Bob Vila &#8211; everyone else is not a slave and Bill DID do some things right, as you said, but a lot of it is attributable to being in the right place at the right time doing something for a company that was afraid of looking like they were trying to set up another monopoly, which they had already been sued for by the government in regards to mainframes, and so they were willing to let it be licensed to other PC makers. Bill is obviously a smart guy, but to a certain extent after he got the contract with IBM, it was like a snowball rolling downhill.</p>

		<p>The article reminds me a lot of the efficiency issues associated with IBM&#39;s CICS, and dates from roughly the same era. &nbsp;Nowadays there are many ways around performance issues, and the bottleneck is understanding existing code well enough to be able to make a change to it, without introducing defects to existing functionality.</p>

		<p>Dave (about three days up the comment chain)&gt; (Admittedly that was about carrying on after a complete and unanticipated loss of power, during which you had maybe 10mS to save machine state to core)</p>
<p>What would you have to save if you were working on a machine with core memory? Registers? Anything else?</p>

		<p>Gates didn&#39;t originally develop FAT for DOS (or QDOS). It was for Microsoft Stand-alone Disk BASIC-80 for the 8080 processor. It was tweaked for use with QDOS and directory/subdirectory capability was added soon after.</p>

		<p>If you have something that sould take at much 400ms to run, and it need 24 seconds. Tryiing to do optimizations that will gain you nice 25% or maybe even heroic 75% faster computing is completelly useless. You need to make your code some orders of magnitude faster. </p>

		<p>This seems particularly amusing with hindsight; I recall IBM boasting &#8211; a few years after this point, I think &#8211; of the improvements in the next release of OS/2, in particular arranging their code so related functions were on the same page together for much the same reasons. Of course, I also remember segment tweaking two decades later for code on the Palm, which still had 64k segments (and a limitation of 32k jump instructions, IIRC), making porting big chunks of C &#39;interesting&#39;.</p>
<p>Now even a cellphone has a 32 bit CPU and hundreds of megabytes of RAM, have we finally seen the last of this, or will we find ourselves in 2030 juggling the code to fit better in the limited resources of injectable nanites?</p>

		<p>An alternative view of the origin of the FAT file system from Wikipedia:</p>
<p>Marc B. McDonald is an American who was Microsoft&#39;s first salaried employee (not counting Monte Davidoff, who wrote the math package for BASIC for a flat fee). He is credited with designing the FAT File System for Standalone Basic which was the file system for the MS-DOS operating system and Microsoft Windows. </p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
