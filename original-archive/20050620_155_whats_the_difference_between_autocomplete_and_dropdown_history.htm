<p>One shows things that might be, the other shows things that were. Both of them try to help you type something, but they operate differently (and look confusingly similar).</p>
<p> Let's take the second case first. Dropdown history, like you see in the Run dialog, common file dialogs, and the Internet Explorer address bar. The cue for dropdown history is a button with a downward-pointing arrow on it. When you click it, a list box with a scrollbar appears. Dropdown history shows you <strong>what you already typed</strong> into the dialog previously, and its contents are independent of what you've typed so far. </p>
<p> Autocomplete tries to guess what you're typing based on an existing database, typically files on your hard drive or web pages you've visited. The autocomplete dropdown is a popup window that filters itself as you type. </p>
<p> Since dropdown history remembers what you actually typed, the Run dialog history can remember command line arguments. On the other hand, autocomplete is based on what's on the system and what web sites you've visited, so it can suggest things you've never typed. Type "C:\" and an autocomplete window appears with everything in the root of your C drive. On the other hand, autocomplete can't remember command line arguments since that's not what it's drawing from. </p>

		<p>Dropdown history can often have a little bit of autocomplete thrown in for good measure. The Run dialog is a good example, where if you type &#8216;C:&#8217; you&#8217;ll see other entries starting with &#8216;C:&#8217; in the drop down list that you&#8217;d typed previously, as well as all of the subdirectories that exist in &#8216;C:&#8217;.</p>

		<p>From a user-interface standpoint, autocomplete is a good example of one of the worst features NOT in windows: it doesn&#8217;t store its previous size.</p>
<p>On my system I run two 1024&#215;1280 monitors.  Assuming that the average user just has a single 1280&#215;1024 display, the autocomplete list in the run dialog still takes up less than 2% of the available screen space.</p>
<p>This is just plain silly.  The size translates to about 7 list items, and if the mouse hovers over either the top or bottom two it scrolls at hyper-ludicrous speed up or down.</p>
<p>The autocomplete list in IE suffers from the same size issue.  When trying to find a site I&#8217;ve been to before, the first thing I do once the list has dropped down is to grab my mouse and size it to fill about half the screen, then continue typing.</p>
<p>(Another problem with the auto-complete list is that the list items aren&#8217;t selectable with Tab, but that&#8217;s minor compared to the main issue.)</p>

<br />Have you tried the up/down arrow keys? </p>
<p>Or maybe I misunderstood what you&#8217;d like to do&#8230;</p>

		<p>Andreas: As a keyboard user, using Tab means that I don&#8217;t have to move my fingers off of the home keys.  The up/down arrows (not the ones on the keypad) work fine, but using them means moving my right hand (and eyes) over to the right.  It shifts my focus from the task at hand.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s no big deal, but Tab is so much easier, esp. if you&#8217;re used VStudio&#8217;s auto-complete feature.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
