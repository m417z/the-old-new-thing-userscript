<p> First of all, when I was growing up, grass jelly wasn't a drink. It was a dessert. It came in a block, and you diced it up into pieces about one cubic centimeter in size&mdash;not the microscopic flecks that you end up in the beveragicized version. You put a few spoonfuls of it in a bowl and stirred in some sugar water and crushed ice. Of course, you had to crush the ice yourself by hand, because that's the way it was done; it built up the anticipation. (You had to crush it uphill both ways.) When you assembled the dessert, you ate it with a spoon. </p>
<p> This grass jelly drink is just a pale imitation of the original. It's like if somebody mocked Jell-O gelatin because it was served to them pureed in a shot glass. </p>

		<p>&quot;You had to crush it uphill both ways.&quot;</p>
<p>This line is particularly hilarious to me. &nbsp;I&#8217;ve always wondered what grass jelly drink was, as I&#8217;ve seen it in my local supermarkets (I swear I have seen that exact same brand even).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m a rat as well. &nbsp;According to Wikipedia, I am &quot;wood rat&quot; specifically. &nbsp;Wikipedia makes being a rat sound pretty nice overall!</p>

		<p>At least you admit you had to crush it uphill both ways.</p>
<p>Crazy, odd, strange is typically in the eye of the beholder and generally speaks more of their ignorance (or arrogance).</p>

		<p>&quot;(You had to crush it uphill both ways.)&quot;</p>
<p>You were lucky. I had to crush it 26 hours per day while working in a carboard box in a middle of a higway. My employer beated me all the time and my father trashed us to sleep with a broken bottle every day when we got home. Of course, we did not have real home so we lived in a septic tank.</p>
<p>And you try and tell the young people of today that&#8230; they won&#8217;t believe you.</p>

		<p>Sounds kind of like some of the stuff in halo-halo. &nbsp;I used to drink that stuff all the time when I was in the Philippines.</p>

		<p>Grass jelly &#8211; good stuff!</p>
<p>I have to agree, when I was growing up, I usually got it in big chunks. Much better than the drink version.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve also had grass jelly cubes in shaved ice, usually with some fruit, peanuts, or red/green beans.</p>
<p>The writer of the grass jelly page just didn&#8217;t get the good stuff&#8230; But it&#8217;s probably an acquired taste anyways.</p>

		<p>There aren&#8217;t any positive reviews, so it&#8217;s hard to take their criticism seriously. Especially as some of the drinks they review are quite tasty.</p>

		<p>I first encountered grass jelly as something tossed into boba tea. Does that make it count as a beverage? &nbsp;I wonder how many of today&#8217;s kids think of tapioca as a beverage.</p>

		<p>I can definitely confirm that it&#8217;s not crazy in the slightest. &nbsp;Grass jelly can be a very refreshing beverage/dessert on a hot summer&#8217;s day and it should still possible to find large cans filled with solid blocks of it in most Chinese supermarkets. &nbsp;And by solid blocks, I mean quasi-firm gelatinous cylinders that need to be cut up.</p>
<p>To sweeten it, I usually add a bit of maple syrup to the grass jelly (and again, it&#8217;s best served chilled). &nbsp;It&#8217;s also very good with a scoop of vanilla ice cream added on top.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s a dessert here in India too, popular especially in the eastern states. We call it &quot;China grass&quot;.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
