Open up the Date and Time control panel and go to the Time Zones tab.
Notice anything wrong with the world map?
Take a close look at northern Europe.
</p>
<p>
Depending on what version of Windows you have, you might
see a body of water where Poland should be.

whether your copy of Windows&nbsp;XP has this problem</a>
depends
on precisely what version you have.

<p>
Where did the great Polish Sea come from?
</p>
<p>
This weekend marks the end of Summer Time in Europe,
and the answer has to do with time zones.
</p>
<p>
Recall that the Windows&nbsp;95 control panel highlighted your current
time zone on the map.
To accomplish this,
each time zone was assigned a different label in the time zone bitmap.
To draw the map, the portions of the world whose label was the same as
the selected time zone were drawn in bright green, and the parts that
were different were drawn in dark green.
So far so good.
</p>
<p>
When the
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/08/22/54679.aspx">
highlighting on the time zone map had to be disabled</a>,
all that happened was that the "color for the selected time zone"
was set to dark green.
The code still went through the motions of drawing the time zone
in a "different" color, but since the colors were the same at the end of
the day, the visual effect was that the highlighting was removed.
</p>
<p>
To determine which parts of the world are land and which parts
are sea, the time zone map enumerated all the time zones as well
as the labels associated with each time zone.
(You can see them in the registry under "MapID".)
In this way, the land masses of the
world gradually emerged from the ocean as
the time zones claimed each spot of land one by one.
</p>
<p>
The shell team did make one fatal mistake, however,
obvious in retrospect:
It assumed that the world's time zones would never change.
But what happens when a country changes its time zone,
as Poland did?
At the time Windows&nbsp;95 was released, Poland was on its own
custom time zone, which Windows&nbsp;95 called
"Warsaw Standard <nobr>Time/<wbr>Warsaw</nobr> Daylight Time",
but it didn't stay that way for long.
Just within Windows&nbsp;95 and Windows&nbsp;98,
Poland's time zone went by the following names:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Windows&nbsp;95: (GMT+01:00) Warsaw
<li>Windows&nbsp;95: (GMT+01:00) Lisbon, Warsaw
<li>Windows&nbsp;98: (GMT+01:00) Bratislava, Budapest, Ljubljana, Prague, Warsaw
<li>Windows&nbsp;98: (GMT+01:00) Sarajevo, Skopje, Sofija, Warsaw, Zagreb
</ul>
<p>
And that's not counting the changes that were made in
Windows&nbsp;NT, Windows&nbsp;2000 or
Windows&nbsp;XP or their service packs.
It's not that Poland's time zone actually changed that many times.
Rather, the way it was grouped with its neighbors changed.
I don't know why all these changes were made,
but I suspect political issues played a major role.
</p>
<p>
As a result of all this realignment,
the "Warsaw Standard Time" time zone
disappeared, and with it, its associated land mass.
Consequently, the land corresponding to Poland remained underwater.
And for some reason, nobody brought this problem to the attention
of the shell team until a couple years ago.
</p>
<p>
In order to fix this, a new world bitmap needed to be made
with new labels (labeling the pixels corresponding to Poland as
"Central European Time") so that Poland would once again emerge
from the sea.
Even though the highlighting is gone, the map code still needs to
know where every time zone is so it can raise them from the ocean floor.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, all this will soon fall into the mists of history,
because Windows Vista has a completely rewritten time zone
control panel, so the mistakes of the past can finally be shed.
Let's hope the people who wrote the new time zone control panel
remembered Poland.</p>

		<p>Is there any non-obvious negative impact to select &quot;wrong&quot; timezone group that have the same utc offset?</p>
<p>The time zones on windows mobile has fewer contries (capitals) in each group, at least what is displayed in gui.</p>

<p>Doesn&#8217;t the current timezone map recenter based on the selected timezone. &nbsp;(So the approximate center of the selected timezone is always in the middle of the map).</p>
<p>Hmm, at least on my install of XP (complete with sunken Poland) the map recenters when you change timezone.</p>
<p>So did you just dislike the fact that after install the default timezone is Redmond, Washington&#8217;s?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m not sure why there&#8217;s a division between Amsterdam and Madrid (for example) since all EU countries have, since at least 1996, used the same dates for going into/out of summer time.

<p>Prague should probably be in the same group as well, as the Czech Republic has been a member of the EU since May 2004. Bulgaria and Romania are due to join in January 2007.</p>

		<p>For time zones, you almost need to have the ability to implement a custom set of rules. &nbsp;On this date and time, advace/retard the clock by this amount of time.</p>

		<p>Clearly, since it&#8217;s also clear that a time zone picker would just be <em>better</em> in 3D, because after all, it&#8217;s one more D!</p>
<p>It&#8217;s been a while since I looked at that dialog, but is it totally silly to ask why they needed to go through this process of raising each time zone from the sea? Once the highlighting was gone, couldn&#8217;t they just use a bitmap?</p>
<p>I suppose it was quicker and easier to just change the highlight colour?</p>

		<p>In XP SP2, the following regedit script fixes this, as far as I can see.</p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINESOFTWAREMicrosoftWindows NTCurrentVersionTime ZonesCentral European Standard Time]</p>
<p>&quot;MapID&quot;=&quot;2,65&quot; ; was &quot;2,3&quot;</p>
<p>Region 2 is the formerly visible vertical stripe for CEST. Region 3 is its land component.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s not obvious is why this change doesn&#8217;t make region 3 disappear at the same time.</p>
<p>Fortunately region 3 is also mentioned under &quot;W. Europe Standard Time&quot;.</p>

		<p>So, I decided to drop into my time zone panel and take a look. I found the results a little disturbing:</p>

<p>Where&#8217;s Scandinavia? It&#8217;s there, though unrecognizable, because it&#8217;s no longer a peninsula. If you want to provide any insights into how I&#8217;ve gained several non-existent land masses, that&#8217;d really be interesting.</p>

		<p>Poland has been on the same time zone and has been using the same DST rules as most EU countries since 1988. So, all these silly changes between various Windows releases were inventions of Microsoft, without any connection with reality.</p>
<p>And why has Bulgaria been put in the CET time zone? They use EET, which is 1 hour earlier.</p>

		<p>Nah, to me the &quot;I can&#8217;t believe I had to write that&quot; are the worst parts, as a fair portion of the time (as this one), the misunderstanding is on Raymond&#8217;s side.</p>
<p>My own favourites are the explanations: &quot;No DirectX in Safe Mode&quot;; &quot;You can&#8217;t change bitmaps in a hotfix&quot;; &quot;Having two versions of the same thing is the exception, not the rule&quot; &#8211; I *love* these! They&#8217;re what I read the blog for: descriptions of the design considerations and restrictions and gotchas that the widows programmers have to take into account. They seem like obvious truisms, and some are: but how many of us would catch all of them before starting to type in code?</p>

		<p>Speaking of my beautiful country, Windows made it travel a lot during last 10 years. I don&#8217;t remember what Windows 95 was thinking but according to NT Bulgaria was happily living in GMT+2. Windows 98 changed all this and the infamous &quot;Windows 98: (GMT+01:00) Sarajevo, Skopje, Sofija, Warsaw, Zagreb&quot; appeared. Windows 2000 added another twist &#8211; now the fourth day of the week is called &quot;четвъвтък&quot; instead of &quot;четвъртък&quot;. In English that would be roughly written as &quot;thurseay&quot; instead of &quot;thursday&quot;. Yes, the person who had written this word just pressed the key above the right one but this slipped through the spell-checker and survived 5 service packs! &nbsp;Happily for us, Windows XP returned all of us back to east form Serbia and west from The Black Sea. Or is it? Well Bulgaria has more traveling to do! There was an artifact left in the Windows Setup. If the user answers &quot;Bulgaria&quot; when asked &quot;Where are you&quot; then the setup suggests timezone GMT-8. The bizarre thing is that GMT-8 is not even the first entry in the drop-down list and the explanation &quot;the list is unitialized and shows its first entry&quot; is not correct. This was lastly fixed in Vista RC2 and I was really shocked to see it working properly after 11 years traveling between continents.</p>

<p>To expand: you only need a *DX9* video card (with PS 2.0) if you want Aero. If you don&#8217;t want Aero, then you don&#8217;t even need that.</p>

		<p>Romulo A. Ceccon says &quot;People generally don&#8217;t understand that, when entering DST, what actually goes on is a change on the time zone, and not on the clock itself.&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure I believe that. &nbsp;I think the clock is what changes. &nbsp;Do you have any references?</p>
<p>Wikipedia&#8217;s explanation says:</p>
<p>&quot;When DST begins, the day loses one hour (hour interchange of -1). At this date, a full hour is skipped and does not exist either before or after the transition, so this date includes only 23 hours.</p>
<p>When DST ends, the day gains one hour (hour interchange of +1). At this date, the same hour occurs twice, first in daylight (summer) time, and then in standard (winter) time, so this date includes 25 hours.&quot;</p>
<p>My digital cable schedule for late &nbsp;Saturday night/early Sunday morning listed shoes starting at midnight, 12:30 AM, 1:00 AM, 1:30 AM, 1:00 AM, 1:30 AM, 2:00 AM&#8230; &nbsp;Cool.</p>

		<p>David, I assume that Romulo was referring to the clock of an actual running computer, and that the computer&#8217;s clock doesn&#8217;t change value any differently at the time that DST starts or ends than it does for any other second of any day, but that the offset from GMT/UTC to local time changes.</p>

		<p>GregM: He didn&#8217;t make that clear. &nbsp;Yes, the offset from local time to UTC changes, since the local computer clock changes, but your TIME ZONE doesn&#8217;t actually change. &nbsp;I&#8217;m in the Mountain time zone in the US, whether it&#8217;s Mountain Standard Time or Mountain Daylight Time.</p>
<p>He might have been trying to say what you said, but he might have also mistakenly thought that your time zone will change. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>&quot;Mountain Standard Time&quot; and &quot;Mountain Daylight Time&quot; *ARE* different timezones &#8212; one is an hour ahead of the other. &nbsp;QED.</p>
<p>That you automatically transition from one to the other on certain dates is a political quirk. &nbsp;But you are changing timezones.</p>

		<p>&gt;So people can&#8217;t change their time zone from Safe Mode?</p>
<p>Who in their right mind would enter safe mode to do just that?</p>
<p>By the way, how many other more important things don&#8217;t work in safe mode?</p>

		<p>If I can get Poland back by changing the registry setting (and it works) does that mean I can sink another country by the same process.</p>
<p>If so, the possibilities for fun are endless.</p>

		<p>[Why change something that isn&#8217;t broken? -Raymond]</p>
<p>But it is broken, inasmuch as the correct fix of converting the<br />
display to a static bitmap was never implemented. I accept your<br />
explanation that changing bitmaps wasn&#8217;t appropriate at the point in<br />
the code cycle when the display issue was raised, but at the very least<br />
a reminder to fix it properly should have been logged somewhere.</p>

		<p>The West Australian Govt is once again toying with the idea of daylight savings (d&#8217;oh!). There may be an upcoming trial if legislation goes through Parliment.</p>
<p>My understanding is there will be a referendum following the trial (anywhere from 1-3 years).</p>
<p>Would Vista be able to handle potentially WA starting up daylight savings after a hiatus of 20+ years, and then possibly going back to no daylight savings?</p>

		<p>[But it wasn&#8217;t broken.]</p>
<p>I think we&#8217;ll have to agree to disagree on the definition of broken. I do still wonder whether the disappearance of Poland would have gone unnoticed without the colour hack.</p>

		<p>Among fixes I made to various machines recently as the visiting IT person, an easy one was a time zone. &nbsp;I had to explain to someone &quot;Of course your country doesn&#8217;t have a time zone because Microsoft said it doesn&#8217;t, but you can&#8217;t randomly choose a neighbouring country with the same GMT offset. &nbsp;You have to choose a neighbouring country that matches your country&#8217;s rules on whether daylight savings time exists.&quot;</p>
<p>Meanwhile Japan has the gall to be incompatible with Windows. &nbsp;For generations the country has called the time zone Japan Standard Time, but for generations the country should have known to call the time zone Tokyo Standard Time. &nbsp;Vista changed this. &nbsp;Some builds said that Japan was in Tokyo Daylight Time. &nbsp;Since Microsoft is more powerful than the US government and the US government is more powerful than the Japanese government, I thought Japan would have to knuckle under and adopt daylight savings time. &nbsp;But then oops, as far as I can tell, some later builds of Vista have failed to be compatible with earlier builds.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
