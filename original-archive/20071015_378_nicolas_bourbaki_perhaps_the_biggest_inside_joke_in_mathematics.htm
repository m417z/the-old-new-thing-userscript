<p> If you've studied advanced mathematics, you've certainly read or at least heard about the books and papers of the great French mathematician Nicolas Bourbaki, whose works in the 1930's set out a rigorous formulation of modern mathematics. <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6503411"> Except he never actually existed</a>. The name was created as a front for a group of renegade French mathematicians who were reacting to Poincar&eacute;'s intuitive approach. </p>
<p> In modern graph theory, I'm told that it is fashionable to publish one's results under false names. For example, the graph theorist <a href="http://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=%22gw+peck%22"> G. W. Peck</a> was actually a collaboration of the mathematicians <a href="http://www-cse.ucsd.edu/facresearch/facultyprofiles/GrahamR.html"> Ronald Graham</a>, <a href="http://www.math.uiuc.edu/~west/"> Douglas West</a>, <a href="http://www.cs.uc.edu/people/faculty/dr-george-purdy"> George Purdy</a>, the legendary <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s"> Paul Erd&#337;s</a>, <a href="http://math.ucsd.edu/~fan/">Fan Chung</a>, and <a href="http://www-math.mit.edu/~djk/"> Daniel Kleitman</a>. (Take the initials of the members' last names.) I learned from Dr.&nbsp;West that the group did not include him originally, and they were prepared to publish under the name "<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000060/">G.&nbsp;Peck</a>", listing the author's address as Hollywood, California. With the addition of a new member, the name changed to "G.&nbsp;W.&nbsp;Peck", which to the group's pleasant surprise happened to be <a href="http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=P000176"> the name of a United States Congressman from the 19th century</a>, which gave them the opportunity to include a photograph and a short biography that ended with something like "After retiring from Congress, Peck returned to his first love: graph theory." </p>

		<p>And of course there&#8217;s the Alpher-Bethe-Gamow paper in astrophysics. It&#8217;s a real paper, even though Mr. Bethe was conscripted into being an author and the results were first announced on April 1st.</p>

		<p>Having a photograph is a nice touch, I think; at my old university, for student elections every race included an option for &#8216;RON&#8217; (Re Open Nominations, basically &#8216;they all suck, keep the post open and try to find someone else&#8217;). Each candidate had a photograph beside their name; RON&#8217;s was Ronald McDonald.</p>
<p>I must admit, though, the idea of a Congressman &#8211; or any other politician &#8211; even being able to *spell* graph theory, let alone understand it, seems pretty far fetched&#8230;</p>

		<p>My favorite example of a mathematical pseudonym is &quot;A. Student&quot; who invented the &quot;Student T&quot; distribution. In reality, it was William Sealy Gosset of the Guinness Brewery:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sealy_Gosset" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/William_Sealy_Gosset</a></p>
<p>Apparently, Guinness took a dim view of employees discussing trade secrets, so Gosset had to publish his papers incognito.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
