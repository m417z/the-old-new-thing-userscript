<p>An internal customer had a question about a tool, let's call it <i>Program&nbsp;Q</i>.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> As part of our gated checkin system, the system creates a new record in a Program&nbsp;Q table to record details of the checkin. (What tests were run, who did the code review, that sort of thing.) We are considering incorporating the Program&nbsp;Q record number as part of our version number: major.<wbr>minor.<wbr>service&shy;pack.<wbr>hot&shy;fix.<wbr>record&shy;number. What is the maximum number of records per table supported by Program&nbsp;Q? </wbr></wbr></wbr></wbr></p>
</blockquote>
<p> Now, the easy way out is to just answer the question: The theoretical maximum number of records per table is 2&sup3;&sup2;&minus;1. Even if your gated checkin system's throughput is one checkin per second, that gives you over a century of record numbers. </p>
<p> But answering the question misses the big picture: The limiting factor is not the capacity of Program&nbsp;Q. The limiting factor is how long you plan to keep using Program&nbsp;Q! Before the century is up, you probably won't be using Program&nbsp;Q. What is your transition plan? </p>
<p> In this case, it's probably not that complicated. Suppose that at the time Program&nbsp;Q is retired and replaced with Program&nbsp;R, the highest record number is 314159. You could just say that the version number in the binary is the Program&nbsp;R record number plus 400000. </p>
<p> If you're clever, you can time the switch from Program&nbsp;Q to Program&nbsp;R to coincide with a change to the major.<wbr>minor.<wbr>service&shy;pack.<wbr>hot&shy;fix, at which point you can reset the record&shy;number to 1. </wbr></wbr></wbr></p>

<div class="post">[<em>Program Q isn&#39;t source control. It&#39;s a database.

		<p>Application lifecycle management should not stop at the deployment stage. It&#39;s a common mistake to not calculate the impact of a component going end-of-life.</p>

		<p>@Anon Yes, but the end of the 21st century is a lot farther away than the end of the 20th century was to the creation of the technologies you mention. Also: before the century is up, you probably won&#39;t be alive to use Program Q.</p>

		<p>so they&#39;re wanting to go from a standard versioning format of 4 numbers, to a non-standard format of 5 numbers?</p>
<p>I know this is similar to TFS (which by default appends an incrementing number to each build within a day)</p>
<p>But none the less, let&#39;s call the approach &quot;bad design&quot;&#8230; instead, blend hotfix and record into the standard &quot;build number&quot;, and call it a day.</p>

<p>People are still riding horses and some even use buggies. That&#39;s not a useful argument against building roads with an eye open to future developments in automobile technology. It would be ridiculous to say, &quot;we thought of painting lines with infrared reflective material for autonomous cars to use in the future, but some people in Pennsylvania still drive a horse and buggy, so decided against it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;The theoretical maximum number of records per table is 2Â³Â²âˆ’1. &#8230;that gives you over a century of record numbers.&quot; &quot;Before the century is up, you probably won&#39;t be using Program Q&quot;</p>

<p>I don&#39;t know about you but, major.minor.servicepack.hotfix.buildnumber it not such an exotic version string. It is normally not user visible but, build numbers make sense. But then again, build numbers are reset when going to the next version.</p>
<p>Speaking of odd version numbers, I work in a company that uses the version stings as follows:</p>
<p>major.minor.servicepack.hotfix_devcycle.iteration.build.buildatempt</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances devcycle=01 and buildatempt=01, but it this scheme incorporates the odd case that you attempt multiple times at developing a version and that build failure are a normal operation mode.</p>

		<p>Wait a minute, could it be that Anon didn&#39;t realize Raymond was discussing source control? Even if some people are still using Visual Basic, it&#39;s not like VB6 itself is being developed any further, meaning no more record numbers for it.</p>

		<p>I&#39;m confused. OurApp creates records in a table used by Program Q. Said records have a number. Now the plan is to have the version-string of OurApp have a recordnumber attached to it? Does OurApp only ever deal with a single record in Program Q for that specific release of the OurApp software? If not, how do we deal with multiple records? How about multiple deployments?</p>
<p>Somehow, I feel like I am completely misunderstanding. Is the Program Q version number something that applies to the db schema Program Q uses?</p>

		<p>The other bigger picture could also be totally different. Maybe the Major.Minor.ServicePack.HotFix is part of the file-version. Like in C# we do with: </p>
<p>[assembly: AssemblyVersion(&quot;1.0.0.0&quot;)]</p>
<p>Then you already have a problem much sooner, because the revision-part can&#39;t go above 65635. (Yes, found out the &#39;hard&#39; way).</p>

		<p>&quot;In this case, it&#39;s probably not that complicated. Suppose that at the time Program Q is retired and replaced with Program R, the highest record number is 314159. You could just say that the version number in the binary is the Program R record number plus 400000.&quot;</p>

		<p>I&#39;m pointing out that developers *EXPECT* their applications not to be in use for decades, or centuries, when in fact, we have entire enterprises planning (and dependent) on using the same software they&#39;ve been using since the 1970s until the end of time.</p>
<p>We rarely run into problems where people CAN&#39;T transition to a new application.</p>
<p>What we run into are problems where people *REFUSE* to transition to a new application, causing disasters like the billions (trillions?) spent refactoring 20/30/+-year old code to avoid Y2K issues. (that same 20/30-year-old code is quickly becoming 40/50-year-old code, that we rely upon for critical infrastructure, that very few people can maintain)</p>
<p>So the limiting factor for Program Q is, indeed, more likely to be reaching the maximum record number than it will be transitioning to a new application.</p>
<p>(I would also bet on Dennis there, or that they use this number in some other application which has a different limit that they&#39;re going to reach first.)</p>

		<p>even the Windows 10 Technical Preview still contains VB6 support (at least msvbvm60.dll is still in %windir%SysWOW64), so Microsoft will probably support this ageing codebase indefinitely. So why change? ;-) </p>

		<p>One of the most used programs ever and is still executed many millions of times per day was written in the 1960&#39;s &#8212; IEFBR14. &nbsp;Code can, and does stay in production for a VERY long time.</p>
<p>With that said, Raymond is correct in saying that one must plan for long term use of data. &nbsp;Regardless of whether a particular program/system will meet one&#39;s long term needs, very often there are regulatory issues surrounding the retention of records. </p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
