<p>When a program crashes or hangs, you are given the opportunity to send an error report to Microsoft. This information is collected by the Windows Error Reporting team for analysis. Occasionally, somebody will ask, "How many failures need to be recorded before the bug is fixed? A thousand? Ten thousand? Ten million?"</p>
<p> Each team at Microsoft takes very seriously the failures that come in via Windows Error Reporting. Since  <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc895596.aspx"> failures are not uniformly distributed</a>, and since engineering resources are not infinite, you have to dedicate your limited resources to where they will have the greatest effect. Each failure that is collected and reported is basically a vote for that failure. The more times a failure is reported, the higher up the chart it moves, and the more likely it will make the cut. In practice, <a href="http://www.crn.com/security/18821726"> 50% of the crashes are caused by 1% of the bugs</a>. Obviously you want to focus on that top 1%. </p>
<p> It's like asking how many votes are necessary to win <i>American Idol</i>. There is no magic number that guarantees victory; it's all relative. As my colleague <a href="http://blog.paulbetts.org/"> Paul Betts</a> describes it, "It's like a popularity contest, but of failure." </p>
<p> Depending on the component, it may take only a few hundred reports to make a failure reach the upper part of the failure charts, or it may take hundreds of thousands. And if the failure has been tracked to a third-party plug-in (which is not always obvious in the crash itself and may require analysis to ferret out), then the information is passed along to the plug-in vendor. </p>
<p> What about failures in third-party programs? Sure, send those in, too. The votes are still tallied, and if the company has <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/08/10/449865.aspx"> signed up to access Windows Error Reporting data</a>, they can see which failures in their programs are causing the most problems. Signing up for Windows Error Reporting is a requirement for the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/dd203105.aspx"> Windows&nbsp;7 software logo program</a>. I've also heard but cannot confirm that part of the deal is that if your failure rate reaches some threshold, your logo certification is at risk of revocation. </p>
<p> If the vendor signed up for Windows Error Reporting but is a slacker and isn't looking at their failures, there's a chance that Microsoft will look at them. Towards the end of the Windows&nbsp;7 project, the compatibility team looked at the failure data coming from beta releases of Windows&nbsp;7 to identify the highest-ranked failures in third party programs. The list was then filtered to companies which participated in Windows Error Reporting, and to failures which the vendor had not spent any time investigating. I was one of a group of people asked to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/06/02/10018606.aspx"> study those crashes and basically debug the vendor's program for them</a>. </p>
<p> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/22/10041191.aspx">My TechReady talk</a> basically consisted of going through a few of these investigations. I may <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/30/10044061.aspx"> clean some of them up for public consumption and post them here</a>, but it's a lot of work because I'd have to write a brand new program that exhibits the bug, force the bug to trigger (often involving race conditions), then debug the resulting crash dump. </p>
<p> I know there is a subculture of people who <a href="http://www.lockergnome.com/blade/2009/04/16/do-you-want-to-send-a-report-to-microsoft-no-i-dont/"> turn off error reporting</a>, probably out of some sense of paranoia, but these people are ultimately just throwing their vote away. Since they aren't reporting the failures, their feedback doesn't make it back to the failure databases, and their vote for <i>fix this bug</i> never gets reported. </p>
<p> By the way, the method for disabling Windows Error Reporting given in that linked article is probably not the best. You should use the settings in the Windows Error Reporting node in the Group Policy Editor. </p>
<p> <b>I should've seen this coming</b>: Over time, I've discovered that there are a some hot-button topics that derail any article that mentions them. Examples include UAC, DRM, and digital certificate authorities. As a result, I do my best to avoid any mention of them. I didn't mention digital certificate authorities today, but I did link to an article which mentioned them, and now the subject has overrun the comments like kudzu. I don't need to deal with this nonsense, so I'm just going to kill my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/30/10044061.aspx"> promised future article</a> that was related to Windows Error Reporting, (I was also planning on converting my talk on debugging application compatibility issues into future articles, but since that's also related to Windows Error Reporting, I'm going to abandon that too.) </p>

		<p>Windows really needs to include an extensive tool to analyze all installed software (including 3rd party) and advise the user what can be updated, what software is known to contain serious bugs (especially security), etc, based on the most recent online database gathered by MS. This will also have an effect of killing those bogus &quot;stability and registry analysis tool&quot; trojan wares.</p>
<p>Also, I was quite surprized to find that usermode Windows components don&#39;t have an embedded signature. I think MS should do the same as with drivers &#8211; include the sig with the binaries.</p>

		<p>OT: All windows components are signed (not the same as saying all Microsoft components are signed!), just not embedded signed. &nbsp;They are catalog signed. &nbsp;Unfortunately the shell&#39;s file properties dialog does not display catalog signatures for a file (probably because looking them up is at least 10X as expensive as an embedded signature check, and there can be more than one catalog signature signifying different things). &nbsp;This comes up a lot unfortunately in that people don&#39;t have a easy visual way to verify a file is indeed part of windows or not, or worse they think Microsoft in 2010 isn&#39;t signing files. ;) &nbsp;Even some of the driver files shipped with Windows 7 are not embedded signed, catalog signing is allowed for drivers, just not a &#39;best practice&#39; due to the signature check overhead.</p>

		<p>@Joe Dietz:</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure kernel loader will go to CAT file to check the driver signature. This is why kernel drivers must have the sig embedded. From what I saw, Win6/7 x64 will refuse to load a kernel driver if the binary was not signed, even though the CAT file supposedly contains its sig.</p>

		<p>What about the checkbox in System Properties that allows you to disable Error Reporting? I&#39;ve always used that one (mainly because the popups are annoying). Should I rather use the GPE?</p>

		<p>Alexandre Grigoriev: If I remember correctly, it depends on when the driver must be loaded. Drivers that may be required to boot the system are loaded by the boot loader, not the kernel. To keep the boot loader simple, it requires embedded signatures. The full driver loader in the kernel only requires a signature in the catalogue file.</p>

<p>They can have embedded signatures. Windows will also notice if you replace one of its components by them using sfc.</p>
<p>However, having an embedded signature is of course not a requirement, and is also not practicable as requirement.</p>

		<p>@Leo Davidson:</p>
<p>I assume that the reporting metrics distinguish between &quot;error 1000 times on one computer&quot;, &quot;error one time on 1000 computers&quot;, and &quot;error 1000 times on each of 1000 computers&quot;. So just reproducing it on your machine often may not be enough.</p>
<p>But somehow, writing that gave me a funny mental image of somebody writing a piece of malware to infect a bunch of computers, purely to have a lot more computers crashing on the bug and submitting the error report. That must be why malware causes computers to crash; it&#39;s that the author of the malware wants their favorite bug fixed. :)</p>

		<p>OT: The boot loader will load a catalog signed driver and you can load catalog signed drivers any other time as well &#8211; it just takes longer. &nbsp;Check out tdi.sys in your win7 system32drivers directory &#8211; no embedded signature. &nbsp;Chances are really good that you are running this driver right now though.</p>

		<p>I love the concept of a centralized error reporting system, it&#39;s just such a pity that the certificates are so expensive that there&#39;s no way that I as a student, for instance, would be able to justify the price of it to gain the benefits.</p>
<p>Hopefully companies do utilize it, however. Are there many smaller companies that use it, or is it mostly the larger ones?</p>

		<p>@Sebastian:</p>
<p>they aren&#39;t <em>amazingly</em> expensive, but yes they&#39;re out of reach of students releasing free software.</p>
<p>That being said, there are quite a few free software projects that have proper signed certificates so are, at least is theory, able to pick them up. &nbsp;Though the one that immediately sprung to mind doesn&#39;t use WER, but instead changes the default error handling to just save the crash information, and then it pops up it&#39;s own &quot;do you want to send this?&quot; dialog on next program startup. &nbsp;Part of the thinking was the non-standard dialog might convince more people to say &quot;yes&quot; to sending the info</p>

		<p>@frymaster:</p>
<p>We used to use Windows Error Reporting, but switched to a custom error reporting system</p>
<p>a) because we wanted to gather more information from our users (e.g. account id, contents of the most recent log file) at crash-report time than WER can obtain</p>
<p>b) because we wanted real-time crash reporting instead of waiting <em>at least</em> a week for WER to batch process our reports</p>
<p>c) because the WER site is only one or two rungs above &#39;barely usable&#39;. &nbsp;The password policy is ridiculously overprotective. &nbsp;There are no ActiveX controls, why does it restrict me to using IE?</p>

		<p>Why aren&#39;t bugs reported by users through the forums fixed with priority? Next to Connect which closes after RC, Microsoft Technet and Answers forums are the best place for Microsoft to &quot;discover&quot; bugs and fix insane design decisions such as the mandatory auto sorting (this is the single most complained feature in the forums). Bing for it. Insane design decisions will now take 3, 6 or 9 years to fix (Windows release cycle) or may never get fixed in this flawed system. &quot;Fixing&quot; them is simply giving developing a hotfix for it. All that the forums users get is a polite answer that this is a known issue or this is by design. It doesn&#39;t get fixed in service packs.</p>
<p>My second issue is that the application should restart immediately and errors should reported in the background. If it crashes endlessly looping, only then Windows should not restart it immediately.</p>

		<p>@Matt: About the second issue, what if you have a program (that is irreplaceable and unchangeable) that clears &quot;corrupt&quot; data, either by design or accident, on startup? &nbsp;An automatic restart would bork what could be useable data. &nbsp;Reporting in the background, however, I agree with at first blush. &nbsp;I wouldn&#39;t mind WER being automatically enabled with batching of error reports between sends if there&#39;s no internet connectivity.</p>

		<p>What Raymond writes about WER acutally makes me less likely to click that send-button!</p>
<p>I trust Microsoft very much nowadays, that they would protect WER data with the highest level of security. I even sent in Outlook crahes when mails were open that I wrote, risking transmitting pieces of it with the stack in the minidump.</p>
<p>But knowing that third party developers (any third party developers) will get my crash dumps and maybe see tiny bits of data from my applications is really scary.</p>
<p>And I&#39;d never trust a popular open source browser with their own bug system to have my crash dumps, there might be passwords etc. What open source crowd would be able to look at them?</p>
<p>I hope we can trust third party developers to protect privat information, too. Surely MS&#39; WER contract will enforce this, but are there technical systems to protect my data against third parties? I hope not just a ridiculous password-chaning scheme (like use a simple password because a hard one would only last 40 days before a useless scheme forces you to change it)</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Vendors can see crash dumps only for their own programs, so Joe Software Company can&#39;t go in and try to scrape financial data out of your Quicken crash dumps. There is no technical system to scrub sensitive data from the crash dump because there is no technical system for identifying which random bytes on the stack or on the heap are sensitive and which aren&#39;t. (Not sure what you&#39;re talking about with the password-changing scheme.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>I was referring to &quot;The password policy is ridiculously overprotective. &nbsp;&quot; from &quot;Tim!&quot;.</p>
<p>I know that each vendor can only see his own programm. But I don&#39;t trust every vendor. Back when XP started to offer me to send error reports I always assumed they would go to Microsoft only. Only through your blog I learned that normal vendors can see their own stack dumps.</p>
<p>I just hope that they threat them well! And I won&#39;t send them so certain vendors I don&#39;t trust.</p>

<p>I mean that, there&#39;s some part of network that doesn&#39;t allow internet access due to policy. Is there anyway that I can periodically use a flash drive or something to zip-copy a folder out, plug to a machine with internet access, and then send to Error Reporting folks?</p>

		<p>@Matt: Restarting an app upon a crash is a bad idea, since many applications have trivial issues when their process is ending that throw errors&#8230; but noone cares since the process is ending anyway. Sometimes a crash is indistinguishable from a normal exit.</p>

		<p>@John Muller: you are right. By &quot;Fully&quot; I mean using Procmon to see what registry keys and values Windows asks for and creating the non-existing keys, then re-running ProcMon again several times if necessary. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s full without this. Done as an excercise/project, this was limited to CEIP/WER only, and no undocumented values were created that could not be found on the Internet coming from credible source &lt;- judged subjectively by eyballing. :)</p>
<p>Breaks Event Log and creates general slowness of Windows, including booting. Don&#39;t remember which were the other issues, but there were many.</p>
<p>I would be glad if someone can prove me wrong and/or investigates in a more coherrent way.</p>

<p>Yes and no. While the default user is created as an administrative account, it has, without elevation, about the rights of a limited user. This get&#39;s really weird when, for example, you can&#39;t even see details to your own processes in Process Explorer &#8230; which even limited users can.</p>

		<p>@Marquess: &quot;If you don&#39;t trust those vendors, why do you use their programs which apparently handle sensitive date?&quot;</p>
<p>Answering for myself (not the poster you are responding to), it might be because the risks are different. It is far more likely for a partially unscrupulous company to start doing bad things through internal employees improperly handling data in private where they won&#39;t get caught. It is reasonable to think that this is much more likely to occur than the company embedding malware or data-corrupting code in their software where it is visible to the world and much more likely to be exposed.</p>
<p>@Alexandre Grigoriev &quot;Windows really needs to include an extensive tool to analyze all installed software (including 3rd party) and advise the user what can be updated, what software is known to contain serious bugs (especially security), etc, based on the most recent online database gathered by MS. This will also have an effect of killing those bogus &quot;stability and registry analysis tool&quot; trojan wares.&quot;</p>
<p>The Secunia Software Inspector already does almost exactly this (not quite everything you mentioned, though). Unfortunately, few know about it. I did convince one person I know to use it though, who was quite pleased with how much easier it made it to stay up-to-date with their software.</p>

		<p>I&#39;d like to thank Microsoft here for opening WER to ISV&#39;s. It&#39;s helped us on more than one occasion. Even got a mail once from Microsof asking us to look into one particular crash.</p>
<p>I&#39;ve got to disagree with the 50% of crashes = 1% of bugs claim. It&#39;s probably 1% of <em>reported</em> bugs, which excludes non-crash bugs. It wasn&#39;t unusual for us to have &gt;50% of crashes because of a single bug, yet we regularly shipped with more than 100 known bugs. (90% of which were cosmetic, of course)</p>

<p>For a while you could get VeriSign certificate for $99 if you signed up for the WinQual program (this may still be true &#8211; I haven&#39;t checked) &#8211; however, this is still $99 more than certificate from Certum (which is free for open-source projects).

		<p>Some of you are missing the point and giving your own piece of wisdom. Windows already automatically restarts some crashed apps like Explorer but it reports the crash first. I am simply saying it should restart first and then report.</p>

		<p>@Christian</p>
<p>I&#39;m speaking as an employee of a company that ships logo&#39;ed software. Frankly, no one gives the f&#8212; about your data. What we are interested, in a crash dump, is our code. Really, your data in most cases is completely irrelevant, so noone looks at it. That&#39;s because, to ship a program, it has been tested and found to be working with user data. Most crashes nowadays are from things like bad synchronization among threads, which are very very hard to catch while testing because they depends on things like number of processors, speed of the computer components, and system being overloaded.</p>
<p>Also:</p>
<p> * most of the time big parts of the program are swapped out. Even if your program happens to process sensitive data when it crashed, there&#39;s a good chance that the sensitive information is paged out, thus not in the crash dump, thus we cannot look at it</p>
<p> * there are so many other binary data around it, that it hard to find it &#8211; for example, go find 14 char password in 1000 MB data of the working set present in a crash dump.</p>
<p> * The basic workflow of debugging: You get the memory dump, execute &quot;!analyze -v&quot; in WinDbg, get the memory address of the exception, wait for the proper source code to be retrieved and start poking it till you find the bug. In the same time you have to write new code for the next version, fix the bugs in the current internal version and so on and so forth. You simply lack the *time* to peek into the user data.</p>
<p> * the information is anonymous &#8211; we have no idea that this information is *yours*, so that we have a clue to start looking for sensitive data.</p>
<p> * You may think &quot;but there could be a bad person who works for herself, even if the company is good-intended&quot;. Then my question for you is: &quot;Why do you think such bad person can be in 3rd party developers but not in Microsoft?&quot;</p>

		<p>@Raymond,</p>
<p>I take offense at your words and side with Tim. The WinQual site is an excruciating pain to be used. After the 1st time I used it, I told my boss that I want to be paid triple for the time I spent with it (a joke but I was furious at the site). Please, do not call me a &quot;slacker&quot;, instead go fix your broken product! And while in there, why don&#39;t you consider making it fun to use? Please!</p>
<p> 1. Drop that VerySign nonsense.</p>
<p> 2. Add some help how to be used</p>
<p> 3. There are browsers on Earth which are not called &quot;Internet Explorer&quot;. Support them.</p>
<p> 4. Answer the mails we send to you with *relevant* information</p>
<p> 5. Generally fix the UI to be understandable</p>
<p> 6. Use your creativity to make it better in other ways. Surprise us ;-)</p>
<p>Frankly, on almost every post you make I take offense at the way you look at us, the ISVs. I suggest you work for 6 months at a company that is a MS partner and see throw our eyes how hard is to work with MS.</p>

		<p>Oh my, the certificates again. Microsoft *does* have a notoriously difficult relation ship to code signing, doesn&#39;t it? But at least there are six companies to choose from when signing kernel drivers. No wait, it&#39;s only three, because one half was bought by the other. (How unexpected!)</p>
<p>And they are all based in the USA. Seriously, now. What were they thinking?</p>
<p>Speaking of which, do these people have their own blog?</p>

		<p>@raymond, re: I should&#39;ve seen this coming</p>
<p>It&#39;s very sad to see some potentially useful and informative postings killed due to the likelihood that they will draw a flood of garbage comments. It feels like collective punishment for the obnoxious actions of the few. Would you consider an experimental alternative? For example, continuing to post entries concerning these hotbutton topics, but with commenting locked (and clearly labeled as locked due to garbage comments so as to avoid comments on unrelated posts)?</p>

		<p>It&#39;s probably too late, but I&#39;m saddened to note that certain articles won&#39;t get published, due to a user that nobody can control. I would imagine a reasonable solution would be to still post the relevant articles, but disable comments. Either way, I&#39;m sure I speak for a lot of others when I say we try not to derail the topic, and if it was possible, we&#39;d prevent others from doing so.</p>

		<p>The Internet is not a living room. If you don&#39;t want comments to go off-topic, don&#39;t have comments. If you have comments, either moderate them or expect that they&#39;ll go off-topic. Trying to control every commenter through moderation will take up a prohibitive amount of time, and controlling comments through hinting has proven not to work. Besides, *nobody* is going to read the vast backlog here to find out what all the &quot;rules&quot; are.</p>
<p>I love this blog, Raymond, and you&#39;re right in principle, but I&#39;m afraid your expectations for a popular blog with loosely moderated comments and no voting capability are somewhat unreasonable.</p>
<p>Besides, most of the interesting conversations I&#39;ve had (online and in real life) have started with topics completely unrelated to the finishing topic.</p>

		<p>Matt, I would guess that most people know that you are kidding and also most people think that your humor is in bad taste. This kind of aggressive &quot;humor&quot; is pretty common in the internets and on this site in particular and gets really, really, really tiring really fast. Commenters not bahaving have cost this blog interesting articles in the past and most of the other people don&#39;t want that happening again.</p>
<p>on topic:</p>
<p>From now on I shall send more failure reports, although I don&#39;t remember the last time when I was prompted.</p>

		<p>Good god, I love your blog, I&#39;ve been checking it out almost daily for over 6 years now and I have read every single article you&#39;ve ever posted here. And I was really looking forward to your app debugging series, because around here I&#39;m the guy responsible for the really hard to debug cases and I find these issues highly interesting. But this is no class room, I cannot simply slap the people who misbehave here, I&#39;m powerless to stop it. So excuse me for asking, but who are you trying to punish?</p>

		<p>Raymond &#8211; is it possible for you to post those articles (assuming they had already been written) &#8211; but simply disable comments?</p>
<p>I&#39;m one of the semi-lurkers that find your writing excellent and very interesting &#8211; even when it completely goes over my head.</p>
<p>I understand that some folks are causing you some strife. But, I do hope there is some way you might consider continuing to post on these hot-button topics.</p>

<p>Like others, I see your point and where you&#39;re coming from, but for me at least, I&#39;d much rather you just disable comments on articles you consider &quot;hot-button&quot; topics than have them excluded entirely. &nbsp;Like Marcel, I too was looking forward to the topics you mentioned.</p>
<p>Your great blog posts combined with the interaction you give your commentors is what makes your blog easily the best one on MSDN. &nbsp;I hope you don&#39;t change that formula too much. &nbsp;I&#39;m probably responsible for some off-topic comments in the past, but my only real defense is that good blog posts incite discussion. &nbsp;It&#39;s a compliment to you, in an indirect (if annoying perhaps) sort of way.</p>

		<p>@lusers?</p>
<p>The poor dumb lusers are to blame that they 1) accept(ed) this POOR behaviour of the OS, 2) didn&#39;t complain about this, and 3) didn&#39;t change the privilege(s) of their accounts.</p>
<p>The should also take Microsoft (as well as their OEM and EVERY software producer/developer whose &nbsp;products dont work as &quot;restricted user&quot;) before court for selling an OS/product that fails to comply with well-known (security) standards and puts them and others at risk!</p>
<p>JFTR: WINNT.SIF/UNATTEND.TXT supports [Unattended] UnattendSwitch = Yes for more than 10 years now, so OEMs could have setup their preinstalled systems properly.</p>

		<p>What is unfortunate is that the CRT force some kind of errors to the built-in UnhandledExceptionFilter, forcing people to use WER.</p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>Like Marcel, I really saw your reaction as the reaction of a teacher before a noisy classroom. A collective punition. Except that even in reality where the unfairly punished could in theory coerce the trouble makers, it doesn&#39;t work that way, so to think that it could work in an online environment is delusional&#8230;</p>
<p>It felt that way because your threat wasn&#39;t to kill comments (which are the problem) but to kill entries (what we&#39;re here for!), if THAT isn&#39;t a punition, then what is? (As a side note, it also seem a little masochistic to kill entries that you already wrote, throwing hard labor to the garbage can&#8230;)</p>
<p>Look&#8230; I know that you read comments and I understand that some subjects get old really fast, but writing a blog shouldn&#39;t drain you that much. You obviously have to do something about it, but I&#39;m afraid that &quot;killing&quot; entries isn&#39;t the good solution (for you readers obviously, and even for you, for the added annoyance).</p>
<p>I also know that comments are often interesting, sometimes even those offtopic.</p>
<p>Since your readers aren&#39;t a single entity, some dead horses may seem in need for a beating for some of the unregular readers. With a product with a userbase so vast, a lot of people are frustrated by a lot of different things, so with comments enabled, dead horses will start to pile up and your &quot;safe&quot; topics will start to shrink.</p>
<p>It bothers me to see how all this affects you. If you cannot mentally skip the bad comments or detach yourself from what people are saying, I think you should disable comments, except maybe for &quot;non-computer&quot; posts. (Were you in better mood when the blog was migrating and comments were disabled?). We all know what we would lose, but it is really the lesser evil&#8230;</p>
<p>Please, don&#39;t kill your next entries!</p>
<p>And keep up the good work, you know we appreciate it!</p>

		<p>[I&#39;m not &quot;punishing&quot; anyone. I&#39;m just taking the path of least resistance, which is to avoid hot-button topics entirely. -Raymond]</p>
<p>It just does sound a lot like &quot;you kids have been misbehaving, I&#39;m going to lock away your toys&quot;. I know you&#39;re not doing this gig to become hugely popular, I see it more as a public service ;), but you simply do have a lot more readers than 6 years ago and I can only highly recommend growing a bit thicker skin. Or disabling comments when you think something is too controversial (I&#39;d miss the comments, but better that than miss any articles).</p>
<p>Like Nawak said, keep up the good work! Can&#39;t really speak for others here, but at least I do really appreciate it ;)</p>

They just like causing trouble. You know who you are.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>raymond was not offended, he&#39;s only lazy. This &quot;offended thing&quot; is only an excuse for not doing work.</p>
<p>Still on topic though, why does windows, as usual, &quot;phone home&quot; with users private information? Hasn&#39;t this already been forbidden by court? It should be disabled by default and enabled by those users which likes to get their identities stolen by M$/isvs.</p>

		<p>@640k: Nothing to base accusation on,no links,no proof,nothing&#8230;</p>
<p>Private info? You know you are not telling truth or at least without anything to back it up.</p>
<p>What does MS is not forbidden by court or law. (Hint: no private info and no stealing of them)</p>
<p>Maybe you are troll &#8211; one of those who kill interesting future posts?(And his reaction might seem lazy,but emember does somebody pay him to write? I am certain that no.)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
