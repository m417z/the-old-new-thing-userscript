<p>  So for example, if your SID is  <code>S-1-5-21-2127521184-1604012920-1887927527-72713</code>,  then your raw hex SID is  </p>
<p>  010500000000000515000000A065CF7E784B9B5FE77C8770091C0100  </p>
<p>  This breaks down as follows:  </p>
<table>

<td><u>S-1</u></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>05</td>
<td>(seven dashes, seven minus two = 5)</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>000000000005</td>

<tr>

<tr>

<p>  Yeah, that's great, Raymond, but what do all those numbers mean?  </p>
<table>
<tr>
<td>S-1-</td>

<tr>
<td>-...-...-...-</td>

<tr>
<td>72713</td>
<td>unique user id on the machine</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>  Each machine generates a unique ID that it uses to stamp all the SIDs  it creates (-...-...-...-).  The last number is a "relative id (RID)"  that represents a user created by that machine.  There are a bunch of  predefined RIDs; you can see them in the header file ntseapi.h,  which is also where I got these names from.  The system reserves RIDs up to 999, so the first non-builtin account  gets assigned ID number 1000.  The number 72713 means that this particular SID is the 71714th SID  created by the issuer.  (The machine that issued this SID is clearly  a domain controller,  responsible for creating the accounts of tens of thousands of users.)  </p>
<p>  (Actually, I lied above when I said that this is the 71714th SID  created by the issuer.  Large servers can delegate SID creation to  helpers, in which case SID issuance is no longer strictly consecutive.)  </p>
<p>  Security isn't my area of expertise, so it's entirely possibly  (perhaps even likely) that I got something wrong up above.  But it's mostly correct, I think.  </p>

		<p>As far as I know, there aren&#8217;t any issues with giving out the SID &#8211; except for one minor issue.</p>
<p>The -&#8230;-&#8230;-&#8230;- actually identify the domain that issued the SID, and that means that it&#8217;s possible to corrolate the domain on which a user account is created.  </p>
<p>That means that if you know one account on a domain that has a weak security policy, you can know if other accounts are also created on the same domain.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a small bit of information disclosure, but in the scheme of things&#8230;</p>
<p>If you think about it, the SID of all the users in an ACL are included in the security descriptor for objects, and the security descriptor contents are semi-public information (you need READ_CONTROL access rights to the object).</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m also not a security guy (although I&#8217;ve done a LOT of security work).<br /></p>

		<p>Same boat as Raymond &#8211; not a security guy, but I&#8217;ve done a good amount of security work.</p>
<p>I personally found the information on SIDs in the SDK and even Howard &amp; LeBlanc&#8217;s excellent &quot;Writing Secure Code&quot; book somewhat lacking in organization. When I had to put things together for the DDK, I organized the list of SIDs this way (from wdmsec.h):</p>
<p>Each SID is listed in the form EnglishName (&quot;SDDL Abbreviation&quot;, FullSID, Authority:SubAuthorities)</p>
<p>  The following SIDs represent *accounts* on the local machine:<br />
<br />  &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>    System (&quot;SY&quot;, S-1-5-18, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_LOCAL_SYSTEM_RID)<br />
<br />        The OS itself (including its user mode components.)</p>
<p>    Local Service (&quot;LS&quot;, S-1-5-19, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_LOCAL_SERVICE_RID)<br />
<br />        A predefined account for services that presents user credentials for local<br />
<br />        resources and annonymous credentials for network access.<br />
<br />        Available on XP and later.</p>
<p>    Network Service (&quot;NS&quot;, S-1-5-20, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_NETWORK_SERVICE_RID)<br />
<br />        A predefined account for services that presents user credentials for local<br />
<br />        resources and the machine ID for network access.<br />
<br />        Available on XP and later.</p>
<p>    (A local *account* for a guest and a default administrator also exist, but<br />
<br />     the corresponding SDDL abbreviations are not supported by this library.<br />
<br />     Use the corresponding group SIDs instead.)</p>
<p>  The following SIDs represent *groups* on the local machine:<br />
<br />  &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8211;</p>
<p>    Administrators (&quot;BA&quot;, S-1-5-32-544, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_BUILTIN_DOMAIN_RID:DOMAIN_ALIAS_RID_ADMINS)<br />
<br />        The builtin administrators group on the machine. This is not the same<br />
<br />        as the builtin Administrator *account*.</p>
<p>    Builtin users group (&quot;BU&quot;, S-1-5-32-545, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_BUILTIN_DOMAIN_RID:DOMAIN_ALIAS_RID_USERS)<br />
<br />        Group covering all local user accounts, and users on the domain. </p>
<p>    Builtin guests group (&quot;BG&quot;, S-1-5-32-546, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_BUILTIN_DOMAIN_RID:DOMAIN_ALIAS_RID_GUESTS)<br />
<br />        Group covering users logging in using the local or domain guest account.<br />
<br />        This is not the same as the builtin Guest *account*.</p>
<p>  The below SIDs describe the authenticity of the user&#8217;s identity:<br />
<br />  &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>    Authenticated Users (&quot;AU&quot;, S-1-5-11, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_AUTHENTICATED_USER_RID)<br />
<br />        Any user recognized by the local machine or by a domain. Note that<br />
<br />        users logged in using the Builtin Guest account are not authenticated.<br />
<br />        However, members of the Guests group with individual accounts on the<br />
<br />        machine or domain are authenticated.</p>
<p>    Anonymous Logged-on User (&quot;AN&quot;, S-1-5-7, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_ANONYMOUS_LOGON_RID)<br />
<br />        Any user logged on without an identity, for instance via an anonymous<br />
<br />        network session. Note that users logged in using the Builtin Guest<br />
<br />        account are neither authenticated nor anonymous. Available on XP and<br />
<br />        later.</p>
<p>    World (&quot;WD&quot;, S-1-1-0, SECURITY_WORLD_SID_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_WORLD_RID)<br />
<br />        Prior to Windows XP, this SID covers every session: authenticated,<br />
<br />        anonymous, and the Builtin Guest account.</p>
<p>        For Windows XP and later, this SID does not cover anonymous logon<br />
<br />        sessions &#8211; only authenticated and the Builtin Guest account.</p>
<p>        Note that untrusted or &quot;restricted&quot; code is also not covered by the<br />
<br />        World SID. See the Restricted Code SID description for more<br />
<br />        information.</p>
<p>  The below SIDs describe how the user logged into the machine:<br />
<br />  &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;-</p>
<p>    Interactive Users (&quot;IU&quot;, S-1-5-4, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_INTERACTIVE_RID)<br />
<br />        Users who initally logged onto the machine &quot;interactively&quot;, such as<br />
<br />        local logons and Remote Desktops logons.</p>
<p>    Network Logon User (&quot;NU&quot;, S-1-5-2, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_NETWORK_RID)<br />
<br />        Users accessing the machine remotely, without interactive desktop<br />
<br />        access (ie, file sharing or RPC calls).</p>
<p>    Terminal Server Users (&#8212;, S-1-5-14, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_TERMINAL_SERVER_RID)<br />
<br />        Interactive Users who *initially* logged onto the machine specifically<br />
<br />        via Terminal Services or Remote Desktop.<br />
<br />        (NOTE: There is currently no SDDL token for this SID. Furthermore, the<br />
<br />        presence of the SID doesn&#8217;t take into account fast user switching<br />
<br />        either.)</p>
<p>  The below SID deserves special mention:<br />
<br />  &#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p>
<p>    Restricted Code (&quot;RC&quot;, S-1-5-12, SECURITY_NT_AUTHORITY:SECURITY_RESTRICTED_CODE_RID)<br />
<br />        This SID is used to control access by untrusted code.</p>
<p>        ACL validation against tokens with RC go through *two* checks, one<br />
<br />        against the token&#8217;s normal list of SIDs (containing WD for instance),<br />
<br />        and one against a second list (typically containing RC and a subset of<br />
<br />        the original token SIDs). Only if both tests pass is access granted.<br />
<br />        As such, RC actually works in *combination* with other SIDs.</p>
<p>        When RC is paired with WD in an ACL, a *superset* of Everyone<br />
<br />        _including_ untrusted code is described. RC is thus rarely seen in<br />
<br />        ACL&#8217;s without the WD token.<br /></p>

		<p>If you&#8217;re looking at a memory dump then you can also use !sid debugger extension:</p>
<p>c:debuggers&gt; cdb notepad</p>
<p>0:000&gt; dc RPCRT4!AnonymousSid<br />
<br />78073fc8  00000101 05000000 00000007</p>
<p>0:000&gt; !sid RPCRT4!AnonymousSid 1<br />
<br />SID is: S-1-5-7 (Well Known Group: NT AUTHORITYANONYMOUS LOGON)</p>

		<p>My greatest highlight inside the security-API-documentation on MSDN is the article: &quot;Windows NT Security in Theory and Practice&quot;. This article has a nice line: &#8216;First, you should definitely read Robert Reichel&#8217;s two-part article &quot;Inside Windows NT Security,&quot; which appeared in the April 1993 and May 1993 issues of the Windows/DOS Developer&#8217;s Journal&#8217;.</p>
<p>Unfortunatly, that article is *not* part of MSDN:-(</p>

		<p>I found one article by Robert Reichel on windows security.  He&#8217;s a real estate agent, and he recommended that windows on and near the ground floor should be locked.</p>
<p>As for that other Robert Reichel, it seems his articles would likely be included in a CD that was made by the original publisher, but the CD is sold out.  CMP has more recent archives posted on their web site.  Anyone know if they could be persuaded to do the same with older ones?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
