<p><a href="http://www.accidentalscientist.com/"> Simon Cooke</a> dug back into his memory and asked, "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/05/25/9639553.aspx#9640932">Doesn't calling <code>Set&shy;Window&shy;Pos</code> with <code>SWP_<wbr>FRAME&shy;CHANGED</wbr></code> cause a recreate and re-apply of the styles?</a>"</p>
<p> The <code>SWP_<wbr>FRAME&shy;CHANGED</wbr></code> flag does not recreate anything, but it does reapply the styles, as far as it knows. </p>
<p> Recall that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2003/12/03/55927.aspx"> the bits in the window style break into two parts</a>. There are the styles managed by the window manager, which are in the upper 16 bits, and there are the styles that are specific to each control, which are in the lower 16 bits. </p>
<p> The window manager knows about the styles that it manages, but it has no clue about the styles that are specific to each control. It has no idea that the <code>MCIWNDF_<wbr>NO&shy;PLAY&shy;BAR</wbr></code> style controls the toolbar in an MCI window, or that the <code>ES_<wbr>RIGHT</wbr></code> style controls the alignment of text in an edit control. </p>
<p> The <code>SWP_<wbr>FRAME&shy;CHANGED</wbr></code> flag tells the window manager, "Hey, I changed some styles that affect the non-client area of the window (the window frame). Could you go and re-read those styles and apply them to the window? Thanks." That's sort of implied in the name: "Frame changed." </p>
<p> If you want a control to re-inspect the window styles and adjust its behavior in response, you need to do something control-specific. The control might have a custom message you can send it to say, "Hey, I changed some styles that afect the client area of the window. Could you go and re-read those styles and apply them to the window? Thanks." Or there may be special messages specifically for changing styles, such as <code>EM_<wbr>SET&shy;READ&shy;ONLY</wbr></code>. The fancier windows may do it automatically on receipt of the <code>WM_<wbr>STYLE&shy;CHANGED</wbr></code> messages. </p>

		<p>The complexity of the Windows GUI code makes me understand why Microsoft made the WinRT API, to throw it all away and make a better design. &nbsp;Too bad it was wasted on Metro. &nbsp;If WinRT could be used on desktop applications, it&#39;d be awesome. =/</p>

		<p>It really isn&#39;t that difficult. There&#39;s also .NET which simplifies it all. Plus you can use the Windows Runtime APIs from desktop applications.</p>

		<p>@Myria &#8212; but there isn&#39;t a supported scenario to write a desktop application that uses the Metro UI which is what Myria was really wishing for.</p>
<p>I really really want a supported method to use XAML directly from native C++ that can be used Win7 and above.</p>

		<p>@Myria: I&#39;m not sure where you&#39;re seeing the complexity in this. &nbsp;SWP_FRAMECHANGED is for use when the frame&#8230; has &#8230;changed. &nbsp;Even the name is totally self-descriptive (compared to, say, something like SEEK_SET).</p>

		<p>@mh: the question is why `Set&shy;Window&shy;Pos()` should be called at all to have a window redraw itself using changed styles? And all this trickery of styles in 16 higher bits and 16 lower bits &#8211; is this really as easy to understand and remember?</p>
<div class="post">[<em>(1) Because the `WM_STYLECHANGED` message hadn&#39;t been invented yet. (2) Would you be happier if there were two different style values? Say, a 16-bit system-style field and a 16-bit application-style field. Hey, that&#39;s what it is! -Raymond</em>]</div>

		<p>@Raymond: my comment was by no means a complaint. I understand and accept a wide variety of constraints, including the unfortunate delay of time machine introduction. I only believe that the result is not what we would agree t call &quot;clean and simple API&quot;.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
