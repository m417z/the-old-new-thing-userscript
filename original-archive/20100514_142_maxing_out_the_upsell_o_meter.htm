<p>Many grocery stores in the United States have a printer next to the cash register which prints out coupons customized to your purchases. If you buy the house brand of spaghetti, it might print out a coupon for a slightly more expensive brand of spaghetti. The goal with these coupons is to get you to try a fancier (and therefore more profitable) version of the product in the hopes that you will like it and switch.</p>
<p> For reasons not important to the story, one of my colleagues needed to buy baby formula for his newborn son. He and his wife carefully researched the options and decided that the best brand to get was XYZ brand. They went to the grocery store to buy some, and as expected, they got a cash register coupon. </p>
<p> But upon closer inspection, it wasn't a coupon after all. </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Thank you for buying XYZ brand baby formula. </p>

		<p>What I&#8217;ve encountered in the past is getting coupons for more of what I&#8217;ve bought. For example, if I bought a bottle of X-brand juice, I might get a coupon for 50 cents off 2 bottles of X-brand juice. If I then use the coupon to buy 2 bottles, I get a coupon for a dollar off 3 bottles of X-brand juice.</p>
<p>So if I&#8217;ve already bought a jug of the most expensive XYZ brand baby feed, they could just give me a coupon for 2 jugs of XYZ brand baby feed.</p>

		<p>@Gabe:</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen those for Hot Pockets before, back when I still bought those.</p>
<p>The amusing thing is that it was always for exactly one more than I currently bought.</p>

		<p>+1 to CodeOrDie; great comment.</p>
<p>Since I open comments in multiple tabs, I see that the Captcha doesn&#8217;t work right when you do that. &nbsp;Yes, I know it&#8217;s not controlled by Raymond&#8230; &nbsp;:-)</p>

		<p>David, I wouldn&#8217;t worry too much about it right now, they&#8217;re replacing the entire blog system starting Sunday. &nbsp;I think they mentioned the captcha as one of the things that is being improved.</p>

		<p>Side question: I don&#8217;t have or plan on having kids&#8230;ever&#8230;but aren&#8217;t all baby formulas in the US, assuming that&#8217;s where said friend lives, the same by law?</p>

		<p>Robert Morris: I can assure you that not all baby formulas are the same, at least in the US. Here&#8217;s some information about different formulas (formulae?): <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/infant-formula/pr00058" rel="nofollow">http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/infant-formula/pr00058</a></p>

		<p>In some countries there are laws about advertising baby food.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not like normal food. In the UK you can&#8217;t mention that it&#8217;s better than breast milk, for example.</p>
<p>Not saying that strange laws are the reason in THIS case, but it may be a factor.</p>

		<p>&quot;If you buy the house brand of spaghetti, it might print out a coupon for a slightly more expensive brand of spaghetti. The goal with these coupons is to get you to try a fancier (and therefore more profitable) version of the product in the hopes that you will like it and switch.&quot;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s interesting because I would have expected the reverse. &nbsp;Most big stores have their own brands (GreatValue for Walmart, Kroger for all their child stores, etc). &nbsp;While upselling the more expensive brands makes sense I would have thought they like you buying the store brand.</p>
<p>Unless the store brand is only there to get people in the store with super lower prices and they don&#8217;t generate much profit. &nbsp;Then this would make sense.</p>

		<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>I would guess that the store makes a higher margin on the name brands. &nbsp;But carrying two similar products at different price points is good marketing strategy &#8211; see &quot;market segmentation.&quot;</p>
<p>There is also the problem of competing name brands&#8230; I&#8217;ve noticed when I buy name brand A I often get a coupon for name brand B (regardless of which is more expensive.) &nbsp;I&#8217;m guessing the store sells coupon opportunities to both brands, and in this scenario brand XYZ decided to outbid their competitor for the coupon opportunity &quot;customer buys XYZ.&quot;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
