		<p>Demolishing the kingdome was too good for it.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s true, but, had it been demolished, the province would have &#8216;saved&#8217; tons of money by not having to repair the roof over and over again&#8230;</p>

		<p>Actually, the Montreal Olympic site was only partially un-demolished, if I can use that term.<br />
<br />In 1990 chainsaws were applied to the teak track of the Olympic Velodrome, and the building converted to a zoological garden.</p>
<p>The Montreal Velodrome was arguable the best cycling track in the world, and its destruction was considered by the cycling community in Eastern Canada as &quot;The Crime of the Century&quot;. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In the 1980s, many of us in Ottawa, Ontario, travelled the 125 miles to Montreal on a weekly basis in order to &quot;ride the track&quot; during the winter months.</p>
<p>The cycling track from the 1996 Atlanta Olympics was acquired, and moved to Bromont, Quebec, between Montreal and Quebec City. &nbsp;Although a fine track, it is outdoors, and as such unavailable for cycling during the winter.</p>

		<p>The reason the Kingdome didn&#8217;t last as long as the Big O was because the Big O never got replaced.</p>
<p>Thanks Jeffery Loria!!</p>

		<p>We&#8217;ll have to wait until September, though. There&#8217;s 15 millions remaining to pay, probably because cigarette(*) sales went down lately.</p>
<p>(*) There is a tax on cigarettes sold in the province of Qu&#233;bec, to help pay the Olympic Stadium!</p>

		<p>When writing in English, it is generally acceptable to drop the accent aigu on Montreal (Montr&#233;al). &nbsp;Same thing for Quebec (Qu&#233;bec). &nbsp;Something like the difference between Vienna and Wein, I figure.</p>
<p>Has anyone else ever noticed that in Americans tend to pronounce Montreal MON-tre-ALL (the way it&#8217;s spelled), while Anglophone Canadians say MUN-tre-ALL? &nbsp;I find that curious whenever the city is mentioned in American movies.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Montr&#233;al today made the final payment</p>
<p>It looks to me like the article states correctly that the province paid it off. &nbsp;The city won the bid with its mayor&#8217;s famous promise, but the province decided that its most distant rural residents would get to help pay for it. &nbsp;Maybe it&#8217;s just pure luck that the rest of the country didn&#8217;t have to pay for it.</p>
<p>Though now I live in a country where the national government spent 10 years spending the entire national economy into near oblivion, outdoing even what Trudeau could have done if he&#8217;d thought of it.

		<p>In French, you do not pronounce the &quot;T&quot; at all&#8230; Mon-re-all.</p>

<p>Depends on how you do your accounting. &nbsp;The rest of Canada pays a hefty premium for the privilege of having Quebec as a part of the country.</p>

		<p>KB: Regarding the pronunciation, yes, I did notice this. &nbsp;When I lived in Canada, I made a conscious effort to say it the &quot;Canadian&quot; way so as not to appear too obviously American.</p>

		<p>Maybe something is getting lost in the transliteration. As a native Montrealer, I find Americans tend to say MAHN-tree-ALL, and to my ears, we are saying MON-tree-ALL (O as in cot).</p>
<p>Although the stadium is still there, it is mostly unused since the Expos moved. The Canadian football franchise, the Alouettes, will play playoff games there for the extra seating, and the occasional motocross or monster truck rally will be held in the stadium. Thanks to the incident when snow fell through the roof during the setup for the<br />
<br />annual Montreal car show, it doesn&#8217;t get much (if any) use as a convention site anymore.</p>
<p>The Quebec government was making plans for replacing the existing roof, so I guess they may go back into debt on the stadium again&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
