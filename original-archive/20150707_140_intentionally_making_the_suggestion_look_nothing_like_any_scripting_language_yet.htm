<p>
In an internal peer-to-peer discussion list for an internal
tool I'll call <i>Program&nbsp;Q</i>,
somebody asked,
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
How can I query the number of free frobs in every table in my
table repository?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I suggested that they could use the command
</p>
<pre>
q query-property "*::frobs-free"
</pre>
<p>
taking advantage of the fact that in Program&nbsp;Q,
you can specify a wildcard for the table name to query
across all tables.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
Thanks, this looks promising, but my repository has
a huge number of tables, so the <code>q query-property</code> command
refuses to expand the <code>*</code> wildcard that much.
I can get around this by issuing 26 queries, one for each letter
of the alphabet:
</p>
<pre>
q query-property "a*::frobs-free"
q query-property "b*::frobs-free"
q query-property "c*::frobs-free"
...
q query-property "z*::frobs-free"
</pre>
<p>
Is there a better way to do this?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I replied with some pseudocode.
</p>
<pre>
(
  from table in `q list-tables`
  select table + "::frobs-free"
) | q query-property @-
</pre>
<p>
(The <code>@</code> means that it should take the list of properties
from a file, and we give <code>-</code> as the file name,
meaning standard input.
Not that it's important because <i>I completely made this up</i>.)
</p>
<p>
A colleague of mine noted that I provided just enough syntax
to explain the algorithm clearly,
but in a form that cannot be executed in any scripting language,
so the user understands that it is just an algorithm that needs
to be massaged into something that will actually run.
</p>
<p>
It's a neat trick when it works.
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/04/16/9551818.aspx">
But when it fails, it fails spectacularly</a>.
Fortunately, in this case, it worked.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
For all I know, that's valid PowerShell.</p>

		<p>This guy at work wanted to know how I did some text file conversion so I sent him the Unix pipeline still in my history buffer. He typed it into cmd.exe. *shrug* I guess to him this was the same as when this fails to you.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t know about &quot;nothing like any scripting language&quot;; the round brackets look like grouping commands in CMD, the backticks are correct in bash and the pipe character works in both.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure how I&#39;d express the same sentiment in CMD, but in bash, I&#39;d expect this to work:</p>
<p>for table in (`q list-tables`); do echo ${table}::frobs-free; done | q query-property @-</p>
<p>Although I&#39;d probably actually code this as</p>
<p>q list-tables | sed -e &quot;s/$/::frobs-free/&quot; | q query-property @-</p>
<p>(And for the benefit of Joshua&#39;s colleague, that Unix pipeline should still work when the same is typed into cmd.exe. (Assuming sed is installed on both platforms.))</p>

		<p>Regarding the linked &quot;fails spectacularly&quot; article, I think Jamie Zawinski&#39;s quip about regular expressions needs to be applied to batch files:</p>
<p>Some people, when confronted with a problem, think, ‚ÄúI know, I&#39;ll use a batch file.‚Äù &nbsp; Now they have a whole slew of problems. </p>

		<p>I love the linked article.</p>
<p>I have it bookmarked in memory. </p>
<p>All the people defending &#39;X&#39; in the original article are some of the primary reasons that everything is always broken all the time, and they&#39;re the same people who perpetuate the &quot;computers are hard&quot; myth.</p>

		<p>Ultimately, for most people, a computer is a tool that they&#39;re doing another job with; time spent learning the intricacies of the computer takes away from time that can be spent doing that job. It&#39;s true even for tools used by programmers. Sometimes, even an auto mechanic just wants to get in the car and drive without having to spend half an hour tuning up the engine first.</p>

		<p>@Max: &nbsp;It&#39;s all about return on investment, isn&#39;t it? &nbsp;Last month someone told me they finished a grueling 4-day task of going through an 800-page document and extracting all sentences with certain keywords. &nbsp;A little investment of 30 minutes here and 30 minutes there over the course of a career and this would have been a trivial task&#8230;</p>
<p>In fairness, the barrier of entry to document automation is ridiculously high for anything other than text files.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
