<p>Continuing the highly-sporadic series of Win32 resource formats, today we'll look at the format of <code>RT_DATA</code> resources, which are declared in resource files as <code>RCDATA</code>. Also the format of custom resources, which are declared in resource files by just giving the custom resource name or ordinal as the second word on the declaration.</p>
<p> The format is very simple: It's just raw binary data. If you ask for a 16-bit integer followed by an ANSI string, then you get a 16-bit integer followed by an ANSI string. </p>
<p> If you ask for the data to be inserted from a file, then the contents of the file become the resource data. No processing is done on the data. You get what you get. </p>
<p> In particular (and this is what catches some people), if your file is a text file, the resource compiler will just treat your text file as binary data and dump it raw into the resources. It doesn't know that it's a text file; it's just a file. This means that if you want a null terminator at the end of your text file, you need to put a null terminator at the end of the text file. Nobody's going to magically do it for you. </p>
<p> (The <code>Size&shy;Of&shy;Resource</code> function may come in handy here.) </p>

		<p>Joshua: It will. Resources are mapped as part of the executable. Actually, LoadResource/LockResource just returns a pointer to it.</p>

		<p>Just to mention SizeofResource is not so handy as it rounds up to alignment size, so the actual size of raw</p>
<p>binary data can not be found with this call.</p>
<p>One must implement his own way like EOF marker or store real size at other place.</p>

		<p>[That KB article applies to 16-bit Windows and to Windows 95-derived versions of Windows. It does not apply to Windows NT.]</p>
<p>That&#39;s rough. &nbsp;I know KB57808 lists Applies To as &quot;Microsoft Platform Software Development Kit-January 2000 Edition&quot;, but there are tons of KB articles where the Applies To lists an older version of the OS and it does apply to the current release. &nbsp;It is reasonable to make the assumption that it still applies given lack of documentation to the contrary.</p>

		<p>&gt;Is there any documentation that describes the resource definition file format (.rc)?</p>
<p>Yes, it&#39;s a documented language; MS calls it a &#39;script&#39; though I&#39;d say it doesn&#39;t qualify for that term since it is really a data declaration language.</p>
<p>Type &quot;resource definition file format&quot; into Google (no quotes).</p>

		<p>@Mark K it can be pretty easily verified that SizeofResource works as Raymond describes:</p>
<p>SizeofResource.rc</p>
<p>1 rcdata</p>
<p>{</p>
<p> &quot;test </p>
<p>}</p>
<p>SizeofResource.c</p>
<p>#include &lt;windows.h&gt;</p>
<p>#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;</p>
<p>int main(void)</p>
<p>{</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;HRSRC h = FindResource(NULL, MAKEINTRESOURCE(1), MAKEINTRESOURCE(10));</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;HGLOBAL hg = LoadResource(NULL, h);</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;DWORD d = SizeofResource(0, h);</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;printf(&quot;There are %d bytes.n&quot;, d);</p>
<p> &nbsp; &nbsp;return 0;</p>
<p>}</p>
<p>rc SizeofResource.rc</p>
<p>cl SizeofResource.c SizeofResource.res kernel32.lib</p>
<p>Run the program. &nbsp;Does it return 5 bytes or a larger number?</p>

		<p>@user0 it&#39;s broken if you attempt to access it over https (as it loads active content over http, and firefox now blocks that by default). &nbsp;You can either click on the shield each time and enable it, or just use http.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
