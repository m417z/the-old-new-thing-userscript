		<p>Actually, what some people do not seem to understand is that &#8211; from the perspective of an advocate for free software &#8211; meanwhile M$ is the lesser evil, compared to some other companies. But of course, this has nothing to do with Blog-Posts being readable to employees first. Actually, it is a sign of transparency that M$ gives its employees a platform to share their expierience.</p>
<p>The thing I mainly miss on this Blog is a possibility to link one&#39;s own Website in comments, as it is given in most other blogs. Probably many commentors here have websites that could be interesting to others. But that is the decision of the Blog-Hoster or Author, and major (german) newspapers do not allow such links in their comments, too.</p>

		<p>Bye the same logic, we can also say Microsoft employee can read chapters from Microsoft Press writers&#39; books before they&#39;re even published, so Microsoft must be evil. [/s]</p>
<p>Btw, I can read some chapters from Microsoft too (I think I&#39;ve read some chapters from BornToLearn or other MS blogs for community to review about a week ago), so I must be also evil.</p>

		<p>My feeling was always that if somebody has to tell you something, it&#39;s not true. For example, if a product tells you it&#39;s &quot;cheese food&quot;, it&#39;s not really food. Similarly, when somebody has to tell you something is a joke, it&#39;s not really a joke. In this manner, if Raymond actually has to explain how he is evil, he must not really be evil.</p>
<p>Sorry, Raymond.</p>

		<p>@AntiTrust: You do realize Raymond&#39;s backlog is at least a year and a half and indications have it closer to three plus years &#8211; all productivity will stop for weeks if Raymond revealed it all.</p>
<p>Of course the sad part is running into MSFT people who don&#39;t know about the blog. Even sadder is the lack of a team at MS to help with the history of Windows project. A surprising amount of learning happens here, and history of why things are what they are is a very important part of understanding the API.</p>
<p>Someone should go through Raymond&#39;s posts and add it to MSDN as documentation. The docs explain what, but Raymond explains why, which can foster greater understansing.</p>

		<p>OK, Raymond *is* evil. &quot;Admitting&quot; to you that he is evil is merely a cover up. Let me explain, but you better read this before this message self-destructs.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Raymond is actual working for Google in the future, and was sent back in time via the wayback machine (archive.org) to rewrite the past *as if* he was at Microsoft during these critical times before the 2012 Mayan calendar resets and causes Y2K 2.0.</p>
<p>During those troublesome times, Microsoft will help &quot;fix&quot; the UN&#39;s computers by installing Vista with Microsoft Bob. At first no one notices. But, when the UN actually starts getting things done, people will realize something is wrong. That&#39;s when Phase two kicks in. No one knows exactly what happened but it has something to do with Security Essentials and .Net. Google will go down, panic ensues, and Microsoft will inherit the Earth.</p>
<p>That&#39;s where Raymond comes in. By going back in time, and *holding back* blog posts, he is actually creating a buffer under-run in the Mayan Calendar itself, giving us relief until 2038, when the Mayans are expected to release a service pack for their calendar.</p>
<p>So far so good, eh?</p>
<p>The problem is Raymond is *telling us* about the queue. The Star Trek reference alone is bad enough, and will certainly be useful in taking over the tri-state area.</p>
<p>And you thought the &quot;old new&quot; thing was a joke, right?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
