<p> I don't have a wireless networking card on the machine I use at home to connect to the work network, so I haven't tried it, but who knows, maybe it'll work for you. </p>

		<p>Sounds very vague. Perhaps you could get your source to elaborate?</p>
<p>My VPN software (OpenVPN) doesn&#8217;t touch any wifi hardware when connecting, other than actually using the card to connect.</p>
<p>A disconnected wifi card surely has no greater attack surface than a disconnected wired NIC?</p>

		<p>Indeed, it sounds strange to me too. The VPN software might indeed have to jump through a dozen hoops to secure the wireless connection. But I really doubt it is continuously spending CPU time to ignore the wireless connection.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d love to know what it&#8217;s &quot;securing&quot; too. Perhaps run procmon while connecting, and post a little comment here?</p>

		<p>What if I access the VPN with my wireless connection?</p>

		<p>Tom: don&#8217;t trust OpenVPN over wireless connections, a thousand times so if you are using redirect-gateway. If the wireless connection goes down and then back up, its &quot;real&quot; routes pushed by the DHCP server will override the OpenVPN routes. I discovered this the hard way</p>

		<p>Hyperion: You can try the OpenVPN option that uses route.exe to set routes instead of using the normal API calls. &nbsp;I think those are persistent&#8230;</p>

		<p>Yes, but OpenVPN is no &quot;solution&quot;, it&#8217;s just an excellent excellent tool/product.</p>
<p>Microsoft definitively uses such bogus software that checks whether your handbrake is on &#228;h I mean, whether your virus scammer &#228;h scanner is running and whether windows update is on, etc&#8230;</p>
<p>From a security perpective this is *always* rubbish because you easily can and should fool that software and waive it with an &quot;all is okay&quot; packet.</p>
<p>Sadly there is MUCH too less informationen about sending fake status reports to such &quot;solutions&quot;.</p>
<p>Of course it&#8217;s also a matter of policy or termination</p>
<p>(unless you don&#8217;t disassemble your laptop or have the admin passwort and there is no virtualization or trusted computing involved)</p>

		<p>Christian: I think I agree.</p>
<p>Yesterday I struggled with Vista&#8217;s built in zip-support. It refused to unzip .js files, so I removed the script host association for those files. Then it refused to unzip files that had no extension&#8230; I was lost for words. I usually unzip using the command line, but this time I needed to avoid one directory in particular and the visual approach seemed easier.</p>
<p>Then I needed to send a .js file to a MSN contact and was told I had no virus scanner installed. WTF? I told it to use C:nonsense.exe as its scanner, and the upload went well. However, that screwed up my downloads of course, since c:nonsense.exe does not actually exist.</p>
<p>Pre-emptive Raymond snarky comment: Yes, I realise you are not to blame, wrong team and all&#8230; I still would like to point out that most security software is overkill and just an annoyance to advanced users.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
