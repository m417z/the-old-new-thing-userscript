<p>During the development of Windows&nbsp;95, it was common for team members to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2013/02/05/10391042.aspx"> pay visits to other teams</a> to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/11/20/10370008.aspx"> touch base</a> and let them know what's been happening on the Windows&nbsp;95 side of the project.</p>
<p> It was during one of these informal visits that the one of my colleagues reported that he saw that one of the members of the partner team had a Gary Larson cartoon from <a href="http://www.thefarside.com/"><i>The Far Side</i></a> depicting a group of scientists studying a multi-stage rocket ship they just assembled, but the stages are connected all crooked. One of the scientists says, "It's time we face reality, my friends. &hellip; <a href="http://twitpic.com/3p6hh0"> We're not exactly rocket scientists</a>." </p>
<p> The comic was "enhanced" a bit by the partner team. They added a sign on the wall of the laboratory that says <i>Windows&nbsp;95 Development</i>, and the stages of the rocket are alternately labeled <i>16-bit</i> and <i>32-bit</i>. The graffiti were clearly poking fun at Windows&nbsp;95's attempt to straddle the 16-bit and 32-bit worlds. </p>
<p> The Windows&nbsp;95 team <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/08/24/10053386.aspx"> knew how to take a joke</a>, and for a time, they adopted "Hey, we're not rocket scientists" as a catch phrase. </p>
<p> <b>Following up</b> on <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/08/24/10053386.aspx"> that article from 2010</a>: Microsoft ran a free seminar on Windows&nbsp;95 development for Macintosh programmers at the 1995 MacWorld Expo. Upon successful completion, participants received T-shirts with the slogan "<a href="http://www.kraigbrockschmidt.com/mm/Chapter09.htm">Windows 95 sucks less</a>." </p>

		<p>What&#39;s funny about the tee shirt is W95 did indeed appear to suck less at the time but when I fire up the VMs with the surviving useful or interesting software from the era everything runs better on 3.1.</p>

		<p>&quot;On a larger scale from James&#39; legendary exploits, we also have Microsoft&#39;s epic product launches. The launch of Windows 95 was a kind of coup de gr√°ce in this regard&#8230;&quot; </p>
<p>Did coup de gr√°ce regard OS/2?</p>

		<p>@Not a scientist at all: the same text explains that at the same show Windows 3.1 was launched, in April 1992, IBM launched OS/2 2.0, too. That might have been OS/2&#39;s coup de gr√°ce :-) .</p>
<p>Microsoft got its share of bad press for mixing 16 and 32 bit code in Windows 95. IBM did the same in OS/2 2.0 (which was slower than &#39;95, too), and somehow didn&#39;t get such criticism. Of course, people settled that when they bought Windows and not OS/2.</p>

		<p>Software may have run better on 3.1 but it crashed better on Windows 95. That might sound funny but you know what I mean.</p>
<p>One software freeze in 3.1 would lock up the whole thing and leave you trying ctrl-alt-delete. Usually you had to reboot. Luckily that didn&#39;t take long.</p>
<p>In 95 a crash would freeze up the program but you could kill it and keep going.</p>

		<p>On the 16-bit code in OS/2, it reminds me of this: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.isham-research.co.uk/slime.html">http://www.isham-research.co.uk/slime.html</a></p>
<p>To add to what the article says, the original OS/2 2.0 had more 16-bit code than later versions. IBM ported the graphics subsystem for example in 2.1, which was released right around the time when the original Pentium was released.</p>

<p>Well, that&#39;s what the marketing material would have you believe. &nbsp;The reality was somewhat different. &nbsp;Mind you, the marketing campaign also told me I&#39;d never see the egg-timer cursor again&#8230; that promise has nearly been delivered on 20 years later.</p>

		<p>Does the current 32-bit layer in 64-bit Windows suck less than Windows 95&#39;s 16/32 bit hybrid?</p>

		<p>I was working at Symantec at this point and I remember the &quot;Windows 95 sucks less&quot; motto well. We were working to support Windows 95 &quot;from day one&quot; and it was definitely interesting. I remember being curious as to why the shell extensibility interfaces all took ANSI rather than Unicode strings. Little did I know just how long that transition would ultimately take.</p>

		<p>@Azarien: There are no 32-bit kernel components in 64-bit Windows. The whole stack is 64-bit drivers up to user mode. In user mode, system processes are all 64-bit. 32-bit user processes cannot load 64-bit DLLs and vice versa. The whole Win32 stack is present as 32-bit libraries, which are the same binaries which ship in the 32-bit except for components which call into kernel mode. Instead, these switch the processor into 64-bit long mode, then call into the WOW64 support libraries (wow64.dll for kernel components, wow64win.dll for calls into win32k.sys, and wow64cpu.dll for CPU emulation).</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
