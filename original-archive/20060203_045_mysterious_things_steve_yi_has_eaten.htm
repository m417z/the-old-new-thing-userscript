<p>I read with some fascination <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/steveyi/"> Steven Yi</a>'s <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/steveyi/archive/2006/01/28/518764.aspx"> <i>Mysterious Things I Have Eaten</i></a>, since I have had four out of five of them myself.

<p> Kimchee, like <a href="http://netnet.net/~pineaire/Lutefisk.html"> lutefisk</a> and <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1469413"> surstr&ouml;mming</a>, most likely comes from the days before refrigeration. The acid produced by fermentation preserves (what's left of) the food. </p>
<p> Oh, and if you're keeping score: </p>
<ul>
<li>Dried squid: Too salty.     (Then again, I didn't have the jerky type; mine was shredded.) </li>
<li>Sea cucumber: Awful. </li>
<li>Kudu poop: Haven't tried it. </li>
<li>Kimchee: Not bad. </li>
<li>Shrimp chips: Awesome. </li>

		<p>The first time I had surstr&#246;mming I was surprised that the flies didn&#8217;t land on it.  I knew something was up straight away.</p>
<p>That said, I did enjoy it.  It&#8217;s just a pity it didn&#8217;t repel the mosquitos too.</p>

		<p>Shrimp chips are quite popular in Chinese restaurants here in Italy&#8230; is it something uncommon elsewhere?</p>
<p>Apart from dried squids, none of those compare to the Spanish Percebes to me.</p>

		<p>Well, </p>
<p>1) agreed dried squid is too salty and tough<br />
<br />2) don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve had sea cucumber<br />
<br />3) kudu poop &#8211; nope<br />
<br />4) kimchee &#8211; sorry, but I prefer my sauerkraut<br />
<br />5) shrimp chips &#8211; quite good, easy to make, just throw them into hot oil and POOF! they are done.</p>
<p>While certainly not mysterious, it is unusual for people to have eaten &#8211; guinea pig, pigs ears, and all manner of offal.</p>

		<p>Shrimp chips are really hard to find over here in the US or at least they are here in Portland Oregon. I have to go to a special oriental grocery store to get mine. I got introduced to them when I was stationed in England in the Marine Corps. I absolutely love them I just wish they were easier to get.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d say you&#8217;re four for four. It doesn&#8217;t sound like he actually ate the Kudu poop. Putting something into your mouth and spitting it out, doesn&#8217;t count in my books. So give yourself an extra pat on the back, you achieved a perfect score, you are the master.</p>

		<p>The only strange critter I&#8217;ve managed to eat has been jellyfish.  It is just like you would imagine, like flavorless jello that has been left out on the Tundra for months to toughen up.  It seemed like the most pointless unsatisfying food you could manage to choke down.</p>

		<p>When in Iceland I was told of a recipe for fermented shark, which I believe is called &quot;hakarl&quot;. The thought of it is not appealing, so I didn&#8217;t try any.

		<p>You know it&#8217;s funny, I wasn&#8217;t fond of kimchee the first time I had it, but thinking back I would definately eat it again.</p>

		<p>One of the few non-technical books in my office is &quot;Unmentionable Cuisine&quot; by Calvin W. Schwabe. Chapter titles include: Horsemeat, Dog and Cat meat, Rodent and other Mammalian Meat, Small Birds, Reptiles, Amphibians, Eels and Lampreys, Insects and Other Land Invertebrates, and Milk, Eggs and Fish. </p>
<p>Recipes included but of course.</p>

		<p>This reminds me of a community in the deep woods of Mississippi called Providence where my dad was the Methodist minister.  They had an annual event which could be accurately described as a celebration of our place in the food chain, but we always called it the Varmit Eat.  A carnivore&#8217;s delight involving much frying, barbequeing, and roasting of a wide variety of meats.  I recall beef, pork, venison, goat, rabbit, squirrel, (o)possum, checken, dove, quail, frog legs, rattlesnake, and alligator.  And it was all quite tasty.</p>

		<p>Shrimp chips are huge here in The Netherlands. You can buy them normal, chili, whatever. Eaten a *lot* with Chinese food, which from what I understand, is more like a special Dutch version of Chinese food.</p>

		<p>I assume &quot;shrimp chips&quot; are what&#8217;s known as &quot;prawn crackers&quot; here Down Under in Oz &#8211; little pink things you fry in oil or put in the microwave and they expand into big pink things that crackle on your tongue?</p>
<p>They&#8217;re both a) fairly commonplace here, and b) awesome. :)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
