		<p>Heh. Yup, that&#8217;s the boat I&#8217;m in this year. &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t even think of it at first either &#8212; it just dawned on me last week. &nbsp;Duh. &nbsp;Last year, of course, she was pregnant for mothers day, so she got a card then. &nbsp;But this year, it&#8217;s the full-fledged gift, I suppose.</p>
<p>Perhaps I&#8217;ll get something in June, then. &nbsp;I wonder if it will be a tie?</p>

		<p>Obviously bramster is not a father. &nbsp;Every husband gets his wife a card/gift for Mother&#8217;s Day (assuming she is, in fact, a mother). &nbsp;Why do they do it? &nbsp;Because it&#8217;s easier than fighting the establishment. &nbsp;Sad, but true.</p>

		<p>Take it from me. Don&#8217;t leave out your wife on Mother&#8217;s Day. It&#8217;s Mother&#8217;s Day, not Your Mother&#8217;s Day, and especially not Yo Mama&#8217;s Day.</p>

		<p>You are all giving into the hallmark marketing system. Mothers days for aunts, grandma&#8217;s wives&#8230; foooey.</p>
<p>Sure if you have a little kid get something for them to write their name in and hand to mum that&#8217;s nice but YOU don&#8217;t need to buy something from YOU.</p>
<p>Its like valentines&#8230; in the UK you get stuff for people you are sleeping with or would like to sleep with. In the USA Hallmark has you buying stuff for pretty much anyone you have ever met. Craaaaazy</p>

		<p>Yep, let&#8217;s all show our love and recognition to our own mother, the mother of our children and everyone else we call mom on mother&#8217;s day. And then we&#8217;re good for the rest of the year, because there is just one mother&#8217;s day per year, right?</p>

		<p>Sure, Dia de las Madres is a &quot;Hallmark Holiday&quot;, but at least it honors people who deserve a little recognition. &nbsp;I believe you should certainly honor your own mom, but also the mothers of your children. &nbsp;After all, you can&#8217;t make them yourself. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t it seem like girls get a pass on this one, though, mother or not?</p>

		<p>Feel free to make your own cards, by the way &#8211; that way, Hallmark doesn&#8217;t get money from you in their sneakiness.</p>
<p>And no, it&#8217;s not Wife&#8217;s Day, but if your wife is a mother, you should still let her have the day off.</p>

		<p>Yipes, thanks for posting this. &nbsp;I forgot. &nbsp;My wife may not be *my* mother, but she&#8217;s still a mother&#8230;and my three-year-old isn&#8217;t likely to have the presence of mind to buy Mommy a gift by himself.</p>

		<p>Mother&#8217;s Day was originally a day for political activism, in the USA, check out:</p>

<p>there&#8217;s an older holiday in Britain with the same name.</p>
<p>It was not invented by Hallmark.</p>

		<p>Jeez guys, is it really that hard to show a little care and/or respect to your partner and/or (step)mothers? It doesn&#8217;t hurt, does it?</p>
<p>I&#8217;m married and we have a 16 month old boy, and I spent Mother&#8217;s Day happily showing him off to all three (grand)mothersboth but I&#8217;ve happily spent &nbsp; to your wife/spouse/mother</p>

		<p>@dbt: Just because it was originally invented for that purpose doesn&#8217;t mean that&#8217;s what it is. &nbsp;The woman who agitated for the holiday in the first place was known to lament the decline of the holiday as early as the 1920s, not 10 years after it was first recognized officially by the state of West Virginia (in 1920). &nbsp;It may have once held noble purpose, now it&#8217;s just a shoddy card giving holiday like all the others (Valentine&#8217;s, Father&#8217;s, etc.).</p>

		<p>Surely if Mother&#8217;s Day was for all mothers, it wouldn&#8217;t have the apostrophe there?</p>
<p>(In a recent episode of the UK Apprentice, the candidates invented a &quot;Singles Day&quot; holiday and accompanying cards. They spent roughly 4 hours arguing about where the apostrophe went.)</p>

		<p>My wife recently gave birth to our first kid, people who says that mothers (and wives) don&#8217;t deserve some special care on mother&#8217;s day obviously don&#8217;t know the amount of pain they went through during labour.</p>
<p>Shame on you guys. &nbsp;Were you guys sleeping at home when she was pushing your kid out?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
