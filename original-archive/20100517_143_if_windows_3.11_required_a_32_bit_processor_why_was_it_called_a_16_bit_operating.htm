<p>Commenter Really16 asks via the Suggestion Box <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#1453869"> how 32-bit Win32s was, and why Windows 3.11 was called 16-bit Windows when it required a 32-bit CPU and ran in 32-bit protected mode</a>.</p>
<p> First, let's look at how Windows worked in so-called Standard mode. Actually, it was quite simple: In Standard mode, Windows consisted of a 16-bit protected-mode kernel which ran applications in 16-bit protected mode. I suspect there would be no controversy over calling this a 16-bit operating system. </p>
<p> With the introduction of Enhanced mode, things got more complicated. With Enhanced mode, there were actually three operating systems running at the same time. The operating system in charge of the show was the 32-bit virtual machine manager which ran in 32-bit protected mode. As you might suspect from its name, the virtual machine manager created virtual machines. Inside the first virtual machine ran... a copy of Standard mode Windows. (This is not actually true, but the differences are not important here. Don't make me bring back the Nitpicker's Corner.) </p>
<p> The other virtual machines each ran a copy of MS-DOS and were responsible for your MS-DOS sessions. Recall that Enhanced mode Windows allowed you to run multiple MS-DOS prompts that were pre-emptively multi-tasked. These other virtual machines ran in a variety of modes, but spent most of their time in virtual-86 mode. MS-DOS applications could use the DPMI interface to switch into 16-bit protected mode, or even 32-bit protected mode if they wanted to. (And that's how Standard mode Windows ran inside the first virtual machine: It used the DPMI interface to switch to 16-bit protected mode.) </p>
<p> It's kind of stunning to realize that Enhanced mode Windows was really a completely new operating system with multiple virtual machines, pre-emptively multi-tasked with virtual memory. In principle, it could have created a virtual machine and hosted yet another random operating system inside it, but in practice the only two operating systems it bothered to host were Standard mode Windows and MS-DOS. </p>
<p> Enhanced mode Windows was called a 16-bit operating system because it ran 16-bit Windows applications (inside a "Windows box", you might say). The supervisor operating system was a 32-bit operating system, but since applications didn't run in supervisor mode, that really didn't mean much. For all anybody cared, the supervisor operating system could have been written in 6502 assembly language. As long as it does its supervisory job, it doesn't matter what it's written in. What people care about is the applications that you could run, and since Enhanced mode Windows ran 16-bit Windows applications, and since it ran a copy of 16-bit Standard mode Windows to do all the things that people considered Windows-y, it was the number 16 that was important. </p>
<p> Besides, you can imagine the uproar from the Slashdot crowd (if Slashdot had existed back then) that an operating system whose purpose is to run 16-bit applications in a 16-bit GUI environment would dare call itself a 32-bit operating system. </p>
<p> How 32-bit was Win32s? Pretty darned 32-bit. A Win32s application ran in the same virtual machine as the rest of Standard mode Windows, but when it ran, the CPU really was in 32-bit protected mode. Naturally, it did all its work under the supervision of the virtual machine manager, and it had to coordinate its work with the Standard mode Windows kernel that it was sharing the virtual machine with. But when your 32-bit application was running, you were bought in: Your registers were 32-bit, your pointers were 32-bit, you accessed data in a 32-bit data segment, and you executed 32-bit instructions out of a 32-bit code segment. </p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
