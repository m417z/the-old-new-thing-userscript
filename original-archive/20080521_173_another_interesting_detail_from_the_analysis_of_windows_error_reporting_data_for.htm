<p>I was in a meeting last year where I learned an interesting tidbit of information. One of the people at the meeting was looking at the error reports submitted against Explorer, and the breakdown went something like this. For the purpose of discussion, the number of reports have been normalized into "units", the precise meaning of which is left unspecified, but is meaningful for comparison purposes.&dagger;</p>

<p> The XYZ virus (not its real name) and its variants together are responsible for the top six categories of Explorer crashes, and by an enormous margin. Seventh place, an actual bug, comes in at only 1/80th the rate of number six; if you group all the XYZ virus failures together, then the combined virus failures outnumber the most popular Explorer bug by a factor of nearly 600. </p>
<p> I remember reading a report that half of Explorer crashes can be directly attributable to malware. Seeing the top Explorer crash swamped by a single virus really drives that point home.&Dagger; </p>
<p> <b>Footnotes</b> </p>
<p> &dagger;I don't know what these units mean either. </p>
<p> &Dagger;The anti-malware team is very interested in this data, because when a new category of Windows crashes suddenly spikes in popularity, there's a decent chance that a new virus is on the loose. </p>

		<p>I am curious where &quot;poorly written shell extensions&quot; would fall into the rankings for explorer crashes.. Given your numerous articles about how to write one, and how they are non-trivial (or at least easy to get wrong).</p>

		<p>has microsoft ever considered releasing a critical update that would block or remove these viruses? maybe some of these people without proper anti-virus software installed have automatic updates turned on.</p>

		<p>Carl, isn&#8217;t that what &quot;Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool&quot; does?</p>
<p>The other issue for Microsoft is that if they make the OS do too many things related to detection, removal and prevention of viruses and nasties, they are going to get hit with anti-trust complaints coming from Symantec, Mcafee etc etc for much the same reasons Netscape complained about the bundling of Internet Explorer (only more so because Netscape was free and the anti-virus vendors charge money for their products)</p>

		<p>Jonathan, Netscape was only free for home use, remember? &nbsp;Also, at least according to the blurb, the Windows Malicious Software Removal Tool only takes out a handful of threats, or it only lists a few. &nbsp;Now, if you get this kind of disparity, where one malware causes 600x the number of crashes as the top reported bug, it&#8217;s probably worth putting that in the removal tool anyway.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve only rarely had a crash with explorer.. now, hung to the point where I reboot is a significantly more common occurrence. </p>
<p>If I use task manager to kill explorer, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve ever seen the crash report dialog ask me to send info about it to MS, so I doubt the crashdump reports see many of these hung explorer problems, so I&#8217;m not surprised that the explorer crashdump stats are like they are.</p>

		<p>This is interesting. Assuming that the crashes of explorer.exe are actually side-effects of the virus, and not their goal, why are they so incompetent? Or more importantly, what are they trying to do that causes the crash?</p>

		<p>What would really be great is if there was a way to add a &quot;keep me informed&quot; option in the crash report dialog &#8211; if the crash I submitted was actually caused by virus &quot;XYZ V2&quot;, then I&#8217;d really like to know that my computer is infected.</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;m sure this adds much more complexity to a system not really designed for that, but I could see the usefulness of such a system. &nbsp;Plus, most people who would be most in need of such information would probably also be those who wouldn&#8217;t use such an option &#8230;</p>

<p>Now that&#8217;s the difference between open and closed source. In open source we&#8217;d create a firefox bugzilla entry with that number just for consistency, and if that wasnt enough someone would add the crash as a new firefox plugin.</p>

<p>If it really is the top explorer crash, that&#8217;s a mighty fine coincidence. I guess the problem is the bug is unchanged under differential analysis?</p>

		<p>@RyanBemrose: Explorer, not Internet Explorer. &nbsp;For Internet Explorer, I&#8217;d be surprised if the top crashes weren&#8217;t: (1) Flash (2) Adobe PDF Reader.</p>
<p>Now you see why the press gets confused, and keeps talking about this &quot;Microsoft Explorer Browser&quot;, or the &quot;Microsoft Vista operating system.&quot; &nbsp;On the other hand, they also talk about the &quot;Leopard operating system&quot; and Walt Mossberg seems to think it&#8217;s some big deal that iPhone has got &quot;the same kernel as Mac OS.&quot;</p>

		<p>Would it then be fair to say that, &quot;If your Windows Explorer is crashing, it&#8217;s 600 times more likely that it is due to a virus or malware than any other cause.&quot;</p>

		<p>Joe: no, because 50,000 is not the total for all other bugs. &nbsp;If there were 600 other bugs, each with around 50,000 units, the odds would be even. &nbsp;Besides, most people think viruses are evidence that Windows is crap.</p>

		<p>Mark,</p>
<p>OK, your clarification makes sense. &nbsp;</p>
<p>So, a fair statement would instead be, &quot;A crash in Explorer is 600 times more likely to be related to virus/malware activity than the most commonly reported Explorer bug.&quot;</p>
<p>Which is now true to what Raymond stated??</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know about explorer.exe, but I&#8217;ve caught malware doing dodgy things inside services.exe before. (More specifically, it modified winlogon.exe &#8211; but the actual work was done by spawning an instance of services.exe and modifying it in memory. Winlogon was behaving as expected, apart from having spawned a second services.exe; the cryptographic signature on services.exe was intact, but doing things it shouldn&#8217;t be. Quite clever, really.) Presumably XYZ was trying to do something similar, but screwing it up badly.</p>

<p>I do the same; straight to the Process tab. But I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll be changing, because in my experience once a process has got itself into a situation where I want to kill it (this is often Explorer; as far as I know I don&#8217;t have any XYZ variants, so maybe I&#8217;m a victim of bug e*100000, who knows), it nearly never responds to whatever the Applications tab does or the &#8216;red X&#8217;. The Process tab seems rather more effective.</p>

It starts off by trying to close the application gracefully and only resorts to more drastic measures when that doesn&#8217;t work. If the application is hung, it can take a couple of seconds to figure it out&#8230;</p>

<p>Watson can do that, or at least it used to. It won&#8217;t be proactive, but you can go back and look at reports you&#8217;ve reported. Of course this may only happen if there isn&#8217;t a known cause when you reported the issue.</p>
<p>@Joe Butler</p>
<p>you can&#8217;t really make a general statement from such specific data. We don&#8217;t have data on the number of other crashes, or number of other viruses. Or what percentage the #1 crasher is of total crashes. Reread Raymond&#8217;s last statement&#8230;</p>

		<p>Hmmm. Methinks Web2.0 needs something similar to this (if it hasn&#8217;t happened already in some frameworks).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m happy to press Send when an application crashes, but I&#8217;m always disappointed there&#8217;s no way to see how popular the crash is, and just in general nose around the database.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t expect this to change, but it&#8217;d be interesting. If anyone at MS wants to send me a spreadsheet&#8230;</p>

		<p>The sad thing is if the &quot;give everybody admin access so ancient code doesn&#8217;t break&quot; Windows &nbsp;&quot;security&quot; model was ever fixed, millions of malware induced bugs would go away and everybody&#8217;s experience would be better.</p>
<p>Microsoft has propagated a broken security model for decades now in the name of backwards compatibility. &nbsp;The viruses run wild. &nbsp;It&#8217;s time to realize a cure (even a painful non-compatible one) is much better than the disease.</p>
<p>Make a VM for the flaky old apps. &nbsp;Pull the rug out from the developers and start over. &nbsp;Apple did this in 2000 with OS X and reaped huge benefits.</p>
<p>Imagine the benefits to the entire Internet if Microsoft actually fixed Windows. &nbsp;The vast majority of spam and DDOS attacks are due to malware running on Windows. &nbsp;Microsoft should be held directly accountable for this. &nbsp;The spammers and bot herders are merely rushing through a door Microsoft has left wide open.</p>

		<p>When explorer hangs I use process explorer to kill the process. Others will kill it from the processes tab of task manager. As these are not reported to MS then it&#8217;s no wonder the stats are so low.</p>
<p>Incidentally, the normal reason for explorer hanging is hardware in my experience, though you could argue it&#8217;s the software&#8217;s fault for letting the hardware hang it.</p>

		<p>I never have any problems with explorer hangs after a clean install of Windows so I&#8217;ve always assumed the problem lay elsewhere.</p>
<p>@J. Peterson</p>
<p>90 percent of the world&#8217;s workstations are running some version of Windows, providing al large surface area for attacts and a high density for any virus to spread. I&#8217;m guessing that if 90 percent were running Linux most virussus/malware would be written for Linux.</p>
<p>@Darrell</p>
<p>I&#8217;m guessing that if Microsoft would let Windows detect which virus caused the crash and lets you know and maybe even how to remove it, they most likley be sued, since this comes close to what virus scanners do.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d also add most hangs/crashes are network issues (or waiting for IO completion, say on a network file share), where I get fed up with explorer not responding to close/minimize/go away.</p>

		<p>@J. Peterson: The actual solution to the problem is to keep people like you from posting nonsense in places where people can actually read it.</p>
<p>Apple could afford to totally drop backward compatibility; their user base is very small compared to that of Windows, and their users are already used to being stifled by Apple (forced to use Apple-provided hardware in order to run the OS). It&#8217;s also not used for day-to-day operations in most extremely large organizations. Who cares if 10 companies complain if you&#8217;re Apple and you own them anyway?</p>
<p>MS, on the other hand, has a very large market share, and the majority of the share of large corporate systems. Dropping backward compatibility for those customers has a much larger impact, both on those customer&#8217;s revenue stream and on MS&#8217;s ability to stay in business.</p>
<p>So please stop spreading FUD nonsense when you obviously have no clue about the subject. Thank s.</p>

		<p>@Drak,</p>
<p>Vista remembers crashes that didn&#8217;t have a solution and will periodically check to see if there is any news (or you can force it by going into Problem Reports and Solutions).</p>
<p>There have been a few occasions when it&#8217;s suddenly let me know why it crashed a few weeks prior and given me a possible solution. I think it&#8217;s possibly my favourite Vista feature.</p>

<p>Not true. &nbsp;Much of what viruses today try to do can be done without admin rights, but those writing them only test (if at all) with admin rights. &nbsp;If admin rights are off by default, more viruses will be tested in that environment and rights restriction will be less effective at stopping them.</p>
<p>Email worms in particular should work just as well from any user account that can receive them.</p>

<p>A couple of minutes might be closer. There&#8217;s that progress bar with the &quot;end now&quot; button, but unfortunately that doesn&#8217;t always seem to work either. And I don&#8217;t have that much patience, especially because the hung app is often eating a chunk of my CPU that is apparently required elsewhere.</p>

		<p>@Josh: Malware running without administrative rights can just infect the current/calling users account, not the whole system.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard of SAFER a.k.a Software Restriction Policies?</p>
<p>Turn them on for all users (except administrators) and allow execution of files only in &quot;%SystemRoot%&quot; and below as well as &quot;%ProgramFiles%&quot; and below (and &quot;%AllUsersProfile%Start Menu&quot; if you don&#8217;t want to remove .LNK from the list of &quot;executables&quot;).</p>
<p>NOW try to run a worm fetched per mail under a user account.</p>
<p>@KenW: So all the administrators of large corporations haven&#8217;t got any clue that even not so well-written crap can be made to run under &quot;normal users&quot; accounts?</p>

		<p>Stefan: but how does that stop an IE exploit from downloading the latest unpatched escalation bug? &nbsp;For the last couple of years, most infections I&#8217;ve found were through Java (with the user clicking Allow). SAFER isn&#8217;t enforced anyway.</p>
<p>As for admins, the majority of software conflicts with LUA on various levels. &nbsp;A large business will have hundreds of applications, and virtualisation only covers a small subset of LUA bugs. Can you really expect to fix them all during an OS upgrade?</p>

		<p>@Mark: with the settings I proposed SAFER prevents (accidential or deliberate) execution of malware which was dropped to the filesystem (like an attachement received per mail).</p>
<p>It cannot prevent the execution of JScript/VBScript/&lt;whatever code&gt; inside any application (except that application would have an interface to SAFER and incorporate these policies; the WSH is an example). It cannot prevent any exploitation of bugs in applications or system components (which can be triggered by such simple means like &lt;IMG SRC=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://malware.com/malicious.img&quot;&gt;" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://malware.com/malicious.img&quot;&#038;gt" rel="nofollow">http://malware.com/malicious.img&quot;&#038;gt</a>; together with the &quot;correct&quot; MIME type sent).</p>
<p>When your applications have known bugs: fix them. If there aint a fix: uninstall the application (or at least prevent it from being used).</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
