		<p>Sounds worth a try. I&#8217;m going to convince myself that typing is exercise. I just burnt 1,000 calories typing this reply alone. BEEFCAKE!</p>

		<p>My mind immediately jumps to those electric abdominal belts. Some people get great results from them. Other people get nothing. I&#8217;ve noticed a strong correlation with believing they work, and experiencing results; Steve Oedekirk, for example, used the abdominal belt exclusively to get himself &quot;in shape&quot; for the movie &quot;Kung Pow: Enter the Fist&quot;. A neighbor, however, wore the thing at work on the highest setting for weeks&#8230; with no result. He didn&#8217;t believe it would work.</p>
<p>Of course, anecdotal evidence isn&#8217;t really evidence. But I&#8217;m still rather of the opinion that it&#8217;s SOMETHING.</p>

		<p>The mind is a wonderous thing. &nbsp;I read an article about all the amazing aids a man can order to increase the size of his manhood and how most don&#8217;t work. &nbsp;I knew better. &nbsp;If the men really KNEW that the aids worked then the aids would work, but if the men had doubts then the aids would be at best interesting &quot;toys.&quot; &nbsp;I KNEW that the devices would work so I ordered several and they did. &nbsp;In fact they worked so well that I no longer need a chair. &nbsp;All I need do is tuck and point my browser to an (in)appropriate web site and the seating ploblem is soon solved. &nbsp;I keep ruining pants though.</p>

		<p>Mark: It is already used as a part of physiotherapy, for example, physiotherapeutists train mentally with patients paralyzed after car accidents, and mental training (patient is imagining that he is moving the limb, and trying hard to control it) really does make a difference (objectively decreases time to restore sensitivity in damaged limbs).</p>

		<p>Placebos are wonderful things. For some diseases it is known that placebos are better than active medication &#8211; but don&#8217;t count on it.</p>
<p>For most diseases the physicians intervention is only marginally better than no intervention or placebo treatment. One of the reasons for this is that medical researchers tend to confuse statistical significance with biological significance (the former meaning that the effect is merely different from zero; the latter meaning that there is some genuine biological meaningful improvement).</p>
<p>Another point to make is that in animals &nbsp;placebo treatments (homeopathy and the like) often work wonderful as well &#8211; even better than in humans. The reason for this is that complementary measures (diet, rest) can better be imposed on domestic animals than humans.</p>

		<p>A friend of mine signed into a fitness spa. She was there a lot, talked to people, gossiped. What she did not do, at least never when I watched, was exercises.</p>
<p>She might sit on a training bike, chat to the person sitting on the next one, but she did not ride.</p>
<p>Still, she lost weight and got into better shape. It was absolutely incredible.</p>
<p>Anyway, she is the only person I know who managed to pull of this trick.</p>

		<p>The iatrotherapeutic effect is nothing to sneeze at (sorry&#8230;). The mere presence of a doctor or other caregiver can be treatment enough. It&#8217;s like a person-placebo &#8211; &quot;the doctor&#8217;s here so now I will get better&quot; kinda thing. Very interesting. Could be the actual effect in play behind many alternative therapies (my experience &#8211; not researched properly).</p>

		<p>Weight loss is a good area for the placebo affect, because it is difficult by design not by necessity. &nbsp;(Unlike most other diseases.)</p>
<p>Humans are designed to gain weight when possible. &nbsp;This would imply that losing weight easily is not difficult to implement, but is an evolutionary disadvantage. &nbsp;The usual messiness of evolution could plausibly give individuals some way to make themselves use more energy than necessary while living, thus losing weight.</p>
<p>The mandatory car analogy: one can much more easily increase a car&#8217;s fuel consumption than (say) repair axle damage, or increase its top speed. &nbsp;You just need to screw with the engine computer&#8217;s program.</p>

		<p>Physical jobs are good excercise: I dropped a belt notch or so in a few weeks when I took a break from programming to be the assistant manager for a new caf&#233; that started up in my local shopping centre.</p>
<p>Being a fast order chef is actually very hard work: lots of things to carry back and forth, lots of running around behind the counter frantically cooking things, lots of cleaning before leaving at the end of the day. &nbsp;Rigid meal breaks would have been a contributing factor: no time for in between meals coffee and snacks, just water grabbed on the run.</p>
<p>I suspect the maids simply dropped their failed excercise plans and worked more enthusiastically. &nbsp;Nothing magic here.</p>

		<p>I watched an interview with Arnold Schwarzenegger when he was in his body building hey day and he recommended that you never exercise with headphones on or in front of a TV etc. because he had found in his personal experience that forcing your mind to concentrate on the exercise and experience it in a conscious fashion produced much better results than doing the same exercise routine but having your mind elsewhere. I have found this to be very true in my own workouts as well. I see much better results when I actively concentrate on the effort yet I don&#8217;t think I am doing anything different than when I exercise with music on. The mind is a strange thing.</p>
<p>Now if only I could teach mine to keep me in shape without doing any exercise, now that would be the best trick of all.</p>

		<p>Of course the researcher didn&#8217;t bother to check on the eating habits of the two groups.</p>
<p>The explanation is really simple. The group that was informed they were doing exercise lost learned helplessness regarding weight control, decided losing weight was a real option, and ate less. Elementary my dear Watson.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
