<p> Since I hadn't seen the outside of my cubicle for a while, I decided to walk over to talk to the customer in person. </p>
<p> The employee having the problem was named Dr.&nbsp;Watson. His computer had bluescreened. </p>
<p> I still get a chuckle out of that years later. That little unexpected name collision threw twelve people in the IT service and support teams into disarray. </p>

		<p>I would have expected this article to appear last week to coincide with the well-publicized Jeopardy! event (unless this is one of those rare articles that was just written and got bumped to the front of the queue for its awesomenes).</p>

		<p>I find it much more likely that it was written well before IBM named their system Watson, and has just been in the queue that long.</p>

		<p>Reminds me of Paul Thurrot&#39;s Windows for Phones With Keyboards 2012 R2 Special Edition. Besides, Live is just the current marketoid term at MS, just like MSN was for 98-era (left for the crap news portal) and .NET for XP-era (remember .NET Server?). I wonder why they didn&#39;t change Passport.NET to Live ID in service packs.</p>

		<p>I&#39;ve run into a Dr. House (same name as the titular character of a popular TV show) and a med student whose last name was Kevorkian (same name as an infamous Dr. in the US), but I have not yet noticed a Dr. Watson &#8212; I&#39;ll have to keep an eye out for one.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
