		<p>When Stefan was on his book tour, he did a reading at Microsoft.  Stefan was kind enough to invite six random people to lunch-and-scrabble with him before the talk, and I was lucky enough to be one.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t get a chance to play him myself, but it was very amusing watching an expert go up against a novice.  I think it was on his third move that he bingoed with DESTRIER.  &quot;What the heck is a destrier?&quot; asked his opponent.</p>
<p>&quot;It is an entry on a list of highly probable eight letter words which I have memorized.&quot;  (We checked later; it&#8217;s a medieval war horse.)</p>
<p>A couple moves later he bingoed again with ELECTORS.  I rarely get one bingo in a game, and here he was with two in the first five moves&#8230;</p>

		<p>Stefan makes the point is his book that the top players stop thinking of the words as &quot;words&quot;, they just see them as valid scoring combinations.  Remembering the definitions just takes up brain space that can be better used for storing more valid scoring combos.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to see the obsolete words tossed out in favor of modern words.</p>

		<p>I remember Stefan mentions one top player who doesn&#8217;t even speak English!  That player merely memorizes lists of &quot;strings of letters&quot; and plays them.</p>

<p>I believe it.  At one time I was very interested in Scrabble, and started memorizing the 2-, 3-, and 4-letter word lists.  It&#8217;s amazing what a difference even those make in your gameplay.

		<p>Can I ask someone what the story is with move #5? Player &quot;B&quot; issues a &#8216;challenge&#8217; move and scores five points? What&#8217;s that all about?</p>

		<p>Rule 5.iii describes how challenges are scored in tournament play.<br />
<br /><a target="_new" href="http://www.msosingapore.org/rules-scrabble.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.msosingapore.org/rules-scrabble.html</a></p>
<p>Here, player J challenged &quot;irately&quot; and failed. The penalty for a failed challenge is 5 points per challenged word.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s always fun to browse the official Scrabble player&#8217;s dictionary.  There are some winners in there.</p>
<p>My favorite is &quot;cwm&quot;.  Cwm is defined as &quot;a cirque&quot;.  A cirque is apparently a square well or ditch, from 11th century Welsh.</p>
<p>We play sometimes at work.  One person memorized all the two-letter words, which gives him an insane advantage.  I&#8217;m just not willing to let words like that into my brain.</p>
<p>I did memorize &quot;qat&quot;, though.  Qs can be tricky to get rid of.</p>

		<p>Ah &#8211; I get it. The turn log confused the issue by putting &#8216;B&#8217; as the player.</p>

		<p>I think scrabble should be forced to adopt Neal Stephenson&#8217;s fictious &quot;qwghlm&quot; from &quot;The Cryptonicom&quot; just for the fun of it.  It was such a hilarious use of a label, ethnic group name and story telling device.  Almost as good as how the adults talk in the original peanuts cartoon videos.  For that matter maybe it can be introduced into the OED.  Bah hah hah.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an idea for someone with too much time on their hands, the MSDE scrabble dictionary and memory tool! :P</p>
<p>As always Raymond great finds and posts.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
