<p>A customer reported that their printer configuration property sheet page looked different depending on the host process. In some processes, the printer configuration dialog had the classic look of Windows&nbsp;2000, but in other processes it has the themed look of Windows&nbsp;XP and later versions.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> The printer driver calls the <code>Create&shy;Property&shy;Sheet&shy;PageW</code> to create the property sheet page that contains the push-button, radio-button, and other controls. We've confirmed that we call the function with the same parameters each time, but the results are different depending on which program is doing the printing. We've confirmed that both applications are using version 6.0 of the common controls library. Can you provide pointers for investigating why we are getting the old-school look sometimes? </p>
</blockquote>
<p> It's clear that the problem is that the property sheet page is being created with a different activation context depending on the host process. If the activation context is a v6 context, then you get the themed buttons; if the activation context is a v5 context, then you get the classic buttons. The fact that version 6.0 of the common controls library is loaded by the process is not relevant; what's relevant is which version is active at the time the dialog is created, since that's the time the class names are resolved. </p>
<p> If the problem were with a regular dialog box, then you can explicitly activate the v6 context before calling <code>Dialog&shy;Box</code>, or you can use <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb773175#mmc"> isolation awareness</a> to have the activation code generated for you. </p>
<p> However, the case here is a property sheet page. Since property sheet pages are created on demand (when the user selects the page), you don't have direct control over the code that calls <code>Dialog&shy;Box</code> in order to activate your v6 manifest. Instead, use the <code>hAct&shy;Ctx</code> member of the <code>PROP&shy;SHEET&shy;PAGE</code> structure and set the <code>PSP_<wbr>USE&shy;FUSION&shy;CONTEXT</wbr></code> flag in the <code>dwFlags</code>. </p>
<p> <b>Trivia</b>: <i>Fusion</i> was the code name for the feature which includes things like <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/dd408052"> isolated applications</a>, <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/aa374191"> application manifests</a> and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/ms682600"> redirection files</a>. And because they were apparently a bunch of nerds (<i lang="fr">quelle surprise</i>!) they named the initial version <i>Hydrogen</i>. </p>

		<p>@Joshua, but that&#39;s what happens.</p>
<p>The hosting process&#39;s EXE might not have a manifest, so it probably dynamically creates an activation context with common controls 6.0. However, that only works for the threads where it&#39;s done.</p>
<p>So, if this printer configuration property sheet is created in another thread, it must activate a 6.0 context, which must be like Raymond said for property sheet pages.</p>
<p>I&#39;m not sure, but it might also be necessary in the event that a 6.0 context was active when creating the dialog that contains the property sheet, but that context is no longer active after its creation (i.e. dispatching messages). I don&#39;t know if this is safe either, I&#39;ve never tried it.</p>

		<p>The whole stuff with activation contexes was always over my head. Looks really complicated to make both versions of comctrls work together.</p>
<p>But what would have happened if Microsoft had just updated comctrl like it was always done before (i.e. with IE4). What exactly would have been broken? What kind of incompatibilites are we looking at that was not so bad in the old times?</p>

<p>Unless they run on Java. In which case they look different.</p>
<p>Unless they use Carbon, In which case they look different.</p>
<p>Unless they use their own custom controls, in which case they will only be consistent with System&#39;s they tested.</p>

		<p>There is a bug in Windows 7 and 8 (fixed in Vista SP2 but not incorporated in W7/8) where even if the EXE has a manifest to use visual styles, they are ignored and the program gets the ugly classic look. To &quot;fix&quot; the bug, run the program once in XP compatibility mode. It then &quot;gets&quot; visual styles and even if you remove the shim after it gets them, it retains its themed look. Anyone at MS wanna fix it?</p>

		<p>@Clovis:</p>
<p>Of course, without that mess you would get people who would have had their apps look bad on upgrade to Windows XP and then suddenly &quot;Microsoft broke my application&quot;.</p>
<p>The styled controls were generally a different size to the un-styled controls, so if the dialogs were of a fixed size, then things would start looking wrong as soon as you applied the visual style. You can see artefacts of this to this very day. One well known installer engine has two buttons overlapping when styles are applied to a certain window.</p>

		<p>@Clovis: Now try (with the help of external programs) to run a pre-Mac OSX application on your lovely OSX. IT looks different too, and OSX can&#39;t even run it by itself. So, what exactly is the point you are trying to make?</p>

		<p>@Drak: &quot;with the help of external programs&quot; is the crucial difference of course. Apple and Microsoft have taken very different approaches to backwards compatibility. You wouldn&#39;t seriously expect software running in a VM always and automatically to match the look and feel of the host OS, would you?</p>

		<p>@Ian: one of my points is that on his Mac, he can&#39;t even run software meant for the previous version of the operatin system without needing special tools. Windows allows this without (for the user) special tools. The fact that all his OSX apps look the same is like saying that all apps written specifically for Win7 do have the same looks and feel (if they use the standard controls).</p>

		<p>@xpclient. I have an exe that is manifested to use version 6 of the Common Controls library. Common controls then render using visual styles.</p>
<p>Can you post the additional steps so I can reproduce the bug on my system?</p>
<p>Note: make sure you are not modifying the manifest after the last as cached it. Reboot after modifying the manifest if you are unsure if you have modified the manifest our not.</p>

		<p>@Ian Boyd, Can&#39;t repro it reliably as it seems to happen only for certain EXEs (haven&#39;t noticed which ones: some 32-bit EXEs or some EXEs which have external manifests or only EXEs with older XP manifest). Since it goes away after the manifest is cached, I didn&#39;t bother looking further.</p>

		<p>@xpclient: &nbsp;you didn&#39;t bother looking further, and you don&#39;t really know if it&#39;s a bug, but you&#39;ll still file it away as another example of why everything Microsoft is broken.</p>

		<p>DWalker, I didn&#39;t say it is not a bug or I don&#39;t know. I have experienced the bug for numerous legacy apps which are properly themed on XP. I said I don&#39;t care about to repro the bug. And where did I file away as &quot;everything is broken&quot;? You must be reading imaginary stuff between the lines. If anyone at MS offers to fix it, then I will find a way to repro it. :) What&#39;s the use if the bug is not going to be fixed? Is there even an official open mechanism to file bugs without MS Premier Support (which you have to pay for)?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
