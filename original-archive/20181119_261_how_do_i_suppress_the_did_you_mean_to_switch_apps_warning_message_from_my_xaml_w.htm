<p>
A customer had an application that used a
<a HREF="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.webview">
UWP XAML WebView control</a>.
There are some points at which the user can click an element
in the hosted HTML which triggers the main app to navigate
to another part of the app entirely.
The customer didn't give any details,
but I can imagine this being, say,
an app that contains multiple mini-web-apps
(say, some web games),
and on the main page of each game, there's a button called
<i>Play a different game</i>.
</p>
<p>
Or maybe it's something else entirely.
Whatever.
</p>
<p>
The customer managed to find a way to do this:
The app registered for a protocol, let's call it
<code>contoso-game:</code>,
and the <i>Exit</i> button navigates the WebView control
to <code>contoso-game:mainmenu</code>.
This works fine,
but when the user clicks the <i>Exit</i> button,
there is a warning dialog that appears first:
</p>
<div STYLE="border: solid 1px black; font-family: Segoe UI, sans-serif;
            width: 30pc">
<div STYLE="background-color: white; color: black;
              font-size: 9pt; padding: 6px">
  Did you mean to switch apps?
  </div>
<div STYLE="background-color: #0067b2; color: white; padding: 10px">
<div STYLE="font-size: 20pt">Did you mean to switch apps?</div>
<div STYLE="font-size: 12pt; padding: 10px 0px; font-weight: 300">
      "Contoso" is trying to open "Contoso".</div>
<div STYLE="overflow: hidden">
<div STYLE="float: right; margin: 10px; text-align: center">
       <span STYLE="display: inline-block; width: 7em; padding: 2px 0px; border: solid 2px white">Yes</span>
       &nbsp;&nbsp;
       <span STYLE="display: inline-block; width: 7em; padding: 2px 0px; border: solid 2px white; background-color: #1f8cfa">No</span>
     </div>
<div STYLE="clear: all"></div>
</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<p>
Is there a way to suppress this dialog box?
It looks silly to have the program ask permission to switch to itself.
</p>
<p>
Your program can handle
<a HREF="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/uwp/api/windows.ui.xaml.controls.webview.unsupportedurischemeidentified">
the
<code>WebView.<code></code>Unsupported&shy;Uri&shy;Scheme&shy;Identified</code>
event</a>.
</p>
<pre>
&lt;WebView
    ...
    UnsupportedUriSchemeIdentified="OnUnsupportedUriSchemeIdentified" /&gt;

void OnUnsupportedUriSchemeIdentified(
    WebView sender,
    WebViewUnsupportedUriSchemeIdentifiedEventArgs e) 
{ 
    // Silently allow all navigations back to the app itself.
    if (e.Uri.Scheme == "contoso-game") 
    { 
        e.Handled = true; 

        // Use the existing URI parser on the main page.
        MainPage.InternalNavigateToUri(e.Uri);
    } 
}
</pre>
<p>
When the user clicks a link that uses a <code>contoso-game</code>
protocol,
we mark the event as handled (so that the WebView control takes
no further action),
and then forward the URI to the existing code in our main page
that deals with URI activations.
Basically, we short-circuit the activation and handle it internally.
This is particularly useful if there is more than once running instance
of the Contoso program:
Short-circuiting the activation means that the navigation is handled
by instance the user the clicked on.
</p>
<p>
Note that intercepting the event from the WebView means that you
don't need to register the protocol in their application manifest
because the protocol is never activated.
Instead, the program intercepts it and performs an internal navigation.
</p>
<p>
Of course, if the customer were using the <code>contoso-game</code>
for other reasons, then they should leave it in their manifest.</p>

		<p>The buttons are still escaping their parent &#8220;window&#8221; in Firefox for me. Fix it by adding a &lt;div style=&#8221;overflow:hidden;zoom:1;&#8221;&gt; element around the &lt;div STYLE=&#8221;float: right;&#8230;&gt; div.</p>

		<p>There&#8217;s something similar when you host IE WebBrowser in your process. Sometimes system administrators will think it&#8217;s *hilarious* to enable Internet Explorer Enhanced Security Configuration. When this happens, suddenly the javascript, inside your browser control, inside your app, is prevented from running. </p>
<p>You can avoid this by responding to the IServiceProvider::QueryService (that&#8217;s your), and provide an IInternetSecurityManager object when they ask for it. </p>
<p>For seven of the eight methods you simply have to return `INET_E_DEFAULT_ACTION`. But for <b>MapUrlToZone</b> you return <b>URLZONE_LOCAL_MACHINE</b>.</p>

		<p>When SBS was a thing, IE ESC used to be enabled by default. I never had to disable it.</p>
<p>Activation short-circuiting is also something AJAX-y web apps do, if they&#8217;ve advanced from using URL hashes to HTML 5 history.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
