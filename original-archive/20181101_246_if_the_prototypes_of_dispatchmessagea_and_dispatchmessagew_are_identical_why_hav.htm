<p>
There are a number of functions, mostly in the window manager,
which have both ANSI and Unicode variants,
even though the prototypes are identical.
</p>
<pre>
LRESULT WINAPI DispatchMessageW(const MSG*);
LRESULT WINAPI DispatchMessageA(const MSG*);

BOOL WINAPI TranslateMessageW(const MSG*);
BOOL WINAPI TranslateMessageA(const MSG*);

int WINAPI TranslateAcceleratorW(HWND, HACCEL, LPMSG);
int WINAPI TranslateAcceleratorA(HWND, HACCEL, LPMSG);

HACCEL WINAPI CreateAcceleratorTableW(LPACCEL, int);
HACCEL WINAPI CreateAcceleratorTableA(LPACCEL, int);
</pre>
<p>
Why can't these pairs of functions be combined into a single
function?
Clearly there's no <code>CHAR</code>/<code>WCHAR</code>
mismatch, seeing as the parameters are identical.
</p>
<p>
While it's true that there is no type mismatch,
there is still a character set dependency.
</p>
<p>
For the <code>MSG</code>-based functions,
the system needs to know whether the message was obtained
via
<code>Get&shy;MessageW</code>/<code>Peek&shy;MessageW</code>
or via
<code>Get&shy;MessageA</code>/<code>Peek&shy;MessageA</code>.
If the message is <code>WM_<code></code>CHAR</code>,
then the meaning of the <code>WPARAM</code> changes depending
on the character set of the function that obtained the <code>MSG</code>.
If you used
<code>Get&shy;MessageW</code>/<code>Peek&shy;MessageW</code>,
then the <code>WPARAM</code> is a Unicode code unit,
but if you used
<code>Get&shy;MessageA</code>/<code>Peek&shy;MessageA</code>,
then it's an ANSI code unit.
</p>
<p>
The case of <code>Create&shy;Accelerator&shy;Table</code> is more
subtle.
Even though the same <code>ACCEL</code> structure is used for
both ANSI and Unicode,
the meaning of one of the fields changes:
</p>
<pre>
typedef struct tagACCEL {
  BYTE fVirt;
  WORD key;
  WORD cmd;
} ACCEL, *LPACCEL;
</pre>
<p>
If the <code>FVIRTKEY</code> flag
is not set in the <code>fVirt</code> member,
then
the <code>key</code> member
<a HREF="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms646340(v=vs.85).aspx">
contains a character code</a>,
and that's the place where a character set dependency sneaks in.</p>

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
