		<p>&quot;National Institute of Standards and Technology&quot;, &quot;Standard Reference Materials&quot;, &quot;peanut butter&quot; &#8212; wow, I thought terms like <a target="_new" href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/A/ANSI-standard-pizza.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/A/ANSI-standard-pizza.html</a> were just a joke&#8230;now I&#8217;m going to look if there is really something like that. :-)<br />
<br />(I would expect things like that in EU, where we have a standard for bannana curvature.)</p>
<p>And a note: is the peanut butter used anywhere except the US? Since I have seen it for the first time in some movie, I would like to taste it (I love peanuts), but I have never seen it in any czech shop&#8230;</p>

		<p>Sure, it&#8217;s pretty big in Australia, and I know it&#8217;s sold in NZ as well. I&#8217;ve also seen it in the UK&#8230;</p>
<p>But nobody has ever explained to me the attraction of PB&amp;J :)</p>

		<p>PB&amp;J is the r0xx0r! :)  Peanut butter also goes quite well in a sandwich with bacon and lettuce, or on its own on toast.  The crunchy/smooth choice is always difficult, so I make sure I have both in the cupboard&#8230;</p>

		<p>Peanut butter goes very well with honey or Nutella(tm). But just by itself&#8230;. dunno.</p>

		<p>&#177;0.2% ? Do we need such accuracy on fat content in peanut butter ? </p>
<p>And how much tax dollars goes to bureaucrats to achieve this standard ? </p>
<p>Get the government out of my peanut butter !<br /></p>

		<p>Nobody is saying that all peanut butter has to be 10.4%&#177;0.2% fat. The purpose of this peanut butter is for food analysis companies to stick it in their nutrition analysis machine and check that the machine reports &quot;The food you just analyzed contains 10.4% fat.&quot; </p>
<p>Surely you want food analysis machines to be accurate, don&#8217;t you?</p>

		<p>OK, now I know where to buy standard peanut butter. But where can I buy the standard high-fat meal <a target="_new" href="http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=%22standard+high-fat+meal" rel="nofollow">http://www.google.ca/search?hl=en&#038;ie=UTF-8&#038;q=%22standard+high-fat+meal</a> mentioned in prescription drug leaflets? Or do I have to prepare it myself using a careful combination of standard ingredients?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
