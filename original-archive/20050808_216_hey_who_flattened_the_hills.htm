<p> This weekend, I went to a friend's house on Mercer Island to see <a href="http://www.blueangels.navy.mil/"> the US Navy Blue Angels flight demonstration team</a> perform. <a href="http://www.seafair.com/airshow.asp"> They do this every summer</a> as part of Seattle's <a href="http://www.seafair.com/"> Seafair</a> festival, but this was the first time I got to see the show up close and personal. The I-90 bridge is closed for safety reasons, and people are allowed to walk onto the highway (at least for a short distance) to get a better view of the demonstration. </p>
<p> Two summers ago my friend invited me to his place, but I made the mistake of trying to drive to Mercer Island&mdash;traffic was horrific and I finally arrived just as the show was wrapping up. (I did manage to glimpse a plane pass by at very low altitude though.) This year I decided to ride my bicycle to his house. It's just an hour's ride and I don't have to worry about traffic! It seems that somebody flattened the hills along <a href="http://www.dreamflying.com/bicycle_commute/mercer_island.htm"> the bike path that follows highway I-90</a>. Okay maybe it's just that I'm in better shape now but I like to think it's because they were nice enough to flatten the hills. </p>

		<p>And of course, since you&#8217;re neither curious nor logical, you didn&#8217;t wonder where they put the hills ! I&#8217;ll tell you: Yesterday, I went for some biking in my neighborhood. And guess what : They put hills where it used to be fairly flat !</p>
<p>I was wondering but now I know: These are your hills ! Please come and take them back !</p>

		<p>And guess what, the planes probably run QNX, but definitely not Windows, otherwise the Blue Angels would Blue Screen! Windows shell team is rubbish so LongWait realtime capabilities will be rubbish anyway.</p>

<p>  It&#8217;s sad when the high point of your day is posting some insulting drivel on someone&#8217;s blog.  I would say the guy is just jealous because he has never produced anything noteworthy in his entire life, and most likely never will.  However jealousy is probably too high of an emotion for this person to experience, he is probably just an angry bitter loser sitting in some crappy flat somewhere telling himself how clever he is and cursing the rest of the world for not acknowledging it.  To the OP I would suggest you make your way back over to /. before you miss the daily circle jerk, don&#8217;t forget your picture of Linus Torvalds.

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
