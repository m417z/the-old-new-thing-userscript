<p>
At Microsoft, you'll often encounter three letters put together
to form an acronym representing what appears to be a group
of people of some sort.

<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
Document title: Monthly meeting with CMR
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
CMR will review the status of all projects in the upcoming weeks.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
<b>From</b>: Morgan
</p>
<p>
... email message ...
</p>
<p>
Thanks for all your hard work,<br/>
CMR
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
This acronym consists of the initials of the leaders of the
three project roles:
Program management, development, and quality.
Collectively, this is known as the <i>triad</i>.
</p>
<p>
In this case, the people involved are named
Robin, Morgan, and Chris.
To choose the name for a triad,
you take the three initials (in this case, R, M, and C)
and play with the six ways of arranging them until you find
something that sounds pleasing but doesn't create confusion
with existing three-letter acronyms.
</p>
<p>
If the name one of the members of the triad begins with a vowel,
then you will often find the choice made so that the resulting
three-letter abbreviation is pronounceable.
</p>
<p>
When two different triads have a meeting together,
this is known as a
<i>3 &times; 3</i>,
pronounced <i>three by three</i>.
This is another case of

		<p>I suspect the 3 x 3&#8230; notation is actually probably a good guidline for how many days it will take between requesting a meeting and actually get the full quotient of people in a room together&#8230;</p>

		<p>So 3 people enter the meeting room and then another 3 people enter the meeting room and then 9 people come out? I think these triads have more interesting meetings than I do.</p>

		<p>When two different triads have a meeting, it should be a 2 x 3, not a 3 x 3.  Or it could be a 3 + 3.  </p>
<p>3 x 3 is just&#8230; wrong, since it&#8217;s 9.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
