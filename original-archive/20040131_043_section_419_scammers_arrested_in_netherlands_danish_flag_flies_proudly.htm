		<p>IKEA&#8217;s spiritual home is Sweden, but its headquarters are in the Netherlands. Probably for tax reasons.</p>

		<p>Ohh the poor victims!!! All they ever wanted to do was aid in illegally exporting money from a third world country for a small cut. Just a little pre-tax income to get Jr. through college.</p>
<p>I get a little irked about the way the scam is portrayed. It makes sense when you realize that some guy wants to sell a story and needs victims or people would go&#8230; &quot;what&#8217;s the point?&quot;</p>
<p>But honestly the only victim I see here is everyone else that gets to deal with the spam and a whole country whose ability to do business internationaly is damaged</p>
<p>Oh and yes I am Nigerian.</p>

		<p>The Dutch-Sweden connection reminds me that Volvo (cars) has a factory in the Netherlands and another one in Belgium. In fact nowadays more Volvo cars are made outside of Sweden than inside. More useless trivia.</p>

		<p>I wish there was some way to regulate the internet. There needs to be some editing process. Maybe a tool that marks a webpage as has been edited or is full of bullshit. Take this article for example. It talks&#8230;</p>

		<p>Can someone explain to me why Americans keep interchanging Denmark and Holland?</p>
<p>Okay, so you&#8217;re not experts on European geography? That&#8217;s okay, I can&#8217;t tell you the name of the capital city of North Dakota.</p>
<p>But it&#8217;s always Denmark and Holland. Never Denmark and Latvia, Denmark and Austria or even Denmark and Belgium.</p>
<p>In fact, I can&#8217;t tell you how many times I&#8217;ve had this conversation:</p>
<p>&#8211; Where are you from Sir?<br />
<br />&#8211; Denmark.<br />
<br />&#8211; Ohh, So then you speak Dutch!<br />
<br />&#8211; No, I speak Danish.</p>
<p>And this is where the funny guys go:</p>
<p>&#8211; Danish? Ain&#8217;t that something you eat?</p>

		<p>For me, it&#8217;s strictly due to the similar names. I should know better.  (I&#8217;ve heard some people confuse Austria and Australia.)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
