<p>Reader laonianren wanted to know more about this game <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/03/10/10138969.aspx#10139278"> Walls and Ladders</a>.</p>
<p> "Walls and Ladders" is not a game. It's just a metaphor for a conflict in which one side wants to perform some action and the other side wants to prevent it. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/26/9445006.aspx"> The defending side builds a wall, and the attacking side builds a taller ladder</a>. In response, the defending side builds a taller wall, and the attacking side builds an even taller ladder. The result of this conflict is that the defending side constructs an ever-more-elaborate wall and the attacking side constructs <a href="http://boingboing.net/2009/12/23/duck-sex-competition.html"> a more-and-more complex ladder</a> [link possible NSFW], both sides expending ridiculous amounts of resources and ultimately ending up back where they started. </p>
<p> There is a closely-related metaphor known as an <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/16/73780.aspx"> arms race</a>. In an arms race, each participant wants to be the most&nbsp;<i>X</i>, for some property&nbsp;<i>X</i>. An arms race tends to be all-attack, whereas wall-and-ladders tends to have one side attacking and the other defending. </p>
<p> Since many conflicts can be phrased either as an attack-attack scenario or an attack-defend scenario (some defenses may include counter-attacks), I tend to get the two confused. Notice, for example, that my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/02/16/73780.aspx"> arms race</a> article contains mostly walls-and-ladders scenarios; for example, a case where one side wants to terminate a process and another wants to  prevent it from being terminated. On the other hand, my <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/03/10/10138969.aspx"> wall and ladders</a> example was really more of an arms race, with both sides wanting to take control of the screen. </p>
<p> Depending on which group you work with at Microsoft, you may find a preference for <i>walls and ladders</i> over <i>arms race</i>, probably due to the same sensitivity to military terms that led to the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2008/11/11/9059013.aspx"> <i>War Room</i> being renamed <i>Ship Room</i></a>. (I seem to recall that there was a lawsuit that among other things alleged that the fact that a Microsoft project called its daily meeting room the <i>War Room</i> was proof of <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2011/05/31/10168424.aspx"> Microsoft's evil essence</a>.) </p>

		<p>FWIW, in evolutionary biology, the &quot;Red Queen&#39;s Race&quot; competition between predator and prey (e.g. bigger legs on both sides for chasing vs. escaping, or bigger teeth/claws/horns vs. thicker armour) is referred to as an &quot;arms race&quot;, even though they&#39;re mostly attack-defend scenarios.</p>

		<p>Seems to me that in German, there doesn&#39;t exist any equivalent to &quot;walls and ladders&quot; (at least I can&#39;t think of any). For arms race there&#39;s &quot;Wettrüsten&quot; which is basically the same, although imho doesn&#39;t have the same annotations as described in the article (i.e. it basically doubles for both arms race and walls and ladders).</p>

		<p>I call these games &quot;last move wins&quot;. Usually they&#39;re played iteratively, but sometimes I find a big company playing the game when they&#39;re in a position where they can never get the last move. It would be funny if it weren&#39;t so obnoxious.</p>

		<p>@A. Skrobov: &nbsp;The Bing translator more helpfully translates it to &quot;You have good, and I had the wall ladder&quot; (if you omit the quotes when translating.)</p>
<p>As a result I believe a more accurate translation would be along the lines of &quot;You have a good wall and I had the ladder.&quot;</p>
<p>(The difference is that Bing will do Chinese (traditional) whereas I believe Google only does Chinese (simplified.))</p>

		<p>@Karellen: I suspect the same will be true of almost any &quot;arms race&quot; scenario &#8211; it doesn&#39;t matter if my gun is bigger than yours if we each have a gun that can kill the other. In the Cold War, both sides had nuclear weapons which would have really, really ruined the other side&#39;s day if fired: the real competition was *countermeasures* to those weapons: fighter-planes to intercept incoming long-range bombers, so the bombers get replaced with missiles that can&#39;t be intercepted by the fighters, so the fighters get replaced with anti-missile-missiles that can intercept them&#8230; Without the defensive aspect, bragging about whether you have the firepower to kill the other guy 1,000 times over rather than just 100 would be rather futile.</p>
<p>Given the military context, the name &quot;Ship Room&quot; brought to mind Raymond&#39;s coworkers all gathered to play a game of Battleships &#8211; ironic, since that&#39;s almost what the real-life War Room was&#8230;</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
