<p>         Short answer: The same reason you turn the ignition key to shut off your car.      </p>
<p>         Long answer: Back in the early days, the taskbar didn't have a Start button. (In a         future history column, you'll learn that back in the early days, the taskbar wasn't         called the taskbar.)      </p>
<p>         Instead of the Start button, there were three buttons in the lower left corner. One         was the "System" button (icon: the Windows flag), one was the "Find" button (icon:         an eyeball), and the third was the "Help" button (icon: a question mark). "Find" and         "Help" are self-explanatory. The "System" button gave you this menu:      </p>

</tbody>
</table>
<p>         ("Arrange Windows" gave you options like "Cascade", "Tile Horizontally", that sort         of thing.)      </p>
<p>         Of course, over time, the "Find" and "Help" buttons eventually joined the "System"         button menu and the System button menu itself gradually turned into the Windows 95         Start menu.      </p>
<p>         But one thing kept getting kicked up by usability tests: People booted up the computer         and just sat there, unsure what to do next.      </p>
<p>         That's when we decided to label the System button "Start".      </p>
<p>         It says, "You dummy. Click here." And it sent our usability numbers through the roof,         because all of a sudden, people knew what to click when they wanted to do something.      </p>
<p>         So why is "Shut down" on the Start menu?      </p>
<p>         When we asked people to shut down their computers, they clicked the Start button.      </p>
<p>         Because, after all, when you want to shut down, you have to start somewhere.      </p>
<p>         (Besides, if we also had a "Shut down" button next to the Start button, everybody         would be demanding that we get rid of it to save valuable screen real estate.)      </p>

		<p>Thanks Raymond. This is a great read.  Can you next explain why &quot;Delete&quot; doesn&#8217;t actually delete my files and why &quot;Delete&quot; is not a valid option in the Recycle Bin (ahem, Trash Can)?</p>

		<p>&lt;body xmlns=&quot;<a href="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&#038;gt" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot;&#038;gt</a>;<br />
    &lt;p&gt;<br />
        In the Before Time, &quot;Delete&quot; meant &quot;Throw away irretrievably&quot;.&amp;#160; About three milliseconds<br />
        after the &quot;delete&quot; command was written, somebody wrote an &quot;undelete&quot; program.&amp;#160;<br />
        These &quot;undelete&quot; programs were necessarily kind of dodgy &#8212; it&#8217;s the computer version<br />
        of picking the eclair out of the garbage can and eating it.<br />
    &lt;/p&gt;<br />
    &lt;p&gt;<br />
        When multitasking came onto the scene, these &quot;undelete&quot; programs became even more<br />
        useless.&amp;#160; So we made the two-stage delete part of the shell.&amp;#160; If you don&#8217;t<br />
        like it you can always turn off two-stage delete (Recycle Bin Properties).<br />
    &lt;/p&gt;<br />
    &lt;p&gt;<br />
        And maybe my eyes deceive me, but when I right-click an item in the Recycle Bin,&amp;#160;I<br />
        see a Delete option which, if selected, pitches the item out of the Recycle Bin, redering<br />
        it lost to the mists of time.<br />
    &lt;/p&gt;<br />
    &lt;p&gt;<br />
        (Those who pay close attention will notice that the confirmation UI for two-stage<br />
        delete is different from the confirmation UI for one-stage delete.)<br />
    &lt;/p&gt;<br />
    &lt;p&gt;<br />
        &amp;#160;<br />
    &lt;/p&gt;<br />

		<p>Makes sense, ever try to Stop a Shutdown before you Start it :), what doesn&#8217;t make senes is while the world installs windows in their offices, one company wants us to install office in our windows.</p>

		<p>Most everything makes sense. Except for that first analogy. If you use this one &#8211; shutting off the car by turning the ignition &#8211; then somehow you have to prove that you actually started up Windows by pressing the Start button. Right?</p>

		<p>Not only did you make a big Start button for people to click and told them to start working, you also, as far as I remember from my Windows 95 expeirences, put a big &quot;Click here to start!&quot; logo on the taskbar.<br />
You left nothing to chance, eh? ;)</p>

		<p>Omer: That&#8217;s still there (as of Win2000), but you don&#8217;t see it if any programs show task buttons on start up.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s just one more instance of the idea that &quot;usability&quot; in software is really &quot;easy to use for someone who has never used it before&quot;.  This is ok as far as it goes, but often it conflicts with what I think is a more robust concept of &quot;usability&quot;, that is, &quot;easy to use to use for someone who knows how to use the software&quot;.</p>

		<p>In response to Byron&#8230; With NT4 you used to be able to stop a shutdown after you started it.  By hitting Ctrl-Alt-Del it would change into a logoff action if it hadn&#8217;t progressed too far.  With Win2K this feature seems to have gone however :-(</p>

		<p>I actually think that Recycle Bin is a better analogy than the Trash can.  When you think about it, files you delete are &quot;recycled&quot; into empty disk space.  Of course, that may not have been what MS had in mind, but it makes sense to me.  :)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
