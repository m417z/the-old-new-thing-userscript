<p>It has been <a href="http://www.miketodd.net/encyc/lingo.htm"> famously said</a> that England and the United States are two countries separated by a common language. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2008/12/16/9222933.aspx"> The same holds true for Microspeak</a>.</p>
<p> In the Redmond dialect of Microspeak, we talk about <i>extensibility</i>: Designing a system with specific points where features can be added in the future, often by outside parties. For example, an example of an <i>extensibility point</i> in the shell  would be a context menu handler or a namespace extension. </p>
<p> In the Reading dialect of Microspeak, the term for this is <i>future-proofing</i>. </p>
<p> On the other hand, if you use the term <i>future-proofing</i> in Redmond, people will interpret it differently. In Redmond, <i>future-proofing</i> means designing a system so that it continues to function without alteration, even if something happens in the future. (For example, one example of future-proofing&mdash;in the Redmond sense of the term&mdash;would be using a function like <code>SHGetSpecialFolderPath</code> instead of hard-coding the path to a directory.) </p>
<p> <b>Update</b>: Some folks have taken issue with this definition, and I will have to defer to their local knowledge. I get my reports on the Reading dialect of Microspeak from my contacts there, so it's possible that they were mistaken, or that the usage was peculiar to their workgroup and incorrectly extrapolated to the entire dialect. </p>

		<p>Sorry Raymond but I don&#8217;t buy that one. I don&#8217;t work for MS, but I do work in the UK and have extensive contact with Microsofties in TVP (Reading) and Redmond. In my experience extensibility and future-proofing mean the same thing on both sides of the pond.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d say that future-proofing includes extensibility as a possibility, but doesn&#8217;t explicitly mean or imply it. I&#8217;ve always used future-proofing in the Redmond sense (though I haven&#8217;t used or heard that term in years.)</p>
<p>PS. I&#8217;ve never worked for Microsoft nor have I ever been in Redmond (or the state of Washington; one of four or five states which I haven&#8217;t yet visited.)</p>

		<p>Can&#8217;t agree I&#8217;m afraid. Here in the UK extensibiliy means just that &#8211; a hook to allow us (or the users) to enhance capability. Future-proofing means doing something now to avoid having to rely on extensibility (or re-engineer) to add features that you wished you&#8217;d added now.</p>

		<p>You guys do realize this is an opinion blog based on Raymond&#8217;s personal experiences, right? Unless you have met all the popel he has met, attended every meeting he has attended, etc, then what you belive to be correct on this subject is no more accurate that what he stated. It&#8217;s not like there is a spec on what extensibility means vs future proofing upon which everyone on the planet has signed off.</p>

<p>See, the problem in the UK is that you could live 5 minutes down the road from someone, both of you speak &quot;English&quot; and yet you&#8217;re both mutually unintelligible&#8230;</p>

		<p>Gosh!</p>
<p>My understanding is that Extensibility is one strategy for achieving &#8216;future-proofing&#8217; Where future proofing means that the system can continue to provide a viable service into the future. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Future Prooofing is not Microsfoft specific, &nbsp;I&#8217;m pretty sure that I heard the term used in the UK outside of Microsoft in the mid 1990s</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve definitiely heard UK Microsoft contractors use the term</p>

		<p>Though to be honest I can&#8217;t recall it being used very often, in our group, future-proofing component X would generally mean designing it so it can meet future requirements without being modified. This includes both designing it to handle more general or a wider variety of scenarios, and designing it with extensible points so future requirements can be met by plugging in new components, without changing the original component.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve always thought these were two different things.</p>
<p>extensibility is the process of allowing it to be extended and updated for the future &#8211; e.g having &quot;plugin&quot; support etc.</p>
<p>whereas:</p>
<p>future-proofing is the idea is designing it such that you don&#8217;t need to update it for the future.</p>
<p>For example, writing a web page is basic text vs lots of scrolling marquees etc. You are future proofing against bad pracices in the future by choose neutral means and not using whiz-bang features.</p>
<p>But this wouldn&#8217;t be considered &#8216;extensibility&#8217; really.</p>

		<p>I think the type of future-proofing where something can be adapted and given new capabilities is the more usual definition.</p>
<p>But the other definition &#8211; something impervious to the future so it will continue to operate as it always has even while its environment changes &#8211; is also valid.</p>
<p>Both are in contradistinction to something that just stops working in the future.</p>

<p>Really, even when Raymond is clearly wrong, no-ones should be allowed to disagree? &nbsp;What a peculiar concept. &nbsp;Personally, I&#8217;ll take nitpicking as always preferable to deference. &nbsp;There&#8217;s never been a nitpicking yes-man.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>I find it interesting that somebody&#8217;s experience can be &#8220;wrong&#8221;. Were you at that meeting?

On the other hand, &#8220;That&#8217;s not how I see the word used&#8221; responds to someone&#8217;s experience with your own experience. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>The Redmond definition (&quot;the future won&#8217;t break it&quot;) makes sense when you compare it to similar words:</p>
<p>bulletproof</p>
<p>waterproof</p>
<p>idiot-proof</p>
<p>damp-proof</p>
<p>None of these have anything to do with extensibility.</p>

		<p>I thought it was funny when [mumble] company started suggesting that people order its computers with half the available RAM slots filled in order to promote &quot;increased upgrade potential.&quot; &nbsp;They weren&#8217;t suggesting that you get the most out of your computer, but to make sure that it was possible to upgrade later!</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
