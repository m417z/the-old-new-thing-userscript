<p>A corporate customer had a problem with their employees accidentally deleting folders like <i>Videos</i> and <i>Pictures</i> and are looking for a way to restore them, short of blowing away the entire user profile and starting over. They found some techniques on the Internet but they don't always work consistently or completely. <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2014/02/06/10496796.aspx#10497222"> What is the recommended way of recreating these missing folders</a>?</p>
<p> It turns out that the customer was asking a question that I answered <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2004/11/23/268486.aspx"> many years ago</a>, but looking at it from the other side. </p>
<p> To recreate a folder, call <code>SHGet&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code> with the flag <code>CSIDL_<wbr>FLAG_<wbr>CREATE</wbr></wbr></code>, or call <code>SHGet&shy;Special&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code> and pass <code>fCreate = TRUE</code>. </p>
<p> If you are targeting Windows Vista or higher, the known-folder equivalent is calling <code>SHGet&shy;Known&shy;Folder&shy;Path</code>, <code>SHGet&shy;Known&shy;Folder&shy;ID&shy;List</code>, or <code>SHGet&shy;Known&shy;Folder&shy;Item</code> with the <code>KF_<wbr>FLAG_<wbr>CREATE</wbr></wbr></code> flag. </p>
<p> (There is a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb762494(VS.85).aspx"> <code>CSIDL</code>-to-KF conversion table</a> in MSDN.) </p>

		<p>Since I fail to see cases where permissions to delete such folders would be useful, wouldn&#39;t this be better handled by group policy?</p>

		<p>@kinokijuf: I did not test specially your case, but whenever I want to prevent the creation of a folder, I create a file with the same name. (And vice-versa for the automatic creation of files)</p>

		<p>For Libraries, there is a built-in command &quot;Restore default Libraries&quot; when you right click the parent Libraries folder. The Shell team could add a similar &quot;Restore default profile folders&quot; command.</p>

		<p>@kinokijuf:</p>
<p>Go to onedrive.live.com and delete the folder there.</p>
<p>If it comes back, an app is making it &#8212; could be a variety of apps, including OneDrive desktop or the Windows 8 app. &nbsp;The Windows 8 app and various mobile devices like to make a &quot;Camera Roll&quot; folder if they&#39;re sent to sync photos, and it might be this is the localized equivalent. &nbsp;Some devices make a separate &quot;HD.&quot;</p>
<p>That sounds like a mobile device that is set to sync its camera roll to me.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
