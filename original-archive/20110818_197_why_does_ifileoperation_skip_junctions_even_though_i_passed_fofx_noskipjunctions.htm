<p>The <code>IFile&shy;Operation::<wbr>Set&shy;Operation&shy;Flags</wbr></code> method accepts a number of flags to modify the file operation, among them today's subject <code>FOFX_<wbr>NO&shy;SKIP&shy;JUNCTIONS</wbr></code>. A customer reported that they couldn't get this flag to work: Whether they set it or not, the <code>IFile&shy;Operation</code> skipped over <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/ee851567.aspx"> file system junctions</a>.</p>
<p> The term <i>junction</i> evolved two independent different meanings. The shell team invented the term <i>shell namespace junction</i> in Windows&nbsp;95 to refer to a point in the shell namespace <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/cc144096.aspx"> in which one type of namespace extension is grafted into another</a>. For example, a directory of the form <code>name.{guid}</code> serves as the transition point between the default file system namespace and a custom namespace. </p>
<p> Meanwhile, the file system team developed the term <i>NTFS junction point</i> to refer to a directory entry which links to another location. </p>
<p> If you just hear the word <i>junction</i> by itself, you need to use context to determine whether it is short for <i>shell namespace junction</i> or <i>NTFS junction point</i>. </p>
<p> Since <code>IFile&shy;Operation::<wbr>Set&shy;Operation&shy;Flags</wbr></code> is a shell interface, the shell interpretation is more likely (and is the correct one in this case). The <code>FOFX_<wbr>NO&shy;SKIP&shy;JUNCTIONS</wbr></code> flag has no effect on the behavior of the <code>IFile&shy;Operation</code> interface on NTFS junction points; it modifies the behavior on shell namespace junctions. </p>

		<p>HAHAHA, check out the MSDN documentation for IFileOperation::SetOperation:</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>FOFX_NOSKIPJUNCTIONS</p>
<p>Walk into Shell namespace junctions. By default, junctions are not entered. For more information on junctions, see Hard Links and Junctions</p>
<p>&#8212;</p>
<p>Yes, &quot;Hard Links and Junctions&quot; hyperlink points you to info on NTFS Junctions and links. &nbsp;I can kind of see the source of the confusion &#8211; the reference guide right there points them the wrong way. &nbsp;</p>
<p>(doesn&#39;t help that IFileOperation doesn&#39;t act on files, it should be IShellItemOperation, but hindsight&#39;s 20/20)</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Good catch. The correct link should be &quot;For more information on Shell namespace junctions, see <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc144096(v=VS.85).aspx" rel="nofollow">Specifying a Namespace Extension&#39;s Location</a>.&quot; -Raymond</i>]</div>

<p>Aaargh, that gives me flashbacks of a product I worked on a long time ago, there was some logic in it that said &quot;if (!bNoDropDownInHeader) {&quot; &#8211; cruel, just cruel.</p>

		<p>@Jack Mathews: Yes, good catch. I hope you&#39;ll add the correction through community content, because there&#39;s sweet FA chance of Raymond or anyone else from Microsoft doing anything about it.</p>

		<p>Shouldn&#39;t the title of this post be &quot;Why *does* IFileOperation skip junctions&#8230;&quot; instead of &quot;doesn&#39;t&quot;? I agree, double negatives are confusing.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
