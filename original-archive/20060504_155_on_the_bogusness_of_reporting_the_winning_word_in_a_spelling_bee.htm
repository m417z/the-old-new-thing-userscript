<p>Whenever the United States media report on a spelling bee (typically, the <a href="http://www.spellingbee.com/"> Scripps National Spelling Bee</a>, the best-known spelling bee in the country), they always report on the "<a href="http://www.spellingbee.com/bwg/statschamp.shtml">winning word</a>". But the winning word is a bogus metric because the winning word in real life tends to be comparatively easy. It's the <strong>penultimate</strong> word that is the hard one.</p>
<p> In nearly all spelling bees, when the field narrows to just two contestants, if one contestant misses a word, the other contestant must spell that word <strong>plus</strong> a bonus word to win. Sort of like volleyball. The bonus word is not necessarily a hard word; in fact, just by the principle of regression to the mean, it is likely to be a comparatively easy word. The hard word is the one that knocked out the second-place winner. Look at it this way: Nobody misspelled the winning word, so how hard can it be? </p>
<p> Consider this hypothetical spelling bee: </p>
<p> <b>Judge</b>: The word is "chiaroscuro".<br> <b>Player A</b>: c-h-i-a-r-u-s-c-u-r-o.<br> <b>Judge</b>: I'm sorry, that's incorrect. Player B?<br> <b>Player B</b>: c-h-i-a-r-o-s-c-u-r-o.<br> <b>Judge</b>: Correct. And your next word is "dog".<br> <b>Player B</b>: d-o-g.<br> <b>Judge</b>: Congratulations, Player B, you're the winner. </p>
<p> [9am: How embarrassing. I misspelled "chiaroscuro".] </p>
<p> The newspapers all report that "The winning word was 'dog'," and people reading the newspaper say, "Pshaw, I don't know why people get all worked up about this spelling bee thing. Even I can spell 'dog'." </p>
<p> For example, in 2005, the "winning word" was "appoggiatura", a word any musician can spell in their sleep. The penultimate word was the somewhat more challenging "roscian". </p>
<p> This year's Scripps National Spelling Bee will be held on May 31 and June 1, 2006. </p>

		<p>If &quot;chiaruscuro&quot; is from Italian, then we&#8217;d say and write c-h-i-a-r-o-s-c-u-r-o and never c-h-i-a-r-u-s-c-u-r-o.</p>
<p>But maybe is US english you use the chiaruscuro variation only (maybe from ancient Italian)?</p>
<p>If I google search for chiaruscuro in &quot;pages in Italian&quot; I get 2 matches (and googles asks me &quot;maybe you wanted &quot;chiaroscuro&quot;?), while I get 287.000 matches for chiaroscuro.</p>

		<p>Chiaroscuro is correct in English. &nbsp;<br />
<br /><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=chiaroscuro" rel="nofollow">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=chiaroscuro</a><br />
<br />Google will find many hits for Mr. Chen&#8217;s spelling, but the &#8216;o&#8217; is correct. &nbsp;Note the 1998 winning word &#8211; &#8216;chiaroscurist&#8217;.<br />
<br />Mr. Chen&#8217;s overall point is quite correct &#8211; I remember years ago the winning word was &#8216;Purim&#8217;, whose spelling is quite phonetic (not to mention extremely familiar for a reasonable percentage of the population).<br />
<br />Dear me, according to the winning word list, that year was 1983. I&#8217;m getting old. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Ugh. Modern &quot;journalism&quot;.</p>
<p>You could have stopped at &quot;On the bogusness of reporting&quot;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure the headline for your example would be &quot;National Honor Student misspells &#8216;dog&#8217; in spelling bee&quot;</p>
<p>This is just another example of reporters that can&#8217;t grasp basic facts about their story. Look at just about any story about &quot;that thar intarweb thing&quot;</p>
<p>Was any of the GTA &quot;Hot Coffee&quot; stories anywhere near correct? None that I saw. Are any of the current &quot;MySpace is a bunch of pedophiles&quot; stories correct? Probably not.</p>
<p>Recently in the local paper there was a story about a new &quot;carbon fiber steel&quot; when it&#8217;s actually a new type of high carbon steel.</p>
<p>Any of the stories about things I&#8217;ve personally witnessed were morphed beyond recognition and at least 50% wrong.</p>
<p>As a result, I don&#8217;t believe anything in the papers unless I can personally verify it.</p>

		<p>&quot;National honours student beaten by a dog&quot;<br />
<br />If the words are arranged in some form of graduated difficulty then this was not bogus reporting. &nbsp;The issue shifts to how do you rank words for their spelling difficulty?</p>
<p>presumably some complex heuristic based on frequency of occurrence, number of syllibals/letters, pronouncibility and quirky construction. &nbsp;I wonder how the words are chosen and ordered?</p>

		<p>&quot;National Honours student eaten by a dog&quot;</p>
<p>Maybe the spelling bee folks should require the attending journalists to drop out if they can&#8217;t spell the words. &nbsp;That might reduce the reports to being only those from better-educated (or merely logophilic) writers.</p>
<p>Of course, the editors would then go and screw the whole thing up.</p>

		<p>How many Italian words in this contest! That&#8217;s really strange, because Italian words are usually very simple to spell. English words are a lot more difficult, because there isn&#8217;t a clear correspondence between spelling and pronunciation.</p>

		<p>If it&#8217;s like Volleyball, then&#8230;</p>
<p>If B mispelled &quot;dog&quot;, A would be asked to spell &quot;dog.&quot; &nbsp;If A got it correct, A would then have to spell another bonus word. &nbsp;If A got the bonus word wrong, that word would go to B and continue until one player gets two words in a row correct.</p>

		<p>Steve:</p>
<p>My experience confirms your post. &nbsp;In cases where I have had personal experience in a story that became &quot;news&quot;, the version in the newspaper was some bastardization of the truth. &nbsp;I am skeptical of everything I read because of that.<br /></p>

		<p>That&#8217;s good contest design!</p>
<p>Rather than let the contest end on a failure (the runner-up misspelling something), the rules make sure the last word spelled is spelled correctly, and by the winner.<br /></p>

		<p>Except that the winner gets to hear a possible spelling fail, making it easier for that winner to spell the penultimate word.</p>
<p>Make them spell, oh, five words in a row, and I&#8217;m convinced.</p>
<p>Honestly, Raymond&#8217;s love of the spelling bee is a bit unnerving.</p>

		<p>I have a degree in music (majoring in musicology) and I had to just look up Appoggiatura &#8211; much much more commonly referred to as a leading note or grace note. I asked a few of my friends who also completed their degrees and work as professional musicians in various capacities, and the only one who knew this word was my friend who has a phd in composition.</p>
<p>To say its a word &quot;any musician can spell in their sleep&quot; means we have a very narrow definition of what &quot;musician&quot; means.</p>

		<p>I was a spelling bee champion, but the entire concept of spelling bees has always bugged me. They are all about spelling words verbally with no visual reference, but&#8230; Spelling is not a verbal skill! It is a written one.</p>
<p>How often in the real world does it matter whether you can spell a word out loud from memory? Ever? No, you spell a word when you write it.</p>
<p>So what on earth does a spelling bee have to do with anything?</p>

		<p>My previous complaint aside, there&#8217;s an interesting parallel with eBay auctions. Many people do not realize that the final price on an eBay auction is not set by the highest bidder. It is set by the *second highest* bidder.</p>
<p>The auction closing price is the maximum bid of the second highest bidder, plus the bid increment.</p>

		<p>Lorenzo: that&#8217;s what makes our words harder to spell for them. Completely different vowels and consonants (even vowels and consonants we don&#8217;t have at all) to be spelled in the same alphabet</p>
<p>See &lt;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-native_pronunciations_of_English#Italian&gt;" rel="nofollow"></a><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-native_pronunciations_of_English#Italian&#038;gt" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-native_pronunciations_of_English#Italian&#038;gt</a>; for a pretty detailed view of the opposite problem (Italian people speaking in English) that nevertheless highlights the vast phonetical differences between the two languages. I think the most important defect has to be &quot;Tendency to pronounce words as they are spelled&quot; &#8211; to us it&#8217;s a given, every letter corresponds to one and one sound, or at most a couple (like &quot;s&quot; that has two distinct sounds &#8211; compare &quot;mese&quot; and &quot;sera&quot; &#8211; or &quot;i&quot; that sometimes is a little like a consonant), and there are no &quot;hidden&quot; vowels, like the omnipresent schwa in English</p>

		<p>KJK::Hyperion, I don&#8217;t know if there are that many exception in italian but some words which seem trivial to pronounce correctly, do infact hide traps.<br />
<br />For example at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language" rel="nofollow">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italian_language</a> you can find that &quot;botte&quot; (barrel or hand to hand fight) and &quot;pesca&quot; (fishing or peach) have the two meanings with slightly different pronounciations. The first time I read it I was amazed of the difference (I didn&#8217;t know there was one) :)</p>
<p>Go figure if there is the same difference in &quot;c&#8217;&#232; un tipo di colore.. si ma che tipo di colore ? &quot; LOL :D<br /></p>

		<p>&#8212; I was a spelling bee champion, but the entire concept of spelling bees has always bugged me. They are all about spelling words verbally with no visual reference, but&#8230; Spelling is not a verbal skill! It is a written one. </p>
<p>In that case, spelling bees also test a child&#8217;s ability at mental visualisation. The best ones are the ones who can visualse the written word in their imagination.</p>
<p>Possibly this is the reason we don&#8217;t have adult spelling bees, we only visualise naked breasts :-)</p>

		<p>&quot;Is there a reason why almost every American seems to go crazy about spelling bees? In Germany these kinds of competitions are almost unknown.&quot;</p>
<p>Because they are not as uncultured as we like to see them? ;)</p>
<p>I think for german (compared to english) spelling is only a smaller part of correct writing. But there is more.<br />
<br />The german education system would be afraid of the competetiveness, and it goes straight against the laissez-faire which is the only direction of change since the &#8217;80.</p>
<p>If you ask me, I&#8217;d take hourly spelling bee news over the shaming debacle of our spelling reform.</p>

		<p>&quot;In Germany these kinds of competitions are almost unknown.&quot;</p>
<p>German spelling is almost entirely phonetic. &nbsp;In English, there&#8217;s nothing at all in the pronunciation of &quot;through&quot; to indicate that the word contains a G. There&#8217;s no spelling difference between the &quot;ough&quot; in &quot;bough&quot;, that in &quot;cough&quot; and that in &quot;through&quot;, but they&#8217;re all pronounced differently. &nbsp;These kinds of inconsistencies are much rarer in German &#8212; for the most part, German spelling is entirely consistent. &nbsp;German spelling bees would therefore be quite staggeringly dull :-)</p>
<p>There are a few exceptions in German, but not sufficient to make a competition out of it. &nbsp;There are also some historical exceptions &#8212; stuff like the towns of Soest and Oer-Erckenschwich, which have a &quot;Westf&#228;lisches Dehnungs-E&quot; (see <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehnungszeichen" rel="nofollow">http://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dehnungszeichen</a> ) and aren&#8217;t pronounced as you&#8217;d expect.</p>

		<p>The last time chiaroscuro came up I was talking with my wife about a word we had both mislearned from context: coruscating. &nbsp;When we got over that, I suddenly felt a great need for a word describing flashes of blackness, and &lt;i&gt;coruscuro&lt;/i&gt; was born.</p>
<p>Hard to see, but worth lighting a candle in the darkness for.<br /></p>

		<p>Xan: myself, I never learned the difference between p&#233;sca and p&#232;sca, despite the frustrated efforts of an otherwise successful middle school teacher :-) I consider them homophones and disambiguate on the context. All in all, it&#8217;s the kind of rules that are worth losing in a language, to make it more &quot;user friendly&quot;. Five vowels ought to be enough for everybody :-)</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
