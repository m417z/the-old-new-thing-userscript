<p>Commenters Mick and Nick (you guys ever considered teaming up and forming a morning radio show?) are <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/26/9445006.aspx#9448035"> interested in the life story of the <code>Switch&shy;To&shy;This&shy;Window</code> function</a>.</p>
<p> The <code>Switch&shy;To&shy;This&shy;Window</code> was originally added in enhanced mode Windows&nbsp;3.0 in order to support switching out of fullscreen MS-DOS sessions. Recall that enhanced mode Windows&nbsp;3.0 was actually three operating systems in one: There was a 32-bit virtual machine manager, and inside one virtual machine ran a copy of standard-mode Windows,&sup1; and inside all the others ran a copy of MS-DOS. This mean that when you pressed a key when in an MS-DOS session, the keyboard interrupt went to the MS-DOS program and not to Windows. </p>
<p> When you pressed <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>, some crazy magic had to happen. The virtual machine manager had to "un-press" the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key in the MS-DOS program, then synchronize the shift states of the Windows virtual machine to match the one from the MS-DOS virtual machine. (For example, if you had the shift key down in the MS-DOS virtual machine, it had to simulate pressing the shift key in the Windows virtual machine so they two shift states were back in sync.) And then it could simulate pressing the <kbd>Tab</kbd> key, at which point the Windows virtual machine would see the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> sequence and put up the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> interface. </p>
<p> That's how things worked if you were running in a windowed MS-DOS session. But if you were in a fullscreen MS-DOS session, things worked differently. Switching back to Windows would mean a display mode reset (which can take a second or longer), and then all the applications on your desktop had to redraw themselves (and probably paging quite a bit in order to do so). This definitely failed to meet the responsiveness people expected from <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>, so the virtual machine manager pulled a trick: If you pressed <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> while in a fullscreen MS-DOS session, then instead of switching back to the Windows virtual machine, the virtual machine manager displayed a text-mode version of the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> interface. </p>
<p> I will stop to let the craziness of that sink in: The virtual machine manager had its own <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> interface built out of text mode. </p>
<p> Anyway, when you finally released the <kbd>Alt</kbd> key and completed the <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> sequence, the virtual machine manager needed to tell Windows, "Hey, like, pretend that an <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> thingie just happened, okay?" </p>
<p> That is what the <code>Switch&shy;To&shy;This&shy;Window</code> function was for. It was the function the virtual machine manager called to tell Windows to switch to a window as if the user had selected it via <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> (because that is, in fact, what the user did, just via the text-mode interface rather than the graphical one). </p>
<p> A similar thing happened <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2009.03.windowsconfidential.aspx"> if you pressed <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd></a> (or <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd> in a fullscreen MS-DOS session. That's why there's a second parameter to indicate whether the switch should be done "in the style of <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd>" or "in the style of <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd>." </p>
<p> The function was undocumented because it existed only for the virtual machine manager to call in order to coordinate its actions with Windows user interface so that you had one big happy <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> family. </p>
<p> The text-mode <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Tab</kbd> interface disappeared in Windows&nbsp;95, but the <code>Switch&shy;To&shy;This&shy;Window</code> function hung around because it wasn't causing anybody any harm, and there was at the time no formal process in place to deprecate and eventually remove an API, not even an internal undocumented one. </p>
<p> In the Windows&nbsp;XP SP1 timeframe, a bunch of lawyers decided that some functions in Windows needed to be documented. The precise rules for determining which functions needed to be documented and which didn't need to be documented were rather complicated. (Some people applied an algorithm different from the ones those lawyers used and came up with a list of functions that are "missing", when all that they really came up with is a list of functions different from the list those lawyers came up with.)&sup2; </p>
<p> Anyway, the <code>Switch&shy;To&shy;This&shy;Window</code> function got caught in the dragnet, so it got documented. Mind you, like it says right at the top of the documentation, there is no guarantee that the function will continue to exist; it can vanish at any time. Although there is documentation, it has the logical status of an internal function, and internal functions have a tendency to change or vanish entirely. Perhaps someday a new chapter will be added to the life story of <code>Switch&shy;To&shy;This&shy;Window</code>: "The <code>Switch&shy;To&shy;This&shy;Window</code> was removed in Windows&nbsp;Q" for some value of&nbsp;Q. </p>
<p> <b>Footnotes</b> </p>
<p> &sup1; Not true, but true enough. Don't make me bring back the Nitpicker's Corner. </p>
<p> &sup2; I will delete any comments on the subject of the algorithm by which those lawyers determined which functions needed to be documented, or on the documentation itself. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: As far as I can determine, <code>Switch&shy;To&shy;This&shy;Window</code> just does a <code>Set&shy;Foreground&shy;Window</code> on the window you're switching to, possibly posting it a <code>WM_<wbr>SYS&shy;COMMAND</wbr></code>/<code>SC_<wbr>RESTORE</wbr></code> message, and moving the previous foreground window to the bottom of the Z-order if switched via <kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>Esc</kbd>. It doesn't provide any special secret sauce for bypassing the normal foreground activation rules. The process that calls <code>Switch&shy;To&shy;This&shy;Window</code> still requires foreground-change permission. </p>

		<p>That&#39;s really interesting. I don&#39;t remember the text-version of Alt-Tab back when I used Windows 3.1. Then again, I probably didn&#39;t know about Alt-Tab way back then either!</p>

<p>Might be virtual machine manager mentioned in the post still be around in some form?</p>

		<p>I remember the text mode switcher&#8230; As I recall, the old MS-DOS Shell program seemed to use the same switcher. &nbsp;At least, it looked the same&#8230; &nbsp;Seemed fast enough, although I thought it odd that there was a difference.</p>
<p>I love these posts that reflect on decisions that date back to the pre-Win32 days. &nbsp;It&#39;s interesting stuff!</p>

		<p>(absent-mindedly clicked Post before I was done&#8230;)</p>
<p>&quot;although I thought it odd that there was a difference&quot; between the graphical task switcher and text mode task switcher &#8211; i.e. why the text mode switcher had to exist</p>

		<p>Back when I was on Windows 3 I was using a 286 so I was in Standard Mode. I remember atext-mode switcher here too but I assume the implementation was pretty different despite the similar UI&#8230;</p>

		<p>I, too, remember the text mode switcher fondly. Back then, I ran many MS-DOS applications, and sometimes I used Windows solely as a multitasking engine to let me quickly switch between DOS programs (ah! the good old days of text-mode editors and command line compilers!). Then I switched to NT 4. It went off smoothly (I had 16 MB of RAM), but if/when something crashed, the system itself kept up.</p>

		<p>There are now three Alt-Tabs in Windows now. One you get with Aero whose previews are hard to make out due to small size of thumbnails, then the ugly gray one which you get if you disable the Aero one and the beautiful one but with classic Alt-Tab style present only in Vista/Windows 7 Home Basic/Starter. Can you forward my request to replace the ugly gray Alt-Tab with the nicer blue one?

		<p>I think that one of the lesson to be learnt from this, is that you have to be careful when designing a system to make it impossible for â€˜normalâ€™ applications to call internal functions, even if that function cannot do any harm.</p>

		<p>@xpclient: I don&#39;t understand what you&#39;re asking. &nbsp;If you select the &quot;Windows 7 Basic&quot; theme you get the blue alt+tab, and if you select the &quot;Windows Classic&quot; theme you get the old gray one.</p>

		<p>@Brian, there is a registry value using which you can keep Aero on and yet use Classic Alt Tab if it suits you better.</p>
<p>Windows Registry Editor Version 5.00</p>
<p>[HKEY_CURRENT_USERSoftwareMicrosoftWindowsCurrentVersionExplorer]</p>
<p>&quot;AltTabSettings&quot;=dword:00000001</p>
<p>I find the Classic Alt Tab more usable than the Aero Alt-Tab but ugly especially when the blue Alt-Tab already exists.</p>

		<p>The &quot;blue&quot; alt tab is themed (Vista Basic). If you use classic mode, that means no theme, and no &quot;blue&quot; alt tab.</p>

		<p>That reminded me of cycling through NLM screens on a NetWare console back in the 4.11 days &#8230; ahh, nostalgia. (3.12 in a lot of places, in fact, although I had a 4.11 machine to support our trial deployment of Windows NT 4 on the desktop&#8230;) Presumably the function was left in Windows 95 because it was impossible to be certain nothing relied on it somewhere, and safer to leave it in place for the time being &#8230; and of course a few seconds of web searching now brings up pages where people are indeed talking about using it, so no chance of safely removing it now.</p>
<p>@ERock: I imagine Raymond used a regex, or other search and replace method, to mark them all up in a few seconds at the end of editing.</p>

		<p>@Grijan: I used DOSShell back for this then, although my uncle had installed Win3.1 for me, it&#39;s considered a bit too heavy for my 4MB RAM machine. Usually the only Windows programs I run at that time were winmine.exe, sol.exe, plus Turbo Pascal for Windows 1.5 for homework.</p>

		<p>This raises more interesting questions: like &quot;Does this mean that the virtual machine manager had to keep track of the current windows and their z-order?&quot; and &quot;How did the virtual machine manager call Windows functions, anyway &#8211; was there a stub Windows process running to perform these calls?&quot;</p>

		<p>&quot;Not true, but true enough. Don&#39;t make me bring back the Nitpicker&#39;s Corner. &quot;</p>
<p>Why are you threatening us with the Nitpicker&#39;s Corner for asking about this issue (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/05/17/10013609.aspx" rel="nofollow">blogs.msdn.com/&#8230;/10013609.aspx</a>) instead of explaining it once and linking it everywhere?</p>

		<p>Bonus bonus chatter:</p>
<p>As far as I was able to tell some time ago when I looked at it, SwitchToThisWindow basically calls SetForegroundWindow.</p>
<p>If you pass TRUE as the restore flag, then it deiconises the window. (But it doesn&#39;t change a maximised window.)</p>
<p>If you pass FALSE as the restore flag, then the previous foreground window gets sent to the back of the z-order. However the window does not lose its topmost state. (I don&#39;t think there&#39;s an API that does this for topmost windows.)</p>

		<p>Mike Caron stated:</p>
<p>&quot;That&#39;s really interesting. I don&#39;t remember the text-version of Alt-Tab back when I used Windows 3.1. Then again, I probably didn&#39;t know about Alt-Tab way back then either!&quot;</p>
<p>From memory (and it may not be perfect memory &#8211; there&#39;s been quite a lot of alcohol ingested since those days), you wouldn&#39;t have seen the text interface unless you were in full-screen DOS mode. And, if you *were* in that mode, I don&#39;t think there was any other way back to Windows so you would have *had* to know about it.</p>
<p>Standard disclaimers: I&#39;ve been wrong before, I&#39;ll be wrong again. Just ask my wife :-)</p>

		<p>JustSomeGuy: The way most people left full screen mode was probably just by exiting the DOS program they were running. Alt-Tab has always been sort of a power-user feature.</p>

		<p>@Gabe: I remember that once upon a time, I decided the proper way to run fullscreen DOS program in Windows is to write a stub program that calls ExitWindowExec() <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/147806" rel="nofollow">support.microsoft.com/&#8230;/147806</a> . I lost track of how this function becomes nowadays, a brief search seems to show that people abuse it as a way to restart Windows.</p>
<p>Don&#39;t know what it happens to later Windows now, my company machine is still using WinXP so I can&#39;t check.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
