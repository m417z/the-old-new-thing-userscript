<p>Hacker News member <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/user?id=citizenlow">citizenlow</a> recalls the time <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=4782531"> I went over after hours to help out the Money team debug a nasty kernel issue</a>. They were running into mysterious crashes during their stress testing and asked for my help in debugging it.</p>
<p> I helped out other teams quite a bit, like <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2005/11/14/492483.aspx"> writing a new version of Dr. Watson for the Windows&nbsp;98 team</a> or <a href="https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/Defrag-Tools/Defrag-Tools-5-Autoruns#time=04m50s"> writing a new version of the MSConfig tool based on a sketch on a bar napkin</a>. And for a time, I followed the official policy for moonlighting to make sure everybody understood that I was doing work outside the boundaries of my official job duties. </p>
<p> When the Money folks asked me for help, I told them that before I could help them, they would have to help me fill out some paperwork. </p>
<ul>
<li>Who will you be working for? Microsoft Corporation. </li>
<li>Where will you be doing the work?     Office XX/YYYY on Microsoft Redmond Campus. </li>
<li>When will the work begin and end?     Begin on YYYY/MM/DD at 5pm, ending YYYY/MM/DD at 11pm. </li>
<li>How much will you be paid for this work? </li>
</ul>
<p> The Money folks were not sure how to answer that last question, since they didn't have any formal budget or procedures for hiring an outside consultant, much less any procedures for hiring one <i>from inside the company</i>. </p>
<p> I told them, "Just write <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/01/11/10255331.aspx"> <i>One slice of pizza</i></a>." </p>
<p> Nobody from the Personnel department seemed to notice the odd circumstances of this moonlighting request; they simply rubber-stamped it and put it in my file. </p>
<p> The crash, it turns out, was in Windows itself. There was a bug in the <a href="http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/2008.09.windowsconfidential.aspx"> special compiler the Languages team produced to help build certain components of Windows&nbsp;95</a> which resulted in an incorrect address computation under a particularly convoluted boundary condition. The Money folks had merely stumbled across this bug as part of their regular testing. I notified the appropriate people, and the Windows team applied a workaround in their code to tickle the compiler into generating the correct code. </p>
<p> As I recall, the pizza was just fine. It was just your average delivery pizza, nothing gourmet or anything. Not that it had to be, because <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/01/1184734.aspx"> I wasn't there for the pizza</a>. </p>

		<p>Acceptable forms of payment for me:</p>
<p>1) Money (or gift cards for alcohol)</p>
<p>2) Alcohol (preferably craft beer but good spirits as well)</p>
<p>3) Food</p>
<p>Computer equipment used to be on the list but that got removed over a decade ago. I just don&#39;t have any interest in the stuff anymore.</p>

		<p>I was half-expecting the punchline to be an auditor showing up on your doorstep years down the line saying, &quot;We have here a form that says you were paid one slice of pizza for your work on MS Money; can you prove that you paid all appropriate taxes on this income?&quot;</p>

		<p>@Simon Farnsworth:</p>
<p>My answer to the tax auditor: This results in a maximum difference of income of about 2 dollars which is much less than the 50 dollar steps in the tax table. Since the necessary records don&#39;t exist [no 1099] and the balance of probabilities is no difference, go away.</p>

		<p>I found it a little bit dumb to have to fill in official paperworks in order to work for another team in the same company, but than remember that Microsoft have been splitted into multiple entities.</p>

		<p>@cheong00: Well, my objects too have to fill in lots of book-keeping structures to work in another part of the program, which is a little bit dumb because it&#39;s the same program, but then I remember that the program has been split into multiple modules.</p>

		<p>I rather like the irony of Raymond, presumably on the Windows team at the time, doing paperwork and getting permission to go and help the Money team &#8230; on what turned out to be a Windows problem in the first place. Maybe the Money team should have filed for reimbursement of the pizza from the Windows team budget?</p>
<p>(Presumably, Money still had to find a workaround of some sort, or wait for a Windows patch then add code to make sure the patch was installed? I recall a frustrating day or two where a program of mine was triggering a BugCheck on Windows 2000 &#8211; which eventually turned out to be the fault of the filter driver in the anti-virus program I was using at the time. I gave up on that bit of code, on the basis I&#39;d never be able to guarantee that buggy AV code, or something equivalent, wasn&#39;t running on users&#39; machines in future.)</p>
<p>I was half-expecting the Personnel department to lay claim to a slice of pizza for themselves to cover overheads &#8211; or send someone to check Raymond didn&#39;t eat a second slice, since that would mean going 100% over budget.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
