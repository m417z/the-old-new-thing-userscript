<p>
Last year, I shared
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2015/08/24/10637017.aspx">
the ship date predictor</a>.
My colleague who created the chart
contacted me last year
and told me what happened when he tried to apply
the ship date predictor to subsequent projects.
</p>
<p>
He discovered that "the rules for Windows 95 didn't carry over,
so my nomination for the Nobel Prize in Project Management was
withdrawn."
He did find, interestingly,
that each management team had its own consistent scheduling errors,
so the chart was useful only in retrospect,
revealing each management team's individual error ratio.
</p>
<p>
My colleague continued tracking the data until the late 2000's,
at which time scheduling became more accurate and the
exercise became uninteresting.
</p>
<p>
Happy 21st birthday, Windows 95.
</p>
<p>
<b>Bonus chatter</b>:
My colleague also looked up the career of the person
who wrote "Otherwise, I'll be applying for a job at McDonalds."
According to LinkedIn, that person left Microsoft in 2000
and now works at another major technology company.
(Not McDonalds.)</p>

		<p>I expect that McDonald&#8217;s has a very large engineering department.  They spend a lot of money on logistics and industrial engineering.  Consider all the planning that probably went into rolling out all day breakfast (re-jigging kitchens and kitchen processes, figuring out how to store the food, getting the supplies to the stores, etc.)  Like airlines, retailers and Uber, someone like McDonald&#8217;s spends *a lot* of money on technology.</p>

		<p>Congrats Raymond!  It&#8217;s hard to remember now how exciting Windows 95 was, especially for people like myself whose first taste of Windows had been &#8220;Ami Pro with Windows/286&#8221;.</p>
<p>Truly a marvel of engineering to be done in the days before standardized unit tests, standardized version control, standardized continuous integration&#8230; but I suspect this type of work helped pioneer it.  The state of the art with CVS was pretty bad back then.</p>

		<p>On the contrary, I remember that Win3.1 did ship with another version of EMM386.EXE, that they told you to use it instead of the one shipped with DOS in order to load Windows. I don&#8217;t know what was fixed in there, or whether if it was a new version.</p>

		<p>Raymond, congrats on the 21st birthday of Win95!  I am still amazed at the work that went it that allowed it to be functional in such a small memory space.  Add in the fact that it was great on backwards compatibility, and it is easy to see why it was such a winner in the marketplace.</p>

		<p>It looks like your colleague discovered the principle behind agile methods using story points instead of time estimates. At the end of a sprint you retrospectively look at how long each task really took compared to its point value. This tends to be fairly consistent and can then be used to make future predictions, much like how each team had a reasonably consistent error ratio.</p>

		<p>21 years, wow.. I feel so old.</p>
<p>Someone asked the question on the old predictor thread, but it wasn&#8217;t answered. If RTM had happened in 1993 or 1994, then what would it have been called?</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
