Last year, we learned that
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2004/05/31/144893.aspx">
the ANSI code page isn't actually ANSI</a>.
Indeed, the OEM code page isn't actually OEM either.
</p>
<p>
Back in the days of MS-DOS, there was only one code page,
namely, the code page that was provided by the
original equipment manufacturer
in the form of glyphs embedded in the character generator
on the video card.
When Windows came along,
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/03/08/389527.aspx">
the so-called ANSI code page was introduced</a>
and the name "OEM" was used to refer to the MS-DOS code page.
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/michkap/archive/2005/02/08/369197.aspx">
Michael Kaplan went into more detail earlier this year
on the ANSI/OEM split</a>.
</p>
<p>
Over the years, Windows has relied less and less on the character
generator embedded in the video card, to the point where the
term "OEM character set" no longer has anything to do with the
original equipment manufacturer.
It is just a convenient term to refer to "the character set used
by MS-DOS and console programs."
Indeed, if you take a machine running US-English Windows
(<a HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/oem/437.htm">OEM code page 437</a>) and install,
say, Japanese Windows,
then when you boot into Japanese Windows,
you'll find that you now have
<a HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/globaldev/reference/dbcs/932.htm">
an OEM code page of 932</a>.</p>

		<p>Great! I&#8217;ve always wondered why Microsoft uses the terms &quot;ANSI&quot; and &quot;OEM&quot;, seemingly ignoring the fine registry at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets" rel="nofollow">http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets</a></p>
<p>Could you also please explain where the term &quot;code page&quot; came from? I find it a bit confusing, and prefer &quot;character set&quot; and &quot;character encoding&quot; as defined by the W3C at <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.w3.org/International/resource-index" rel="nofollow">http://www.w3.org/International/resource-index</a><br /></p>

		<p>Code Page is a term that IBM adopted for PC-DOS 3.3 when they ported their NLS system from their mainframes to PC-DOS (IBM did all the development work for PC-DOS 3.3 and PC-DOS 4.0).</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not sure where IBM got the phrase from.<br /></p>

		<p>For Christoffer:<br />
<br />&gt;&gt; prefer &quot;character set&quot; and &quot;character encoding&quot;</p>
<p>Code page is not mean the same thing with &quot;character set&quot; or &quot;character encoding&quot; (which are also not the same).<br />
<br />Code page matches &quot;coded character set&quot; in the UNIX world.<br />
<br />You can talk about the &quot;Latin script&quot; or &quot;Cyrillic character set&quot;. This is the collection of characters, no numbers associated. Mac and Windows can use different char-to-number mappings (code pages/coded character sets) for the same character set (charset).<br />
<br />This is why for a font you select the charset.<br />
<br />Once you map characters to numeric values, it becomes a &quot;coded character set&quot; (or code page).<br />
<br />Then you might have several ways to represent the same code page. These are &quot;encodings&quot;. UTF-7, UTF-8, UTF-16, UTF-32, &quot;Java escaped (u3213)&quot;, MIME, Base-64 can be are different encodings of the same coded character set. Same as decimal, hex, binary, octal, are different representations for the same number.<br />
<br />For a long time the Unicode Consortium confused &quot;coded character set&quot; with &quot;encoding&quot;, now they are starting to fix it.<br /></p>

<br />Yes. Seems &quot;country.sys&quot; and &quot;nlsfunc&quot; command is avaliable only after MSDOS 3.3.</p>

		<p>Does anyone know why Japanese DOS uses the yen sign as the path separator rather than forward slash?</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
