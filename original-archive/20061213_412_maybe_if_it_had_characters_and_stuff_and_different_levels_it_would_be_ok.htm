		<p>I don&#8217;t think Tetris was ever really intended for kids aged 9-12. It was always more of an adult time-waster.</p>

		<p>My daughter (age 9) likes Tetris as much as I did as a kid. &nbsp;It&#8217;s a classic game that really never gets old. &nbsp;In fact, she&#8217;s actually playing my original Gameboy cartrage from 1989 on her new Gameboy Advance SP &#8212; the wonders of backwards compatibility.</p>
<p>But honestly, even I find older games boring. &nbsp;Just like I find older TV boring. &nbsp;We&#8217;ve really created a generation of &quot;smarter&quot; children who need more than we had in the past to hold their interests.</p>

<p>Don&#8217;t you mean short attention span product junkies? I still remember back when cable was new, they had a show on one of the networks called short attention span theatre.</p>
<p>Anyway, outdoor things should still work to hold their attention &#8211; skiing hasn&#8217;t changed that much on the time I&#8217;ve been around (ignoring the new skis)</p>

		<p>AlmostAlive,</p>
<p>My 10 year old daughter loves tetris, too. &nbsp;She has it on her cell phone, and is begging for a copy of it for DS.</p>
<p>I constantly marvel at old game paradigm vs. new game paradigm. &nbsp;The old model was &quot;Simple, easy, every level looks the same, clever ideas.&quot;</p>
<p>Now it&#8217;s &quot;Huge, Complex, multiple distinct levels, graphics!graphics!graphics.&quot;</p>
<p>Not that the ideas still aren&#8217;t clever&#8230;but it amazes me how much I can still lose an afternoon running from Flaming Sentient Barrels when I get on a donky kong kick. &nbsp;Of course, I can also lose an afternoon sitting on top of a tall building sniping pedestrians and throwing explosives at the police when I play Grand Theft Auto.</p>

		<p>Aren&#8217;t the comments just indicative of the fact that the kids are used to the general mechanic of these types of puzzle games, and have played ones that have been souped up a bit.</p>
<p>From what I&#8217;ve seen, websites like miniclip.com are quite popular with the young&#8217;ns, and their version of Tetris does exactly what the kid wanted: there are blocks that can remove other blocks. It even &#8216;blows&#8217; them off the screen.</p>
<p>I just think it&#8217;s a little hard to expect 9 to 12 years olds to have enough of a sense of history to hold reverence toward a game, especially when they are already familiar with its genre. And I reject that it&#8217;s anything to do with rising complexity in games, or the fact they were &quot;modern kids&quot;.</p>
<p>All that said, yeah, it&#8217;s pretty funny.</p>

		<p>FYI, it&#8217;s Electronic Gaming Monthly.</p>
<p>I never found those articles very believable. &nbsp;I&#8217;m not saying that they were rigged or anything, but I think the kids were deliberately going for attention at times.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s a classic EGM article there; the second one just doesn&#8217;t compare to the first one, though. &nbsp;Maybe they got kids that didn&#8217;t get bored as easily the second time around.</p>

		<p>Comments such as &quot;Becky: It&#8217;s Zeus. He&#8217;s taking you to the Acropolis&quot; and &quot;The score is tied. This &nbsp;is so exhiliarating!&quot; make me doubt the veracity of the first article. I mean, that&#8217;s a lot of vocabulary for 12 year olds.</p>

		<p>It is true that kids have changed. &nbsp;I collected Wacky Packages as a kid. &nbsp;These were parodies of everyday products. &nbsp;They have released four new series for the kids of today. &nbsp;I tried turning my son onto these, but they just didn&#8217;t grab his attention. &nbsp;The online games he plays (Runescape, etc.) is much more interactive and what kids look for today. &nbsp;Marvel has a device that scans the trading cards and provides special abilities for the video game player. &nbsp;It is a clever way of &quot;marrying&quot; the two. &nbsp;I had actually thought of the same idea, but obviously someone beat me to it. &nbsp;I really love parody. &nbsp;Silly Supermarket Stickers compete with Wacky Packages. &nbsp;Silly Supermarket Stickers are sold at <a href="http://www.sillysupermarket.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.sillysupermarket.com</a>. &nbsp;Here are a couple good examples:</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
