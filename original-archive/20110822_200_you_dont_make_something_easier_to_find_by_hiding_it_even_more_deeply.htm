		<p>I agree, its already difficult to explain to some people, what you mean with &quot;an empty space&quot; if you want someone right clicking on an empty spot on the desktop to get the context menu there. :)</p>

		<p>I&#39;d expect that the right-click would be in addition to the double-left-click. Some people will randomly left-double-click, while others will randomly right-single-click. By having both options, you are more likely to get both sets of people.</p>
<p>Honestly, though, the &quot;tiny footprint&quot; mode should probably only work for the graph tabs. That way it&#39;s all empty space and anywhere you click you&#39;d be able to get back to normal mode.</p>

		<p>From many Microsoft products (Office, at least before ribbon UI) I learnt that often right-clicking on nothing allows to reach some hidden stuff.</p>
<p>That is why I think, rolfhub&#39;s solution would be rather intuitive and would not bother smarter users win unnecessary buttons.</p>

		<p>Erm, how does adding an additional way to find something make that thing harder to find?</p>
<p>&quot;Who right-clicks on nothing?&quot;</p>
<p>More people than double-click nothing, I imagine, given that double-clicking nothing brings up context menus throughout the Windows OS&#8230;</p>
<div class="post">[<i>Let&#39;s try that again. Who right-clicks on nothing <span style="text-decoration:underline;">in a dialog box</span>? Pretty much no dialog boxes respond to right-click on background. There is no reasonable expectation that Task Manager would be different. (The people who doublee-clicked nothing didn&#39;t do it on purpose. They did it by mistake, and consequently don&#39;t even realize that they even did it.) -Raymond</i>]&lt;/DIV</div>

		<p>Why was the extremely useful Shutdown menu removed from Task Manager? Now if the shell crashes and is stuck in a crash loop or everything else besides the Task Manager starts to hang, we have to use shutdown.exe from its File menu -&gt; New task, something Joe Average is very unlikely to know or try. The Windows team sure likes to &quot;fool around&quot; with the UI and yank stuff randomly.</p>

		<p>&quot;Why was the extremely useful Shutdown menu removed from Task Manager? &quot;</p>
<p>Wow, that disappeared around the time our IT group was turning the thumbscrews with group policy stuff. &nbsp;I always figured our IT group intentionally removed that the same way they removed Run from the start menu to make it painfully tricky to actually execute an arbitrary program. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I guess I never realized it was removed from the OS itself.</p>

		<p>Well I can speak only for myself and if I remember correctly (been some time) I pretty much rightclicked around for some time before stumbling upon the doubleclick behavior when this feature &quot;happened&quot; to me back to XP times.</p>

		<p>I think a right click menu would be helpful too. The first time I did this it was an accident, and double clicking a window to get that (or similar) behavior is not a common practice. I had to google the problem before I learned about the double click. Now, should right click be implemented before the million other more important things I&#39;m sure Microsoft has on the to-do list? Probably not. It was a stupid design decision to have the feature in the first place and maybe they will silently remove it in future versions.</p>
<p>@SimonRev</p>
<p>I love when computer admins mess with machines in weird ways like this. The university I went too removed the &#39;Run&#39; option from the start menu, but Windows+R still worked.</p>

		<p>What do you mean &quot;an empty space&quot;? Is the video section of a media player in full screen an &quot;empty space&quot;? Because that&#39;s exactly where you would right-click to exit from the full screen (if you are bored reaching the keyboard to ESC). I don&#39;t know about you, but the first thing I would try is right-clicking that area just like I do in many &quot;fullscreenable&quot; apps.</p>

		<p>Mazzter, thanks for that tip. That option should have been in the menu.</p>
<p>Oddly, it seems that the labels aren&#39;t big enough. On my computer it now says ‘ume con’ instead of ‘Volume control’ even though there&#39;s plenty space left.</p>

		<p>@xpclient: I believe whether &quot;Shutdown&quot; menu of Task Manager exist is depending on whether you joined domain (or have &quot;Welcome screen&quot; enabled) as in WinXP.</p>

		<p>I don&#39;t really understand the criticism. &nbsp;It&#39;d seem like a strict improvement if it were done in addition to the current, confusing double-click behavior. &nbsp;Would there be even better, more discoverable ways? &nbsp;Sure.</p>
<p>As for who right-clicks, I&#39;ve seen user tests where people start randomly right-clicking out of desperation since that&#39;s sort of inadvertently been trained to do when they can&#39;t find something they&#39;re looking for. (Also, right-clicking on the Task Manager&#39;s taskbar entry while in Tiny Footprint Mode does nothing, whereas in normal mode it shows the typical system context menu. &nbsp;If that were fixed, then a menu item could have been added there, and then users could be right-clicking on *something*. &nbsp;Granted, not many people would know to right-click there either.)</p>

		<p>Hmm, if I had dictatorial control over all aspects of the shell, I&#39;d just get rid of tiny footprint mode entirely or at the very least make it a lot harder to enable.

		<p>Right-click solution has its flaws, but it&#39;s definitely more intuitive than double-clicking. People right-click stuff all the time when they want to act on something. They&#39;re used to this.</p>
<p>(And no, Raymond, people have no idea that dialog boxes usually lack right-click menu. They don&#39;t even know what&#39;s a &quot;dialog box&quot; and how it&#39;s different from other windows. They&#39;ll just try right-clicking on it because who knows, it might work. Sometimes it works.)</p>

		<p>Wheel click FTW. Use it all the time to start new instances of apps from windows7 quick launch area (aka pinned apps). Using shift click to start apps usually results in the app starts at bottom of z order &#8211; thus a useless features.</p>

		<p>Sometimes I really wonder how Microsoft got to be so successful. Is there seriously anyone there with any real intelligence any more?</p>
<p>Adding a context menu is not making it harder to find. It&#39;s adding ANOTHER way to find something that&#39;s already hard to find.</p>
<p>More to the point &#8211; why have this stupid hidden feature in the first place? I don&#39;t think I&#39;ve ever wanted task manager in &quot;tiny footprint&quot; mode at all, and if I did, I&#39;d probably look for that option in a context menu before thinking &quot;oh yeah, double-click will be the way to do it&quot;.</p>
<p>If so many people are double-clicking accidentally, maybe the double-click option shouldn&#39;t be there in the first place.</p>

<p>&quot;Usually, it&#39;s not an intentional double-click&quot;</p>
<p>Ah, ok. Indeed, that is probably how i found it years ago. But, it was pretty obvious the double-click did it.</p>
<p>I have double-clicked when i didn&#39;t mean to. But once i did, i knew i did it. Is mistaken double-clicking really not that noticeable?</p>
<div class="post">[<i>An accidental double-click often occurs when you intend to single-click. You click once, wait, then click again since you think the first one didn&#39;t work. Boom, unintentional double-click. (There&#39;s another class of users who don&#39;t know how to single-click; they always double-click. Like how toddlers forget how to walk; they always run.) -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>Sometimes accidental double-clicks happen just because of a flaky mouse button switch. In that case, the user doesn&#39;t even know that they clicked twice!</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
