<p>We interrupt this program for a word from Microsoft Press.</p>
<p> A few months ago, I noted that <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2012/05/17/10306079.aspx"> Charles Petzold is coming back with another edition of Programming Windows</a>, and you could have gotten in on the ground floor and <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/microsoft_press/archive/2012/04/21/mark-your-calendars-programming-windows-sixth-edition-is-coming.aspx"> ordered your copy for only $10</a> which included access to all prerelease versions. </p>
<p> Well, the book has reached Release Preview, which means that the sticker price has increased to $30, so if you missed your chance earlier, you can at least get your order in before it goes up to $40 on August 28 and before it reaches its final price of $50 on November 15. And as with the people who acted quickly, your $30 order includes access to the Release Preview and the Final version. </p>

		<p>I wonder when they&#39;ll get around to notifying people those of us who bought it at the time that there&#39;s a new release. &nbsp;So far all I&#39;m getting from them is ads.</p>

		<p>O&#39;Reilly got an email from them yesterday, notifying me that the book had been updated.</p>
<p>They also sent me an ad today. &nbsp;If you got one but not the other, you may have checked the wrong box when attempting to unsubscribe from the ads.</p>

		<p>The UI Previously Known As Metro is not absolutely my cup of tea, but for $10 you couldn&#39;t go wrong picking up the book. I don&#39;t anticipate doing a lot of Metro development, but if I do want to give it a try it will be nice to have the book on hand.</p>

<p>It&#39;s also all in C#. &nbsp;That&#39;s great and all, but I still develop in C++ to Win32 for most things since we do high-perf graphics apps.</p>
<p>Yeah, not been impressed thus far with Win8&#39;s approach. &nbsp;I think it looks fine on a tablet or phone, but is a terrible model for desktop usage where you DO want more than one app open at a time to cut/paste between and have multiple data sources open at once. &nbsp;That and 3D games, and likely most high-perf graphics apps will simply not be re-written for metro. &nbsp;I just don&#39;t see Adobe/et al spending tons of money and time to metro-ize their apps for uncertain market benefit. &nbsp;Wait and see.</p>

		<p>Worse than that, when I tried to buy it the lead-in page says &quot;now $30&quot; but adding it to my cart it&#39;s $50. And their buy 2 get a third free discount code appears to give a random amount off (three books at $16/$18/$23 and the total discount is $26&#8230; even if there&#39;s a $20 discount for Petzold that doesn&#39;t add up). Not willing to chance my credit card details.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
