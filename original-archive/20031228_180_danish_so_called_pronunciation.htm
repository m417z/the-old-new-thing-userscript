<p>Of course my real goal in studying German and Swedish is eventually to have all of Denmark surrounded. (After Swedish, the next most likely nearby targets are&nbsp;Norwegian and Dutch.)</p>
<p>All I know about Denmark I learned from Swedes. Well, if you don't count one Danish co-worker, who moved back to Denmark several years ago. The Swedes tell me, "The Danes would be so much easier to understand if they would only take the hot potato out of their mouth before they started talking." (Two Swedes have told me that Danish sounds "drunk".)</p>
<p>I thought this was just friendly Scandinavian pick-on-your-neighbor-ism until I actually listened to some Danish closely.</p>
<p>Believe it or not, the odd collection of sounds that comes out of their mouths (1)&nbsp;counts as a language, and (2)&nbsp;is comprehensible to other Danes. Listen for yourself: <a href="http://www.speakdanish.dk/html/pronunciation_intro.htm">R&oslash;dgr&oslash;d med fl&oslash;de</a>. That "soft d" I will never, ever learn to pronounce properly. It appears to requires the use of throat muscles that most people are content to use only for swallowing.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.geocities.com/tsca.geo/dansk/dkwymowa.html">This site has a longer sample of Danish speech</a>. You thought swallowing a word was just a figure of speech? Check out the pronunciation of Sverigesf&aelig;rgen which sounds to me something like "Svesf&aelig;n".</p>
<p>Okay, now that I've publically made fun of Danish, my punishment will probably be that I will be called upon to study it seriously at some point.</p>

		<p>&#8216;Two Swedes have told me that Danish sounds &quot;drunk&quot;&#8217;</p>
<p>This is because most Swedes who are in Denmark are drunk &#8211; due to their own restrictive alcohol laws (or because we are nice enough to bring alcohol to Sweden when we visit &#8211; part of the big &#8216;plan&#8217;).</p>
<p>We sound drunk, but in fact it is the Swedes (and Norweigians) who are drunk.</p>

		<p>Ah, yes, &#216;resundsbron.  A beautiful bridge, I must say. Before the bridge, Swedes would take the ferry across, get drunk, and take the ferry home. But now that there&#8217;s a bridge, they can simply drive home. Much more convenient.</p>

		<p>But they have Lego Land! That was the coolest thing in the world when I was ~5 years old. In fact, I think it would still be great fun even today :-). </p>
<p>Just the other day I was playing with my little brother and we put together a Lego set. As a kid, I always wanted to work at Lego and design all the really cool stuff that you could buy&#8230;<br /></p>

		<p>You must be American, with your little knowledge of Danes. Not only did we gave you Lego but also C++ and C#. Anyhow most Swedes and especially Norwegians can with a little effort understand Danish and visa versa.<br /></p>

		<p>Yeah, but we also gave them Aqua with their Barbie girl, so I guess it is a tie.<br /></p>

		<p>Actually, I had the same discussion with my Swedish girl friend last night &#8212; after eight months I&#8217;m decent in Swedish but she&#8217;s still reluctant to try pronouncing Danish. Don&#8217;t know why but have a look at &lt;a href=&quot;<a target="_new" href="http://aufrecht.org/blog/one-entry?entry%5fid=12193&quot;&gt;Joel" rel="nofollow">http://aufrecht.org/blog/one-entry?entry%5fid=12193&quot;&gt;Joel</a> Aufrecht&#8217;s Learning Danish, Part 1&lt;/a&gt; (I&#8217;m still waiting for the sequel).</p>

		<p>Don&#8217;t feel bad that you can&#8217;t pronounce a &quot;soft d&quot;. English speaking people have trouble pronouncing lots of sounds, which is why in WWII movies they always refer to Hitler as &quot;Derrr Fuuuhrer&quot; with a U.</p>
<p>Germans will know what I&#8217;m talking about.</p>

		<p>Hm.. my previous attempt in replying failed :(</p>
<p>This autumn there was a funny show at the Norwegian TV-channel NRK1 called &quot;Ut i v&#229;r hage&quot;. One episode of the show was about the Danish people not understanding eachother :).</p>
<p>You can watch it at <a target="_new" href="http://www.nrk.no/programmer/tv/uti_var_hage/3069554.html" rel="nofollow">http://www.nrk.no/programmer/tv/uti_var_hage/3069554.html</a><br /></p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
