A customer had a question about the
<code>Reg&shy;Notify&shy;Change&shy;Key&shy;Value</code> function.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q>
<p>
We are using it to monitor the
<code>HKEY_<wbr>CLASSES_<wbr>ROOT</code> tree as follows:
</p>
<pre>
RegNotifyChangeKeyValue(
    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT,
    true, // monitor entire subtree
    REG_NOTIFY_CHANGE_NAME | REG_NOTIFY_CHANGE_LAST_SET,
    eventRegKeyChanged,
    true); // asynchronous mode
</pre>
<p>
If I understand the documentation correctly,
this registers for notifications when subkeys are added,
deleted, or when values are changed.
However, it seems that my event becomes signaled at many
other times,
for example, when I switch folders in an Explorer window.
I fired up Process Monitor and confirmed that nobody (not even
Explorer) is writing to <code>HKEY_<wbr>CLASSES_<wbr>ROOT</code>.
</p>
<p>
Why are we getting spurious notifications?
Have we misunderstood what this function does?
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Everything is working as expected;
it's just that your expectations are wrong.
</p>
<p>
Recall that the
<code>HKEY_<wbr>CLASSES_<wbr>ROOT</code> registry key
is really a
<a HREF="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms724475(v=VS.85).aspx">
combined view of
<code>HKEY_<wbr>LOCAL_<wbr>MACHINE</code> and
<code>HKEY_<wbr>CURRENT_<wbr>USER</code></a>.
Specifically, it is a combined view of
<code>HKEY_<wbr>LOCAL_<wbr>MACHINE\<wbr>Software\<wbr>Classes</code> and
<code>HKEY_<wbr>CURRENT_<wbr>USER\<wbr>Software\<wbr>Classes</code>.
And
<code>HKEY_<wbr>CURRENT_<wbr>USER\<wbr>Software\<wbr>Classes</code>
is itself just an alias for
<code>HKEY_<wbr>USERS\<wbr>&laquo;SID&raquo;_Classes</code>.
Therefore, if you're going to look in
Process Monitor,
you need to be looking at all of those locations to see changes
that eventually get reported as changes in
<code>HKEY_<wbr>CLASSES_<wbr>ROOT</code>.
</p>
<p>
In this particular case, Explorer was making changes to
<code>HKEY_<wbr>USERS\<wbr>&laquo;SID&raquo;_Classes\<wbr>Local Settings</code>,
which shows up as
<code>HKEY_<wbr>CLASSES_<wbr>ROOT\<wbr>Local Settings</code>.
</p>
<p>
Upon receiving this explanation, the customer understood what
was going on, and also remarked that they were going to look to
see if they could register their notification on a location that
isn't quite so broad.</p>

		<p>I still don&#39;t understand, Ray, why you put up with xpclient&#39;s continual habit of being the first person to rate and always rating it a &quot;1-star&quot; (like today, again), not to mention his acerbic comments and troll baiting.</p>
<p>On-topic, you know people are going to wonder what the customer was trying to accomplish, but I&#39;m sure you don&#39;t know, or you would have incorporated it in the story.</p>

		<p>It&#39;s also not an unreasonable assumption that the modifications would have shown up in ProcMon. And they even considered that they might be at fault in the original question (assuming Raymond hasn&#39;t reworded it). There may be hope yet&#8230;</p>
<p>They may have been doing something like having a systray app wait for a COM component to be registered.</p>

		<p>@Brian_EE: I make a point of rating the new article every day now. If enough of us do that it should flood out xpclient&#39;s silliness.</p>
<p>I like the way Codeproject handles ratings. It has a system where statistical outliers are tossed out.</p>

		<p>@Barf: Really, the problem is people who rate something consistently high or low.</p>
<p>The bit that gets me is that if xpclient thinks that every single post by Raymond is cr4p, why does he not just go away and read a different blog? It&#39;s not like there&#39;s a shortage of other stuff to do on the Internets.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
