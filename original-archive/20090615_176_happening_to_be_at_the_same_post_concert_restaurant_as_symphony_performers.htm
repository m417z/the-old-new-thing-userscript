<p>Getting out of the parking garage immediately after the symphony ends is usually a bit of an ordeal, so my symphony group tends to linger downtown for some coffee or dessert, allowing time for the post-symphony traffic jams to clear out. The other night, we went to the <a href="http://www.unionseattle.com/">Union</a> restaurant just a block from Benaroya Hall. (Verdict: Not a good dessert restaurant.)</p>
<p> After we placed our orders, violinists Elisa Barston (my current "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2009/02/03/9392203.aspx">favorite symphony performer</a>") and Mikhail Shmidt came in and were seated at the table next to us. I tried not to stare, but even though I've sat <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/04/11/2079141.aspx"> quite close to Elisa Barston before</a>, this time I was even closer. (There were two other people at their table, but I couldn't tell who they were because they were facing away from me.) </p>
<p> As another coincidence, it was during the concert we had just attended that Mikhail Shmidt dropped his bow. I didn't see it occur; my guess is that it fell off his lap during a pizzicato section. It was during a relatively loud part of the piece so you had to be pretty close to the stage to hear it fall. I heard the clatter, looked over, and saw the violinist calmly bend over and pick it up. He and his standmate played the next few bars with smiles on their faces, clearly amused by the minor snafu, something to make the performance of an orchestral warhorse a bit more memorable. (I have to admit, I was amused too.) </p>
<p> One thing I noticed was that whereas my group was out for dessert and coffee, the symphony performers were having dinner. Makes sense. During a performance, you don't want to be overcome by indigestion, a food coma, or an urgent call of nature. (Or <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2005/09/20/471750.aspx"> receive a phone call</a> for that matter.) </p>
<p> As we got up to leave, a member of our group struck her head on a low-hanging lamp. In the brief hubbub, Elisa Barston reassured us, "That's okay, I hit my head on that lamp all the time." Which means either that she comes to Union often, or (more likely) she just said that to make us feel less embarrassed. </p>
<p> This was the third time we found ourselves at the same post-concert restaurant as a symphony performer. </p>
<div style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em">  0. I saw Joshua Roman heading into Wild Ginger. </div>
<div style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em">  1. Gerard Schwarz was having drinks in the lounge at Union. </div>
<div style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em">  2. Maria Larionoff, Gerard Schwarz, the evening's guest soloist,    and a number of other people sat at a large round table    near ours at <a href="http://www.thecapitalgrille.com/">The     Capital Grill</a>. </div>
<div style="margin-left:1em;text-indent:-1em">  3. Elisa Barston, Mikhail Shmidt, and two others having dinner at Union. </div>
<p> I guess if I see Susan Gulkis Assadi at a post-symphony restaurant, I'll have completed the entire set of string section principals. (I'm ignoring principal bass, because, well, everybody does...) </p>
<p> I counted Joshua Roman as a zero in the list above, since we saw him go in, but we were heading to <a href="http://www.thepurplecafe.com/"> Purple</a>, so it didn't count as a "same restaurant" encounter. </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter&nbsp;1</b>: I happened to have attended the open rehearsal for this same concert earlier in the week, so I got to hear the second piece on the program performed two-and-a-half times: The first time was by the orchestra without soloist. Then with the soloist. The <i>-and-a-half</i> was all the fragments the conductor rehearsed repeatedly. This was an interesting way to be exposed to the piece for the first time: Hearing the orchestral part first biased my reaction to the piece. Instead of hearing it as a violin concerto, I perceived it more as an orchestral work with solo violin accompaniment. Other interesting things from the rehearsal: </p>
<ul>
<li>String section leaders have much better access to the conductor     than other sections. During the rehearsal, the concertmaster     and principal second had brief chats with the conductor without     even leaving their seats.     By comparison, the piccolo player had to hang around near the     podium to catch     the conductor's attention as he returned from a break. </li>
<li>It's an interesting contrast seeing the soloist turn up for     the rehearsal in jeans, pink shirt, ponytail, and glasses.     Whereas for the performance, she's in a blue dress and     wearing contacts. (But she still had the ponytail.) </li>
<li>The rehearsal ends promptly at 12:30.     Right in the middle of a phrase, boom, everything stops.     Union rules. </li>
</ul>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter&nbsp;2</b>: I was tempted to title this entry <i>When out on the stage there arose such a clatter</i>, but the dropped bow was such a small part of the article, and the clatter was relatively insigificant, so it would have been a bit of a misrepresentation. </p>

		<p>My nextdoor neighbor is in the symphony and I ran into her while she was bringing home take-out. Does that count?</p>
<p>Incidentally, this same neighbor was in the same class as Josh Roman in music school.</p>

		<p>If I&#8217;m chuffed when Raymond Chen stops by my blog (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://tinyurl.com/nynt5y" rel="nofollow">http://tinyurl.com/nynt5y</a>), and Raymond is thrilled when he sits by some famous musician, who does the famous musician write home about? Obama? And who does Obama dream of meeting?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve had a subscription to the symphony off and on for the past decade (off for five years or so when I wasn&#8217;t living in Seattle) and although I&#8217;d recognize many of the players, I couldn&#8217;t name any of them on sight. &nbsp;Well done, sir.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s interesting, actually, because of course I&#8217;d recognize the Assads, or Paul Galbraith, or Ravi Shankar, and then we drop off the cliff into symphonic/progressive metal musicians.</p>
<p>A real question, though: &nbsp;did anyone else attend the symphony last weekend? &nbsp;While it was billed as Stravinsky&#8217;s Firebird and Mussorgsky&#8217;s A Night on Bald Mountain, I found that the contemporary piece (&quot;Concentric Paths&quot;, Thomas Ades) between them was amazing. &nbsp;The audience didn&#8217;t seem to care much for it, but if anyone else here was there I&#8217;d be interested to hear about it.</p>

		<p>The question is, does Elisa Barston&#8217;s blog say &quot;After the symphony we went to the Union as usual, and we happened to find ourselves sat next to Raymond Chen, the world famous computer programmer&quot;?</p>

		<p>You should say hello, and tell them that you really enjoyed the concert. If you&#8217;re polite, I&#8217;m sure they&#8217;d be happy to chat. I&#8217;m always happy for people to come up to me after a gig&#8230; &nbsp;but often they don&#8217;t want to in case they think they&#8217;re being a pain.</p>

		<h1>&quot;The rehearsal ends promptly at 12:30. Right in the middle of a phrase, boom, everything stops. Union rules.&quot;</h1>
<p>I&#8217;m a supernumerary[1] for the Indianapolis Opera, and it can be a bit disorienting when, as the drama reaches its peak, the music goes from full orchestra to rehearsal piano.</p>
<p>On a similar note, it&#8217;s not unusual for principal cast members to sing quietly during early rehearsals to save their voices. It&#8217;s odd to watch an opera singer, trained to fill a concert hall with her voice, all but whisper a great aria.</p>
<p>[1] Latin for &quot;extra.&quot; No, really.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
