		<p>The Contoso logo looks remarkably similar to the old British Leyland logo:</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Leyland" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/British_Leyland</a></p>
<p>That&#39;s probably not an association that you&#39;d want to make&#8230; but then, maybe the number of people who would recognise the similarity is quite small these days&#8230;</p>

		<p>Could not you lose a trademark if you don&#39;t use it? Isn&#39;t it why the merchandise was made?</p>

		<p>Contoso reminds me of Aperture Science. We should invent a mad CEO for it, and a completely implausible backstory.</p>
<p>Or, more appropriately, a dull as dishwater CEO and a backstory that makes it completely indistinguishable from any generic enterprisey software company that &quot;empowers growth&quot;.</p>

		<p>So what will Microsoft do when someone starts creating counterfeit mugs/teeshirts/books for Contoso/Fabricam/litware?</p>
<p>Love to see legal get their heads around that one or do the above exist as MS copyrights even though the companies don&#39;t exist?</p>

<p>Yes, with bonus points if someone can use all the Microspeak terms mentioned by Raymond over the years. :)</p>

		<p>@Flash:</p>
<p>Follow the first link to see your answer:</p>
<p>&quot;Where did these fake names come from?</p>
<p>The Trademark Group in Microsoft&#39;s legal department.</p>
<p>The Trademark Group performed background checks on these names and cleared them for use as fictitious entities by Microsoft samples and documentation. The web sites for all of these &quot;companies&quot; redirect to the main Microsoft home page. Having a pool of &quot;standard fake names&quot; means that Microsoft samples and documentation don&#39;t run into the problem of a fake URL turning into a porn site.</p>

		<p>Do you think it would be okay for my company to use contonso inside the manual for our product or for sample data visible inside screenshots in our brochures?</p>

		<p>@Christian:</p>
<p>Your company should use their own brand/logo in your manual. Relying on a third-party like Microsoft not only puts you in breach of a Microsoft trademark, but puts your company at the mercy of Microsoft managing to keep its house in order. Instead, either get your company to register their own trademarks, use your own company name, or use a name like <a href="http://www.example.com" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.com</a> or <a href="http://www.example.org" rel="nofollow">http://www.example.org</a>, which ara IANA reserved addresses for the purposes of putting example URLs into documents.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
