<p>Slashdot covered <a href="http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/09/21/1547259"> hand-cranked radios and other electronica</a> a while ago. I keep <a href="http://windupradio.com/lantern.htm"> an old-model Freeplay flashlight</a> in the trunk of my car. It sort of fits the whole energy-counter-culture ethos, since I drive an early-model Toyota Prius.</p>
<p> Freeplay is a South African company, and one of my South African colleagues pointed out that the Freeplay devices sold in South Africa are heavier than the ones sold in the States. Not for any technical reason, mind you. It's psychological, I'm told. Apparently, in South Africa, you want your equipment to be good and heavy, since that makes it seem solid and dependable. </p>
<p> When I was in London a few years ago, I joined a friend in a day trip to the <a href="http://www.vam.ac.uk/"> Victoria and Albert Museum</a>. The museum is far too large for you even to pretend to see it all so we created for ourselves a one-day tour on the theme "The history of British furniture from 1500 to the present". Yeah, it sounds stupid on paper, but it was actually quite fun. (We saw how the British were fond of Japanese teacups but couldn't get over the fact that they don't have handles. They solved this problem by building a metal cage with a handle; into the cage was placed the teacup.  Now you can drink your tea out of the lovely Japanese teacup with the added civility of a proper handle. Yet for some reason, this didn't catch on in Japan.) When we got to the late twentieth century, one of the items on display was... a Freeplay radio. </p>

		<p>Thanks for the tip regarding the flashlights. The model that you&#8217;re using is on their site, but not available for ordering. However, there are a bunch of interesting wind up flashlights/radios that would be handy for emergencies.</p>

		<p>I seem to remember hearing that the Japanese teacup is designed without a handle for a reason.  They believe you should only drink fluids at a temperature that you could hold in your hand, otherwise you may burn your throat.</p>
<p>I think there&#8217;s a sort of wisdom in such thinking.</p>

		<p>yeah &#8211; we had the if it&#8217;s heavy it&#8217;s good mentality here in the 80s &#8212; when you could buy the &#8216;new phones&#8217; with electronic ringers instead of old fashioned bells &#8211; many companies inserted lead weights to make them feel &quot;right&quot;</p>

		<p>as it happens, i received my &quot;premium&quot; from the local NPR station today: a crank-operated emergency radio/flashlight/cellphone-charger.</p>
<p>sadly, it doesn&#8217;t play &#8216;pop goes the weasel&#8217; while cranking, but otherwise it works great.<br /></p>

		<p>I wish HP printers were heavier. I can&#8217;t get over how flimsy the plastic parts are. My $1000 laser printer feels like a Fisher Price toy (and is about as liable to break).</p>

		<p>Black and Decker also manufactures the DeWalt tool line for contractors.  While they are better-quality, the DeWalt tool line is constructed to be heavier.  Pick up a B&amp;D vs DeWalt drill, and feel the difference.</p>
<p>Heavy=sturdy.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve got techie biceps instead of contractor biceps, it&#8217;s best to try before you buy&#8230;</p>

		<p>Placing a glass/cup in a metal cage with a handle is (or at least used to be) a common practice in some ex-USSR countries, although they seem to be dying out now. The last time I&#8217;ve seen these in use was on a train, where it&#8217;s sort of a tradition. Here&#8217;s how the final result &lt;a href=&quot;<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.gelos.ru/2004/bigimages/16528-1.jpg&quot;&gt;might" rel="nofollow">http://www.gelos.ru/2004/bigimages/16528-1.jpg&quot;&gt;might</a> look&lt;/a&gt;</p>

		<p>Slight correction &#8211; Freeplay is a British company; the Clockwork Radio was invented by British inventor Trevor Bayliss, and the company founded with help from the British government in the form of a grant (the intention was to use the radio for humanitarian purposes, as a way of spreading information about AIDS for example in Africa.)  As of this year they are traded on the London Stock Exchange AIM market.</p>
<p>The company does have a research centre in SA as well as the UK (I believe the products are actually manufactured on an outsourced basis in China these days.)</p>
<p>The Freeplay Foundation (the charity founded and primarily funded by Freeplay to carry out the humanitarian works) has offices in the UK, USA and SA (Cape Town.)</p>

		<p>(Addendum to the above: the original company &#8216;Baygen&#8217; that made the first Freeplay radio, while a UK company, did manufacture the radios in South Africa.  The note that they have closed their manufacturing and outsourced it to China comes from the company&#8217;s 2004 Annual Report.)</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
