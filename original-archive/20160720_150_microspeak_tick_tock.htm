As you might imagine, there's a lot of stuff
that needs to happen on the
opening day of //build.
For //build 2016, my job was to publish the new samples
to
<a HREF="https://github.com/Microsoft/Windows-universal-samples/">
the Github repo</a>.
And //build 2016 was when
I was introduced to the term
<i>tick-tock</i>:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
Please review your items in the <i>tick tock</i>
from a timing perspective and send me any corrections.
Visual Studio
is
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130122-00/?p=5493">
pivoting</a>
on the conclusion of the keynote,
and our plan is to update the SDK as soon as Update 2 goes out.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The attached document was a spreadsheet that listed
the chronology of events,
along with other information
like the task number in the task database
(not shown here).
Something like this:
</p>
<table BORDER=1 BORDERCOLOR=black BGCOLOR=white

I think it was nice of Bob to remind people to eat the donuts.
I was not in the room, so I lost out on the donuts.
</p>
<p>
<p>
The items in red are external events we have no control over,
but they act as signals for us to proceed with the next steps.
Therefore,
everybody had to keep an eye on their prerequisites to make
sure the steps occurred in the right order.
(I'm guessing the term <i>tick-tock</i> evokes the idea that
when the prerequisite action ticks, the dependent action tocks.)
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it wasn't as crazy as
<a HREF="http://kenlevine.blogspot.com/2016/02/this-is-amazing-from-grease-live.html">
this</a>.
</p>
<p>
Another <i>tick tock</i> document I found covered
a Windows launch event,
starting three days before launch and continuing
through two days after launch.
</p>
<p>
I had difficulty finding good
citations for <i>tick tock</i>,
mostly because the phrase is too common to be searchable.
One document I found was kind enough to provide sort of
a definition via context:
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
Attached is the Contoso Launch tick-tock document which
includes the timing, execution instructions, coverage,
and links to detailed guidance.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
The timeline was not down to the minute like the one I had.
It covered a campaign that took a month to play out.
</p>
<p>
Anyway,
from what I can gather, the term
<i>tick tock</i> is used to refer to
the schedule of events surrounding a product announcement.</p>

		<p>&gt;Anyway, it wasn&#8217;t as crazy as this.</p>
<p>That wasn&#8217;t crazy, they were well rehearsed and knew what they were doing. I&#8217;ve done live radio and &#8220;recorded live&#8221; TV where you might start out with a schedule if you are lucky, but even then the schedule gets adjusted. The last camera work I did was close ups from the orchestra pit, which made it hard to hear the director. So I had to keep shots going all the time in case they were using my shot. Looking for new shots when I definitely heard they had taken a shot from a different camera.</p>
<p>Carrying a stack of carts and vinyl into a studio for a news and sport programme was a lot of fun.</p>

		<p>Safire&#8217;s Political Dictionary defines &#8220;tick-tock&#8221; as &#8220;journalists&#8217; argot for a story detailing the chronology leading up to a major announcement or event&#8221;: <a href="http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2013/05/word-of-the-week-tick-tock.html" rel="nofollow">http://nancyfriedman.typepad.com/away_with_words/2013/05/word-of-the-week-tick-tock.html</a></p>
<p>(current edition from Google books: <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=q6ARDAAAQBAJ&#038;lpg=PA742&#038;dq=safire&#039;s%20political%20dictionary%20tick-tock&#038;pg=PA742#v=onepage&#038;q=safire&#039;s%20political%20dictionary%20tick-tock&#038;f=false" rel="nofollow">https://books.google.com/books?id=q6ARDAAAQBAJ&#038;lpg=PA742&#038;dq=safire&#039;s%20political%20dictionary%20tick-tock&#038;pg=PA742#v=onepage&#038;q=safire&#039;s%20political%20dictionary%20tick-tock&#038;f=false</a> )</p>
<p>That seems the opposite of the Microspeak usage: a political &#8220;tick-tock&#8221; is a history emphasizing dates and times, while a Microsoft &#8220;tick-tock&#8221; is a schedule for the future.</p>

		<p>To me, the difference between the &#8220;tick-tock&#8221; that Raymond describes and a much plainer &#8220;schedule&#8221; or &#8220;timeline&#8221; is that the &#8220;tick-tock&#8221; is like a batch scheduler.<br />
Each player affected by the &#8220;tick-tock&#8221; looks at his little region of the schedule and figures out if he/she&#8217;s time-based or event-based, and plans how to start/stop/continue the task scheduled.  The tick-tock-ed-ness is to emphasize that it&#8217;s not just a schedule, it&#8217;s a plan (yes, I&#8217;m serious, but my tongue is also in my cheek).</p>

		<p>Sometimes corp-speak sounds like someone just couldn&#8217;t find their thesaurus and decided to verb a noun or something. Other days it sounds like it&#8217;s straight out of A Clockwork Orange.</p>

		<p>&gt; Anyway, from what I can gather, the term tick tock is used to refer to the schedule of events surrounding a product announcement.</p>
<p>From what I can gather &#8220;tick-tock&#8221; means scheduling with internal and external schedules, i.e. &#8220;ticks&#8221; are your scheduled events and &#8220;tocks&#8221; are externally scheduled events which you must schedule your ticks around.</p>

		<p>I think &#8220;tick-tock&#8221; just convey the idea on timing with the sound of the clocks. So be sure not to overrun the schedule.</p>

		<p>I used the term at my former job where I was order &#8220;not to ask questions&#8221; when x happened, but got called out for &#8220;not asking questions&#8221; when z happened. It happened all the time, tick-tock. I eventually left for more reasons then just this one.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
