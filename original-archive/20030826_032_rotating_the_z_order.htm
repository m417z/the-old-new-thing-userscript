[ Import ]   [ Export ]  [ Remove ]

                                 [ Close ]
</pre>
<p>
        Drag/drop will call WindowFromPoint() to determine which window receives the drop.
        The window closest to the top of the Z-order (towards the beginning of the dialog
        template) will be chosen. 
    </p>
<p>
        We want drops to go to the listview, not the tab control, so the ListView (IDC_LIST)
        needs to go ahead of the Tab control (IDC_TAB). 
    </p>
<p>
        However, doing this breaks accessibility, because the tab order follows the Z-order,
        too. Consequently, the Tab order on the dialog is 
    </p>
<pre>List -&gt; Tab -&gt; Import -&gt; Export -&gt; Remove -&gt; Close
</pre>
<p>
        This is an undesirable tab order, since it causes focus to jump upwards (from List
        to Tab). To get the tab order right, you need to put Tab before List. 
    </p>
<p>
        This is where rotation comes in. 
    </p>
<p>
        Start by putting the controls on the page in the order necessary for tabbing. 
    </p>
<pre>Tab -&gt; List -&gt; Import -&gt; Export -&gt; Remove -&gt; Close
</pre>
<p>
        Recall that the tab order is circular. When you are on the last control and hit TAB,
        you go to the first one. So you really should view the tab order as a circle: 
    </p>
<pre>   /--&gt;  Tab  ---\
   |             |
  Close          v
   ^            List
   |             |
  Remove         v
   ^            Import
   |             |
   \-- Export &lt;--/
</pre>
<p>
        Once you view it this way, you realize that you can rotate the circle and the tab
        order remains unchanged. So let's rotate it so List comes first, since we need List
        to come first in the Z-order. 
    </p>
<pre>   /--&gt;  List ---\
   |             |
  Tab            v
   ^            Import
   |             |
  Close          v
   ^            Export
   |             |
   \-- Remove &lt;--/
</pre>
<p>
        Now cut the circle open, yielding the linear diagram: 
    </p>
<pre>List -&gt; Import -&gt; Export -&gt; Remove -&gt; Close -&gt; Tab
</pre>
<p>
        This gives us our final dialog template: 
    </p>

                    WS_TABSTOP,7,24,321,141
END
</pre>
<p>
        Now you get the best of both worlds. List is at the top of the Z-order, and the tab
        order is still correct.

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
