<p>KJK::Hyperion asks, "<a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/pages/407234.aspx#2477535">Could you shed some light on Get/SetMessageExtraInfo? It's almost like nobody on earth used them, ever, and I can't get some sample code</a>."</p>
<p> Yup, that's about right. Nobody on earth (to within experimental error) ever used them. </p>
<p> These functions were introduced on July 20, 1990 (I'm looking at the change history right now) at the request of what was then called the Hand-Writing Windows group, which shipped the first version of Windows for Pen Computing in 1992. The idea was that each input event from the custom pen hardware would have this extra information associated with it, and the software that converted pen input into strokes (and ultimately into gestures or characters via handwriting recognition) would use this extra information to guide the conversion process. </p>
<p> Seeing as Pen Windows died a hasty death, I think it's fairly accurate to say that nobody on earth will admit to having used these functions. </p>
<p> For those of you fortunate enough never to have been exposed to Pen Windows, here are some random tidbits of information. </p>
<p> First, applications needed to be modified to support pen input. In particular, edit controls did not accept text input from the pen. You had to replace them with one of the following: </p>
<ul>
<li>Handwriting edit control (hedit). This accepted free form     handwriting input. </li>
<li>Boxed edit control (bedit). This accepted handwriting input,     but you had to write one letter per box.     This constraint resulted in much better character recognition. </li>
</ul>
<p> Both of these controls were significantly larger than the standard edit control. They needed to be, in order to give enough room for the user to write. This in turned means that you had to edit all your dialog templates and custom window layout to take into account the larger pen-aware controls. </p>
<p> And just changing your controls wasn't enough. You also had to write extra code to call various character recognition functions to get the user's pen input converted and recognized. </p>
<p> Here's an artist's conception of what the boxed edit control looked like: </p>

<p> That weird triangle-shaped thingie was, I believe, called the <i>dinky</i>. What did it do? Beats me. </p>
<p> There are still vestiges of the old Pen Windows product in the <code>GetSystemMetrics</code> function: Check out <code>SM_PENWINDOWS</code>. </p>
<p> (Note that the old Pen Windows product is unrelated to the current Tablet PC product, even though they both do handwriting recognition.) </p>
<p> <b>Bonus chatter</b>: The <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/e7/archive/2009/03/25/touching-windows-7.aspx"> Windows touch team</a> saw their opportunity and commandeered the extra info (perhaps resurrecting the ghost of Pen Windows) and <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms703320.aspx"> use the extra info to specify the source of the input</a>. </p>

		<p>tabpill: I&#39;m guessing that there is just a change log at the top of the source code file that implements those functions. Odds are the file was copied from the Win16 project into the WinNT project and the change log came with it.</p>

		<p>Was gonna say (before I read the bonus chatter) that I actually wrote an MSDN article that never got published describing how to use that extra info to make UI&#39;s that adapter to pen/mouse. The examples I gave involved growing splitters and spinners. It was very useful to have that extra info without all the overhead of actually accepting stylus input.</p>

		<p>Actually, I&#39;m using this mechanism in a program (KatMouse) which routes mouse wheel messages to the window/control which the mouse is hovering over.</p>
<p>In this context, could you or somebody explain why Windows is sending mouse wheel message to the control with the keyboard focus?</p>

<p>I won&#39;t be surprised if it turns out, that early version of mouse wheel simulates keystrokes, like pageup/pagedown or something like that. Mind, that this is only a guess.</p>

		<p>@Eduard: Any mouse action that you bind to a button via Mouse Properties will be sent to the input focus. &nbsp;However, Click, Right-click, and AutoScroll happen to also change the input focus. &nbsp;It sounds like your question really is &quot;Why does Windows lump scrolling with the majority of actions that do not change focus, instead of the three special actions that do change focus?&quot;</p>

		<p>&quot;why Windows is sending mouse wheel message to the control with the keyboard focus?&quot;</p>
<p>Possibility 1: scroll messages are sent to the control with the keyboard focus</p>
<p>Pros: works the same as arrow keys, page up, page down. &nbsp;You can move your mouse cursor away from the window and still scroll where your text cursor is.</p>
<p>Cons: unrelated to the mouse cursor position</p>
<p>Possibility 2: scroll messages are sent to the control under the mouse cursor</p>
<p>Pros: You don&#39;t have to give keyboard focus to a control in order to scroll it</p>
<p>Cons: If your mouse drifts as you are turning the wheel, you can suddenly start scrolling a different window. &nbsp;Doesn&#39;t work the same as pressing the arrow keys, page up, and page down. &nbsp;It only works when your mouse cursor is over a window that can be scrolled.</p>
<p>I think the pros of 1 far outweigh the cons of 1. &nbsp;Remember also that mouse wheel scrolling was first implemented on windows that didn&#39;t understand it, so they had to use existing mechanisms for scrolling.</p>

		<p>&quot;Any mouse action that you bind to a button via Mouse Properties will be sent to the input focus.&quot;</p>
<p>But the mouse wheel is not a button [yes, there&#39;s a button under it, but it&#39;s not the one we&#39;re talking about]. And mouse movement* does not get sent to the input focus &#8211; it gets sent to the window under the mouse cursor [unless the cursor is captured].</p>
<p>*And, no, wheel scrolling isn&#39;t the same thing as mouse movement, but it&#39;s not a button either, and the analogy is just as fair.</p>

		<p>It seems that all other GUI systems chose the second approach (Mac OS, KDE, Gnome) and I&#39;m preferring it, too.</p>
<p>It just seems more natural. To scroll a window with the mouse wheel in Windows, you have to first give it input focus by clicking it, which can have other unintended effects.</p>
<p>It&#39;s also the case that more and more Windows applications choose to implement wheel scrolling independent from the input focus. I have not yet encountered a Mac or Linux application that chose the Windows way regarding mouse wheel scrolling.</p>

		<p>By the way, the OS/2 pen extensions worked on the normal controls (i.e. you could write directly into existing fields) &#8211; although this was difficult in practice.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
