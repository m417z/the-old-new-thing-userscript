Some time ago,
I encountered a new piece of Microsoft jargon.
Let's try to figure it out together.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
For our team presentation, we developed a theme that ties together
all of the features we are working on, and how it <i>laddered up</i> to
something bigger than the features themselves.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
I went searching through other documents looking for the
phrase "ladder up" in an attempt to triangulate the meaning.
Here are some more citations.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
These requirements are documented and <i>ladder up</i> to each other
so teams understand how the work is connected.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
I think it's important because it's actually these tiny issues
that <i>ladder up</i> to my perception about various products.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
<b>Risk</b>: The organization's strategy keeps changing.<br>
<b>Impact</b>: Trying to align experimentation to supply decision
        at a specific timeline cannot succeed.<br>
<b>Action</b>: Form our own vision of how to ladder up.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
At left are some of the more common
<a HREF="https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20130122-00/?p=5493">
pivots</a>
we looked at in the data.
Things like role, organization type, platform, and technology use.
We found the segments <i>laddered up</i> to three main categories
identified here.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
The list of potential needs will include the twelve needs currently
identified (and which can be <i>laddered up</i>
to the four meta needs of "information", "enrichment", etc.).
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Confused yet?
Here are some more.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
Company X organizes all social conversations with subject code tags,
which <i>laddered up</i> to branded campaigns and offerings.
</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote CLASS="q"><p>
"Fast" features can be <i>laddered up</i> to a strong emotional
benefit which taps into a need.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Okay, so there appear to be three general categories of usage.
</p>
<p>
One sense of <i>ladder up</i> is that of multiple things
building upon each other and reinforcing each other,
usually building toward a common goal.
</p>
<p>
Another sense of <i>ladder up</i> is that of organizing a collection of
items into a small number of groups.
</p>
<p>
The third category is the ones that I can't make any sense of.
("Form our own vision of how to ladder up."
"&hellip; laddered up to branded campaigns and offerings.")
</p>
<p>
One of my colleagues spent time in marketing and said that
the phrase <i>ladder up</i> was used a lot
to describe how various campaigns all contributed to a common goal.
</p>
<p>
So at least in marketing, the <i>ladder up</i> sense is that
of building and reinforcement.
</p>
<p>
It's not clear how the "organizing into a small number of groups"
sense is related to that.
Maybe it's just a coincidence,
and the two uses developed independently.
Or maybe people heard the phrase <i>ladder up</i> in a marketing
presentation and decided to start using it themselves without really
understanding what it means.</p>

		<p>I  get the strong sense that &#8220;laddered up&#8221; just means &#8220;add up&#8221; and is a monstrosity concocted by someone who heard the latter and didn&#8217;t understand what was said, coming up with this semi-absurd alternative.</p>

		<p>The usage describes combination of smaller pieces into ever growing chunks, which only become visible as the viewer is climbing a metaphorical ladder, one that presumably ends with a ten-thousand-foot view.</p>

		<p>Perhaps the first couple times it was a bad spell checker, where the writer wanted to write &#8220;added up&#8221;, and perhaps wrote &#8220;addered up&#8221;, which got auto-corrected to &#8220;laddered up&#8221;.  I think &#8220;addered&#8221; is the most likely mis-type due to the proximity of the keys and perhaps some reflexive muscle memory with the &#8220;-ered&#8221; sequence.  After the precedent was set, other people picked up the jargon.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d say, equivalents are:<br />

		<p>&#8220;Stacking/adding/building up to&#8221; doesn&#8217;t have this sense of details vanishing into a larger whole, a higher level of abstraction that becomes visible only from a certain height:</p>

		<p>Rather than &#8220;building and reinforcement&#8221;, the common theme seems to be related to requirement traceability.  The idea that all these small tasks aren&#8217;t done in isolation, they link/trace back to a higher goal.</p>

		<p>The only use of &#8220;Ladder Up&#8221; I have ever come across has involved some reference to setting off, being derived from the practice in the early days of aviation where your aircraft involved climbing a ladder and then pulling the ladder up, into the aircraft (so that you had it available to disembark, when you landed).</p>
<p>i.e. &#8220;Ladder Up&#8221; in that sense means &#8220;get under way&#8221;, &#8220;get on with it&#8221; etc.</p>
<p>As in, &#8220;Come guys, enough chatter.  Time to ladder up&#8221;.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
