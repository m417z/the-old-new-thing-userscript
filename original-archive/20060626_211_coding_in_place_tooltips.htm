<p>
Today we'll look at how to implement in-place tooltips.
These are tooltips that appear when the user hovers the mouse
over a string that cannot be displayed in its entirety.
The tooltip overlays the partially-displayed text and provides
the remainder of the text that had been truncated.
The keys to this technique are the
<code>TTN_SHOW</code> notification (which lets you adjust
the positioning of a tooltip before it is shown) and
the <code>TTM_ADJUSTRECT</code> message which tells you
precisely where you need the tooltip to be.
</p>
<p>
Start with our
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2003/07/23/54576.aspx">
scratch program</a>
and add the following:
</p>
<pre>
HFONT g_hfTT;
HWND g_hwndTT;
RECT g_rcText;
LPCTSTR g_pszText = TEXT("<a HREF="http://www.lipsum.com/">Lorem ipsum</a> dolor sit amet.");
const int c_xText = 50;
const int c_yText = 50;

BOOL
OnCreate(HWND hwnd, LPCREATESTRUCT lpcs)
{
 g_hwndTT = CreateWindowEx(WS_EX_TRANSPARENT, TOOLTIPS_CLASS, NULL,
                           TTS_NOPREFIX,
                           0, 0, 0, 0,
                           hwnd, NULL, g_hinst, NULL);
 if (!g_hwndTT) return FALSE;

 g_hfTT = GetStockFont(ANSI_VAR_FONT);
 SetWindowFont(g_hwndTT, g_hfTT, FALSE);

 HDC hdc = GetDC(hwnd);
 HFONT hfPrev = SelectFont(hdc, g_hfTT);
 SIZE siz;
 GetTextExtentPoint(hdc, g_pszText, lstrlen(g_pszText), &amp;siz);
 SetRect(&amp;g_rcText, c_xText, c_yText,
                    c_xText + siz.cx, c_yText + siz.cy);
 SelectFont(hdc, hfPrev);
 ReleaseDC(hwnd, hdc);

 TOOLINFO ti = { sizeof(ti) };
 ti.uFlags = TTF_TRANSPARENT | TTF_SUBCLASS;
 ti.hwnd = hwnd;
 ti.uId = 0;
 ti.lpszText = const_cast&lt;LPTSTR&gt;(g_pszText);
 ti.rect = g_rcText;
 SendMessage(g_hwndTT, TTM_ADDTOOL, 0, (LPARAM)&amp;ti);

 return TRUE;
}

void
PaintContent(HWND hwnd, PAINTSTRUCT *pps)
{
 HFONT hfPrev = SelectFont(pps-&gt;hdc, g_hfTT);
 TextOut(pps-&gt;hdc, g_rcText.left, g_rcText.top,
         g_pszText, lstrlen(g_pszText));
 SelectFont(pps-&gt;hdc, hfPrev);
}
</pre>
<p>
After declaring a few variables, we dig into our
computations at window creation.
We create the tooltip window, passing ourselves as the
owner window.
(Passing ourselves as the owner window is important in order
to get proper Z-order behavior.
I refer the reader to the fifth of my "Five Things Every
Win32 Developer Should Know" topics for further details.)
We then obtain our font and set it into the tooltip control
so that the tooltip renders in the same font we do.
(I'll take up more complex font manipulation in a future entry.)
We then measure our text in the target font and set
the <code>g_rcText</code> rectangle to the dimensions of
that text.
We use that rectangle to establish the boundaries of a tool
in the tooltip control.
By setting the <code>TTF_SUBCLASS</code> flag,
we indicate that the tooltip control should subclass
our window in order to intercept mouse messages.
This is a convenience to avoid us having to use the
<code>TTM_RELAYEVENT</code> message to forward the mouse
messages manually.
This hooks up the tooltip.
</p>
<p>
Painting the content is a simple matter of selecting the
font and drawing the text.
</p>
<p>
Run this program and hover over the text.
The tooltip appears, but it's in the wrong place.
Aside from that, though, things are working as expected.
The tooltip has the correct font,
it fires only when the mouse is over the text itself,
and it dismisses when the mouse leaves the text.
Let's position the tooltip:
</p>
<pre>
LRESULT
OnTooltipShow(HWND hwnd, NMHDR *pnm)
{
 RECT rc = g_rcText;
 MapWindowRect(hwnd, NULL, &amp;rc);
 SendMessage(pnm-&gt;hwndFrom, TTM_ADJUSTRECT, TRUE, (LPARAM)&amp;rc);
 SetWindowPos(pnm-&gt;hwndFrom, 0, rc.left, rc.top, 0, 0,
   SWP_NOACTIVATE | SWP_NOSIZE | SWP_NOZORDER);
 return TRUE; // suppress default positioning
}

LRESULT
OnNotify(HWND hwnd, int idFrom, NMHDR *pnm)
{
 if (pnm-&gt;hwndFrom == g_hwndTT) {
  switch (pnm-&gt;code) {
  case TTN_SHOW:
   return OnTooltipShow(hwnd, pnm);
  }
 }
 return 0;
}

// Add to WndProc
    HANDLE_MSG(hwnd, WM_NOTIFY, OnNotify);
</pre>
<p>
The <code>TTN_SHOW</code> notification is sent
when the tooltip is about to be displayed.
We respond to the notification by mapping the
text rectangle to screen coordinates and
using the <code>TTM_ADJUSTRECT</code> message
to expand the rectangle to include all the
margins and borders that the tooltip control
will place around the text.
That way, when we position the tooltip at that
location, the margins and borders match up
precisely, and the text appears at the desired location.
It is important to return <code>TRUE</code>
to indicate to the tooltip control that we
took care of positioning the window
and it should not do its default positioning.
</p>
<p>
When you run this program, you will find one more problem:
Tooltip animations are still taking place,
which is particularly distracting if
the animation is a slide animation.
This is easy to fix:
Tweak the way we create the tooltip control.
</p>
<pre>
 g_hwndTT = CreateWindowEx(WS_EX_TRANSPARENT, TOOLTIPS_CLASS, NULL,
                           TTS_NOPREFIX <font COLOR=blue>| TTS_NOANIMATE</font>,
                           0, 0, 0, 0,
                           hwnd, NULL, g_hinst, NULL);
</pre>
<p>
The <code>TTS_NOANIMATE</code> style suppress animations,
which means that the tooltip simply pops into place,
exactly what we want.
</p>
<p>
So there you have it&mdash;the basics of in-place tooltips.
Of course, there are many details you may wish to deal with,
such as showing the tooltip only if the string is clipped.
But those issues are independent of in-place tooltips,
so I won't go into them here.
We'll look at selected aspects of tooltips in future installments.</p>

		<p>As a note regarding GetTextExtentPoint at MSDN says:<br />
<br />&quot;This function is provided only for compatibility with 16-bit versions of Windows. Applications should call the GetTextExtentPoint32 function, which provides more accurate results.&quot;</p>
<p>So why not use the &quot;proper&quot; one? [besides not needing the increased accurancy]<br />
<br />Do you suggest to still be compatible with 16-bit Windows or did you use it just for simplicity&#8217;s sake? Just curious of your point of view.</p>
<p>Anyway thanks for the tip, Raymond!</p>

		<p>So, how did they get it so wrong in Microsoft Document Explorer for the tree view in the left pane, bundled with VS 2005? </p>
<p>If the pane is narrow (or the text is wide) the entire pane flickers when the tooltip is displayed. </p>
<p>Or are you still building with VC 6 Raymond, so haven&#8217;t had the japanese style flashing animations? </p>

		<p>Raymond,</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t expect you to know. &nbsp;It was more of a rhetorical discussion point; just wondered if you had noticed, and had perhaps applied your &quot;psychic powers&quot; of debugging as you&#8217;ve mentioned before.</p>
<p>Sorry if it came over the wrong way.</p>
<p>Your timing is spookily weird though sometimes. &nbsp;Just the other day I built a DDE server for a client, and what pops up, but an article on DDE from you.<br /></p>

respond to TTN_SHOW just like you do, but instead of using<br />

<p>Maybe it&#8217;s not that your suggestions are worthless, but instead it&#8217;s just that you complain so much that everything you say starts to become this annoying buzz that people try to ignore. &nbsp;Perhaps you can try to be constructive once in your life and you&#8217;ll actually get people who want work with you instead of wanting nothing to do with you.</p>

		<p>Sorry, I&#8217;ve never heard of TTM_ADJUSTRECT and I should have read the documentation before bothering you with this&#8230; You are right, I am &#8220;hard-coding&#8221; a number: it&#8217;s an owner-drawn list with an owner-drawn tooltip, so I know exactly how big the tooltip should be.

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
