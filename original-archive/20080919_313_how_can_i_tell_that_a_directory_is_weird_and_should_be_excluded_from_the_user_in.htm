Last time</a>, we looked at a customer who wanted to know how to tell
whether a given folder was a Recycle Bin folder or not.
We answered the question as stated,
but made the mistake of not looking
at the problem the customer was trying to solve.
</p>
<blockquote CLASS=q><p>
I need to know which folders are Recycle Bin folders so I can
skip over them when searching the drive for content.
</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
Ah, the real question isn't "How can I tell whether a directory
is a Recycle Bin folder?" but rather
"How can I tell whether a directory contains weird stuff that
we shouldn't be showing to the user (of which Recycle Bin files
are just one example)?"
</p>
<p>
The way to mark a folder as containing stuff that you shouldn't
bother the user with is to set both the <code>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN</code>
and <code>FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM</code> attributes.
In addition to Recycle Bin directories, this also prevents you
from searching weird things like System Restore points.
(Though for some reason it doesn't stop you from searching
Temporary Internet Files; I don't know whether that is a bug or a feature.)
</p>
<p>
Therefore, the answer to "How can I tell whether a directory
contains weird stuff that we shouldn't be showing to the user?"
is to test for the hidden and system attributes.
</p>
<pre>
BOOL IsWeirdDirectory(LPCTSTR pszDir)
{
  DWORD dwAttr = GetFileAttributes(pszDir);
  return dwAttr != INVALID_FILE_ATTRIBUTES &amp;&amp;
         ((dwAttr &amp; (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM | FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN))
                 == (FILE_ATTRIBUTE_SYSTEM | FILE_ATTRIBUTE_HIDDEN));
}

<p>I disagree about it being expected, at least from a high-level perspective. &nbsp;The question was how to skip over Recycle Bin folders. &nbsp;If I remove the attributes, the folder is still a Recycle Bin folder (my deleted files still get moved there) yet it will not get skipped over using this method.</p>

		<p>Whoops. &nbsp;I should have said the question was how to skip over &quot;weird&quot; folders. &nbsp;Removing the attributes from the recycler folder does not remove the &quot;weirdness&quot; associated with the folder.</p>

		<p>Yes, but you guys are now talking about doing weird things, that normal users probably don&#8217;t normally do. &nbsp;Why would you want to remove the hidden attribute from the Recycle Bin folder, especially if you know enough to know how to do it? &nbsp;There&#8217;s already several ways to see inside it without changing its attributes.</p>

		<p>Nope, but the hidden file attribute is INTENDED to hide folders that the typical user doesn&#8217;t need to know or care about. &nbsp;This fits the customer&#8217;s definition of &quot;weird&quot; pretty well.</p>
<p>The system attribute is intended to mark system-critical files that should be hidden as allowing the user to do stuff to them could make their system unstable. &nbsp;This might also be part of the &quot;weird&quot;.</p>
<p>If the hidden file attribute is removed, we can&#8217;t do much about that. &nbsp;Basically we have here a simple and easy solution that will cover 98.9% of cases. &nbsp;For 0.1% (hidden file attribute removed by a program without user consent) IMO the work that would have to be done would not be worth the effort to clean up someone else&#8217;s mistake (I can&#8217;t see it being intentional). &nbsp;The last 1% would be if the attribute was intentionally removed by the user, in which case it&#8217;s likely they did it on purpose and would expect and want the folder visible for whatever reason.</p>

		<p>Windows is sending some mixed messages about indexing. I have &quot;Show hidden/system files&quot; turned on in Explorer. If I right-click the Recycler folder and select Properties, then click Advanced, it has a check next to &quot;For fast searching, allow Index Server to index this folder&quot; even though both hidden and system are enabled for that folder.</p>
<p>Also, by default XP&#8217;s &quot;System Volume Information&quot; folder that holds restore points is ACLed so that not even administrators can get into it. You can change that, of course, but it also serves as a barrier to an indexer that might ignore the hidden/system bits.</p>

		<p>The problem with this approach is that there&#8217;s nothing preventing &quot;non-weird&quot; directories from being marked hidden&amp;system. &nbsp;Sure, there aren&#8217;t any by default, but I certainly wouldn&#8217;t want to exclude from my indexing any data that (e.g.) malware was attempting to hide from the user, and I&#8217;ve certainly seen malware using this strategy in the past.</p>

		<p>Jules: &nbsp;I think, by definition, all directories marked Hidden and System are &quot;weird&quot;. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Pretend we have a new attribute, called &quot;Weird&quot;. &nbsp;Any directories with this attribute set are therefore weird and should be skipped by user code. &nbsp;Now, nothing will prevent malware from marking its data as Weird. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You have just moved the problem, and you don&#8217;t gain anything. &nbsp;</p>
<p>We&#8217;re back to this: everything marked Hidden and System is &quot;weird&quot; by definition. &nbsp;The fact that malware can mark itself as Hidden &amp; Ssytem is a different problem, which is not easy to solve, but it doesn&#8217;t make this approach wrong.</p>

		<p>The real wtf is that the developers probably went into Windows Explorer and said to themselves, &quot;Hmm. &nbsp;Let&#8217;s just untick &#8216;hide system and hidden files&#8217; to see what sort of stuff is hidden from us. &nbsp;Oh, yes! &#8211; lots of things we don&#8217;t want turning up in our product&#8217;s scan&#8230; &nbsp;Now, I wonder how we can figure out if we have one of these hidden, system files ourselves&#8230;&quot;</p>

		<p>Dave: Why shouldn&#8217;t you be able to search the Recycle Bin? &nbsp;Makes sense to me.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s say you delete a folder with documents you think you don&#8217;t need any more, but there&#8217;s one file in there you forgot you put there. &nbsp;You go looking for that file later, but can&#8217;t remember where you put it.</p>
<p>So you use search. &nbsp;Since the Recycle Bin is indexed, you find it and are able to save it (yay!).</p>
<p>The Recycler folder may be intended to be hidden from the user, but the files in it certainly aren&#8217;t.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s my computer. If I want to search a hidden or system folder, that&#8217;s totally my right. Give me a search tool that searches these places. And don&#8217;t dare tell me what I should and shouldn&#8217;t look at.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).

</ul>
