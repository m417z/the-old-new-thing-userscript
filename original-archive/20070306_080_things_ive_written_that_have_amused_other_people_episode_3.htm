<p> This got quite an amused response from the Hebrew-speaking (or at least vaguely Hebrew-aware) members of the mailing list. </p>
<p> Not bad for having studied Hebrew for about ten seconds. (Apparently a better spelling of the plural would be "blogim" or "bloggim". But it wouldn't have been as funny.) </p>

		<p>Language geekery&#8211;providing endless opportunities for cleverness. &nbsp;This is why learning new languages is fun.</p>
<p>I finally got to use my knowledge of hebrew while watching that Tomb o&#8217; Jesus show on discovery the other night. &nbsp;I was able to say, &quot;wow, that really is some bad handwriting.&quot;</p>

		<p>why have gender as a defining property of a conference around a new technology? &nbsp;That strikes me as devisive, &nbsp;responding with a male equivalent is also discriminatory and devisive. &nbsp;Why not have a single event based on quality where gender is irrelevant. &nbsp;</p>
<p>That the context for Raymonds unquestionable humour arose, &nbsp;is disappointing in a company that should be forward thinking on diversity and technology.</p>

		<p>Does anybody know if BlogHer discriminates based on sex, or only on gender?</p>

		<p>@GABE -&gt; A more relevant question would be, does anyone care?</p>
<p>@WENDY -&gt; MS does lots of gender and race specific stuff in the name of inclusion, and fairness. The outcome of which is really exclusion and preferential treatment, a fact that seems totally lost on it&#8217;s internal PC culture.</p>

		<p>@ Raymond: Soooooo&#8230;. why isn&#8217;t there a BlogHim?</p>
<p>Also, appologies for political discussion in your comments.</p>
<p>@ Steve: That&#8217;s true of pretty much any &quot;politically correct&quot; culture. Affirmative action? Scholarships for women, &#8216;latinos&#8217;, africans, etc&#8230; but if there&#8217;s one for white males there&#8217;s suddenly a swarming pack of screaming banshees assaulting it.</p>
<p>We won&#8217;t be equal until we can remove gender, race, and ethnicity from consideration for anything, not just remove white males from consideration.</p>
<p>Instead, we celebrate the women who have chosen to blog; while pointing out that &quot;men don&#8217;t need celebration&quot; because &quot;men are so much cooler than us&quot; or something. It seems that PC people are simply sexist/racist at heart and think that, essentially, we women are inferior to men and need to be celebrated when we try not to be. Great&#8230;</p>
<p>Again, I&#8217;d like to take this moment to apologize to Raymond. I am sorry for posting political arguments in your blog comments.</p>

		<p>That&#8217;s two articles in a row touching on Jewish issues. &nbsp;Now I&#8217;m waiting for the storm of comments asserting that Microsoft is a front for Zionist something-or-other. It&#8217;d be no less logical than some of the nitpicks you get &#8217;round here&#8230;</p>

		<p>Erzengel, you raise a good point. As a guy who&#8217;s friends with a lot of top-notch technologists, many of whom are women, I often feel like they&#8217;re being looked down upon, albeit unintentionally. It seems to propagate the idea that women in technology is unnatural, and that the women need special attention because they&#8217;re not smart enough to do it on their own. Good intentions, but bad results&#8230;IMHO.</p>

		<p>A conference for women bloggers? Wow, next thing you know they&#8217;re going to be asking for the right to vote&#8230; (/snark)</p>
<p>Why do they need to do one of those? I don&#8217;t know, maybe they&#8217;re going to be talking about issues that are specifically of interest to women bloggers, just like some would make conferences for issues pertinent to political bloggers or technology bloggers or science bloggers. Ever think of that?</p>
<p>As for the interests of male bloggers, that&#8217;s what ALL the other conferences are basically defaulting to ANYWAY. Who needs BlogHim? Every other blog conference is a BlogHim.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
