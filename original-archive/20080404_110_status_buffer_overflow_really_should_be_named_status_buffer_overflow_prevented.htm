<p>One category of dubious security vulnerability that comes into the security response team is people who recently discovered the <code>STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW</code> status code.</p>
<blockquote class="q"><p>  <b>Title</b>: Buffer overflow occurs in scenario&nbsp;X </p>
<p> <b>Description</b>: Run a file monitoring tool and perform scenario&nbsp;X. In the log, you will see entries that have the error <code>STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW</code>. This is an easily reproducible buffer overflow bug. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> If only the system were so smart that it could detect buffer overflows in this way. But what you're seeing is not actual a buffer overflow. The status code <code>STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW</code> does not mean that a buffer overflow has occurred; rather, it means that the buffer passed by the application was too small to hold all the requested data. Its name should really be <code>STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW_PREVENTED</code> or <code>STATUS_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER</code>. Indeed, the corresponding Win32 error code has the less misleading name <code>ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER</code>. </p>
<p> Every wannabe security investigator sees this error code in a monitoring tool and says "Jackpot!" And then they send a report to the security response team and brag about it to their friends. "Dude, I found two dozen buffer overflows in just a few minutes. I am so <a href="http://www.31337.com/">31337</a>!" </p>

		<p>Blah: This is an NTSTATUS code, returned by the NT Native API, which is what a normal file access monitoring application will actually be monitoring. The Win32 functions you&#8217;re calling, like OpenFile, are just wrappers around NT kernel functions like NtCreateFile.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s possible to call the native functions directly, but not possible to call the Win32 function without that turning into a call to the corresponding Native function, so the Native function is the one to watch.</p>

		<p>Ah, the power of words&#8230;</p>
<p>Reminds me of the time we wrote an application which output &quot;Error 0&quot; to the log files when things worked.</p>
<p>We had one customer who raised a bug report on all the errors appearing in the logs.</p>
<p>This, despite the fact that everything was working fine and we made it clear the log file was for our purposes in post-mortem debugging, not for them to browse for their amusement.</p>
<p>Our solution: we changed the word &quot;Error&quot; to &quot;Status&quot; in the next release &#8211; the customer was satisfied (probably because the were using &quot;grep -i error&quot; to test it).</p>
<p>Cheers,</p>
<p>Pax.</p>

		<p>quoth the raven:</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>So what&#8217;s the difference between ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER (&quot;The data area passed to a system call is too small.&quot;) and ERROR_MORE_DATA_AVAILABLE (&quot;More data is available.&quot;)?</p>
<p>=====</p>
<p>Sounds like #1 leaves your buffer alone, #2 gives you a bit (to fill your buffer) and says there&#8217;s more.</p>
<p>#2 I&#8217;ve seen similar in the C I/O calls which deliver a byte stream &#8211; #1 is probably used where you&#8217;ve asked for a structure to be filled out.</p>

		<p>John, ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER vs ERROR_MORE_DATA_AVAILABLE is an artifact of the Lan Manager APIs (and applies to some Win32 APIs as well).</p>
<p>The Lan Manager APIs filled in buffers that contained an array of 1 or more fixed size structures. &nbsp;Within those fixed size structures, were pointers to variable length strings. &nbsp;The strings were packed at the buffer at the end of the fixed size structures. &nbsp;If the buffer supplied wasn&#8217;t big enough to fill in the fixed size structures, ERROR_INSUFFICIENT_BUFFER was returned, if there wasn&#8217;t enough data for the variable length strings, ERROR_MORE_DATA was returned.</p>
<p>In many circumstances, it wasn&#8217;t necessary to get the variable length strings, so the two cases were different.</p>
<p>ERROR_MORE_DATA is also used for message mode named pipes (to let the caller know that there is more data available in the message than was read).</p>

		<p>I remember the first time runninng filemon and seeing lots of buffer overflow messages.</p>
<p>Although the aim was to find security issues, the sheer number of these overflows was a big enough clue that it didn&#8217;t mean what I first thought it might, and that I should read up a little bit more on it before getting too excited.</p>

		<p>The Windows Kernel&#8217;s I/O Manager has two broad techniques to get data back to user mode:</p>
<p>1. &quot;Direct&quot; I/O, wherein hardware writes directly into the user mode buffer specified by the app</p>
<p>2. &quot;Buffered&quot; I/O, wherein hardware writes to a kernel mode buffer, and the I/O manager later copies it back to the user mode buffer</p>
<p>For small buffers, #2 is more efficient. </p>
<p>A driver returns an &quot;error&quot; status (0xCxxxxxxx) to tell the kernel to copy nothing to user mode.</p>
<p>A driver returns either a success (0xxxxxxxx) or a &quot;warning&quot; status (0x4xxxxxxx) to indicate there *is* data to copy back.</p>
<p>Imagine a request that returns in the buffer:</p>
<p>1. Number of elements (32bit value)</p>
<p>2. The elements themselves (varying size)</p>
<p>If you called the driver with a buffer of size zero, the NumberOfElements field couldn&#8217;t even be written out. In this case, a driver would return an error (STATUS_BUFFER_TOO_SMALL)</p>
<p>If you called with just enough room (32bits) to contain the NumberOfElements field, the driver might write a 0 into it and return a warning (STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW)</p>
<p>In this regard, ERROR_MORE_DATA most closely matches the intended meaning of STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW.</p>

		<p>I remember the behaviour that at the time I found odd when calling one of the WNet APIs using a server from a particular network vendor.</p>
<p>Calling the API (unfortunately I forget which) with a zero buffer would cause the API to fail indicating that it needed a buffer of at least the size of the fixed structure. Of course this wasn&#8217;t enough, and the API had to be called again to determine the buffer size including all of the variable strings.</p>

		<p>This is a non-issue in so far that STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW is well documented. Heck, for accessing the registry this is actually the preferred way to read data of unkwown size: One call with a NULL buffer and zero length to get STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW and the required size returned, then allocating the buffer and calling it again to get the buffer filled. In the first case, you only expect STATUS_SUCCESS for zero-length data or STATUS_BUFFER_OVERFLOW for non-zero-length, and in the second case only STATUS_SUCCESS &#8211; anything else is an error.</p>

The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>

        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.

        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.

        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
