<p>One of the flags you can pass to the  <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/reference/functions/shgetfileinfo.asp">  SHGetFileInfo</a> function is  SHGFI_USEFILEATTRIBUTES.  What does this flag mean?</p>
<p>  It means, "Do not access the disk. Pretend that the file/directory exists,  and that its file attributes are what I passed as the  dwFileAttributes parameter.  Do this  regardless of whether it actually exists or not."  </p>
<p>  You can use this flag to get the icon for a file type.  For example, to get the icon for text files, pass a filename of  "x.txt", pass SHGFI_USEFILEATTRIBUTES in the uFlags, and specify  FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL as the file attributes.  </p>
<p>  Why is the filename "x.txt"?  Because you want it to have the extension ".txt", and you want it  to be a valid filename.  (Don't pass illegal filenames like  "???.txt".)  </p>
<p>  Why are the file attributes FILE_ATTRIBUTE_NORMAL?  Because you want SHGetFileInfo to pretend that it is a normal file.  (If you passed, say, FILE_ATTRIBUTE_DIRECTORY, then you would have  gotten the folder icon back, since you told the function to pretend  that "x.txt" was a directory.)  </p>
<p>  Note that since you are telling SHGetFileInfo to "pretend",  there are some things you lose by the nature of make-believe.  </p>
<p>  For example, if the extension is a filetype whose icon changes  depending on the contents of the file,  then the dynamic icon will not be returned since there is no file.  You told the function to "pretend", after all,  and a pretend file has no contents.  </p>

		<p>This was so handy for a program where I needed to enumerate all of the file types in the system way back when.</p>
<p>Just go through .* in HKCR, get the icon for that type, then map them to their proper names and display them.  I was so happy the day I found this function :)</p>

		<p>Are you sure that you can&#8217;t  pass &quot;???.txt&quot;?<br />
<br />I would usually pass &quot;*.txt&quot; to this function and that seems to work.<br /></p>

		<p>Too bad there isn&#8217;t a way of doing something similar to get the executable used to edit the file (sort of like FindExecutable).</p>

		<p>Then, again, maybe AssocQueryString would work for that.</p>

		<p>Henk: It may work today but it won&#8217;t work in Longhorn. The first parameter is supposed to be a valid filename.</p>
<p>njkayaker: Yes I believe a variation on AssocQueryString will do the trick.</p>

		<p>How about just &quot;.txt&quot;? It&#8217;s a valid filename, after all. Even though Explorer won&#8217;t let you create it, Explorer will correctly recognize it as having the &quot;.txt&quot; extension (and a blank name).</p>
<p>If it works, then you&#8217;ve saved yourself a whopping full character of unnecessary bloat!</p>

		<p>Hey Ray, could you give us an example of a filetype whose icon changes depending upon its contents?  I&#8217;ve never heard of such a thing before.  Thanks.</p>

		<p>Good that you clarified that.<br />
<br />I don&#8217;t remember where i got the &quot;*.txt&quot;, but i certainly didn&#8217;t invent this myself, and i think it is widely used like this.<br /></p>

		<p>Some time ago, in times before XP and Me, there was a “tip” that had you set your icon for .bmp to %1. It gave you a slowdown on directories that contained many bitmaps, but you got to know just by looking what a picture was about.</p>

		<p>Sure you have &#8211; you just don&#8217;t realize it.  *.lnk files for example. *.exe for another. *ico for a third.</p>

		<p>Setting the icon to %1 only works if there is an icon handler shell extension registered for that file type.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
