<p>Some years ago (in a project far, far away) I received a piece of email from a member of the release management team asking me if a particular issue met the <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/release_team/archive/2005/08/26/456610.aspx"> escrow reset</a> <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/virtual_pc_guy/archive/2004/12/30/344424.aspx"> bug bar</a> or not, as it applied to an upcoming pre-RTM release.</p>
<p> I asked, "What is the current escrow reset bar?" I thought this was a fair question. After all, in order to state whether or not the issue met the escrow reset criteria, I needed to know what the escrow reset criteria were. I figured they'd reply with something like "The escrow reset criteria are on this internal Web page. Please evaluate the issue against those criteria and get back to us." </p>
<p> Instead, the response I got back was, "I'm not sure, let me check." </p>
<p> Some time later, I received the answer. </p>
<blockquote class="q"><p> There is no formal set of criteria. It's taken on a case-by-case basis after discussion with the team responsible for the issue. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> I thought it was interesting that, first, somebody asked me to evaluate an issue against criteria I was not provided with; second, the person asking the question didn't know the criteria either; and third, it turns out that there were no criteria at all! </p>
<p> According to their definition, the way to determine whether the issue met the escrow reset bar was to meet with the release management team themselves and let them make the call. In other words, they asked me to make a decision that only they could make. </p>
<p> They decided not to hold a meeting to discuss the issue. I guess that means it didn't meet the escrow reset bar. </p>

		<p>But if someone asked him that indicates that this someone didn&#39;t know what it meant either. &nbsp;If this someone had, he would have asked directly if the bug should undergo &quot;escrow reset&quot; (I have no idea what this is).</p>

		<p>I guess the reset bar was that if you need to ask what the reset bar is, your issue doesn&#39;t meet the reset bar. (After all, the first rule of reset bar is that you don&#39;t talk about reset bar.)</p>

		<p>What usually seems to happen in this case:</p>
<p>1) Person A says, &quot;Is f(x) true?&quot; (&quot;is it true that this bug meets the bug bar?&quot;)</p>
<p>2) Person B asks, &quot;Wait, what do you mean by f()?&quot; (&quot;What is your bug bar?&quot;)</p>

<p>There seems to be a great divide amongst those who disliked Vista RTM. half of them constantly say &quot;And, who can forget Vista&quot; whereas the other half say &quot;I think we all need to forget Vista&quot;. Myself? I&#39;m undecided.</p>

		<p>If you know what code escrow is, then the term should make quite a bit of sense.</p>
<p>But I don&#39;t see that anyone in this anecdote didn&#39;t &quot;know what the term means&quot; (the criteria for determining if a bug is severe enough that the lawyers have to be contacted and told the escrow details are being changed)&#8230; the problem seems to be in knowing what the term implies (the criteria themselves).</p>

		<p>Jeez, did you guys actually read the explanation of what &quot;escrow reset&quot; and &quot;bug bar&quot; are? Ray helpfully linked to clear, concise descriptions. If you can&#39;t be bothered to read them you shouldn&#39;t complain that you don&#39;t understand what it means.</p>

		<p>This is the funniest real-life Dilbertesque thing I&#39;ve heard in a long time. &nbsp;I hope you didn&#39;t feel bad that your bug wasn&#39;t important enough to trigger an event that had no criteria!</p>

		<p>Looks like you had dealings with a &#39;Leaky Pipe Manager&#39; (LPM). An LPM&#39;s sole reason for existing is to act as an information pipe between two teams, adding some managerial gravitas, but also losing vital context information during the transfer. LPMs can always be replaced with a direct inter-team lossless communication channel. But they never are.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
