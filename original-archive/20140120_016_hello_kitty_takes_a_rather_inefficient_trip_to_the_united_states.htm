		<p>Maybe in the original edition it was just New York and Florida, and in successive reprints Vermont and Hawaii were added at the end. I&#39;m sure Hello Kitty respects backward compatibility.</p>

		<p>It rather had to do with how inefficient the airline hub and spoke system is. Like how you have to fly west from Western NY to Chicago to get to London (or south to NYC or Washington DC).</p>

		<p>This isn&#39;t so bsd if you assume the constraint &quot;cats don&#39;t like cold, so visits to two cold states in succession are disallowed.&quot;</p>
<p>New York =&gt; Florida =&gt; Hawaii =&gt; Vermont would have been bad, especially if she originated from (and ultimately returned to) Japan.</p>

		<p>The traveling salesman generally concerns himself with distance, as though he were driving a car. However distance is largely irrelevant in air travel. What matters most is cost and schedule. It&#39;s entirely possible that schedules made it the fastest route (due to layovers), though it&#39;s most likely that this route was chosen because it was the cheapest.</p>
<p>For example, maybe it&#39;s the off-season, so flights to/from Florida are super-cheap. It might be $300 to fly from New York to Vermont, but you can get $99 super-saver fares from New York to Florida and Florida to Vermont.</p>
<p>Maybe she didn&#39;t even want to go to Vermont, but some crazy airline price war made it ridiculously cheap to go from Florida to Hawaii via Vermont, so she ended up there during an extended layover.</p>

		<p>@Gabe: &nbsp;Right, the &quot;Traveling Salesman&quot; problem often omits to say WHY we are trying to find the shortest path. &nbsp;I often assume that the salesman is traveling by horseback and he doesn&#39;t want to wear the horse out! &nbsp;But maybe, as PC and Bob mentioned, the salesman and his horse like to see the scenery. &nbsp;Maybe what the salesman wants to do is to perform only as much work as necessary to buy hay (or gasoline). &nbsp;Maybe he&#39;s longing for the days when women become salesmen, or when people don&#39;t buy printed encyclopedias any more&#8230;</p>

		<p>@Mrs. Whatsit &#8211; Really? I&#39;d have thought that generating any path at all would be O(n). And finding an optimal route with Quantum Bogosort is also still only O(n) &#8211; and that assuming you managed to complete the &quot;exercise for the reader&quot; for step 2 (which I would be very interested in seeing.)</p>

<p>This is an excellent children&#39;s novel in which teleportation (or &quot;tesseract&quot;) plays a pivotal role. Since all paths are equally ideal, the actual work involved is O(1).</p>

		<p>With respect to the inefficiency of airlines, I recall a time my sister made a trip from a Los Angeles area airport (don&#39;t recall which one) to Dallas. It turned out to be significantly cheaper to fly to Oklahoma City (or somewhere else similarly distant) than to Dallas. The really annoying part &#8211; there was a layover for that flight in Dallas.</p>

		<p>@Brian G., it&#39;s not at all uncommon for airports an hour or so away from a major hub to be much cheaper. &nbsp;Also, your sister could well have just gotten off at Dallas and not caught the second leg. &nbsp;I once needed a one-way ticket somewhere but it was about 50% cheaper to buy a round-trip, so I did, and never used the second half.</p>

		<p>Rick C: I once needed to fly one-way from San Jose to Cleveland. I ended up taking a flight from San Francisco to Columbus via Cleveland and just never got on the second plane. This only worked because I was going one-way and had no checked bags.</p>
<p>If you miss a flight the airline will cancel the whole rest of your itinerary, so you can only do it at the end of your trip. And if you do that regularly, they will likely start to catch on, and may refuse service.</p>

		<p>@Rick C: What Gabe said. We looked into it, and they would have canceled her return trip if she stopped in Dallas. Similarly, the return trip wouldn&#39;t have let her skip the Oklahoma City leg and start in Dallas.</p>

<p>Even worse, they may send you a bill for the difference between what you paid for and what you flew for all of those flights for which you didn&#39;t board the second flight in order to get a cheaper ticket.</p>

		<p>Maybe the trip in question had nothing to do with physical travel. Maybe Hello Kitty had a bit too much catnip.</p>

		<p>DWalker: While &quot;Traveling Salesman&quot; often is described as &quot;find the shortest path&quot;, it can easily be extended with a weighting function for each path (e.g. you don&#39;t want to travel gravel road when there&#39;s a not so much longer paved road). Scenery could be added to that weighting function &#8211; and would explain this Hello Kitty trip :-)</p>

		<p>Clearly, Hello Kitty was engaged in a Mileage Run &#8211; it seems quite common to arrange strange routes like this to get the maximum number of frequent flier miles for an itinerary. The fare rules about staying a certain number of nights always seemed bizarre and arbitrary to me; I recall one case where someone had to make two brief trips from one major city to another, about a week apart. The cheapest way was to fly A to B on day 1 with one outbound ticket, then use a second &quot;outbound&quot; ticket to get home to A on day 2. A week later, use the &quot;return&quot; leg of the second ticket to get out to B again, then come back home using the first ticket&#39;s return on day 8.</p>
<p>NY-Florida-Vermont might well be cheaper as an NY-FL return, then NY-VT return and an onward flight NY-HI, rather than three one-way tickets.</p>

		<p>Path of shortest weight&#8230; &nbsp;OK, we&#39;ll give high weights to paths with less scenery, then the entire trip will have maximum prettiness.</p>

		<p>&gt; Hello Kitty visits Vermont to see the colorful leaves</p>
<p>This purported motivation becomes suspicious when we add the information that cats cannot see colors on the low end of the spectrum: e.g., reds and browns.</p>

		<p>&gt; The travelling salesman doesn&#39;t find the &quot;shortest path&quot;. He finds the path of shortest weight.</p>
<p>lightest weight, surely ;)</p>

		<p>Vermont &#8230; why? If they wanted to hit stereotypical US wouldn&#39;t Texas, California or Louisiana make more sense? Cali and NY are already over hyped in pop media so if the idea was to have a non-typical look at the US both should have been avoided.</p>
<p>Inefficient trip around the US: finally another nation that is failing geography.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
