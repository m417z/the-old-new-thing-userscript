<p>It started out in finance, but the term has crept into more mainstream usage (at least within Microsoft) and along the way picked up its own meaning:</p>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Where did we <u>net out</u> on this? </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Customers want you to <u>net out</u> the business value. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="m"><p> Note any significant changes to the forecast and explain the reasons why. <u>Net out</u> changes to start conversation. </p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="m"><p>  Include the following points in your presentation: </p>
<ol>
<li>... </li>
<li><u>Net out</u> action plan     <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2007/09/25/5108967.aspx">     moving forward</a> </li>
</ol>
</blockquote>
<p> The next citation is a bullet point from a PowerPoint slide: </p>
<blockquote class="m"><p align="center"><font size="+2"><b>Agenda</b></font><br> <font size="+1"><b>Each district/vertical will answer/report back on:</b></font></p>
<ul>
<li>... </li>

</ul>
</blockquote>
<p> (I also have some finance citations, but they aren't relevant to Microspeak, so I've left them out.) </p>
<p> In finance, to <i>net out</i> is to cancel out positive and negative amounts. For example, you might <i>net out</i> an account by cancelling amounts owed against amounts due in order to eliminate offsetting transactions. When calculating tax liability, you <i>net out</i> your gains against your losses to determine your net change for the tax period. </p>
<p> In Microspeak, well, I'm not sure what it means. In that first citation, it appears to be a synonym for <i>come to a conclusion</i>. The question appears to be a rephrasing of "What was our conclusion on this?" or "What did we finally decide on this?" </p>
<p> In the second citation, it appears to be a synonym for <i>summarize in terms of net benefit/loss</i>. "Customers want you to show the net benefit of the product." </p>
<p> In the third citation, it appears to be used merely to mean <i>summarize</i>. </p>
<p> And in the final two citations, it appears to be simply a verb meaning <i>to produce</i>. </p>
<p> Note that <i>net out</i> is unrelated to that other Microspeak phrase <i>net net</i>, discussed earlier. </p>

		<p>The phrase: &quot;Net out top 3 business asks&quot;, smacks of a low, plebeian upbringing, unfit for the high position which the writer of said memorandum surely occupied. Such abuse of the English language will go on unfettered until the noble souls rise up and expunge such blasphemy by reintroducing corporal punishment in the grammar schools.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s charming how many at Microsoft are using words whose meaning isn&#8217;t known by anybody&#8230; I have this theory that any large corporation slowly converts into a bureaucratic organization, much like a government. If that&#8217;s true, any executives would tend to act as politicians. This would explain the existence of Microspeak as a kind of politicians&#8217; jargon, used only inside the company that originated it. It would be interesting to know if this happens at other big corporations.</p>

<p>Yes, it happens are other large organizations. Federal Government, State Government, Non-Profits, and Corporations.</p>
<p>Or that&#8217;s been my experience. You eventually end up with someone marginally incompetent in power, they fake it by making stuff up, the habit gets imitated, not only but especially by other incompetents, and eventually you end up with &quot;Net out top 3 business asks&quot;.</p>
<p>The person who is actually using the phrase might be a valuable employee, who is just imitating others to fit in. But someone started using those phrases&#8230;</p>
<p>I think it&#8217;s just the nature of the beast when you reach a certain size.</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
