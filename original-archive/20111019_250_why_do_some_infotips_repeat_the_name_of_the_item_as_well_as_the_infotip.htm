<p> The customer compared their shortcut with the other ones but couldn't find anything that was telling Explorer, "Include the program name in the pop-up infotip, please." </p>
<p> Because the reason for the name being included in the infotip had nothing to do with the properties stored in the shortcut. The reason the name was included in the infotip is that the name was being truncated in the main display. </p>
<p> When an infotip is about to be displayed for a listview item, the listview sends a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb774835.aspx"> <code>LVN_<wbr>GET&shy;INFO&shy;TIP</wbr></code> notification</a> with a <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/bb774786.aspx"> <code>NMLV&shy;GET&shy;INFO&shy;TIP</code> structure</a>. If the <code>LVGIT_<wbr>UNFOLDED</wbr></code> flag is not set, then the infotip is being displayed for a truncated item, and the <code>pszText</code> is pre-filled with the full name. The program should then append its information to the existing text so that the full name is the first line of the infotip. On the other hand, if the <code>LVGIT_<wbr>UNFOLDED</wbr></code> flag is set, then the item text is fully-visible and you should just copy your desired description text into the <code>pszText</code> buffer. </p>
<p> The customer was happy to get this information. Their designer wanted only the description to appear in the infotip, and now they know that they need to shorten the program name to make the name disappear from the infotip. </p>

		<p>+1 for forcing a company to reconsider adding every word they can think of to a product name. &quot;Contoso Professional Music Studio Deluxe 2010&quot; is verging on being silly. For a start, it would be very rare to have multiple versions of the same software on a single computer, so most programs use a simple version of the name and give you the other details in the About box. The &quot;Professional&quot; is probably redundant as well (given its placement in the name and the &quot;Deluxe&quot; on the end, it&#39;s probably more a statement about their intended audience than anything useful to the name). This leaves us with &quot;Contoso Music Studio&quot; or &quot;Contoso Music Studio Deluxe&quot; if they&#39;re really attached to that. Much nicer.</p>

		<p>I find server programs generally fall under the &quot;Contoso Widget Frobbing Server Web Edition Administrator Tools (v.5.6.102923484) SP3&quot; or something equally silly. It&#39;s even better when these shortcuts stay around, even when Contoso has been bought out by Fabrikam, &quot;Widget&quot; are &quot;Doodads&quot; now, and the program is up to version 10!</p>

<p>Perhaps that&#39;s true for non-technical users, but not for geeks:</p>
<p>To begin with, there&#39;s the open source competitor to Contoso Professional Music Studio Deluxe 2010 &#8211; &quot;Audacity 1.2.6 is our main release, complete and fully documented, but no longer under development. You may install Audacity 1.2.6 and 1.3.13 on the same machine.&quot;</p>
<p>Then there is Ruby 1.8.x and 1.9.x.</p>
<p>Anyone beta-testing 7-Zip is likely to also have the release version installed.</p>
<p>And I can&#39;t remember the last time I only had one version of Visual Studio installed.</p>

<p>Sadly, the replacement for the Start Menu, the Start Screen in Windows 8 is not showing infotips from the comment field for the shortcuts on the Start Screen. :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For folders, all Windows versions (except Vista) show an infotip specified in desktop.ini. Windows 8 Start Menu or Start Screen does not. :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Explorer status bar showed infotip information for single selected file in XP, it is removed needlessly in Windows Vista and still not returned/fixed in Windows 8. :(</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The taskbar infotips for system notification area icons in Windows Vista had icons which gave them a rich look. They were removed in Windowsa 7. :(</p>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
