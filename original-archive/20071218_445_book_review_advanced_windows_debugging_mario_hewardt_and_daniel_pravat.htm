<p>Ever so often, somebody sends me a book, and most of the time I glance through it and say, "Eh."</p>
<p> But not this time. </p>
<p> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321374460?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=tholneth-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0321374460"> <i>Advanced Windows Debugging</i></a> will make you the envy of your friends (if your friends are computer nerds). Even the section with the "Oh come on every moron knows this already" title <i>Basic Debugger Tasks</i> has stuff that I didn't know. Fortunately, you don't have to slog through the stuff you already do know in order to find it, because the nifty new debugger commands are set off in the snippets of debugger conversation. (And by debugger conversation, I mean output of a debugger based on the Windows debug engine, debuggers like <code>ntsd</code>, <code>kd</code> and <code>windbg</code>.) </p>
<p> Once you get past the "basics", you still have loads more ahead of you. The book covers debugging scenarios like a corrupted heap, a deadlock, or 100% CPU usage, as well as debugging tasks, like following the trail of an LPC request from the client to the server, peeking at the token count of a semaphore, and reconstructing a partially-corrupted stack&mdash;and illustrates each investigation with both discussion and annotated debugger output. All the things that seasoned developers take for granted (because they have become instinctual after years of experience) are spelled out for you. Learn more from the book's web site, not unsurprisingly named <a href="http://advancedwindowsdebugging.com/"> advancedwindowsdebugging.com</a>. </p>
<p> I'm keeping this book on my shelf. You can borrow it, but I'm going to insist that you return it when you're done. </p>

		<p>I have some books like that. When someone wants to borrow one of those, I insist that they must leave one shoe for collateral. No one so far has left the building without returning the book. &nbsp;(This may not work with the Java coders on second floor, but their interests and my library don&#8217;t often coincide).</p>

<p>I am getting this book for sure.</p>
<p>I am under the impression that Win32 development is pretty much over by now. With all the .NET hype and new frameworks coming each month. :-)</p>

<p>It would also be cheaper to buy a banana, but I don&#8217;t think either one of those would help you learn advanced Windows debugging techniques. &nbsp;Though I suppose a banana might make for a good snack during debugging sessions&#8230;</p>

		<p>Ahhh, a book that will fill the void left by John Robbins deciding not to do a new update of &quot;Debugging Windows&quot; for native code (<a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.wintellect.com/cs/blogs/jrobbins/archive/2007/10/15/why-i-m-not-writing-a-native-c-debugging-book.aspx" rel="nofollow">http://www.wintellect.com/cs/blogs/jrobbins/archive/2007/10/15/why-i-m-not-writing-a-native-c-debugging-book.aspx</a>).</p>
<p>This book at first glance looks like it goes into incredible low-level detail. &nbsp;Nice.</p>

		<p>That looks good. &nbsp;Parsing the table of contents, the only real hole I see is using windbg, etc., on managed code. &nbsp;Maybe it&#8217;s in there but non-obvious? &nbsp;I&#8217;ll have to look for the book at a B&amp;M store and see what&#8217;s there.</p>

		<p>Judging from the sample chapter, it looks as though the book is very well-written and thorough in its presentation. I will probably buy a copy. Thanks for pointing it out, Raymond.</p>
<p>But the fact that such a book is necessary in the first place causes me to think that the software industry needs some fresh ideas. No application programmer should ever have to muck around with the stuff shown in the sample chapter. It is utterly grotesque that we are still dealing with this stuff.</p>
<p>I program using the Win32 API every day. It is the best solution available for my needs. But I can&#8217;t wait for something radically better to come along. Programming used to be fun. I feel confident that someday it will be fun again. But in the meantime, I think I can see why very few college students are taking up Computer Science these days. Most people woudl rather read an IRS Auditor Training Manual than a book on Windows Debugging.</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Naturally the book doesn&#8217;t cover the easy cases, the stuff you can debug from an IDE. If you let people write in a language in which memory corruption is possible, then you have to be able to debug the consequences, and often the consequences are extremely subtle. -Raymond</i>]</div>

<p>Wow, I didn&#8217;t realize such people existed. Are you from the future?</p>
<p>Even if you don&#8217;t use these techniques, understanding them helps you understanding the underlying system you&#8217;re programming for. That always helps, using a type-safe language or not.</p>

		<p>Skip: Windbg on managed code is very limited and non-trivial. You&#8217;re usually better off usual Visual Studio (or Rascal, the lightweight version).</p>
<p>Bob Snyder: .NET programming might prove to be a pleasant surprise for you.</p>

		<p>Thanks Raymond : I saw this book some days ago on Amazon and I was really considering buying this book and I just decided I&#8217;ll buy it in the next days.</p>
<p>As AsmGuru said, there was a steadily decreasing number of updated resources regarding advanced debugging and non-managed/.NET stuff in general : glad to see some authors still care about it.</p>

		<p>I came across this book but bought it after this review. My thinking was &#8220;If RaymondC likes a debugging book, it must be awesome&#8221;.</p>
<p>Raymond &#8211; the power you have is awesome and scary. If I were a technical book author, I would be making a beeline to you door :)</p>
<div class=post>[<i>Okay, let&#8217;s test that theory. &#8220;I read <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2006/12/07/1233002.aspx" rel="nofollow">this awesome book by Raymond Chen</a>. You should buy a copy!&#8221; Let&#8217;s see if that helps my sales rank. -Raymond</i>]</div>

		<p>On the one hand, I now work in a job where I don&#8217;t need to run wdeb. (I even run a RELEASED OS as standard practice!) </p>
<p>On the other hand, I spent 4 years where my &quot;list for new testers&quot; included, &quot;Read RaymondC&#8217;s tips on debugging Windows&quot;. &nbsp;</p>

		<p>Weren&#8217;t you one of the technical reviewers for Undocumented Dos?</p>
<p>There was a bit in that that actually made me laugh out loud. They described how Windows instanced the Current Directory Structure and commented that in the first edition they tried to load their nasty reverse enginneered redirector into a Windows Dos box. It loaded and that Dos box mounted the redirected &#8216;network&#8217; drive. They checked in another Dos box and found that the redirected drive didn&#8217;t show up there. Which is not surprising once you know that each Dos box has a different intance of the CDS. The funny part is that one of the technical reviewers of the first edition commented &#8220;only an idiot would expect that to work&#8221;. </p>
<p>Which I like the idea of &#8211; the idea that unless you can work out that the CDS is instanced and thus that redirectors are per Dos box, neither of which is obvious to 99.99999% of the population, you&#8217;re an idiot. </p>
<div class="post">[<i>It&#8217;s blatantly obvious that the CDS is instanced. Here, watch: Open two DOS boxes. In each one, CD to a different directory. Holy cow, you can do that! -Raymond</i>]</div>

<br/><div class="disclaimer">
*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
