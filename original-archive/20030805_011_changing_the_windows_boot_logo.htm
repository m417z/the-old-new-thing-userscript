<p>         This is the answer I give to IT people when they ask if it's okay to customize the         Windows boot logo.      </p>
<p>         DO NOT DO THIS ON A PRODUCTION MACHINE OR YOU WILL REGRET IT.      </p>
<p>         If you hack the bitmap everything will seem fine until six months down the road when         you decide to install the latest service pack. The service pack installer <u>will         not upgrade your ntoskrnl</u> because it looks at the file and says "Hm, this isn't         the standard uniprocessor ntoskrnl, it's not the standard multiprocessor ntoskrnl,         it's not the standard advanced server ntoskrnl, I can't tell what this is, so I don't         know which version of ntoskrnl to update it to. I'll just leave it alone."      </p>
<p>         If you are lucky you will <u>bluescreen at boot</u> because the old ntoskrnl is incompatible         with some other critical part of the service pack.      </p>
<p>         If you are unlucky, your machine will <u>appear to run normally</u> when in fact it         is quietly corrupting itself, and then it will keel over or generate bogus data when         you least expect it.      </p>
<p>         If you planned ahead, you will have <u>quit your job and moved to Hawaii</u> so the         disaster falls on your replacement's head to clean up while you sit on the beach sipping         a pina colada.      </p>

		<p>What ever happened to rolling back the service pack installation after failing to recognize the version of ntoskrnl?<br />
This isn&#8217;t really an excuse for not changing the windows boot logo. This is an excuse for changing the service pack installers.</p>

		<p>here&#8217;s an idea.<br />
store the boot images in a seperate file that makes it easy to change them. why the hell do I need to hack ntoskrnl to change an image.</p>

		<p>It&#8217;s called branding.  My Sony Vaio doesn&#8217;t let me change the boot image. Neither does my Toshiba DVD player or my Prius (yes, my car has a boot image).  I bet your TiVo, PS2, Xbox and iMac don&#8217;t let you change the boot image either.  If you license a McDonalds franchise, I&#8217;m pretty sure you aren&#8217;t allowd to tinker with the McDonalds logo on the front of your store.</p>

		<p>I have modifyed the ntoskrnl bitmap, but I have the orginal file from the I386 folder back in it&#8217;s place (by itself in the System32 folder) and still can&#8217;t upgrade to SP4 running 2k w/SP3!<br />
Any ideas??</p>

		<p>I just remember to swap it back with the original come patchy time.  And then wait for the hacking community to churn out a logo maker that supports the new ntoskrnl.  Another trick is to use ntoskrnl.exe /kernel=customlogo_krnl_file.exe on [boot] so you never physically mess with the real ntoskrnl.exe, although you have to remember to alter that line every service pack&#8230;</p>

		<p>I have changed the bitmap in ntoskrnl.exe and saved it with a new name. In fact I&#8217;ve done this around 40 times with such names as kernel01.exe, kernel02.exe, etc. Altering the c:boot.ini file, you can use any of these alternate ntoskrnl.exe files. In fact, I have around 40 alternate boot.ini files, each of which uses a different one of these alternate ntoskrnl.exe files. Renaming one of these alternate boot.ini files (e.g. boot01.ini) to boot.ini in effect makes the change. I have a program that does this automatically after each boot. Now, the only potential hangup I know of is if ntoskrnl.exe changes, for instance by virtue of a Windows Update or service pack. This happened a few days ago to me. Fortunately, one of the programs I wrote alerted me to the fact that the Windows Update I just ran did change ntoskrnl.exe and I immediately disabled my alternate logo system and am using the standard (newly supplied) ntoskrnl.exe until I get around to altering the new one (40+ times). If I hadn&#8217;t caught this I don&#8217;t know what would have happened.</p>

		<p>What you can do is alter the NTOSKRNL.EXE and save it as another filename (NTOSKRN2.EXE), thus leaving the NTOSKRNL.EXE unmodified.  Then modify your boot.ini to have it point to NTOSKRN2.EXE.  You will still get the modified bootlogo and leave the original NTOSKRNL.EXE intact.  There&#8217;s an article about this on littlewhitedog.com.</p>

		<p>Perhaps you could all just give away this silliness of editing the kernel and use the /bootlogo option in BOOT.INI instead. I think this may be available only with Windows XP, though.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
