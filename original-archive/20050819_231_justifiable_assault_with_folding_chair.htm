<p> Everybody's lunchtime conversation a few days ago was the <a href="http://msnbc.msn.com/id/8973616/"> riot at a used laptop sale in Richmond, VA</a>. [<a href="http://www.richmond.com/news/output.aspx?Article_ID=3834354&amp;Vertical_ID=127&amp;tier=1&amp;position=1">Local coverage</a>.] What got me was this fellow Jesse Sandler: </p>
<blockquote class="q">
<p> "I took my chair here and I threw it over my shoulder and I went, 'Bam,'" the 20-year-old said nonchalantly, his eyes glued to the screen of his new iBook, as he tapped away on the keyboard at a testing station. </p>
<p> "They were getting in front of me and I was there a lot earlier than them, so I thought that it was just," he said. </p>
</blockquote>
<p> Because if somebody cuts in front of you in line, you are perfectly justified in assaulting them with a folding chair. That's one of the guiding principles this country was founded on. </p>

		<p>I say, he confessed of his own volition to a 3rd party.  The City of Richmond should charge him with assult, it&#8217;s a slam dunk case.  Ok so nothings a slam dunk case here.  But he obviously has no remorse, so I doubt they could claim insanity.</p>

		<p>What was that county thinking, selling them for only $50?  Why didn&#8217;t they sell them for a cost closer to their actual value?</p>

		<p>I&#8217;m with Master Chief on this one. We&#8217;ve been a rough-and-tumble country from day one: if something isn&#8217;t working, change it or destroy it. That&#8217;s even a Jeffersonian viewpoint of government itself.</p>
<p>Legally the dude is liable but if we&#8217;re talking pure fairness, the line jumpers had it coming.</p>

		<p>2 days ago at the dog park, one guy had a pitbull, very aggressive dog, and this dog attacked a small dog, the owner of the small dog (a lady) got her dog out of the way somehow, and of course she and other people were angry, as aggresive dogs are not allowed on that park (it states it clearly at the entrance), but the owner of the PitBull was even more aggresive than the dog!, he started yelling at people saying that he didn&#8217;t tell the dog to attack the other dogs, that it wasn&#8217;t his fault, he even called the poor lady something, and he said that he would bring his dogs any time he wanted, blablabla&#8230;</p>
<p>sheeeez!</p>

		<p>At this same event, one woman peed her pants to avoid losing her place in line. Line-jumping is not welcome.</p>

		<p>Joshua:  </p>
<p>Since when does fairness justify physical assault as a response to inconveniencing someone by not following what is at most a custom?  Waiting in line is not a law &#8212; it&#8217;s a courtesy.  If lack of courtesy were a crime, there&#8217;d be very few people not in prison.</p>
<p>Was Sandler&#8217;s anger warranted? Yes.<br />
<br />Was Sandler&#8217;s person being harmed? No.<br />
<br />Was Sandler&#8217;s property being threatened? Again, no.</p>
<p>Sandler was waiting in line for a luxury item, and someone cut in front of him.  The only thing that would be justified would be to have the management evict the line jumper in a civil fashion.  Obviously, as this and other anecdotes show, there was no management whatsoever.</p>
<p>Instead, Sandler showed nothing more than base greed.  He&#8217;s no better than the common thief who steals because he thinks they&#8217;re charging too much, or thinks he deserves a thing more than the next guy.  I pity anyone who has to deal with this person.</p>
<p>Were I the guy who got assaulted by Sandler, I&#8217;d be perfectly justified in filing charges.  The fact that the police did absolutely *nothing* to deal with the whole affair (of which Sandler was only a part) is disgraceful.<br /></p>

<br />[/quote]<br />
<br />Personally, I think it depends.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s the case there, but in Hong Kong, the queue position for buying &quot;whatever&quot; can sometimes be exchanged for good amount of money, depending on what the queue is for and how long is the queue.</p>
<p>Should there be Hong Kong, I may say the one who cuts the line is no different compare with stealing money from everyone behind him, and the line cutter deserves any kind of punishment a thief deserves.</p>
<p>Although I DO think a folding chair is a bit too much. It can be lethal if she hit it too hard.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve seen (just seen &#8211; didn&#8217;t feel like experiencing) such mindless crowd in Bombay suburban trains &#8211; but not intentionally violent, it just happens so when you got to board and get off the train in 8 seconds. </p>
<p>Can&#8217;t imagine something like that in VA.  It is probably the XBox&#8230;</p>

		<p>I&#8217;ve complained before that people become violent over mere objects, but I&#8217;m sick to death of the people in this country selfishly acting on the assumption that no one will kick them in the teeth for having wronged others.  </p>
<p>Line-jumping in this case was done with the clear intent of depriving someone else in favor of the tardy line-jumper&#8217;s desires.  Social convention does indeed lead to implied contracts (try getting up at a restaurant and telling them that they never told you that you had to &quot;*pay* for all of this food&quot;), and being polite to selfish people obviously isn&#8217;t working.</p>

		<p>I think I would probably do the same. Line jumping is exceptionally common in queues at airports going to and from South Asia, and I can well imagine myself graduating from appearing threatening, which has sufficed so far, to carrying the threat out.</p>

<p>The Mumbai trains are more exciting than any roller coaster and well worth a ride. I wouldn&#8217;t call it mindless though: it&#8217;s just a case of lots of people wanting to use the train coupled with a tight platform turnaround time. I admit that I chose to sit *inside* the train &#8211; hanging off the door and window frames, like the keener commuters, was a bit extreme for me.</p>

		<blockquote><p>
  Was Sandler&#8217;s property being threatened? Again, no. </p>
<p>Actually&#8230; His future property was being threatened. The linejumper could potentially affect the supply to a sufficient degree as to deny Sandler his property. Specially if others noticed that he wasn&#8217;t going to take action with the linejumper. It would&#8217;ve encouraged potential linejumpers and Sandler would eventually wind up at the end of the line.</p>
<p>I can sort of relate to the argument that this was a luxury item, thus not that important, but in that case: It only makes the act of linejumping even worse! If this was a breadline or something similar and someone worse off than me cut the line, then I for one would gladly accept that. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been linejumped once (by two bigger guys), but as there were other lines I would&#8217;ve lost out bigger in case any of my actions held up the line for any duration. So I bit my tongue. However, if there&#8217;s a red light and I see any of those two guys crossing, I won&#8217;t stop. So just because you&#8217;re successful at treating others like dirt, don&#8217;t think for a moment that it won&#8217;t come back to haunt you.</p>

		<p>I don&#8217;t know&#8230; it&#8217;s just a thing, hitting someone for it? That makes me no better. Somehow, I value his head more than a queue position. I would object, but not try to do more harm.</p>

		<p>&quot;Was Sandler&#8217;s property being threatened? Again, no.&quot;</p>
<p>Yes it was. His proximity to the goods (along with his money) was the basis for his claim to it.</p>
<p>&quot;Instead, Sandler showed nothing more than base greed.&quot;</p>
<p>And what of the line-jumper(s)? I pity anyone who has to deal with them.</p>
<p>What some won&#8217;t grasp is that, regardless of legal system, you forestall threatening situations when you don&#8217;t provoke people. This includes not jumping in line, not cutting people off on the road, and not running around Harlem yelling, &quot;I hate n*****s.&quot;</p>
<p>Otherwise, at the very least, you can hardly expect me to feel sorry for you.</p>

		<p>Perhaps Raymond was not being sarcastic. The rest of you might want to read up on the &quot;Boston Tea Party&quot; that was the beginning of the war of independence.</p>
<p>For my money though, a chair is overdoing it. A sharp elbow to the teeth followed by a hearty, completely (and obviously) insincere apology would be better.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
