		<p>So I earn a million, then pay 38% taxes<br />
<br />With the remaining 640K I purchase a yacht from my neighbour.</p>
<p>Assuming the income taxes are same, the guy will have to pay another 38%, that would made about 220K<br />
<br />So I have to earn a million, to purchase something that costs 372000?</p>

		<p>Well, keep in mind that lots of football players started out in the lower end of the economic spectrum.  If you grew up in a household that was in a low tax bracket, got EIC, maybe had lots of kids (exemptions), etc., you&#8217;d probably be a little shocked at the top-end bracket.</p>

		<p>The guy who says you have to pay income tax on the money you get for selling your yacht is wrong. That ain&#8217;t income, and even if you sell yachts for a living, you&#8217;ll only pay income tax on the profits you regualarly get after your accountant has gone through it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know about the States but the guy would be pretty stupid if he lived in Europe and got the signing fee paid to himself. You get the signing fee paid to an offshore company in the Caymans that is set up to handle your promotional interests. The company is 100% owned by you, but you arrange it so you only pay income tax on the money your own company pays you.</p>

<p>We really only have to worry about the debt in the form of Treasury bonds. The rest we can shove under the carpet.</p>
<p>38% only applies to people making mad bucks. Which (I assume) doesn&#8217;t include me or most of the people here.</p>

		<p>I&#8217;d pay 38% happily. The marignal income tax here in Israel at fairly low brackets ($60k a year) is 49%, not including another ~9% for social security and health tax.</p>

		<p>I think you&#8217;re being too harsh. When he got the signing bonus, did they tell him in advance that he would be losing a lot of it to taxes? I&#8217;ve known people in the computer industry who got upset when they got a bonus or royalty check that had the taxes taken out. They simply thought that the bonus wasn&#8217;t &quot;income&quot; and therefore not subject to taxes. Also, keep in mind how young these guys are. At 25, I made the mistake of not rolling over a retirement account because I didn&#8217;t know what was going to happen. I spent the money, and then the next year I got hit with a big tax bill because of what I did.</p>

		<p>Here in Massachusetts, they are even trying to tax non-resident athletes for their income based on the number of days they were in the state to play.</p>
<p><a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://www.massdor.com/help/guides/abate_amend/Personal/issues/tradeBussExp.htm" rel="nofollow">http://www.massdor.com/help/guides/abate_amend/Personal/issues/tradeBussExp.htm</a><br />
<br />(search for &quot;professional athletes&quot;)</p>
<p>Massachusetts, being a liberal state, even has an optional HIGHER tax rate that residents can choose to agree to. You don&#8217;t get anything for paying the higher rate except that warm fuzzy feeling that the all-good tax man is spending your money more wisely than you ever could.</p>

		<p>Seems like these players also don&#8217;t realize they have to use toilets like everyone else.  From the article:</p>
<p>&quot;Despite spending $750,000 on the symposium, the N.F.L. would not, as Ahlerich predicted, save all souls. A week later, Najeh Davenport, the baggy-pants defender, was also arrested, on charges dating back to April. In the wee hours, Davenport supposedly entered a women&#8217;s dormitory at a Catholic university in Florida, found his way into a sleeping student&#8217;s room and, for reasons that remain unclear, defecated in her laundry basket.&quot;</p>

		<p>What I dont understand is why employers remain complicity in perpetuating the situation that causes this upset new signee. </p>
<p>For example why dont the employers advertise the signing-bonus size as it is actually received (AFTER tax deduction).  Why dont the negotiate a standard that involves each advertising and actual take-home amount.  Call me a hick from the sticks- but it seems more open and honest.</p>
<p>Similr problem in Washington (State) stores.  In the UK the sales tax is included in the cost of items advertised in the store.  You look at the advertised price and you know what you&#8217;ll pay.  In Washington state, you look at the advertised price go to the check-out and find it costs more than &#8216;advertised&#8217;.  Even if you know to expect this bizarre yax added after advertised price you still have to perform some calculation to work out the ACTUAL price then you aren&#8217;t suprised at the till.</p>
<p>For goodness sake!  since the store has to make the calculation anyway (currently at check-out) why dont they just move this calcualtion earlier in thier business process?  Put it as the price of the article to the customer.  For example, WA state could introduce a policy of showing actual price to the customer rather than pre-tax prices.  Currently its like a silly systematic tease -that serves little benefit other than adding a &#8216;calculation&#8217; work-load to the customer.  Now that&#8217;s not good customer service,  come on Washington,  pull your socks up.. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ll calm down now.</p>

		<p>One problem is that not everybody has the same income tax rate. If you win $1000 in the lottery, your winnings after federal income tax range from $650 to $1000 depending on your bracket. And that&#8217;s not counting the other applicable taxes (depending on the time of year, my social security tax varies).</p>
<p>In Washington, sales tax rates change from city to city. If you&#8217;re a company with multiple stores, your advertising flyer will have to print mutiple prices. I believe in Europe the law requires that the price on the item be inclusive of all fees and taxes. I remember picking up a magazine that had no less than 10 different prices printed on it, because it was available for sale in 10 different tax jurisdictions.</p>
<p>That said, I too would prefer that all values be quoted in &quot;net&quot;, if only it were practical.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
