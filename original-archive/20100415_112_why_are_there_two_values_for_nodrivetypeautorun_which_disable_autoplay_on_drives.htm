Hey, wait, two of the entries are the same.
What's the difference between 0x1 (<i>Disables Autoplay
on drives of unknown type</i>)
and
0x80 (<i>Disables Autoplay on drives of unknown type</i>)?
</p>
<p>
The values in the bitfield correspond to return values
of the <code>Get&shy;Drive&shy;Type</code> function:
</p>
<pre>
#define DRIVE_UNKNOWN     0
#define DRIVE_NO_ROOT_DIR 1
#define DRIVE_REMOVABLE   2
#define DRIVE_FIXED       3
#define DRIVE_REMOTE      4
#define DRIVE_CDROM       5
#define DRIVE_RAMDISK     6
</pre>
<p>
The value 0x1 corresponds to bit zero, which means that
the <code>Get&shy;Drive&shy;Type</code> function could not tell what
type of drive it is.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, the value 0x80 does not correspond to
any known return value of <code>Get&shy;Drive&shy;Type</code>.
It's reserved for future use.
</p>
<p>
My guess as to how this happened is that the original table
did not have an entry for 0x80.
Then somebody asked,
"What does 0x80 mean?"
</p>
<p>
The response was,
"It's not used yet.
It's for some future unknown drive type that has yet to be invented."
</p>
<p>
"Okay, thanks. I'll just say that the drive type is unknown."
</p>
<p>
Bingo, now you have two copies of "drives of unknown type."
The 0x1 means "drives whose type cannot be determined"
whereas the 0x80 means
"drives of a type not currently known to mankind."
</p>
<p>
So let's just pretend that the entry for
0x80 reads "Reserved for future use."
(The page is archived content, so it's not like anybody's
going to be updating it.)

<b>Pre-emptive snarky comment</b>:
"Autoplay is the stupidest feature on the face of the planet."
The issue here is not discussing whether Autoplay is a good idea or
bad idea.
I'm trying to improve the documentation.
I try to avoid providing tips/support about
controversial features because of the
<a HREF="http://blogs.msdn.com/oldnewthing/archive/2010/04/07/9991494.aspx">
flame-fest that invariably results</a>.
This is an experiment to see if it's safe to go back into the water.
</p>
<p>
<b>Update</b>: Comments have been disabled because everybody wants to
discuss whether Autoplay is a good idea or not, even though that topic
was explicitly taken off the table.
Strike two.</p>

The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from

WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
