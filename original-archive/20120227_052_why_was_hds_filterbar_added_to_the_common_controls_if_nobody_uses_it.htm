<p>Mike Dunn was curious about <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/07/20/10040074.aspx#10040746"> the intended purpose of <code>HDS_FILTERBAR</code></a>.</p>
<p> The <code>HDS_FILTERBAR</code> style adds a row below the header control consisting of an edit control and a <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/b/oldnewthing/archive/2010/08/18/10051229.aspx"> funnel</a> icon. The funnel icon presumably represents a coffee filter, because after all, everybody in the world drinks coffee as much as people in Seattle. (Developers think they're so clever.) </p>
<p> Mike points out that new features of the common controls were nearly always used by whatever version of Windows or Internet Explorer shipped that new version. The <code>HDS_FILTERBAR</code> style is a notable exception. What happened? </p>
<p> I believe the <code>HDS_FILTERBAR</code> feature was originally intended for use by Active Directory; my guess is that dialogs like <i>Find Computer</i> would have taken advantage of it. For whatever reason, that feature was cut from Active Directory, which is why you didn't see anybody using it. However, the feature was cut after the code for the feature was already written and checked into the common controls under the style <code>HDS_FILTERBAR</code>. </p>
<p> The Active Directory team either forgot to tell the Common Controls team, "Hey, you know that feature we asked you to write for us? Yeah, we don't need it after all," or they did, and the Common Controls team said, "Well, we already wrote it, and we don't want to take the risk that removing it won't introduce a bug, so we'll just leave it in. Maybe somebody else can find a use for it." </p>
<p> The result was a feature in the header control that nobody used. And since nobody used it, I wouldn't be surprised if it's a little buggy. (We already know that it's more than little ugly.) </p>

		<p>I always thought that Icon represented filtering because it starts off wider at the top and is narrowed at the bottom to represent the smaller result set with the filter. &nbsp;Doesn&#39;t even remotely look like a coffee filter to me.</p>

		<p>The funnel icon just mirrors what Excel uses for its filtering. It makes sense that MS would have a common icon for a given feature. Other software (like SysInternals&#39; ProcMon) also use a funnel to represent filtering.</p>
<p>I don&#39;t see a connection to coffee, either. All I see is that lots of stuff goes in one end and few things come out the end.</p>

		<p>You know, as a non-coffee-drinker, all this time and I didn&#39;t make the coffee filter connection. I remember being confused the first time I tried to use something that used that funnel/filter/roughly-triangularly-shaped thing because I didn&#39;t connect it in my head with filter.</p>
<p>Maybe it&#39;s supposed to be &quot;funneling&quot; you to the right selections? Larger set funneled down to a smaller set? Probably a good example of a UI choice that might not have been the best in retrospect but is widely-known now.</p>

		<p>As avid coffee quaffer I must say that I never made the connection with coffee filters either. It&#39;s obviously a funnel, which is a bad metaphor for what it does since funnels don&#39;t funnel larger sets into smaller sets; they just squeeze the same set into a smaller bucket.</p>
<p>The stupid thing is that if I search the web for ‘filter icon’ I only get funnels, probably all inspired by Microsoft&#39;s use of the icon. So what would be a good metaphor? A sieve possibly?</p>

		<p>Well, a sieve might have been the right metaphor, but a funnel it was, a funnel it is, and a funnel ist stays. That&#39;s the thing with lock-in, inertia and &#39;never change a running system&#39;.</p>

		<p>The whole funnel thing did seem illogical. Coffee filter now that makes sense! Never thought of that before. Filter away the bitter coffee grinds to get the beautiful, refreshing lifeblood of the development world. &nbsp;It&#39;s coffee filter for me now. I think that is better than sieve because we filter data not sieve it.</p>

		<p>I always thought it was less representative of it&#39;s actual functionality of &quot;removing unwanted data&quot; and more the high-level goal of &quot;reducing the flow [of information] to manageable levels&quot;. Never made a coffee connection.</p>
<p>BTW: The &quot;uncommonly used things might have bugs&quot; obviously doesn&#39;t apply to security bugs, so if a security reviewer finds a non-security bug in the source, is that likely to be logged? (Not that it would make the bar to get fixed.) Or would that mean the security reviewer gets &quot;last touch&quot; status on that component?</p>

		<p>Having just looked at the Event Viewer in Windows 7 I see the funnel icon is still alive and well. But then, so are these: <a rel="nofollow" target="_new" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filter_funnel" rel="nofollow">en.wikipedia.org/&#8230;/Filter_funnel</a> (also can search for images of them).

		<p>The funnel as a filter symbol made sense to me as a metaphor from chemistry classes in high school (as in circular filter paper, fold into quarters, place in funnel). &nbsp;I had always assumed that to be the case, which shows that what is gobsmackingly obvious for one person is not always so for someone else. Plus, here is Australia, filtered coffee would not be thought of as the height of coffee geekdom.</p>

*DISCLAIMER: I DO NOT OWN THIS CONTENT. If you are the owner and would like it removed, please
<a target="_blank" href="/contact.htm">contact me</a>.
The content herein is an archived reproduction of entries from
Raymond Chen's "Old New Thing" Blog (most recent link is <a target="_blank" href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/">here</a>).
It may have slight formatting modifications for consistency and to improve readability.
<br/><br/>
WHY DID I DUPLICATE THIS CONTENT HERE?
Let me first say this site has never had anything to sell and has never shown ads of any kind. I have nothing monetarily to gain by duplicating content here.
Because I had made my own local copy of this content throughout the years, for ease of using tools like grep, I decided to put it online after I discovered
some of the original content previously and publicly available, had disappeared approximately early to mid 2019.
At the same time, I present the content in an easily accessible theme-agnostic way.
<br/><br/>
The information provided by Raymond's blog is, for all practical purposes, more authoritative on Windows Development than Microsoft's
own MSDN documentation and should be considered supplemental reading to that documentation. The wealth of missing details
provided by this blog that Microsoft could not or did not document about Windows over the years is vital enough, many would agree an online "backup" of these details
is a necessary endeavor. Specifics include:<br/>
<ul>
    <li>
        A "redesign" after 2019 erased thousands of user's comments from previous years. As many have stated, the comments are nearly as important as the postings themselves.
        The archived copies of the postings contained here retain the original comments.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has changed domains many times and the urls have otherwise been under constant change since 2003.
        Even when proper redirection has been set up for those links, redirection only works for a limited period of time.
        For example, all of the internal blog links that were valid in early 2019, were broken by 2020 without proper redirection.
    </li>
    <li>
        The blog has been under constant re-design and re-theming since its inception.
        It is downright irritating to deal with a bogged-down site experience as the result of the latest visual themes designed for cell-phone browsers.
        As of this writing, it is cumbersome to navigate titles with only 10 entries per page.
        While it is nice that the official site has a search feature, searching using this index (with all titles on a single page) is much quicker (CTRL-F in most browsers).
    </li>
</ul>
